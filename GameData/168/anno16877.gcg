>Evans_Clinchy: BEINSTV -BV +0 0
#note Considered VIBE and VIBES, but EINST is just too potent to pass up. Sim says the exchange is best by a couple of points.

>Marty_Gabriel: DOY O5 DO.Y +30 98
>Evans_Clinchy: EGILNOT A5 GEL.TION +60 205
#note Dumb miss on the ISOS# hook. LENTIGO plays for 17 more.

>Marty_Gabriel: EPW 10F PEW +42 176
>Evans_Clinchy: CEGLOPR 7C COP +24 286
#note Debated between COP and COG, which is a close call, but the sim likes something else even better: BECLOG L7, which scores well and digs deeper into the bag.

>Marty_Gabriel: EEIMV L11 MIEVE +30 292
>Evans_Clinchy: DEFHLRR 15K H.DER +27 353
#note This sims best in win percentage. I have four objectives here - score, clear out some consonants, take out the triple-triple threat, and hold onto the FR- combo that could turn into a 50-point play at B10 next turn. This does all of the above.
>Marty_Gabriel: CET M10 TEC +15 307
>Evans_Clinchy: EFHLLNR M10 ...H +28 381
#note Sim prefers plays that score less but turn over more tiles. Understandable, but I went the opposite route to prolong the game and put more time pressure on.
>Marty_Gabriel: ?AGIIST 4B .AISTInG +72 379
>Evans_Clinchy: EFLLNRT 11C LEFT +21 402
#note Sim says FRET B10 is best, which looks insane to me. I liked this because it shut down bingos and gave me a tempo advantage. Now he needs to open the board if he wants to come back.
>Marty_Gabriel: KO O1 KO +29 408
>Evans_Clinchy: BEFLNRU 3C FLU +26 428
#note Pretty sure this is best even though it opens a new bingo area. Thing is, he was going to pry open line 2 anyway if I didn't. I might as well play FLU - it scores nicely, it keeps a good consonant-heavy leave considering all the vowels in the pool, and it also gives me a shot at a cool extension.
>Marty_Gabriel: U I3 U. +4 412
>Evans_Clinchy: BEEINOR H8 ...BONER +63 491
#note I needed the O for JAWBONER, and I got it! This is the winning play. He has SERRATI# in two spots (line 2 making RUG and line 13 making GELATIONS), so I can't block. I just have to score big and outrun his bingo.
>Marty_Gabriel: ?AEIRRT 15A sTARRIE. +74 486
#note Phew!
