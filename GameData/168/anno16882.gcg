>Joshua_Sokol: ADEFIIL H4 FAILED +28 28
#note Championship game. Please keep in mind that this whole game I'm under the idiotic impression that since Ross is 75 points ahead in spread I have to win this game by 38 or more to finish in first place. But we have the same number of wins so...yeah...
>Ross_Brown: OOTY 4H .OOTY +22 22
>Joshua_Sokol: HHIKMRV 5E KIV. +22 50
#note Nooooo! Immediately I noticed the possibility of MIKV(A)H but I whiffed so hard! Where the hell else would I have seen MIKV(A)H if not in some Scrabble form? aarrghh :( MIKV(E)H is also an option. I only saw MIKVAH.
>Ross_Brown: ?AENNRT K4 .ENANTRy +78 100
#note oy. Only 78-pointer, nice find!

>Ross_Brown: EGILSU 11D UGLIES +28 156
>Joshua_Sokol: GINQRRT D10 Q.IRT +28 125
#note I'm hoping his decently likely chance of having another S didn't materialize in reality.

>Joshua_Sokol: GNORRSV --  -34 125
#note uhhh, I thought it was good... What is this
>Ross_Brown: ENTY 14A NET.Y +23 191
#note very very interesting strategic play by Ross that did turn out to work and I think grants him best strategic play of the tourney if I'm judging.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEGILNS 15E SEALING +83 282
#note what a miracle draw. And what a dimwitted mistake of not playing LINAGES because I thought I was confused... It's a ridiculously huge improvement. 
>Ross_Brown: ?BCRT O1 BRaCT +35 280
#note bold move that I'm not certain is correct. Ross complained about in his opinion having to play this because he had no vowels. I think C(AROUSING) is interesting.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADFLOTW I7 AWOL. +27 309
#note Given the rather large ADZ/ZAS threat and Ross's 2-consonant leave I give him a good shot of the hard-hitting 45-pointer
>Ross_Brown: CEO E3 CO.E +23 303
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEFOT O12 ODEA +22 331
#note So to me I'm in great big trouble here because not only do I think I might not win, I think that it's almost impossible for me to win by enough to seize 1st place. While thinking about that, I spaced and almost played N1 OAF for 24 making an invalid 2. I stopped myself and played this, but now he knows I have an F. I considered FEOD as well, but it looks even better now that I see the pool, since I had omitted some tracking at this point, which seems to happen to me far too often. 
>Ross_Brown: IP O8 PI +26 329
#note yeah, FEOD :(
>Joshua_Sokol: DEFNSTU 9A FUDS +25 356
#note I have enough time left but I would rather have spent it frying my brain to find the best play rather than spending half of it tracking. Ducky has championship player and many-ply agreeing that my play in fact wins 100% of the time, but as per usual the sim enjoys playing off my F at H11 or 5M best whereas champ disagrees. So here are the 100% wins according to both algorithms. I think they are reliable here only because there is no tile-sticking option and also not many options at all for either of us. 

In order of valuation, the 100% wins that the sim believes in are H11 (E)F, 5M F(AT), 7B FUND, 7C FUD, 7B FEUD, 9A FUDS, 6B FED(EX), 7C FED and 7A UNFED.

On the other hand, championship player responds with these plays:
9A FUNS, 7B FUND, 7B FEND, 7B FEUD, 9A FUDS, 6B FED(EX). 
I played this because I believed to have outs with many of the tiles in the bag and options if I drew the Z, namely ZE(E) M14 and ZE(D) C7. I saw ZEB(U) as a possibility for Ross after playing this and was disappointed in myself. Out of all of the 100% plays announced by Quackle's prophets, the ones that interlap are 9A FUDS, 7B FEUD and FUND, and finally 6B FED(EX).
>Ross_Brown: ABEEIOZ 3A AZOI. +32 361
#note I was still disappointed that I wasn't going to win by what I thought was enough. Silly silly silly. 3A ZEBE(C) is 3 points better than this although I'm most likely to make a mistake after AZOI(C) or ZEB(U). Pre-analysis I thought ZEB(U) was Ross' best play as if I decided to play O(B)E 8A he could block my only outs at M10.
>Joshua_Sokol: ENOT 2K TENO. +10 366
#note O(B)E was in fact my best option, but it ties with the sequence induced by AZOI(C).
>Joshua_Sokol:  (BEE) +10 376
#note I made two (even 3: MIKV(A)H) huge mistakes this game, same as last! I got the best of Ross in this one though, and I guess my mistakes were a tad less costly. Otherwise, in general, this tournament I played pretty well when I wasn't making huge mistakes. When I realized I was actually going to be in first I took another mental blow that I have learned to evade recently. So I'm happy with how I did and I still have a long way to go before winning a real div 1 tourney! As always, thanks for watching me ramble and gamble, guys :)
