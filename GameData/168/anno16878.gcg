>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEIIQ H7 QI +22 22
#note my favorite opening play! :(
>Ryan_Chepita: AT 7H .AT +13 13
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEIOP J5 IO.A +6 28
#note hmm, missed OPIA(T)E and (T)OEA and decided against playing 2 vowels. I don't know if this is the right play.
>Ryan_Chepita: AKT K3 KAT +18 31
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEPRST K7 SERPEnT +81 109
#note ahh, STEEPeR was what I wanted to play here. I didn't look hard enough.
>Ryan_Chepita: ?AEGMO L2 GAM +26 57
#note I don't remember what Ryan said his last tile was but it was either a T or an N as he said he passed up MONTAGE, MEGATON and MAGNETO here to greedily set up a bingo making O(GAM). Interesting idea that I don't think I agree with. I think if I were to pass up the bingo here I would play OGAM instead. 
>Joshua_Sokol: BEELNOU 1K BOULE +32 141
#note his play permitted me to get rid of my worse tiles and score quite well
>Ryan_Chepita: ?EFO L11 FE +17 74
#note unfortunately he also wasn't able to bingo this turn 
>Joshua_Sokol: EEILNOO G8 LOONIE +10 151
#note Do I set up points here and play G8 LOOIE or 13G OOLI(T)E? Or do I go mad and play N1 (L)OONIE? The only thing interesting about (L)OONIE is that it sets up (KA)Y(O), (AM)E(N) or (AM)I(N). Other than that I think I'm giving him way too many points for it to be worth it. I liked LOONIE as he obviously didn't have the J, he seems to be fishing, the triple hotspot this opens isn't that dangerous and this shuts down the top left quadrant pretty well
>Ryan_Chepita: EMW H13 MEW +28 102
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIJNOU F10 JO +52 203
#note this was fortunate enough as well
>Ryan_Chepita: BE H10 BE +19 121
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHINRU E11 HUE +26 229
#note His last play made my candidate play a bit worse as now S(HONE) will be a readily available hook.
>Ryan_Chepita: ?ADENTT M7 NoTATED +76 197
#note M3 TAuNTED and TAiNTED are 13 points better than this.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIINNR 3K ..IN +16 245
#note Ouch, I don't know why my brain started to play tricks on me here. At first it looked like there was a 7 in here, but then I thought that I was confusing the rack with CRINITE, as CRININE* was obvoiusly invalid. Then I think I just gave up looking for a bingo anyway because there weren't any spots, so I thought. I have seen CINERIN so many times online, why oh why do I miss it when it's actually important to find? :(
>Ryan_Chepita: AUV N5 VAU +10 207
#note here's where Ryan started to run into some time and therefore mental trouble. He told me that this was one of the racks where he really leaned toward exchanging but probably decided against it due to the fact that he didn't seem to have any other options than opening things up
>Joshua_Sokol: CEINRYZ O7 NICER +24 269
#note this was one of the NICER YZ draws. Heh...
>Ryan_Chepita: OY N13 OY +13 220
>Joshua_Sokol: AGLSWYZ O13 WAY +39 308
#note ooh, 14B GAWSY looks good here. The thing about the word GAWSY is that I always think AEGIRSW makes GAWSIER* but then when I see that the solution is EARWIGS it makes me doubt the validity of GAWSY. I didn't even see the possibility of the word being played here. :( But anyhow, besides GAWSY, would you play WAG or WAY here? I chose the pointses
>Ryan_Chepita: GI 13C GI. +8 228
>Joshua_Sokol: GILSUXZ 12D X. +36 344
#note I was all set to play X(U) there anyway even though it was 8 less points than 10M (A)X(E). Perfect turn of events.
>Ryan_Chepita: ADO I3 ODA +8 236
>Joshua_Sokol: GILNSUZ H1 ZIG +42 386
#note Another perfect situation
>Ryan_Chepita: EP G2 PE +14 250
>Joshua_Sokol: DLNNOSU 4E NUN +8 394
#note Didn't want to give Ryan two floaters and really didn't want to leave that lane open either, but I should play NOUN instead, because it's impossible for him to win with only 6 in the bag if he manages to bingo next turn. I also considered DUN at the same spot but liked keeping the D
>Ryan_Chepita: C 2G ..C +14 264
>Joshua_Sokol: DHLLORS 15H .ORLD +11 405
#note game over. I don't know why I decided to play this instead of blocking the floating N. In any case I missed 14E SHR(E)D for 31.
>Ryan_Chepita: FRT 14F FR.T +24 288
#note Ryan had around 2 minutes left and he laid this down instantly, forgetting that he could be emptying the bag.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEHLRS E2 HA.DLERS +74 479
#note And I drew into this. Sick.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (IIRSSV) +18 497
