#note Opening with a bingo again :(
>New_Player_1: ?CEFHOP 9E FOH +29 29
#note CEH? is better than CEP? so Q suggests FOP instead.

>New_Player_1: AAENQTY --  -24 139
#note Messed up the definition of AYE. It means an affirmative reply, and not to give an affirmative reply as I thought.
>Quackle: GSUV 10B VUGS +22 156
>New_Player_1: AEENQTY O1 EYE. +24 163
#note Missed NEEDY, which is a bit better.
>Quackle: X 5H .X +18 174
>New_Player_1: ADDENQT 2M DA. +18 181
#note I had a feeling Q would like DEY better, but I figured I'd likely get an I or U.

#note Still missing BOWED, as I did last turn.

>New_Player_1: ABEMNQT 6A A.T +15 212
#note Yuck. The leave is  way too sucky. But I knew he was going to bingo next turn so I wanted to keep some high scoring tiles for the hot spots he would likely open. But I think exch. BQ is better as I'll likely bingo back.

>Quackle: AINU 12D UNAI +19 263
>New_Player_1: BHILOOZ I13 ZOO +42 282
#note Hated opening the triple but I felt like he was vowel heavy and wouldn't be able to profit much from the triple. This is #4. BAZOO, THOLOI and BOHO are the top 3.

#note He insta-played this.
>New_Player_1: BDGIJLR 9I J.G +19 326
#note Best. I thought he had an S and was going for a bingo on column L. This pretty much stops that but..
>Quackle: EKRST 15A TREKS +49 337
#note I didn't see he could get this many points here.
>New_Player_1: BDILNRT F2 BRIN. +22 348
#note Best. Wins 40%
>Quackle: AIMMORV 8J .AMMOR +42 379
#note Held this until I saw I could win by V sticking him. It's phony, but according to Quackle, VOMIT wins.
