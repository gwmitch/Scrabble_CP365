>Smedley_D._Butler: ADIQRRU 8F QUID +28 28
#note I yanked the name from a military base I’ve handled a lot of invoices for cause I thought it was funny. Turns out he was a pretty interesting dude.
>Kelly: EIMRTTY E7 REMIT +29 29
#note Why is it that I always see a bunch of cool options when they are either bad ideas or aren’t even possible? No E for TEMERITY, while YTTRI(U)M would be a pointless display of temerity. CP is okay with my play, but I would have played TYRE instead had I considered it.
>Smedley_D._Butler: AGNORRR 10A ROAR.NG +12 40
#note Only someone known as "Old Gimlet Eye" and "Old Duckboard" would make such a ballsy play.
>Kelly: ADSSTTY A8 ST.AY +36 65
#note TA(R)DY is probably better here. Three extra points, and the D is pretty useless on this board, while the Ss assure good options for a few turns.
>Smedley_D._Butler: AEORTUY 9C YO. +23 63
#note Smedley was also known as "the Fighting Quaker", but for me that will always be Alexander Palmer, despite orchestrating the brazen civil rights violations of thousands of suspected Commies.
>Kelly: ADDJRST 12A .ARDS +26 91
#note Meh. I still don’t know what’s best here. JARS-J5 grabs more points and makes bingoing hard, but gives up easy points to any O. Nearly 30 points seems a lot to give up just to exchange and keep ARST, but that’s what the report suggests.
>Smedley_D._Butler: AENRRTU I6 UR. +5 68
#note Meriweather Lewis had my all-time favorite historical nickname: the Sublime Dandy.
>Kelly: ADJOTVW 5I TAJ +25 116
#note Yucky leave, but it scores, deals with the fishing threat, and gives me time to regroup. CP likes it along with (A)VOW-B12, which seems insane. The possible J bomb should I draw an O might not even be there after a reasonably likely bingo from the W.
>Smedley_D._Butler: AEENORT 6K OE +11 79
#note Did you know Smedley exposed the Business Plot, an attempt by the DuPonts and other business moguls to organize a putsch against FDR? Why have I never heard about this? Seems kind of important, trying to overthrow the government and all.
>Kelly: DGLOVWW -WOWDGLV +0 116
#note That’s enough of this crap. CP suggest V(U)G(G)-G7, (A)VOW, which seems even crazier this time, or keeping D or DL.
>Smedley_D._Butler: ADENRTU 7I .UT +13 92
>Kelly: ABCIKLN D3 KIBLA +24 140
#note Yay for old quizbowl knowledge.
>Smedley_D._Butler: ?ADEENR 3B DA.ERhEN +76 168
>Kelly: ACDNOUW 8K ADOWN +44 184
#note Comes out on top of the report, just ahead of ADUNC, which seems like it would be useful to know.
>Smedley_D._Butler: EEEHILV 2H HIVE +25 193
>Kelly: CGINPUV M7 C.UPING +32 216
#note Finally got ING for (STRAY)ING, but I’m glad I kept looking for something better. COUPING comes out 6% better than anything else. The HE below the triple is scary, but there’s nothing I can do about it, and it might not have even been a set-up play.
>Smedley_D._Butler: EEFLLNO 1K FELON +32 225
>Kelly: CHIIOTV 1E CHIT +45 261
#note While I was getting an oil change, I saw a car with a parking permit for MacArthur Park Apartments. The driver never showed up, so I didn’t have to face the dilemma of whether or not I should ask if he or she would ever have that recipe again.
>Smedley_D._Butler: BEIILMX L11 XI +31 256
>Kelly: ?EIOPVW 2A WOP +26 287
#note Giving up a point to play it at 3K might be a bit safer.
>Smedley_D._Butler: BEEILMN 7A EMB.. +21 277
>Kelly: ?EEILOV 5B VI.E +18 305
#note Disappointing to not find NOVELIzE, having at one time owned a novelization of Hudson Hawk. I’d have even been okay with the babies VIOLENcE or OVENLIkE. The four-vowel eights are a work in progress, so I’ll just take comfort in evidence of obvious upside in my future.
>Smedley_D._Butler: AEILNSS 1A AS +25 302
>Kelly: ?EELOOT K12 TO +5 310
#note Now things are really tricky. It’s looking awfully likely the duck will have a big -(XI)NG play, simultaneously scoring well and blocking my lane. This seemed like the best way to deal with both threats. CP strongly (i.e. by 15%) prefers the set-ups (D)OE and (R)OE, but I’m not sold.
>Smedley_D._Butler: EGILNSZ 3K ZING +43 345
>Kelly: ?AEEFLO 14E bEEFALO +66 376
