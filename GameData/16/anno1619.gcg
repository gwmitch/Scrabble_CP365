#note FIGWORT!
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAELNNT 9F NEAT +16 16
#note Not the best fish. 9F NA sims best. 7F LEAN is next, which sets up my T.
>ftangredi: ABHMORW 10H WORM +19 41
#note Cool, didn't know BAGWORM before. 
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEHLNTU 11K UH +18 34
#note I saw this first, looked for other moves, then came back to this one. I thought, "This can't be my best move. I must have some good-scoring play that dumps the U and leaves a bingo rack." But that's exactly what this one does!

#note 12K DEATH 42.

#note 13L HEX 41.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EIINSST 15F SI.NITES +70 135
#note Best of the playable bingos.
>ftangredi: ?ACHIRS D2 ARCHIn.S +76 174
#note CRASHING is 6 more, but it opens the 3x3. A nice alternative is (G)RApHICS, even more defensive.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AAIILU 3C U.IAL +12 147
#note Definitely didn't spot 14G A(LEX)IA.
>ftangredi: DEEEFJU F2 J.DE +28 202
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AAEIOW 13L WOE +27 174
#note ALEXIA is still an option, but WOE nabs some much-needed points.
>ftangredi: ADEEFIU 6F DUE +26 228
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AAINOP O9 ANOPsIA +89 263
#note Highest-scoring bingo. There are some neat ones that also play here: JAPONICA, DIAPASON, APHONIA.

>Brendan_Sullivan: ACEEORT 15A CEE +22 330
#note I spent a good chunk of time on this move. I can't necessarily assume Frank is close to a bingo after FROZE, and the only bingo spots, anyway, are across from H1/H2. The pool also doesn't look all that fruitful. I'm also clinging to a small lead, and I believe this game will come down to who can-outrun-whom down the stretch. Accordingly, I wanted to dock some points. If he bingos then I'm going to lose, but I don't think I need to bingo to win, either. By playing at A15, I take a 35 point lead and leave essentially no scoring opportunities. The only feasible spots left for him are from the K at H4 to the DWS, but that would likely open something for me. I did not spot the E5 (I)N(DUE) potential at the time, but even if I did, I would hope to draw one of the 3 Ns left and hit it myself. Low-ply sims favor short fishes like I13 (B)E(EN). I ran 6000 iterations of a many-ply sim, though, and E12 CO(Z) 14 topped the list with 88.5% win, followed by 13A COAT 23 85.8%, 13A TOE 15 84.7%, then my play with 83.9%. I think COAT and TOE do sorta the same thing I was trying to do, but they don't sufficiently neutralize the lower-left corner there. And I have no idea why COZ is best . . . Anyone have a guess?
>ftangredi: INNOOUV C11 INU.. +10 305
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEMORTT 12A ME.TOR +22 352
#note Now I'm really not afraid of a bingo; nothing plays from the R or I. I just take as many points as I can and leave a couple in the bag. KORAT, MENTOR, KORMA and 5D HAEM all show about 96-97% wins. I kinda* like HAEM, in retrospect; I didn't see it then.
>ftangredi: GGNOOPV 1G P.ONG +8 313
#note Tough rack. Really not much to do here.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ALLTVYY 11E YAY +30 382
#note The ideal endgame sequence is quite strange. It consists of Frank and I each playing off one tile at a time until we're both V stuck. I get a 35 point win out of it. YAY scores, but it gives Frank (IN)V(AR). I'd like to say I spotted that and was setting myself up, but I honestly didn't notice it until the next turn.
>ftangredi: GNOOV B10 VO. +16 329
#note If he takes INVAR, I only win by 26.
>Brendan_Sullivan: LLTV F8 ..V.. +16 398
>ftangredi: GNO K1 .ONG +6 335
#note He can make it closer with M12 (DO)G(S) leaving the unblockable 2F (J)O(IN).
>ftangredi:  (LLT) +6 341
#note Note quite the shootout that the first game was!
