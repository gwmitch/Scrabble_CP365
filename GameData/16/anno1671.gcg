>Pete_Zeigler: AAILLNY 8G ANALLY +26 26
#note I like ALLAY keeping IN, only needing the G. I also made a mental note to keep an eye out for the B hook, although it never came up.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EEGKRTU L3 TURKE. +26 26
#note I didn't see KUGEL or KLUGE for 20 which have better leves (ERT), nor did I see 7H UKE 27 which scores and sorta covers the DLS hotspots. Phooey.
>Pete_Zeigler: DEFIIMO 5E MODIFIE. +106 132
#note Reminiscent of his 2x2 CREAMERY against me at Charleston.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EEGINTV I8 .GENTIVE +65 91
#note Missing 3G VIGNETTE 86. I should find that. And VIGNETTER is good, neat.
>Pete_Zeigler: AEGIOSS 11F AGO.ISES +68 200
#note The only one.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?NNPUVY 15H P.NNY +42 133
#note On the ride to the tourney, we passed a car whose license plate was "PENNY" and I waxed knowledgeable about the many front extensions. Alas, the back extensions are too long for this placement, and the front extensions are too short to be worth anything but style points.
>Pete_Zeigler: DHMOQRT F10 Q.T +32 232
#note 6E MHO 38 might still be there next turn.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?BILNUV 10H N.B +23 156
#note Did not know L10 NEBULY, which seems pretty good in this spot. 4D NUB 18 is the best fishing play, but I was paranoid about an easy X play at J10.
>Pete_Zeigler: ?DDHMOR 6F HOD +34 266
#note Opting out of the extra 4 points for MHO for synergistic purposes.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?EILOUV 4A VOILE +28 184
#note Missing 3F INVOLUTE 72. Apparently I don't know it well enough. 4A OVULE for 6 less is also considerable, just to play the U.
>Pete_Zeigler: ?ADIMRW A1 WAI.eD +36 302
#note L10 W(E)IRD(Y)26 and 3E MAW 19 and 14L MAW 23 all sim best on a 2-plyer. The thing is, pretty much any reasonable move is showing over 95% wins. In that case, one of the easiest ways for him to lose is if I hit a 3x3. But I'm not sure my last few plays indicate closeness to a bingo, necessarily. NEB could be blocking the hotspot and VOILE is just a good-scoring board opener. If I faced this one, and I was really scared of a 3x3 for some reason, then B3 W(O)RM 18 would be my blocking move. It makes it very difficult to play thru the V, let alone squeeze a 3x3 in there, and I don't think the 21 extra points for WAIVeD are worth playing the blank for. Even a bingo response from me on the TWS line will leave me down 20ish and Pete still has the blank. Another alternative is (V)AW for 9. It nixes all 3x3s, and with an A draw Pete gets (VAW)ARD 39.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?CENOSU 13A CONfUSE +81 265
#note Somehow I overscored this by 5 points. Sorry Pete!
>Pete_Zeigler: AEJMORR B10 MAJ.R +40 342
#note H1 JERR(ID) is 5 more, but either way he's gaining a full bingo lead again, so it's smart to cut out the chance of me getting a big bingo thru the C.
>Brendan_Sullivan: BEIRRWZ 10L WIZ +42 307
#note I wondered for a while if 14L BIZ is worth the risk. There are 4 Es unseen, but I'm also down by a bingo, and if I can cash the BIZE hook first, I might not need to bingo to catch up.
>Pete_Zeigler: EEGOORU 3E ROGUE +14 356
#note I had PREB(ID) all lined up before this play. H1 GUERIDON 33 might be worth the points, and 3D ERUGO 15 is a better block since it cuts down on bingos thru the I, as well.
>Brendan_Sullivan: BCDEPRR C2 PR.CED +26 333
#note I couldn't remember if ROGUE was a verb. Well, it is, and I should have played J3 DR(I)B like I wanted to, since it leaves the C column open for a possible bingo, which I might need.
>Pete_Zeigler: AEFLOTX A13 .OX +38 394
#note M6 AX 40 sets up the F quite nicely, although he might be wary of playing there next in case it opens an S hook for me, with one S unseen.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ABEIRRT A8 BRAT +24 357
#note 2F BA 23 gives me a chance, but it's so easily blockable. 14K ABRI 21 is simming best, roughly 11.5% wins. I wonder why.
>Pete_Zeigler: AAEFLTT M6 AT +12 406
#note Tough to lose from here; the only bingo in the pool (REHOUSE) fits nowhere, and I'm not threatening any big plays, either.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEHIRU 2F HA +29 386
#note If he has FOLIATE, FOLATES or SEALIFT/FETIALS, I'm toast. But unfortunately I didn't see any good alternatives. Turns out there are quite a few: 12B JEE 24, 12K HE 27, or N2 HIREE 29. Not sure why to pick one over the other, but they're all better than my play.
>Pete_Zeigler: AEFILOT 1G FLOAT +31 437
#note I sat for 2 minutes, begging him not to find the bingo. He said he didn't think about it, and was looking for the elegant out-in-two. Barring the bingo, 1D FLOTA 46 is a few points better.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EEIRSU N3 SURE +15 401
#note I'm in time pressure at this point, and didn't find N2 SIREE or REUSE for 23 to cut my losses.
>Pete_Zeigler: EI 14I .IE +14 451
#note I have to blame this one on the two missed bingos early on.
>Pete_Zeigler:  (EI) +4 455
