>Brendan_Sullivan: INOPRSX G6 OX.N +46 58
#note I was eager to snag the (BEAU)X hook before eyeing this spot.
>axolotl: DEEEILT H4 DIE +16 44
>Brendan_Sullivan: DEIIPRS 9F S.IP +31 89
#note I was willing to burn the S for 14 here in hopes of building an early lead and trying to sit on it. Seemed like a good strategy against a good player. NIP sims about 4.5 points better.
>axolotl: EEGLRTZ J6 GET +15 59
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?DEIIRT 7I D. +13 102
#note Missing NITRIDED. Didn't know it was a verb. 7I TEIID, 6J GID and H2 DIDIE un-duplicate the Is, but this fish seemed fine.

#note Only bingo.

#note Either this or O1 THEREON, which I did not find.

#note N8 (N)EURONE 23 was too tricky for me. Also lapsed on URA(R)E.
>axolotl: AEILMRT 2F MALTIER +70 214
>Brendan_Sullivan: AFNOPRY N10 PORNY +37 272
#note PANFRY! It plays for 48 in the same spot. I should have found 3C FORAY for 43.

#note WAGE is better, in retrospect. For some reason I wanted to save an E.

#note Total luckbox* draw.

>Brendan_Sullivan: ACGIIKT 2B KA +18 462
#note H12 IKAT 21 scores the most but gives him an out. Accordingly, I made a conservative move. Best play is F12 SICK; he still can't make a play there and I get I(K)AT the next turn, ultimately winning by 12 more than this way.

#note B4 ARCTIC is best. Didn't know it was good.
