>ftangredi: AACGKMV -AGV +0 0
#note Interesting choice of tiles to keep. Why not just play MACK?
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?ADNOPT 8D PiNTADO +74 74
#note Three bingos play.
>ftangredi: ACDKMRS J7 D.CK +21 21
>Brendan_Sullivan: EORSSUU H2 ROUSSE.U +59 133
#note Missing U(P)ROUSES. With this play, I have to hope Frank doesn't remember the T hook.
>ftangredi: ACEMNRS 3G R.MANCES +82 103
#note CARMINES plays as a 2x2.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EOQRUVZ E6 QU.VER +34 167
#note I didn't like leaving a juicy A hook, but I also didn't see any better options. Plus, if I catch an A myself, I can hit 2J ZA or 5D ZA.
>ftangredi: AENOTYY 5D YAY +54 157
#note TONEY/TROUSSEAU plays for 63, keeping the A.
>Brendan_Sullivan: DEIOPUZ N1 UP.IZED +42 209
>ftangredi: ?BEINOT O7 EBONITe +80 237
#note Best of the bingos that don't hook at H1. Now I know he won't play there, since I see he had a T.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EIJLLOX 1L JE.X +78 287
#note Frank told me to cut it out, and I said I was just "playing games." Yuk yuk yuk.

#note Shucks, no possibility left for the END- extension. Or MID-, for that matter.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AFIIOVW D10 WAIF +27 403
#note Nothing looked too tempting here. Didn't spot 9C VI(V)A 20 which seems to tie with WAIF in a 2-ply sim. The only reason I didn't like WAIF is that it gives him easy overlaps there for 30ish, and I'm holding a V which might make it tough for me to play there, depending on my draw. Eventually, I just decided that nothing else seemed any better, so I made the play.
>ftangredi: ADEINRT B8 ANTIRED +72 445
#note Ouch. I guess that's one argument in favor of VIVA for my last turn; this was one of the easier bingo lanes to hit.
>Brendan_Sullivan: HIIOORV L3 .HIRO +20 423
#note I have no hope for a win. I tried to play off as many tiles as possible and hope for an out in one next turn, but now that I look at it, that's a dumb hope; only an L helps, and he can block VIOLA easily. The best moves after a long many-ply sim are A13 OOH 23, A12 OHO 18, A11 OOH 17 and J12 VI(E)R 19. I'm guessing the OHO/OOH moves are best because they eat up that juicy spot where Frank might hit TOWEL for 40.
>ftangredi: EFLLOTW A13 FEW +35 480
#note Perfect endgame play starts with C12 EF 31 and nets a 49 point win for Frank.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EIOV G13 VI. +11 434
#note I should take M12 VO(T)E 14 leaving O1 X(1) 13 and out. It leads to a 41 point loss, instead of the 48 I got.
