#note My play is not on the list.  I wanted to fish off EOR and I couldn't find a good place to do it.  This play is questionable because I really wasn't sure if it took the S.  I had a feeling it did but I could have easily been getting it confused with something else.

#note I felt good enough about TORES that I had to try this.  He held but didn't challenge.

#note I considered 5A QABAL(A) 34 but I wasn't sure you could spell it that way.

#note Didn't see 6B QAN(AT) 34 which is good, although my play is more defensive (doesn't open a bingo lane).
>Karl_H.: AHP C7 PAH +34 273
>Brad_W.: CNNOPVW 8A WO.. +24 391
#note 3B CONV(EYEd) 30 would have been sweet.  My play is not on the list but it scores more points than anything that is (besides CONVEYED).

#note OK I give!

#note Karl said he wanted to trade 7 too, but after my trade he didn't expect his would work out so well.
>Brad_W.: ADEGINO 13E O.GANDIE +63 454
#note Wow that trade worked out way better than I expected.  I was just hoping to draw a vowel or two.
