>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEILNW 8G WE +10 10
#note I thought about LAWINE, too, but drawing 2 to AEILN felt like a good gamble.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ADMP 7F DAMP +23 23
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEIILNT H5 LI.. +6 16
#note This might be silly since I'm not holding an S. I should have gone all out with just F6 ID.
>Chuck_Armstrong: GIJNOT 5F JO.TING +30 53
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAEINOT 4K OAT +14 30
#note Why did I pass up (J)A(D)E? I just don't know. AEIN has vowelitis* potential, but I figured I was opening a valuable lane on row 3.
>Chuck_Armstrong: BBRU 3L BURB +26 79
#note I looked and looked but couldn't find BIVALENT. If I'd remembered LIMEN, then ANVILED plays for 78.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEILNV 9B VALINEs +74 104
>Chuck_Armstrong: FIKORRW O1 RI.WORK +60 139
#note He told me his 7th tile after the game. I didn't hold this one, because I was nervous and just trusted his word knowledge. But I did write on my scoresheet: "RIBWORT?" This one is a clever combination of CRIBWORK and RIBWORT. But if I wrongly challenge and he hits the S, it's game over.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EGNRTXY C8 G.NTRY +20 124
#note I'm turning over an extra 2 compared with (L)YNX to get my hands on an S before him for RIBWORKS*. Yes, it's phony, but we don't know that at the time.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ADEEMNO 1H DEMEANO. +86 225
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEEIIX 12A AE.IE +12 136
#note Yucky draw.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EEEPV 11E PEEVE +28 253
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEIOOX 2H OXID +35 171
#note The leave after 2H OXO 30 instead is a little more balanced.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ACRT 7K TRAC. +12 265
#note Great, now that I have ZIGS lined up for 117, he decides to block.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEGIOSZ 10I AZO +34 205
#note I was deciding between AZO and (RIBWORK)S. Ultimately, I decided that I needed to bingo to catch up, and that was going to happen sooner if I'm drawing to EGIS than AEGIOZ. I just neglected to fully consider the consequences of leaving the S spot open for him to get an easy 51 points at any time, though.
>Chuck_Armstrong: S 8O S +51 316
#note Which is exactly what happened.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EGHINSY H11 .YING +48 253
>Chuck_Armstrong: FHNO 11K FOHN +30 346
>Brendan_Sullivan: EHIISST 14E SHI.IEST +71 324
#note The only one.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ADELQUU A12 .QUA +39 385
#note He said he was one off from QUAALUDE.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACELOSU O11 SCALE +41 365
#note He will hit a bingo that fits on Row 3 50% of the time (if the D/F/R/T is in the bag). I can't realistically bock it; maybe with 3C OSCULE or COLEUS, neither of which I saw at the time. I felt like I needed to hope he couldn't bingo, and just score a bunch to make it closer. But if I'm doing that, O10 OSCULA or OSCULE is better.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?DELRTU 3B sTRUDEL +70 455
#note Come on, he didn't need that one.
>Chuck_Armstrong:  (FOU) +12 467
