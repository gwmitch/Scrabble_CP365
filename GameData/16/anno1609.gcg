>Dave_T: ?AEEOTT 9F TOTE +23 23
#note Not a good start.  For some reason I was unsure of OUTEATEN and missed TOTEABLE.  My play was third best.
>Carolyn_E: LUV 10I LUV +13 39
>Dave_T: ?ACESXY L10 SEXY +35 58
#note CALYXES for 109
>Carolyn_E: GIM 10E MIG +23 62
>Dave_T: ?ACDEOO 11C COO +18 76
#note I should have played Q's choice of K10 VOE but was afraid the board would become too closed.
>Carolyn_E: IIII -IIII +0 62
>Dave_T: ?AADEOO K9 A.O +16 92
#note best
>Carolyn_E: FIRT 12D FRIT +29 91
>Dave_T: ?ADEORS C4 EnDOSAR. +62 154
#note 13D FEDORAS and C8 BROCADES are better.  I also could have played J1 SEADROME.  I almost got a challenge but she had a good reply.
>Carolyn_E: DEK 8A DE.K +42 133
>Dave_T: AAEHLQY H12 HEAL +48 202
#note HYLA
>Carolyn_E: IVW 4A VI.W +28 161
>Dave_T: ADEHQSY E4 YEH +32 234
#note YEAHS is better here but I wanted to keep the QA combo which I probably shouldn't have been too concerned about at this stage of the game.  I also should have at least considered HEAVY.
>Carolyn_E: ELZ 14F ZE.L +33 194
>Dave_T: AADGIQS B1 QAD. +28 262
#note Q agrees but it's potentially risky.  I was planning on blocking the 3x3 threat the following turn.  
>Carolyn_E: EEIRTU 1B .UIETER +51 245
>Dave_T: AGINNSU J1 SANGUIN. +63 325
#note I was planning on trying 2A SAUNAING (SAUNAED didn't seem like it'd be an adjective) before it was blocked and I saw the bingo.
>Carolyn_E: AM F6 MA +23 268
>Dave_T: EINOPPW K4 OP +19 344
#note A8 DOWNPIPE would have been awesome had I known and seen it.
>Carolyn_E: AFOR L2 FARO +27 295
>Dave_T: EILNPRW M3 WEN +33 377
#note this is by far the best play and I love how it closes up the top part of the board.
>Carolyn_E: I 12L .I +9 304s
>Dave_T: IILNPRS N12 SPIN +22 399
#note I wish Quackle had some sort of fish detection.  There's no way in hell I'd go with it's suggestion of N1 LIN after her last play.
>Carolyn_E: ?BGNNRT 6I B.T +10 314
>Dave_T: AIILNRR A8 .IRL +5 404
#note I kind of like Q's play of 9B RAI.
