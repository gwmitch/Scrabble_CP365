>Jason: DEFLTTX 8F FLEX +28 28
>Pete_Zeigler: AEIOTUV 7B OUTVIE +19 19
#note Jason: "Well, I know what your leave wasn't," I said. Pete: I sacrificed the 2 points not to open the triple line. I didn't quite know what to do with this rack; I'm glad my thought process was right.  
>Jason: ADGILTT H4 GLAD. +20 48
#note Jason: Whiffed on LATIG(O) and DITA at 8A, which run a close 1-2 equity-wise and sim-wise.
>Pete_Zeigler: AADFGII 5E FAI. +14 33
#note Pete: Duck likes ADAGIO, which I missed, but I'm not a fan of it. Opens the A column for big plays, and for so few points, I couldn't justify it. IF 8A is second, with the AA leave (I disregarded it), and mine is third. It was a tough decision, but I stand by it.
>Jason: AEIORTT 4C TAO +11 59
#note Jason: I feel like these racks really separate the boys like me from the men; I don't feel like I handled these situations well. One of those racks where all the top choices are really close in equity and win percentage.
>Pete_Zeigler: ADGHIRR 4H .HARRI +20 53
#note Pete: A stupid play because I saw and liked the word, and was a bit pissed about not having a place for HAGRIDER. Duck likes GIRTH or GRITH C1; while I prefer its third choice RAD 3B. My play finishes 5.9 equity points down. My play was way too aggressive without good stuff on my rack.  
>Jason: EEIMRST N1 TRISEME +91 150
#note Jason: If Scrabble had style points, the non-bingo (FLEX)TIMERS would be best. Again, Pete just seems to have horrible timing when he plays me; I pull the S at an opportune time and Pete sets me up perfectly.
>Pete_Zeigler: CDGNOST O5 DONG +27 80
#note Jason: I'd like to hear Pete's explanation of how he got 33 when he counted it. At least I caught it. :) Pete: Scrabble is a word game; I don't do math. Bitter about the lack of an open A for the coolish CANTDOGS, My play is about equivalent to COST 8L; down a bingo I thought keeping the S was best.
>Jason: ?EEKLOS K4 .OSELiKE +94 244
#note Jason: I owe the Illinoisans (Illinoisers? Illini?) for this one. Saturday at lunch Haughney was trying to remember the three-L -LIKE word (got away with DOLLLIKE* that morning; I guessed GULLLIKE* since almost all animals take the -LIKE); Turissini looked it up: LILYLIKE. With that knowledge, I was able to go: "If LILYLIKE is good, logically ROSELIKE's gotta be good. Right?" Now I'm slightly offput because it's the only bingo I see. If I pass on it and it's good, Q hates me. If I play it and it's challenged off, Q hates me (esp. since I can score the same with KEELSOn at M7). In the end, I followed my gut, hoped the OWL had some logic to it (a dangerous assumption), and it paid off. If I don't go to Subway on Saturday, no way do I have the guts to pull the trigger.
>Pete_Zeigler: CEILRST C6 C.RLIEST +72 152
#note Pete: Proud I saw and considered all of the 72 pointers.  CURLIEST won the sim. Figured CURLIEST or UTRICLES had to be best, as it gave additional for the additional bingoes I'd surely need.
>Jason: AACEOQT 3M Q. +44 288
#note Jason: In the sim, Q's got ACE(T)A very close behind and I can see why. Still a shot at the 44 next turn, and if it's blocked, play the Q at 10B for 31.
>Pete_Zeigler: DEINORU M7 DOURINE +78 230
#note Jason: Hey, I've broken open a close game with a 91-94-44 sequence, just led by 164; why hasn't he gone away? Pete: Woohoo!  Another no-brainer bingo! Still down a bingo, but the board is still open, and ?S unseen.
>Jason: AACDEOT 1L DA.A +21 309
#note Jason: All the decent plays are through the T.
>Pete_Zeigler: AAGNNOU 2H GUANO +11 241
#note Jason: Somebody's regretting not playing DATO the turn before... Pete: Figured it was time to start getting a bit crazy. Only one additional A was out, and I figured I could score something with a bit of luck. 
>Jason: CENOTWY N11 TONY +20 329
#note Jason: No, no, no. I thought I'd play that defense I've been hearing so much about, but the leave's crap and the score's mediocre. Not even on Q's radar.
>Pete_Zeigler: AENSUV? 1E UVEA +30 271
#note Jason: Are those footsteps I hear? Pete: I was afraid I missed one, but UVEA was best. I had to clean the VU, and its a reasonable score. Jason: Now I'm glad I blocked AVENUeS/(DOURINE)S.
>Jason: CEEIOPW 10H WIC.E. +21 350
#note Jason: When I had the Y, I saw MOC(K)E(R)Y for 32 as a cool possibility.
>Pete_Zeigler: BMNRST? 6H .RB. +12 283
#note Pete: At any critical juncture, I can count on the bag to kill me. Six consonants seems about par for the course. BRR 8A is better, scoring 5 more with the same tiles and opening a new line. Braincramp. 
>Jason: EINOPPY 3B YIP +24 374
#note Jason: Q got (S)NIPPY with me here. I liked scoring, not opening and leaving a good combo, but (S)NIPPY at 12C is clearly best. Leaves one in the bag and shuts down the board.
>Pete_Zeigler: BJMNST? 10B J.B +28 311
#note Pete: SO much for a vowel. I have to dump the J, and JIB opens a semi-useful new line. With a good draw, there's a chance... JIB sims at about 41% win percentage, beating the next choice by a big margin. 
>Jason: AENOPWZ 2A ZAP +43 417
#note Jason: Finally drew one of the two biggies to put it away.
>Pete_Zeigler: ?HIMNST 12A MI.HuNTS +82 393
#note Jason: Pete said he mad me mistracked, but said "this might win," which had me a little nervous. I assumed he couldn't score 90 with any seven of ?EHIMNST. Pete: I missed the only playable bingo, TINSMITH, which scores about the minimum and doesn't come close to winning.  
>Pete_Zeigler: ?HIMNST --  -82 311
#note Jason: "I don't understand; it's a perfectly cromulent word!" said Pete. Thanks to Pete for filling out the slip before making the play. :)
>Jason: EENOW E10 ENOW +27 444
#note Jason: Missed the out of (T)OWNEE.
>Pete_Zeigler: ?HIMNST H10 .HIMpS +42 353
#note Jason: Stupidity on my part to let it go (esp. since I wasn't 100% sure if the blank was an E or P ... don't ask), although since spread was meaningless, it ain't no thing. Jim Peters pointed out he had WHIMSy. "That's why I didn't challenge," I said, trying to keep a poker face. Pete: I do silly things when a game is lost. By this point in the tournament, I had been on such a roller coaster, I was going nuts. Lunch came at a great time. 
>Jason: E 13E .E +5 449
#note Jason: Since I had five 5s, I dropped the E above the I in WHIMPS*. I think it landed facedown at D14, which should've been a clue to play (T)E(W)!
>Jason:  (NT) +4 453
