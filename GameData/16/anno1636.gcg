>James_Leong: ABEELRV 8D VERBAL +30 30
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIIIMTU I6 MI.ITIA +11 11
#note I7 I(L)IUM 9 is better; AIT is preferrable to U. Plus MILITIA gives away high-point 4s to the TWS.
>James_Leong: ?EGLOQS 11H Q. +11 41
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEFORU D6 FA.OURED +80 91
>James_Leong: ?EGGLOS 13I SLOGGEd +79 120
#note J2 GOGLEtS 83.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEHOPR N10 HOP.D +38 129
#note I did not know DROPHEAD. And I did not know PREVERBAL.
>James_Leong: ?AAINTW O5 ANTIWAr +83 203
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEIOPRW F1 AIRPOWE. +73 202
>James_Leong: EOTUUVY 1E V.TU +21 224
#note 3A VOYEUR 24 gets rid of most of the junk.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAEEIIJ C3 AJEE +27 229
#note Ugly leave, but the best I can do, and exchanging didn't feel right.
>James_Leong: EHORUXY D2 RHO +35 259
#note E10 HEX 44. Take the points.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEIINTY J3 TINY +30 259
#note C11 AYIN 27 leaves me with a much-needed consonant.
>James_Leong: BENTUXY B1 BUY +25 284
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEIILLM L8 MILLA.E +26 285
#note N2 MALLEI 28 is less dangerous, with SSS unseen. If I really want to gamble, C12 MILE 22 opens the 3x3 and leaves me hoping for a bingo.
>James_Leong: CEENNTX 3H EX.ENT +42 326
>Brendan_Sullivan: EIOOOSS I2 O.O +12 297
#note 9F SO 22 is neat; there are a few 2 tile draws that give me bingos on row 15.
>James_Leong: ACEGKNR B6 KEG +38 364
#note Very nice setup, holding the only A left.
>Brendan_Sullivan: CDEIOSS C12 DOC +21 318
#note All the high-scoring plays are from 15H hooking MILLAGES, but they leave me down 25ish with no hope at all for a win. This play gives me an outside chance at hitting a bingo somewhere on the bottom row.
>James_Leong: ACENRTZ A7 RAZE +50 414
>Brendan_Sullivan: EINRSSU 15F INSURES +86 404
#note No matter what tile is in the bag, I lose after any of the playable bingos here. So why is a many-ply sim showing the 15G and 15F bingos with 12% wins? It makes sense to me that the 15C/15A placements have higher valuations, since they more than likely block his high S plays hooking DOCS, like FISC, particularly. But how do the others win at all???
>James_Leong: CFINNST 15A FIST +31 445
#note FISC is 16 better, with me going out next.
>Brendan_Sullivan: D A7 ....D +15 419
#note So close to winning . . . Oh wait, James resigned anyway! How sneaky and completely unexpected of him :-P
>Brendan_Sullivan:  (CNN) +10 429
