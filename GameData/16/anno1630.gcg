>Steve_Grob: ?DENORU 8D DOURiNE +68 68
#note Steve: Chose this of many bingos because 1) I saw it right away and it put the D on the dls, and 2) I didn't think it took an -S hook at the end. oops. Jason: As Steve puts down DOUR, I say "I think I've seen this word before." Now I wish I'd done a bingo list, so I could have "DOURINE, DOURiNE."
>Jason: AAHLRTT E7 L.ATH +16 16
#note Steve: Why couldn't he play something like THR(E)AT?
>Steve_Grob: ENOOSSZ G2 SNOOZE.S +70 138
#note Steve: Caught myself trying to lay it down at 12e, which could have led to a zero. Not knowing DOURINES costs 20 points. Ouch.
>Jason: AABJNRT 4D JAB.T +30 46
>Steve_Grob: AEKLNOR 5B KAON +29 167
#note Steve: Q likes krone 12a. I debated between this and (Z)ONK 6g.
>Jason: AIMNRRY 6A MIRY +34 80
#note Jason: Didn't have enough faith in MIR(K)Y.
>Steve_Grob: EEHLNQR 2G .HEQEL +38 205
#note Jason: I told Steve, who put down HEQ first, "If you'd played SHEQALIM (for 134) there, I would've just up and left." 
>Jason: AADNORW 1H AW +35 115
>Steve_Grob: AACCFNR 1L AFAR +27 232
>Jason: ADDINOR 7I ANDROID +66 181
#note Jason: I was actually a little disappointed I saw this, because then I saw DINAR at 3I for 40 (41 after AFAR). I mean, how often do you play DINAR for 41?
>Steve_Grob: CCDENXY O7 .EXY +45 277
#note Jason: After this play, I'm wondering if this is going to be one of those "Sisyphus games", where every time I start to pull close, he's got a big play to send me tumbling down the hill again.
>Jason: IMNOOTU N10 MOUNT +39 220
#note Jason: It was this or MOTION. If I'd known MOUTON, the best play, I'd have played that.
>Steve_Grob: BCCDFIN N4 BIF.D +22 299
#note Steve: Big miss here. BID on row 3 scores 34; as long as I'm keeping the double C leave for the third turn in a row I might as well take the points.
>Jason: EIILOPV 12A VOILE +33 253
#note Jason: Hey, an E!
>Steve_Grob: ACCLNPR 13C NARC +28 327
>Jason: EGIPSTW 15L WISP +47 300
>Steve_Grob: CEILPSU 10B CUL.I +15 342
#note Steve: Didn't know this bingo, at least not well enuf. Wouldn't have been sure enough to know that PELVICS is good, which would have done wonders. No excuse for the poor vision, however, and not spotting CE(L) at 7c for 32.
>Jason: ?EGGRTT 3K TEG +13 313
#note Jason: Given how vowel-heavy the pool was, I couldn't imagine not getting there leaving ?GRT, especially with the N in MOUNT in a nice spot for -ING bingos.
>Steve_Grob: EEIIPSU 13L PI.E +12 354
#note Jason: Steve drew only two after this play. As you might guess, this would prove significant. In hindsight, Steve said he should've played SUPINE or PUISNE. Knappster said "Why not PEIN?" which blocks as well.
>Jason: ?AEEGRT J5 GE..RATEd +63 376
#note Jason: I knew that Steve could make plays rendering the board almost impossible for eights, which he did. But yet, I never looked a nine. But when he put PINE down, my brain said "Look for nines through NE!" And I saw it instantly, freaked me out a little. When looking for bingos through the N, I was going through what I could make the blank, and for E it was GENERATE/TEENAGER. Maybe that explains it; I dunno. Given the circumstances, it's probably the best play I've ever made, even though Pete might call it a "pedestrian nine." :) When that question circulated through LJ a couple months ago, I didn't have an answer. Now I do. My chance to get in "Your Move" legitimately! :)
>Steve_Grob: EIOSUV A12 .IVE +30 384
#note Jason: Before PINE, I made sure everything was cleared for endgame takeoff. My count and my track agreed: six in the bag. So I was surprised when I drew four (EGIT); I only had me drawing three. Now I can't go out and probably will lose. So, I only had six on Steve's rack: EIOSUV. He plays VIVE, leaving 1:10. Fortunately, I've got about 15 minutes, so I begin re-tracking the game. Then I think: "You're SURE he's got four?" I look at his rack: three tiles. Time to call the director. Carol comes. I explain the situation. "Is it a close game?" Carol asks. "He just played that to go up eight," I said. I thought she might hit me. :) Carol leaves and returns with a manual, which doesn't outline our situation. Carol leaves and returns with Stock (manning the computers, needing winners slips quickly for KOTH pairing purposes). I explain the situation again for him. They agree they need to pow-wow. They return and ask us to explain the situation a third time, just so they're 100% clear on the timeline of events, esp. when I discovered it. They leave again. I'm worried they're going to say I caught it too late and tell us to play on. I'm pretty sure that I can go out with any three of the four, given the open R and A, but play on and I lose. By now, a couple of people are coming over to see what's going on. They return with their decision: Since Steve would have pulled one of my tiles from the bag, I'm to turn all four face down, shuffle them, and he picks one. "But if I pick the wrong one, he goes out!" Steve said with a dry laugh. I offer to let him look at two and pick one when Carol tells me I can't do that; they've made their ruling and that's how it's going to be. He picks the I.
>Jason: EGT 10I G.TE +5 381
#note Jason In my excitement, I missed GET at O3 for seven more. Other stuff: Steve was incredibly gracious about the whole thing, especially when I'm annoyingly telling everybody and their brother after the game. If he plays SUPI(N)E, he wins, but Haughney saw GE(NE)RAlE(S)T (most general), which is no good but would've been one of the great tries in history. (V)IVE is the best play with EIIOUSV as well, so no harm done there. I asked Carol and Stock at dinner if there was any disagreement, and she said in the end the only decision they had to make was whether to let Steve pick randomly or have me choose which one to give him as punishment, in which case I give him the E and play GIT at K10 for 17. I had no need to worry; any situation leaves me with three tiles. Nothing changed in the recount. What an unbelievable game.
