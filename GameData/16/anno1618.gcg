#note Good judgment - FOR gives up too much despite undoubling the R's.

#note This was a very tough decision and I don't think my play was all that great, breaking up a bingoish rack for only moderate points. Fishing moves like PLY sim best here, but YCLEPT is another interesting option.

#note Boy, what a string of crummy racks! I think I would probably exchange again, unappetizing as that may be.

#note This play sims poorly compared to TROIKA 4G. My thinking was to keep a balanced leave, and hope to score with the K. But maybe opening up the board so much was unwise given my lead.

#note Great play - opens a 2nd bingo lane, with plenty of 2 tile draws that produce bingos in both spots.

#note Luckily for me, MANROPE O6 was the only possibility I had to worry about.

#note I saw that this was better than BOVID, but interestingly enough, the best sequence seems to be to eat both V's. BO 13G, saving the D to threaten WYNDS, comes out 3 points better than VID.
