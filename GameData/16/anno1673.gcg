>Brendan_Sullivan: AEOOQTV 8G QAT +24 24
#note An exchange keeping ET or AET is probably okay, too.
>Linda_Hoggatt: AENU G8 .UEAN +15 15
>Brendan_Sullivan: EOOORUV H12 OVER +27 51
#note Tough leave, but I'm scoring in the process.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ABE 12D BEA.. +14 29
>Brendan_Sullivan: MOOOOUV -MOOOOUV +0 51
#note It's attack of the killer Os!
>Linda_Hoggatt: AJOT 13C JOTA +30 59
>Brendan_Sullivan: BEILLST J2 BILLETS +80 131
#note Wonderful rack management.
>Linda_Hoggatt: OPW 14B POW +33 92
>Brendan_Sullivan: AMNORTU 6D AMOUNT.R +62 193
#note I remember the discussion on CGP about the invalidity of MINOTAUR, but I somehow remembered there being a valid anagram, so I spent some time looking for it. I also just couldn't find ROUTEMAN. I've seen it, but it hasn't stuck. It's the only playable bingo here, with a homeless ROMAUNT. In fact, ROMAUNTS and ROUTEMAN are the only 8s with this rack.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AMNORTU --  -62 131
#note Bzzzt.
>Linda_Hoggatt: EEG 15A GEE +26 118
#note This was underscored by 1 and we didn't catch it.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AMNORTU 3G MAN.TOU +26 157
#note 11G A(M)OUNT 26 might be better.
>Linda_Hoggatt: DENY 4D DENY +23 141
>Brendan_Sullivan: ??IIRSV 15H .IVIeReS +77 234
#note Sheesh, another ?? draw today. I didn't like what N1 VISITOR/ER opened up. I wish I had found N1 ISOGRIV 80!
>Linda_Hoggatt: EHL 14F HE.L +31 172
>Brendan_Sullivan: DIKOOOY 10D YOK. +21 255
#note If only I had read the comments on Antelope of the Day #7! I wasn't sure that one could spell it KOODOO as well.
>Linda_Hoggatt: AFG 9C FAG +19 191

>Linda_Hoggatt: ADENPRT L1 PR.NATED +82 273
>Brendan_Sullivan: CEIOORS 3C COO +15 311
#note I think I looked at playing POCO, then looked elsewhere, then forgot about POCO entirely. It sims second-best to 5E RECOIL 32, which I did not see.
>Linda_Hoggatt: CLU 5G CUL. +16 289
>Brendan_Sullivan: EGINRSX 1L .REX +39 350
#note I thought briefly about how often 7L (E)X 17 might pay off with a bingo to the S to make it worthwhile. M5 NIX 39, which I did not look at, is a little better than my play.
>Linda_Hoggatt: HI 2N HI +29 318

>Linda_Hoggatt: U 2J .U. +7 325
>Brendan_Sullivan: AINORST M6 AROINTS +67 447
#note Lucky draw, and the only bingo.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ADEEFIR O8 AIRFEED. +89 414
#note Hmm. A desperate attempt indeed. A5 AER(I)FIED cuts the margin of victory to 51.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ADEEFIR --  -89 325
#note My spread thanks Linda for her generosity.
