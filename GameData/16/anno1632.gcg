#note Missed the double-double E5 EMP(T)IED 48.  Was going to play 7F MIMED 26 but at the last minute panicked, thinking MIME might not be a verb (only MIMIC).

#note E5 qUO(T)ABLE 86 is probably better, although it might be more important to shut down the triple lane.  I did the math and determined a 2x2 would score only 1 more point, and didn't bother looking to save time.

#note D1 VAGUE 35 and D1 WAVE 32 are better but I'm not going to open the 3x3 with the lead and a blank still out.

#note OK, C3 ON 17 is the #1 play and C3 AN 17 (my play) is the #10 play.  I chose to keep the O because there were a lot of A's left.

#note Quackle likes 9C JUS 30 but I don't see how spending the S can be worth 6 extra points.
