>Jeremy: CDIQRUU 8G QUID +28 28
#note I don't want the E(QUID) hook to be in the 2x2x lane.  Quack prefers the 8H positioning by 2 points.  Perhaps a Q in the center square makes bingos to the TWS improbable.
>Joel_W: AI 9F AI +15 15
>Jeremy: CFORRUZ I7 F.Z +29 57
#note Normally I would have played CRUOR at 10B (best), but this play might block more bingos.  A 2 tile play for 15 points by Joel indicates fishing.  Defense can't hurt.
>Joel_W: ANR J8 .ARN +18 33
>Jeremy: ACEORRU F5 OCRE. +28 85
#note Quack likes UREA at F6 for the improved leave, but at the expense of 7 points.
>Joel_W: AEINRST 5E N.TARIES +82 115
>Jeremy: ACNORUY 4K YUCA +27 112
#note YOU, YOURN, and YUCA sim virtually even for best play.
>Joel_W: AAEGV 10B AGAVE +23 138
>Jeremy: AGINORU C7 ROU.ING +22 134
#note Best by a slim margin over G3 OUT for just 4 points keeping GARNI.
>Joel_W: ELNOOW 3G WOOLEN +23 161
>Jeremy: ABDGLVW 8A BL.W +39 173
#note Missed H1 AVOWAL hands down best, and picked BLOW over 8A AVOW so I would keep my vowel.
>Joel_W: BEE 12A BE.E +18 179
>Jeremy: ADGNSTV O1 VATS +35 208
#note Best.  0I TAVS and 2F VANG are very close behind.
>Joel_W: ?DEEIMN N4 .DEEMINg +64 243
>Jeremy: DGILMNO A12 .OLD +21 229
#note My thinking here is that I will likely need a bingo to catch Joel, and if I keep ING I need a space for an ING bingo.  Correct moves are parallel to ADEEMINg to eat up the TWS and score 34 or 37.  This move puts me well back in win percentage.  The blunder of the game.
>Joel_W: STY O6 STY +43 286
>Jeremy: FGIIMNO H1 MO. +15 244
#note Trying to bingo next, and making space to do so.  M9 MO keeping FGIIN wins the sim in w% in MANY plies.
>Joel_W: ILOPU 4A POILU +22 308
>Jeremy: AFGIINS I11 IF +7 251
#note Opens a spot for my S, keeps bingo tiles, and makes Joel wonder if I have the J for JIN and a huge play to the TWS.  M1 FIS(C) wins the sim for it's points, but I think I need to bingo badly now.
>Joel_W: AEIRR H11 AIRER +27 335
>Jeremy: AGIJNPS C3 J.G +22 273
#note 1F JIMP is better on MANY ply, but I need to preserve my bingo lanes to threaten Joel.  JIG is not far behind.  I disagree with Quack on this call.
>Joel_W: DEEP A1 DEE. +21 356
>Jeremy: AHIKNPS 2N K. +12 285
#note I get a bingo at 15G P(R)ANKISH which I turn down because I am convinced it loses the game 100%.  If I can fish a tile, and then bingo out... I have a chance to catch Joel with the X and win.  I am correct.  I  fish off the K, but in the wrong spot.  9M K(I) gives me a new bingo line at the cost of one point. 9I (ZA)P is equally good with a 12.22% chance to win. My KA is just a 6.11% chance to win, but it's a chance.


>Joel_W: ?HOTTTX K11 sHOTT +20 376
#note Joel thinks he is blocking FI(R)ESHIP.  He has mistracked.  I hold INPHASE, and he has just blocked HEPA(R)INS.

>Jeremy: AEHINPS 15K .HINE +36 321
#note I put Joel on hold, 90% sure SHOTT is good.  I don't see HEPA(R)INS but if I did I would have challenged.  I don't spot a bingo, but through R and T PE(R)IAN(T)HS doesn't quite fit.  The T needs to be one over.  I run my clock down to 6 seconds looking for wacky bingos, and then slam down THINE at 15K resigning to a loss.  Best play luckily.
>Joel_W: TX 2A .X +18 394
#note Joel plays quick (perhaps trying to get me to go overtime?)
>Jeremy: APS 14E PAS. +8 329
#note I fire down PASE, the first think I see, and hit announce 8 points and blindly hit the clock,  my clock is at 0:00.  K7 ASP is a whopping 35 points, which is why THINE was best last turn.  Oops.  Oh well.  The only thing lost was spread points.
>Jeremy:  (T) +2 331
