>Christopher_S.: DEFNOST 8D FONDEST +80 80
>Brad_W.: AAIINOS J6 IO.A +6 6
#note I liked this play because it kept things nice and open, although after I made the play I noticed that I was blocking one of the best bingo lanes (to the S).  Probably not a big deal since I have an S myself.
>Christopher_S.: ABEPRTW K9 BEWRAPT +82 162
#note Scored as 84.  I would have challenged except I had a triple-triple comeback.  I would have lost a turn.  I knew INWRAPT* was a phony.  I wonder why BEWRAPT is good but not INWRAPT*.
>Brad_W.: ?AEINSS 15H NAS.IESt +122 128
#note I played the first one I could find that didn't slot the S in the triple lane.
>Christopher_S.: AEHY 7E YEAH +27 189
>Brad_W.: CCEEHMR 6F HM +35 163
#note N10 CREME(S) 32 is better.  I didn't love the idea of keeping the two C's together but it seemed like the right play.
>Christopher_S.: AEIOSTU 12E SAUTOI.E +68 257
>Brad_W.: CCEEGIR F11 C.GE +9 172
#note I agonized over this play.  My play actually does make the list.  I considered CERCI/CERCI(S)/RECCE/RECCE(S) but wasn't sure about either of them.  Also considered N12 CIG(S) 14 but I didn't want to score nothing AND block the juiciest bingo lane.
>Christopher_S.: AEGL 14B AGLE. +12 269
>Brad_W.: ?ACEEIR G6 ...E +8 180
#note I agonized over this play too although by this point, I was running low on time so I had to keep my agonizing to a minimum.  Surprisingly my crap play made the list again.  I talked myself out of N8 DeCIARE(S) 80 by convincing myself it was a french adjective, thinking I had never seen it while studying 8's.  Oops.  Also wasn't sure if CERIA took an S.  
>Christopher_S.: EILOR 15A REOIL +28 297
>Brad_W.: ?ACEINR O8 INtERAC. +77 257
#note Finally.  Now I can get on with the rest of the game.  There are 5 higher-scoring bingos that get the C on either N10 or O12, but I don't have any time left to look for them.
>Christopher_S.: IJN C11 JIN.. +26 323
>Brad_W.: AINRTTZ N6 ZIT +34 291
#note I hated blocking this lane, especially if it turns out I need a bingo to catch up.  5D ZIT 31 is probably better but I don't think I saw the spot.  I saw K4 ZIT 26, but I didn't want to give up 8 points and give an easy comeback score on the Z.
