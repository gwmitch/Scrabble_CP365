#player1 Jason Jason
#player2 Steve_Grob Steve Grob
>Jason: ADEGINO 8G GANOID +20 20
#note Jason: One of the more interesting opening racks I've had in a while. This is best equity-wise, but sim's top three plays are AGO, exch. AO and exch. A.
>Steve_Grob: AFIILNY 7G AYIN +23 23
>Jason: AEOPQTV 6E QAT +18 38
#note Jason: PAVE(D)'s a little better (setting up Q(A)T), but with two I's already gone, I just wanted the Q off my rack.
>Steve_Grob: EFHIILO L3 FOILE. +20 43
>Jason: DEGHOPV K3 EDH +32 70
>Steve_Grob: ?HILNRW 5J W..N +10 53
>Jason: GOPRTVV -GOPVV +0 70
#note Jason: Damn not being able to play PROV(IN)G at I3. Oddly enough, exchanges are Q's top-10 plays, but keeping RT not among them! Weird.
>Steve_Grob: ?HILRRZ 6I HI +22 75
>Jason: IRRSSTT 3I TR..S +18 88
>Jason: IRRSSTT --  -18 70
#note Jason: I liked it better than R(EF)TS*! Should've remembered REFS has no hooks. Good challenge by Steve.
>Steve_Grob: ?LPRRUZ N3 PReZ +44 119
#note Steve: Didn't like burning the blank, but the math makes it the easy choice. Jason: I'm assuming he's leaving the other blank, so I'm running a little hot here.
>Jason: IRRSSTT M8 STIR +14 84 
>Steve_Grob: EILNRTU E4 RE.UIN +30 149
#note Jason: OK, maybe he doesn't have the other blank.
>Jason: LNNPRST -LNPR +0 84
#note Jason: This just in: Scoring 14 in a four-turn span is not the way to beat Steve Grob.
>Steve_Grob: CEILOTV 4A COVE.T +28 177
#note Steve: After the play I was almost wishing I held back the C, in hopes to cash in big on the next turn.
>Jason: KMNRSTW B3 W.RK +21 105
#note Jason: Thank heavens I got a vowel to play through, or it would've been 14 points in five turns, and perhaps a repeat of our MM '07 game, in which I scored 240.
>Steve_Grob: ?IIILPS D8 PILI +18 195
#note Steve: Look Ma! I have the case III.
>Jason: EEMNSST 9C M..ES +17 122
#note Jason: I even put ME(L)S/(REQUIN)S down. Didn't look right. Totally forgot PILI takes an S, too. Confusing it with HILI, maybe?
>Steve_Grob: ?EFISTX 12H FoXIEST +95 290
#note Steve: Funny. I saw FIXaTES, but at 12G, not B8. A mere 27 point error. Jason: Channeling jigsawn, are we? :D (j/k! j/k!) I guess I should be fortunate he didn't go for 122.
>Jason: ADELNST 13C SLANTED +81 203
#note Jason: I made a really, really dumb prop bet with hector after we each started 5-3: My Sunday wins +1 vs. his Sunday wins, at 8-5 odds for me. Well, he starts out Melvin, Ross, Breitbeil (3-0, naturally) and I start out Hoekstra, Kid Fiszbein, Grob (and 0-3). I've already lamented the stupidity of this bet after my 0-2 start vs. his 2-0, saying "I should just pay you now; even if I win, it'd just be rewarding bad behavior." Well, as he walks by the table with Connie to the challenge computer, he says "Wanna pay me now?" Needless to say, at this stage I wasn't in the mood and he nearly got a five in the face on the way back.
>Steve_Grob: AABEEOO C1 ABO.E +32 322
>Jason: BGMRUUY 1A BR.Y +39 242
#note Jason: Didn't know (A)UGURY, which is clearly best.
>Steve_Grob: AACEEOR O6 AERO +23 345
#note Steve: RACE o5 is too many to pass up, even tho it leaves three vowels.
>Jason: AEGMOUU K11 M.AOU +14 256
>Steve_Grob: ACEGNTU 14J C.NGA +28 373
#note Steve: More afraid of J(O)ULE here than a 3x3
>Jason: ADEGJOU H12 ..UD +24 280
#note Jason: JEU at 12A sets up the out in two.
>Steve_Grob: EELOTUV O1 VOE +22 395
>Jason: AEGJO 11C J.AO +22 302
#note Jason: I wondered if I had to block LUTE(D). I do, with GA(N)E at F11 guaranteeing me a good out with the J.
>Steve_Grob: ELTU J10 LE. +16 411
#note Jason: Fortunately he missed it/wasn't sure of it, too. :) Steve: Wasn't 100 percent on LUTE(D) being good, and it would have been a big knock on point spread if it wasn't.
>Jason: EG 2C .EG +11 313
#note Jason: Seeing (HIN)GE would've been cool.
>Jason:  (TU) +4 317
