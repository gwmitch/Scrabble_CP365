#note I proceed to miss the extension to DIAPHONY for the next three turns. Such a pretty word! also, quackle actually likes my play among non-extensions...I was playing defensively fearing a blank bingo, but the more I look at it the better I like it.

#note in another illustratory note, he then misses the other extension, APOPHONY (third one is SYMPHONY and that's it for extensions)

#note ok, this next one is where I need your help

#note here's my logic - the board is effectively dead, partially instigated by my own bingo. there is one lane. he will block next turn just about every turn. I have to create some kind of counteraction. But maybe you say that by playing WOE this turn and taking the points and a semidecent leave I actually give myself a better chance because he might have a disaster rack. Or is there another play worth considering?

#note an interesting move. I think he had FRUITAGE in mind, though I hardly suspected it at the time. Blocked my last desperation play, which was going to be to fish for the one-outer to FUNNELING and hope the other lane managed to distract him.

#note also FRUITION. quackle likes other stuff. I fold.

#note actually the best endgame play! still drawing dead no matter what.

#note decided to call the bluff with nothing on my end.

#note finishes off with american airlines. I'm testing a theory that if scrabble employs more jargon a la poker, and outright steals its lexicon, then it might be able to piggyback its way into the limelight. Unfortunately, five people will look at this game, four of them in order to confirm how bad of a player I am, and the fifth will be my mom. Hi mom! Get back to work.
