>Pete: HIINRRT 8F THIR +14 14
#note Best play.  I always enjoy games with Scott.  I knew this one would be pivotal in the tournament, as I was 2-2, and needed the win to stay in contention to cash.  I hoped to play well. (Hec: Who's this Scott guy? Hat says "Team Hector." And right back at you on the compliment, I enjoy every game we play. Pete's too humble to mention how he thrashed me when he visited my house two months ago.) 
>Scott_Pianowski: AEHIITY F6 YE.I +15 15
#note Duck likes HAIRY for Scott slightly.  
>Pete: ADEINRS 10F SARDINE +72 86
#note I got it right, fortunately.  I actually blanked out on the anagrams of SARDINE, as idiotic as that sounds, but Duck liked this play, and as I am an advocate of an open board usually, it worked for me too.
>Scott_Pianowski: AGHIOOT K5 HOOTI.G +44 59
#note I liked this play, and it is a great example of why Hector is such a chalenging foe.  He never panics, never worries, he just makes a great play when some people would panic and fish off the O's or something weak like that. (Hec: I appreciate the props, but even Walter Koenicki finds HOOTING, right?) 
>Pete: ?DEEGIV M4 GrIEVED +73 159
#note only bingo. (Hec: When you played SARDINE, I was thinking, "wonder if he's thinking of the new hook." Umm, yup. This is also a good time to mention Lester's fantastic anamonic for RANDIES: "SUV belonged to Greenspan." Lester totally rules.) 
>Scott_Pianowski: AFIIMTX 8M .IM +24 83
#note Best.  For Scott, best is a running theme this game. (Hec: I took a while on this one, thinking I was missing something. Guess not.) 
>Pete: EKLNSUU J3 ULU +8 167
#note here, I panic.  RUNKLE kicks ass by 16.5.  My like of K's and hatred of U's combine to make me look like a moron. (Hec: I hate those Us, too, but getting rid of one of them and scoring, seems like a plan. When you put down ULU, I realized it was a break for me, a turn you couldn't score much.) 
>Scott_Pianowski: AFILPTX E3 PILAF +30 113
#note Duck likes FIX by 13 points, but I think Scott's play is right here.  Score with the weakish tiles, while still keeping X plays open for the next turn.  Equity is an incomplete analysis tool in this case. (Hec: This was the one play all game I really wanted to be right. Score, turn over, keep X options. FIX just seemed like too much of a give-back. I need to keep simming this position with funky specs until PILAF wins, dammit.) 
>Pete: CEIKNSU D4 KEN +34 201
#note CUKE is much better.  I'm a moron.
>Scott_Pianowski: AIOTXY? I2 OX +34 147
#note Best.  Scored, and opens a dangerous line while holding the blank. (Hec: Yeah, now it's time to Wakefield the X spot and move on. I was lucky he can't hit the top row. I was *very* lucky in the second part of this game, period.)  
>Pete: ACEISUW H1 AW +20 221
#note WISE slighty beats AW by 2.3 pts, but I stand by my play, which saves the S.
>Scott_Pianowski: ?AEITTY F2 YET +25 172 
#note (Hec: Don't see much else, need to rid myself the Y and extra T, keep scoring. I also need to open this board up soon before it's too late; obviously I didn't here.) 
>Pete: CDEIOSU I5 DOU. +13 234
#note Duck likes fishing off the U for FEU by 9.7, which shocked me.  I didn't realize how good the CDEIOS set is... takes ABCDEMNT, most of which I knew. I always have trouble with these situations, and knowing when the fish is right. (Hec: I wouldn't have gotten that right, either.) 
>Scott_Pianowski: ?ACIJRT H10 .AJ +18 190
#note Best.  I knew I was in trouble here.  That play looked like a combination fish and opening play, and had no counter.  Might be one of the best plays of the game. (Hec: Thanks. Of course it's lucky when you hit a draw that fits, as I did.) 
>Pete: CEEFINS N5 EF +27 261
#note Best.  I knew I was in for it, I was hoping I could catch something to CEINS that would let me hit back.
>Scott_Pianowski: ?CINRST 13G NaRCIST +80 270
#note Best.  It's a broken record, but look at how many darn Bests Scott has had.  Ouch. (Hec: Luckbox.) 
>Pete: ABCEINS O1 BICES +32 293
#note My big error. I panicked. I shoulda fished the B, but I was afraid of leaving the open O column.   
>Scott_Pianowski: EEMORST 14B REMOTES +85 355
#note Only playable.  And because I broke up a great rack, I'm unlikely to be able to hit back. (Hec: Major luckbox. I will never be a guy who brags about BINGO/BANGO bullshit, especially when it's something this pedestrian. When you draw a bingo on a seven-pick, you've just gotten lucky. Period, end of story.) 
>Pete: AADNPUZ 13A ZAP +38 331
#note Best, although it ties up lines.  Scott woulda taken care of them if I didn't.
>Scott_Pianowski: ABELQRV 15A VERA +37 392
#note Best.  I figured I was toast here. (Hec: With multiple spots for the Q, I can safely hoard it and get my cheap point-grab here.) 
>Pete: ADNNOUW B9 UNAW... +12 343
#note Duck liked WAND, this simmed 2nd.  I like putting pressure on Scott here, holding one of 2 N's.  Keep the board open for the miracle. (Hec: I loved this play. I thought Pete played the pre-endgame very well, and I said that as soon as the game ended. Of course, what do I know?) 
>Scott_Pianowski: BEGLQRT 9J Q. +22 414
>Pete: ADLNNOO K13 .N +2 345
#note My only reasonable play... may be my best of the tournament.  I simmed EVERY play, this came in at 25%, second PEN 3E came in at 6%.  I was fishing for the unseen G or R, and hoping Scott wouldn't block the sevens.  Turns out if I catch the R, I had two playable, but I wouldn't have found MOORLAND anyhow. (Hec: Again, kudos.) 
>Scott_Pianowski: ABEGLRT L1 BETA +24 438
#note Scott misses the cool AG(GREIVED) extension. (Hec: I figured I could outrun pretty much anything, plus I played BETA immediately, to put Pete, into his final minute, on the clock.) 
>Pete: ADLNOOO A7 DONA +19 364
#note I miss the easy ONLOAD.
>Scott_Pianowski: GLR 1G R.G +15 453
>Pete: LOO B5 LOO +8 372
#note Great job, Scott.  I'm in awe. (Hec: Yeah, that Hodges hat sure worked wonders for me. Oh, and do not put things on the piano. Thank you. Good game, amigo.) 
>Pete:  (L) +2 374
