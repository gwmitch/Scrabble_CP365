>Joshua_Sokol: DEINTUV J5 UNVIED +23 23
#note Welp, that's the last time I miss INDEVOUT. Looked for a while, and decided to phony
>Michael_Fagen: AEKNRSS K9 SANK +21 33
#note RANKNESS. YONIS as well
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEILNT G1 BINATEL. +65 88
#note missed the V! Played BINATEL(Y) instead of TAILBONE because I knew he had an S, and didn't want his bingo to open the now pretty dead left side. I also thought his bingo-prone leave was less likely than average to hit the B, but maybe I am underestimating the risk. BI(V)ALENT though for sure
>Michael_Fagen: ENOQRSW 1G .ROWN +30 63
#note H1 ENOW is better than Q(I) or (B)ROWN, although BROWN is a strong play as well. QI is better for the bingo potential though
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEEHRZ 2B wHEEZ.ER +132 220
#note Only bingo.

>Michael_Fagen: AEEOORS 12J O.E +14 105
#note probably L12 AERO here?
>Joshua_Sokol: AALLMTT 3C ATMA. +41 296
#note correctly passed up ALLANT*. That isn't a word, and it would probably have gotten challenged. Michael had held all of my plays before GIF, and also held this.
>Michael_Fagen: AAEORSU 5E AU.O +8 113
>Joshua_Sokol: EGILLOT L6 GILT +9 305
#note trying to do something about this board. GEOI(DA)L is better, missed that.
>Michael_Fagen: AEIJRSU 4G .JI +35 148
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILOP 6E EP.E +34 339
#note half hoping he misses T(EPEE) so that I can keep control of this board.
>Michael_Fagen: AAERSUW 4B AWA +27 175
>Joshua_Sokol: ACGILLO 1A LAC +28 367
#note obviously ALOGICAL is a word. Ugh, I didn't know that! Maybe I have seen ALOGICAL before. Should have tried it... Who knows! I saw it as a possibility, but judged it as 95% getting challenged off.
>Michael_Fagen: BEFRSUY I11 BY +18 193
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGILOO 13D GOOLIEs +69 436
#note Trying to prevent him from bingo-ing still, although it will hard to block everything after this. After OLOGIEs for 73, I can do a good job next turn if he doesn't open anything else, and even then. But SE_____ bingos are very unlikely. I think I like this.
>Michael_Fagen: EEFRSTU 14E EF +28 221
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEINVX M10 INDEX +39 475
#note Shoot! I missed VIDE(OE)D! I like that play a lot. Played this over DEX because if he overlaps DEX I can't really block his S hook, especially if he makes XU. Didn't like giving him the free lane, but at this point if he is leaving well he can bingo with DUSTIER or something at C15. Which is why VIDEOED is so good with the rack inference!
>Michael_Fagen: EHRSTUU N13 HUT +35 256
>Joshua_Sokol: CDORSTV 15A CORDS +33 508
#note I didn't like TORCS for the lane it gave but I guess it's really tough to hit anyway, but I didn't want to allow Michael to fish one off.
>Michael_Fagen: ERRRSTU 8L .URE +12 268
#note He saw that I could have ADOPTIV(E) here and went full tilt
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIOPTV O1 ADOPTIV. +101 609
#note Although it took me a minute to realize that I had it...
