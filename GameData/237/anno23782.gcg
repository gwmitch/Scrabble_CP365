#note Crud, didn't spot my X setup with 7H TAU. I didn't like the aggression of most of the other options, which is funny considering my play two turns later.

#note Completely whiffed on TIX to avoid the insanely dangerous setup. I figured at least I had an I and a lot of As were out already.

#note Thought a bit between FUMY and ARGUFY. I saw he might have FRANKERS and PREFRANK after FUMY and got a little worried, but I totally missed the possibility of SPEAK at 2F for 50+, which FUMY blocks. CP says ARGUFY wins 75% and FUMY not quite 90%.

#note And finally, to top off this complete horror show, I miss RENO to go out to win. The new words just aren't quite as natural as the old. Fortunately I have a month to fix that (and all the other problems showcased in this game) as best I can.
