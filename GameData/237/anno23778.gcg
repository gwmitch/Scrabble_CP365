#note I briefly conisdered AQUA, but intution told me had the Z on his rack so I played QUIN.

>Tasha: AACNNRS 15A ANS +23 300
>Tasha: AACNNRS --  -23 277
#note #4.  The very first play I considered was CANCAN, but I felt that I needed to address the set up on column 15 especially since I read Jonathan as having the Z.  So I thought of ANSA.  But why play ANSA if ANS* is good?
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEEERZ 14B B.EEZE +74 276
#note See, I knew he had the Z.  Jonathan said he thought of playing BREEZER* but thought better of it.

>Tasha: ADGILNS 8K GADS +20 330
#note What's the point of fishing on this board and with this score?  Jonathan has the X and so I definitely shouldn't be leaving column O open.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ALX O4 LAX +25 329
#note See I knew he had the X.
>Tasha: EFILNRV 3M R.F +26 356
#note I didn't write my racks down for this turn or any of the following turns.  This is pretty close to what I had.  
>Jonathan_Lindh: LOS 15A LOS +27 356
#note I did look at this sideways, but as you may have observed, I'm not exactly the best authority on threes.  
>Tasha: IKLNTUV 3G K.LN +25 381
#note Again, I didn't write my rack down for this turn.  I know I had the V because I was trying to remember whether or not VILK* or VOLK was a new word.  I also considered playing 9J IT too.  
>Jonathan_Lindh: GIW 12A WI.G +24 380
>Tasha: AEINTUV 9I .UITE +24 405
#note Definitely my rack.  I remember having an unplayable VAUNTIE.
