#note I missed the i hook on PO, and thus the top play -WISE for 42.

#note better to pay ADZ or ADZE in row 7. UH at 13b is an option for an offensive gambit, but I don't care for it given Miki's last fishing play.

#note bingos in the O column, like coiners, score an extra point. This also sets up a mammoth hot spot for the X, which is probably a bad idea here.
>Miki: AEGNRS O8 RANGES +38 233
>Steve: BDEEJWY I5 JEW +28 262
#note i put too much value on holding onto the 11th E. CP likes L1 DWEEB, then k3 JEWED.
>Miki: DLOU L2 LOUD +19 252
#note Bold play. I like the aggressiveness.

#note MUDRA for 34

>Steve: AAIIRTT 6E TI +7 325
#note AIL, 2j gives about a 1 in 4 chance of winning, my play about 1 in 6, according to Q analysis. A sim further tilts the numbers to AIL, 30 percent wc to 16.
