#note It's backstory time!  If I were to be completely honest, I thought I blew the chance at doing well in this tourney on day 2.  I knew I was in 5th place at that point, but I also knew I only won 4 games.  I'm painfully aware of my track record and I thought I will do what I usually do and win only two games and end up in 12th place or something.  It LITERALLY wasn't until after I played Ben for the third time - after round 21 - that I realized I could cash.   I was absentmindedly looking at the (not current) standings and it very slowly dawned on me that I could be in third place.  Me: Wait, I think I'm in third place!  Ben:  You ARE in third place.  Then Steve Glass further explained to me that I will be playing Matt for third in the last round and I had to win that game if I were to cash because of my low spread.  So there you have it, folks!  Wait, wait, wait...one more thing.  If I'm going to miss a bingo, I should play PIU!
