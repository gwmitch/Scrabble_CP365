#note saw GAUCHE, YUGA... didn't see CAGEY, GUY. CEE is nice cause of the H setup, but it doesn't help close the board, and sets up an S hook after an ALA play. I like what ECHOEY does for the board a lot. GAUCHE is the equity play but didn't like what it did. at least CEE has scoring potential. apparently I score about as much after GAUCHE as I do CEE. a problem here is the C in croaks, which is nice for closing the left except it lends itself to bingoes, opening the bottom.

#note belie is a better version of this play.. maybe should just play end or something, or exchange. no reason to let her open.

#note considered ThONGIe(R), TOk(E)NInG (both spots - 70 and 71) and then GOT, GO, TO, (T)O. Between the bingoes, I think THONGIER is probably best, because the main problem with bingoing is being outrun with plays like WADI, rather than other words. the left TOKENING can restrict d1 plays, but I think those give back some options. I don't see why THONGIER isn't the best bingo. Out of the plays, my goal is to force Q to empty the bag and bingo out. A secondary goal is to score enough that a one tile play by quackle, then my bingo could outrun by enough in the endgame. Between GO and TO, I think it's fairly clear that TO is better - it provides a better lane from the T, which is the best lane for outrunning a one tile play by quackle. down 45, a play like OFAY puts me down 55 - an 80 point bingo gives me a 25 point lead with one tile. even a play like WADI might not outrun me, assuming I can go out (which I imagine I always can). it also leaves the R as another lane to outrun. TO seems the better choice based on the G lane, and ING?? isn't too bad for hitting the R, even if INT?? is a bit stronger. TO vs (T)O, I don't see why I would play (T)O over TO, because it allows opp. to play off two tiles, and better outscore me. (T)O may be better equipped for high point draws cause they can then start bingoes, but I think TO is still better to force them to play one tile (I assume I bingo often enough that if they play long I bingo a lot). TO vs. GOT - the nice part of GOT is that if I bingo, I pretty much always win. The worry with a play like TO is that quackle could play (T)I or (T)A or (T)O... seems like something quackle could actually find, and makes outrunning harder. (G)O or (G)I is a lot less worrisome because I just have to bingo out to the R, through the T or T, or some other random place. (9s I guess). It's hard for me to quantify the difference, but I felt my bingo chances after GOT were high enough to give me a sure win more often than TO outruns potential plays. Against a bad human, TO might work a bit better, but I would take GOT against the duck. then finally THONGIER vs. GOT. I felt GOT bingoes often enough, and THONGIER gets outrun a fair bit. e.g. up 21 after thongier, if I don't draw an out, a play like WADI I feel beats me quite often. Other plays to consider are GIT and TON - the former saving the O for OFAY, the latter saving the GIn potential. My inclination definitely says GIT > TON, because the O offers more versatility than InG, which is good except when InG doesn't play, then GI is a hindrance. Comparing GIT vs. GOT, I am not good at estimating this bingo % - my estimation is that GIT is better, because ??o is almost as versatile as ??i, even if IN has a bit more synergy for hitting the R and stuff... offering the extra lane to make ofay makes it harder to stop a bingo. I would ultimately take GIT.
