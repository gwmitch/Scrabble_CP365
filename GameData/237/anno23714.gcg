>Matt_Canik: CINSTTU H7 CUNT +12 12
#note I played this in large part because the opening play on the next turn was also CUNT. 
>Mike_Baker: ALRW 7H .RAWL +11 11

#note OMG MISWROTE god I suck

>Mike_Baker: EEFR 12I FERE +25 64
>Matt_Canik: ABEGPTU 13J GETUP +27 183
#note GETUP  forks the board for Mike which is about the last thing I want to do at this point, but GETUP was just so much higher in equity that I chose to do it. 
I think in other circumstances I would (and should) play UPBEAT or BAGUET along the 13 row, but after the last game where I choked on a huge lead by dinking and closing (and being horrible at scrabble) so I decide to play open here.

#note Nice setup

#note I'm going to pretend like I just missed the squares I was trying to set this on and tried to play this at 4K......
>Mike_Baker: AOTU 3C AUTO +13 250
>Matt_Canik: ?AEIMOV C6 MOVIE +18 304
#note Mike blocked my bingo in two different spots! I should play VIM here because it's so consonant heavy in the pool. JQXZ all unseen means I could be outrun after this
