>Matt_Canik: NOOQSTU H8 ONO +6 6
#note Seems okay to score a little and hold the Q to cash in big next turn. 
>Steve_Glass: ?AEIKPR 11B PARKIEs +77 77
#note Great start to the tournament!! Allowing a phoney go on turn 1.... I figured with many other options available he wouldn't roll the dice on this one. PARKY+ but it's an adjective, which means that I'll be missing PARKIEST a few times lol. 
>Matt_Canik: ALNQSTU C9 QU.NTA +50 56
#note And here we go again, setting myself up for failure. I've talked myself out of the validity of QUANTAL. 
>Steve_Glass: AEINOST I4 ATONIES +66 143
>Matt_Canik: ADHIJLS J2 JIHAD +50 106
>Steve_Glass: CDEO H1 COED +36 179
>Matt_Canik: DHILNSU 14B H.LID +26 132
#note Missing QUANTAL options like HILUS. LUD at K2 seems good too. Bleh.

#note I see AIMFUL at 14J before chickening out. I also learned FAMULI! Man, I'm bad.

#note Or perhaps NIFFY+?
>Steve_Glass: AEIRU 14J AUREI +20 375
>Matt_Canik: ELNRRTX 13K RENT +19 369
#note I think I'm dead. AUREI doesn't hold at least one E very often and the only ways I can really see to win are to hope he has consonant junk or hope ES is in the bag and he doesn't block MAQUIS/RELENTS after R(E)X.
