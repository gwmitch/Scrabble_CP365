#note Brace yourselves: this is probably one of the worst games of Scrabble in my entire life.

#note Had no idea what to do and still don't know in hindsight. This was not very good though. Maybe UKES N1? Or just let him bingo and play SAKI for 38? I think if I could do it again I'd play SAU N4. 
>Jeff_Martin: EIT O1 TI.E +27 69
>Matt_Canik: AEIRSSV K4 ..S +18 108
#note Another confusing turn here, but I don't think I messed this one up as badly. This fish seems strong on paper but unless he opens, I'm still in bad shape. VA(U)S seems better in hindsight?

#note Missed REVISAl/APOD/LID, but that's gotta be the play

>Matt_Canik: IILPSTT A5 .ILT +12 225
#note At this point I just have to control the left side and then knock out GALEA or GALES and then I win, right? So I'll just play this? Maybe I should play IT on top instead?

#note And now I'm confused again.... I oversaw (NU)T(T)Y for 16 which seems good, passed on STRIPY in two spots because I don't need to open the board, and this draws STRIPEY sometimes. I also knock out cheap plays like WAD at the top. Ugh I have no idea. GYR(U)S also looks good.

>Matt_Canik: ILNOOPS 13A POOL +15 274
#note I saw PLOSION and was like "that's not a word". He played this quickly and I thought he was holding an L for sure. This play is the worst
>Jeff_Martin: HI A13 .HI +24 252
>Matt_Canik: EINRRSU 11C ..UR +14 288
#note This is a bad turn. Two big considerations I didn't consider: YODH plays and the unseen Q that won't go anywhere. I just took the equity and ran with it here and that was so bad. I need to hold the S and U for SUQ plays if I draw the Q. Maybe I play REIN/YON and be prepared for the Q.

#note I'M LOSING NOW WTF
>Matt_Canik: AIMORRS B9 OI +11 315
#note At this point I decide that I'm going to block Q plays and stick him. If I take that plan, though, I need to play just one tile, not two...
Maybe I should play ARM/GALEA and hold IS for QIS/ARMS if I draw it, but idk? Maybe even (TILT)S and fish for ARMOIRE/GALEA?
