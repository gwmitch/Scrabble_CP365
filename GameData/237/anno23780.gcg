>Darrell: EGN 8G NEG +8 8
>Will: ACDEEUV 9C CUVEE +17 17
#note Torn between VAGUE and CUVEE over the board, but given NEG to open, I think the play has to be UVEA to best defend against bingos. It somehow escaped my consideration - bad.
>Darrell: EEGILNT C6 ELE.TING +74 82
>Will: ADDFHPR D5 PRAH. +27 44
#note OK, here is a play Quackle hates that I really don't mind. Most of the good equity plays seem unncessarily aggressive. Maybe I could do 6B FED to keep some semi-synergistic consonants and my vowel. Also I like PRAELECTING but didn't know it.
>Darrell: ANPT E4 PANT +26 108
>Will: DDEFLTZ B2 DELFT +28 72
>Darrell: CINOO I3 COOIN. +13 121
>Will: ?DKNRWZ 6H W.Z +35 107
#note WIZ or ZONK? Seemed really close. I bingo a bit more shedding the extra tile (about 5-7%) but with all 4 esses unseen a ZONKS play closing up the board further could be really bad news.
>Darrell: BGOY 4H B.OGY +28 149
>Will: ?DHIKNR A1 KID +30 137
#note I bingo slightly more with KIN than KID, actually - a bit likelier to hit the Y with DHR? than HNR? (a slew of HYDR- words). Still fine with KID.
>Darrell: OW C3 WO +26 175
>Will: ?EHNQRT 10F HERN +31 168
#note QI was tempting but I was getting back within range of not needing a bingo.

>Will: ?ANRSTT K8 TRAN.iTS +64 276
#note Well, I burned a ton of time here trying to work up the courage not to play TRANSITS, and just couldn't get there. My thinking was that if I open a volatile spot with TRANSITS, maybe I can get one of the two big spots between row 15 and the SQUAD hook on row 1. But with ST? in hand I'm a solid favorite to hit that spot myself and if I open a new lane with something like 13F RANT (Quackle-preferred) I'm bingoing 70 percent of the time.
>Darrell: LOU 15K .OUL +5 260
>Will: EEIJMRR 14M ME +16 292
#note Ugh. This might be a pretty big screwup, but it's tough to figure out. Some of the likely bad things that can happen after SOUL (AXELS/AXILS/other longer stuff like VEXILS) still go through after my play. If Darrell is playing SOUL because he has SS in hand, he can still hit the spot either with a bingo hooking MES+ or an -SS word (though I'd be happy to see one -SS word compared to an S coming out with SOULS and then the other with SQUAD next turn). It would be a little surprising if Darrell had played SOUL with heavy tiles in hand with the score so close, and I should have reasoned that it was a little less likely that I'd get crushed than usual. Not only that, I'm not saving myself *that* many points by blocking a play like IXIAS compared to something like SIX 1F after I block with ME. The problem with ME is that if he really isn't likely to have heavy tiles after SOUL, then maybe he has tiles that are likelier to bingo, and I've just given him a great place to put a 7 down. It doesn't block enough threats, leaves me with an inflexible leave, and only draws 2 tiles towards the valuable esses. I'm liking TIMER right now to block sevens ending in S, leave two consonants with all the vowels coming, and get 4 cracks at any esses left. Credit to Darrell for inducing a screwup and time pressure.
>Darrell: AEU L9 EAU +9 269
>Will: AEIIJRR 13M AE +17 309
#note The A lets me seal the spot off for good, and now I have next to no time left after the last two turns so I play AE fast.
