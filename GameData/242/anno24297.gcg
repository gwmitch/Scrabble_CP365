#note are JUVIE and UVEOUS suicidal? I didn't see uveous but I imagine it's better, we still have two bingo lanes and a trade isn't too bad (more likely he doesn't even bingo on the bottom). the kinda paranoid play I made too often in the tournament - he averages like 8 more in the sim after uveous, but still worth making the play. specifying S, uveous sims about 5 up.

#note IMARET here is good. I like AIM best. His range is slightly wide, ? or S both make sense, but even slightly less bingo prone things make sense. DIOST and stuff. I fucked up here by thinking REAIMED* didn't give back a bingo line, when in fact it does give a higher scoring one. AIM has gotta be right, even though Q likes IMARET. Also reaimed* is not a word. ugh.

#note and the worst part about REAIMED is that, given an even mediocre range for Mark (and really good stuff makes the most sense), I'm drawing 6 tiles into a very bad pool, whereas after AIM I'm drawing 3. No wins here, so I'm just hoping he mistracks or misses vizor.
