#note Quackle hates this. I must have an incorrect understanding of how good (or bad) the I is by itself. J4 BIPOD was my other choice and it fares much better in the simulation.
>Chris_Cree: AEIMRRS J2 MARRIES +74 86

>Chris_Cree: TW 7I W.T +19 105
>Charles_Reinke: ADEIIOZ I3 ZOA +47 153
#note Unclear why I didn't play AZO for two more.
>Chris_Cree: AALT D8 A.TAL +20 125
>Charles_Reinke: DEGIIIT 10H DIGIT +16 169
#note I think I have to play two I's here. K3 GET is somewhat tempting, both to score and to block any plays Chris might have near K5, but the IIID leave is just horrible.
>Chris_Cree: HIQTU 4A QUIT.H +54 179
>Charles_Reinke: EEEILNS C11 LEE +12 181
#note Took a long time here. Now I have to get rid of my E's because there's so many in the bag.
>Chris_Cree: INY 3I ..YIN +34 213
>Charles_Reinke: CEINSUX A1 CIN. +45 226
#note Cleverly bypassing CIN(Q)UE to keep the U for 3C XU. Quackle still likes CINQUE better.
>Chris_Cree: AJL L1 JA.L +38 251
>Charles_Reinke: EFNOSUX 1L .EUX +54 280
#note See how clever I am Quackle?????
>Chris_Cree: EF B2 FE. +24 275

>Chris_Cree: ?CEENRS M7 CENSERs +82 357
>Charles_Reinke: AAHNSTV 8L H.AT +33 336
#note V(E)NA, same spot. Playing the H instead of the V will tank my bingo chances.
>Chris_Cree: EIKNP 12H PINKE. +30 387
>Charles_Reinke: AAGNSVV J12 .AV +14 350
#note There are no scoring spots on the board, so I make one. Maybe I'll hit a miracle bingo or something.
>Chris_Cree: ADEERTY O5 YAT.ERED +64 451
#note Chris debated for a long time whether he should empty the bag by playing this.
>Charles_Reinke: ABGLNSV 15F VANGS +34 384
>Chris_Cree: EGIMOSU B11 GEMS +27 478
#note B10 UGSOME is nice.
