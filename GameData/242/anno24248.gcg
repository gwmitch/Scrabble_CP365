#note i had to talk myself out of playing SYNOVIAE* here. i wrote it down on my scoresheet and then kept looking at it later and being mad at myself. i was only like 20% on it though so there's no way i should ever play it.  also, i missed IVORY. need more practice anagramming, even though OVARY is close enough.

#note already a pretty tough situation. quackle likes G3 FEE, and it's worth the score, just don't like blocking that many lanes... but i really really really need to score. -9

#note that is a really lucky draw to EEIN

>cesar: ABCKLUW 4C W.CK +27 146
#note G6 WUD actually sims a tiny bit better. ABCKL is a leave with a lot of scoring potential.

#note this is phony. i have a funny story about this play, but the margin of this notebook is too small to contain it. the right play is the really nice G6 BEDAUB. -3

#note wow, i actually missed 8 bingos here!!!! SCUTELLa is the best one. i wasn't sure enough of CULLETs (or BREEDINGS for that matter). never seen dulcetly or luculent, there's also cloudlet and lucently. christ. i should have probably found CULTLIKE, too. i'm pretty sure i was running low on time since i'm the slowest player ever, and after a little bit of time just decided to play CULLY and try again.

there is a bingo, though, that i did see, and i'm going to be mad at conrad for this one. TELLURIC through the C plays, but a few years ago he played TELLURID* on me and i challenged it off pretty quickly because I knew it was only TELLURIC. but then, thinking about it, i couldn't remember anymore whether i challenged TELLURIC or TELLURID*, and then I remembered that TELLURIDE was a word, so if TELLURIDE is good, why wouldn't TELLURID* be good? this is all your fault Conrad. -21

#note one of the best karmic indications that i've missed something is drawing badly right after it. at this point, i knew that i must have missed at least one bingo.

>cesar: DDGHIOO J9 OH +28 398
#note misplayed this pre-endgame pretty badly apparently. i should go through all the possibilities here, but J9 OH loses 3 out of 8, and 12E DOTH apparently wins all games. i was definitely low on time, but, boo. he has HOMIE at B5 many times.
