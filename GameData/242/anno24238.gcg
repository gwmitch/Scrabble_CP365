>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEIRSW H6 SEmIRAW +76 76
#note This was by far the worst game I played all tournament, especially given how I drew compared to my opponent. Well, that's if you leave out that game vs. Orry. Wasn't sure what to take here, so I decided to leave the board open but hookless, and see where to go from there. WEARISH, WASPIER also make sense here. This is the weirdest bingo I could probably play, though, so there's that (what makes this weird is that it's vertical).
>Clay_Daniel: FOU G11 FOU +17 17
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGGRUW 14B WAGGER +33 109
#note Probably G7 WAG, but I wanted to make easy decisions all game. I didn't want to have to think much. This allows most of the plays I make to be pretty obvious a lot of the time, since the board will now be virtually impossible to close. So not as many board dynamics to think about. This is the start of a truly remarkable performance on my part.
>Clay_Daniel: EEIINPR 6A PINERIE. +64 81
#note Remarkably bad, that is. Obviously the reasonable play last turn would have blocked this
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEIKLU A6 .UKE +30 139
#note Had to think about this one, unfortunately. Missed 5B KIBE, and KEL(P)IE. Whatever, equity
>Clay_Daniel: DEX 15A DEX +47 128
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEILOO 13A BEL +36 175
#note OVERBOIL and BLOOMIER play, missed both of them. Absolutely horrendous. Although I knew this probably wasn't much worse than a bingo, I spent far too much time looking for something and missing it. It would have been easier to just bingo here anyway and autopilot the rest of the game.
>Clay_Daniel: ABDELLR F3 BRA.LLED +65 193
#note Second clear mistake on my end, second time paying for it.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACIOOQ 5B QI +24 199
>Clay_Daniel: ACGV C2 CAV..G +28 221
#note QI wasn't a mistake, but since I made two mistakes earlier, Clay gets to make a nice tile dump at my expense.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACOOTY 10A YO +21 220
#note WAGGERY is a word, and I think I knew that. Huge blunder, since that at least gets rid of the S hook on FOUR. And scores 9 more points.
>Clay_Daniel: DM F13 M.D +10 231
#note But Clay can't catch a break, so decides he should block the S. Smart, since he must have known that I was going to bag him.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AACOST 2A CO.A +16 236
#note 2 more blank bingo misses here. I did not know MARCATOS, but I did know CROSTATA. Huge blunder number 4, and each time it got worse.
>Clay_Daniel: HILOT 1D THIOL +30 261
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AENSTU 8H .ENSTrUA +71 307
#note I'm just going to bag you for the rest of the game, so I can make the most board-opening play ever and be fine.
>Clay_Daniel: EHO A1 E.HO +30 291
#note This whole game, I've been assuming that I'll draw my way out of trouble. Just wait until I have one bad draw.
>Joshua_Sokol: AJNNNOO O3 ANNON. +7 314
#note And after one bad draw, I proceed to make probably my worst play of the game. ANNONA for 7. I was obviously setting my J up, but I need an E, a P, an NT or an OST to cash my setup. I played this very instinctively, realizing that I could have played something that set it up better, such as K4 NOON(S). I actually keep thinking ANONS* is valid, and if I had thought longer I might have played that. Don't know whether Clay would have challenged. He would have had to hold immediately, and he probably would not have realized until I drew that ANONS* might be phony. But it would have blocked his bingo, so there's that. Anyways, the best J setup, which I completely missed, is 11G (FA)NON. 
>Clay_Daniel: EFIORTU K1 OUTFIRE. +72 363
#note I'm very lucky Clay did not play FOU(S)TIER in the same spot, or REOUTFIT, or OUTFIRE at 2H. Otherwise I would have been completely sunk.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIJOSZ 3I ZI.IS +48 362
#note It looks grim, but there are almost no vowels left, so I'm not in terrible shape here. Which is ridiculous
>Clay_Daniel: MT 2J M.T +23 386
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIJOV N6 JE. +53 415
#note All of Clay's turn I was trying to convince myself that there had to be a vowel out there and that he was going to find a way to win. But I retracked again and again while Clay was agonizing, and alas, there were no vowels. He was drawing completely dead. 
>Clay_Daniel: DNRSTTY 11G ..RTS +16 402
#note Hoping that I miss his big Y play and screw the game up, which was highly probable. Nice attempt to steal the game. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AAIOPV E9 PIA +17 432
#note I just needed to find a sure out in two here. 
>Clay_Daniel: DNTY G5 D.Y +24 426
>Joshua_Sokol: AOV D9 OVA +20 452
>Joshua_Sokol:  (NT) +4 456
#note And there you have it, folks. I'm not bending the truth at all when I say that the universe was trying to win every single game for me this year.
