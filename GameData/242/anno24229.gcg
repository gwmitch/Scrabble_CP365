>Will: AIILTWZ N10 ZITI +41 365
#note WIZ and ZITI both get me 39 points per turn on my next move despite WIZ bingoing 25% to ZITI's 5%...obviously that's ZA followups bumping it up along with saving 2D LAW. Take your pick here I suppose.

>Will: AAIKSTW 14M ASK +45 447
#note Very close to doing 2E AW preserving my big ASK play along with much better bingo chances. Still, 45 points.
>Richard: MUV F1 .VUM +17 300
>Will: AAFIQTW 6H Q. +11 458
#note The play I was looking for here was 9C IF, setting up a second place to dump QI while blocking columns C and D. Clever Quackle spots 2J CAW which sets up very big FAQIR plays with a blank or R draw.
>Richard: ?EEGHRT C1 .EGaTHER +74 374
#note HERITAGE and WEIGHTER still go down after IF.
>Will: AAFINTW D4 WAIF +40 498
#note Richard didn't get the D from the bag after REGATHER...I figured I mistracked until we squared the tiles and found it.
>Richard: DE 9F DE +13 387
#note Actual play was 12L HE
