#note This turn was a stumper. There are a lot of meh plays here. Many of Quackle's choices look quite bad to me. During the game, I thought of URAEMIC and UREMIC, but they keep exactly the wrong stuff for this board. EU isn't great, but mediocre scoring tiles felt even worse to me here. I didn't think of MU(L)EY F6, which seems right. ACI are okay bingo tiles, and MULEY doesn't weaken the board too much. 
>Rafi_Stern: AESTY L8 YEAST +38 139
>Noah: AEEEHKU 12C HAKEE. +39 89
#note Looked at (Y)EUK very briefly. It doesn't give back as much of a score for Rafi, but AEEH is weak for bingoing and YEUK doesn't score as much.
>Rafi_Stern: BFO 13B FOB +30 169
>Noah: CEEEEOU -EEEOU +0 89
#note Thought about playing through with CEE here. COULEE seems really bad since it closes down lanes. I really feel like I can't play it here, even though it sims 7 higher than exchange.
>Rafi_Stern: ABN 14A NAB +28 197
>Noah: ?CENRTT M4 CoRNETT +70 159
#note Thought about CoNTR(I)TE/CoRNETT(I) also. I thought CoRNETT(I) gave away too much equity. Wasn't sure if CoNTR(I)TE opened in a way that was good for me in the long term. Didn't see CENTR(I)sT. One of those plays might be better than mine. CoRNETT(I) doesn't give away as much equity as I thought -- Rafi's avg. score is increased afterward but mine is by a comparable amount. Given my deficit, I might do that with a do-over.
>Rafi_Stern: ANORSTU K2 SANTOUR +70 267
>Noah: ?ENOORS 15H .RONgOES +74 233
#note Rafi held on this for a bit. I didn't seriously consider ONO 15A, but it could be better. One problem with it is that Rafi will immediately start closing down at this score.
>Rafi_Stern: AW 14H .AW +29 296
>Noah: EGITTUV 15A UT +18 251
#note The options here are all weak. I wanted to leave the board about the same, which led me away from options on col N/O, VIG(O)U(R) or VIG 7C. UT seemed bad too, but leaving as many lanes as possible looked too important.
>Rafi_Stern: GP 13G P.G +28 324
>Noah: DEGIOTV 10B VOGIE +26 277
>Rafi_Stern: IIQU 4H QUI.I. +54 378
#note Held this. I was pretty sure of it, but it pretty much kills my chances.
>Noah: DEIOSTW 9C WO +25 302
>Rafi_Stern: AAEGP O10 AGAPE. +10 388
>Noah: DEEISTX M12 EX +20 322
>Rafi_Stern: DEL J3 L.ED +20 408
>Noah: DEINSTZ E5 ZIT. +26 348
#note I felt I still had a shot here, if I drew a 2D play...but SLIED is no good!
>Rafi_Stern: ADR F4 RAD +26 434
>Noah: DEHINNS 2D HINDNES. +74 422
>Noah: DEHINNS --  -74 348
#note Thinking HINDNESS could be new (though this unlikely), and thinking SLIED was good, I went for the win. Maybe better to just go for spread.
>Rafi_Stern: EIJORU J9 JU.O +15 449
#note Best by a landslide is SIEUR 2K!
>Noah: DEHINNS 2K .HINS +16 364
#note With little time left, couldn't figure out the best endgame. I saw that (S)HINE would stop Rafi from going out, but also saw that he could block my only out. It's still quite good though -- the second best play. The best play here is sweet: (S)I to set up a big H play! This is 10 worse.
