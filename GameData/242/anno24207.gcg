#note I came in needing to win this game to win Division 2.  The last time I was first in the divsion was going into game 6 where I lost to Mark by 315 points.
>David_Turissini: AEILNRT E2 RELATI.N +66 66
#note Quackle says D8 (C)LARINET is best.  But why setup a potential 3x3 for 8 points?  Likewise, F5 TER(M)INAL could give up 2x2s.  I'm happy with the my more defensive play.
>Mark_Fidler: EFGIJNW D3 WEN +23 53

#note I missed H8 (A)vOCADOS and didn't know 6D S(T)OcCADO.
>Mark_Fidler: AERTU D8 .URATE +18 71
>David_Turissini: ?HIRTUZ 13C H.RTZ +54 191
#note Quackle says C13 HUT for 32 less points.  Is the leave really that much better?

#note Tons of options here, and Quackle prefers a lot that end in S.  I would have thought this was better by not oepning a lane for plays starting with A.

#note I got very, very lucky this game.

#note Quackle says 13I SWI(N)GER for 3 less points.  Surely, the last S is more valuable than that, right?

#note O7  I(F)S  He challenged OSTRACODS which is good as is OSTRACODE, but it turns out OSTRACON does not take an S.
