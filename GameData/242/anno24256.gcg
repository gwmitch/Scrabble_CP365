#note I didn't like blocking all the lanes for eights but this was just too many points.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?BEMNOU 14D NElUMBO +72 169
>Charles_Reinke: DDENRRS 15G NE +20 127
#note In bad shape now. This is the only play I can make that blocks the TWS hotspot and it leaves me with a terrible leave, but I can't let Matthew score thirty points there and leave me down by more than a bingo.

#note Well that sucked.
>Charles_Reinke: IINSTWW 13J TWIN +16 205
#note Everything is bad here and I'm definitely going to lose this game, but I couldn't bring myself to exchange and risk not hitting the 250-point threshhold.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AGIIT 12K ATIGI +25 346
>Charles_Reinke: EEIOPSW C5 POW +33 238
#note I was so excited to see a high-scoring play that I put it down too quickly and forgot about (P)RETAX. If I'm going to make any kind of comeback, it starts with playing 5M OP to set up a bingo lane.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADIQ A2 QAID +29 375
>Charles_Reinke: EEIIRRS 15J SIRREE +24 262
#note Was going to play RERISE, realized I had SIRREE (which you have to concede is a cooler word), didn't re-evaluate the hook I was making. But it's both players' responsibilities to spot phony threes when they get played. It's only half my fault that it stayed on the board.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EGHRRRT F4 GRRR. +8 383
>Charles_Reinke: DDEIILO 14N DO +14 276
#note Somehow I missed Matthew's outs and made this dumb play thinking I would get another turn for 13G DE or something.
