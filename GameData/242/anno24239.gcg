#note I was hoping for a tough matchup when I went to look at the final pairings. I was not expecting to play the only player in the field that knows my game left to right. This was definitely a tough matchup! Too bad I couldn't play someone I don't go to club with.

>Joshua_Sokol: EINRRRT 11G TRIER +14 128
#note Was being safe here with over a bingo's lead. I considered being aggressive with B4 (E)RR, but surely he has a bingo here, and I should leave as little as possible up to chance.
>Jason_Li: EO F5 .OE +12 57
#note lol...
>Joshua_Sokol: CEHINOR H11 .HINO +36 164
#note My play worked out perfectly. My word knowledge, on the other hand... I did not remember CHORINE!!! Me oh my... 
>Jason_Li: EIILPST 10A SPILITE +69 126
#note Originally scored as 67.

#note Nice phony, I think Jason thought it was good. SACBUT is the real word in there. Maybe he didn't know... Unbelievable that I'm so far ahead this game...
>Joshua_Sokol: CEINRRU D7 CUR.IER +20 223
#note 12A (B)RUCIN is better, ER is just too good here compared to just N, despite there being good stuff to dig for.
>Jason_Li: ADVY C12 DAVY +29 194

#note At this point he should just 3x3 on me and have his way.
>Jason_Li: IQ G13 QI +44 238
>Joshua_Sokol: DGMNOST N2 G.NOM +26 340
#note Damn it, I forgot about MONGST! GENOMS is better than GENOM, as it really reduces his options going down the triple word. And DO(N)G is just all around safer, but MONGST is just by far the best play. 
>Jason_Li: ?EEEKPW O5 WEEK +42 280
#note When Jason told me what his leave was, I said "wait..."

He might have been able to pull off the win if he had known EKPWElE (102 points!!). But still, things looked very grim. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADSTTTV K2 T.ST +21 361
#note Struggled awhile here between playing TAVS for 37 and leaving the board very volatile but going up 97, and playing something else. I ultimately decided to partially block the lane on row 2 while retaining a vowel, which will help me out of sticky situations. I'm really just worried about him getting a good bingo and me being stuck with crap. Quackle thinks TAVS outruns just about everything, and is therefore worth it. I'm not sure, since Jason will know not to bingo immediately unless he has 90+ points. My play will leave him with 6 tiles on his rack for the endgame, and he basically needs to hope I have all consonants. Obviously a lot of people would go with TAV over TAVS but the S is quite useless here, and playing it also blocks the L column. Anyways, I think I like my choice. VAST L9 is another option, but every option but this one has the same setback of only leaving consonants on my rack.
>Jason_Li: AF F14 FA +27 307
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDIOTV 2F VITA +21 382
#note Between 3B ODD leaving VITA and 2F VITA leaving ODD, I thought VITA would be better, since the V is of no value to me besides for blocking a lane. The D's looked far more flexible in an endgame where Jason is playing a bingo. And between DADO and VITA, I worried about drawing GGY or something that wouldn't allow me to score in the endgame. I knew that I had VI(N) for 21 at worst, but it looked like A bingo from the O could outrun that. But that's true for any play here, it seems. I should have just played DADO. I was also just worried about a play like B2 O(DE), threatening a big bingo in two spots, but I outrun ONAGErS/(O)rEGANOS, and nothing else seems like it scores enough. I should have swallowed my fears, or just realized that I could possibly lose after VITA too. VITA+ODD just banked one more total point than DADO+VIN. I calculated 21+25=46, and 26+21=47-2=45 for my leftover T. Maybe that wasn't a smart calculation, since I am drawing some more tiles that I might be able to score elsewhere with, but I thought it made sense. Jason can outrun either, though, in theory.

I really need to think harder about my pre-endgames, and work harder to understand the intricacies they put forward.

#note Jason correctly determined he couldn't win, but that I might screw up the endgame if he bingo-ed now.
>Joshua_Sokol: DDGOOSY N9 DODGY +23 405
#note Jason corrected his score of SPILITE here, but it was too little, too late.
>Jason_Li: E 14F ...E +7 388
#note -1 to E(TRIER), which I realized I had donated to Jason a bit later on in the game. 

Most of all, I still need to put in the work and learn those flipping words.

Thanks for tuning in, see you all next year!
