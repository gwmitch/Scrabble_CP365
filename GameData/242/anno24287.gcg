>Marty_Fialkow: ACHMP H4 CHAMP +34 34
>Jackson_Smylie: AEGIIRR 5H .EGARI +20 20
#note considered CAGIER cause hegari can be better overlapped, but the 2 points is probably worth it. 
>Marty_Fialkow: AENY I7 YEAN +27 61
>Jackson_Smylie: AIMRTUW J8 WAUR +23 43
#note also considered atrium... there's a chance he ddoesn't know WAURS*. I don't mind either play
>Marty_Fialkow: DO 4K DO +13 74

>Marty_Fialkow: EK 6F KE. +17 91
>Jackson_Smylie: DEIMSSU 7F IM.. +27 97
#note close to playing WAURS here, but IMMY is still a nice play. a 6 from 8a doesn't bother me too much, DESSU can bingo.
>Marty_Fialkow: EINNORT 6J IN +13 104
>Jackson_Smylie: CDESSUU 8D CUD +17 114
#note I saw CUZ but not CUZES! feeling pretty paranoid after his IN play that CUZ will get hit with an -NCE word... doesn't happen too often. CUD is equally silly to set up an S hook that lets him fork the board! silly me! CUZES has gotta be right
>Marty_Fialkow: ??DEERR C2 REREsDa +72 176
>Marty_Fialkow: ??DEERR --  -72 104
#note this was unfortunate... he circled the bottom blank as the A and the top one as the S, so his rereads turned into not rereads. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ELRSSUV C2 SLURVES +79 193
>Marty_Fialkow: ??DEERR 2A RE.eRvED +64 168
>Jackson_Smylie: ABELOQW A2 .OWABLE +48 241
#note missed ELBOW! ROWABLE sets up the GROWABLE spot, which is not ideal. a scoring spot that is easy to use and not a potential 53 points is good, but this one can propel him back into the game too easily.
>Marty_Fialkow: AINORT 1G RATION +32 200
>Jackson_Smylie: EEFQSTT 2J FE +28 269
#note FEZES is better. I could run into Q trouble but I have time. ONe nice thing is that often an I gets played at n2, giving me QI. the C at d8 is very hard to block here without opening, so I need to hope for a J or a 5 that doesn't hook.

#note very happy to save JUTTED for next turn.
