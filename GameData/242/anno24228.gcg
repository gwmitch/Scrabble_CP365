#note Quackle likes 12A VAIN. Doesn't look so great to me, but apparently it's solid defensively (opp. avg score) compared to NORIA...it's easy for Ted to dump heavy tiles from 15A after NORIA, but maybe not so easy to hit the V with anything good after VAIN. Still, I can't imagine ever doing VAIN. 2B AVION certainly bingos more - I could see doing that instead. I'm OK with NORIA.

#note I bingo not even 10% of the time after NORIA...pretty lucky.

#note Greedily leaving the board open with EMORSW (EMBOWERS/IMBOWERS/WEBWORMS down A, EARWORMS down B, GREWSOME down O)

#note Quackle prefers FAWNY. If he has ESCARPED he also has ESCAPED so there's no point blocking, and ERS goes out with everything easily. I see it.
