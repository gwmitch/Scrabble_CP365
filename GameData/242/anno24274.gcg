#note 6D EEEW is a bit better I guess. Or maybe leave the first E off to set up a (tough-to-use) hook.

#note Suddenly I'm in pretty bad shape thanks to my II draw. Quackle thinks DEI(C)E is best and this is horrible. I thought this might block some of Clay's plays on column A but it likely doesn't block enough for it to be worth playing. And it's only four points!

#note MONG*. I held for so long. Then I manufactured some memory about the A(MONG) hook and let it go. I HAVE to challenge here if I'm going to win this game. There's no reason not to. Except I convinced myself that MONG was good.

#note Luckily there was a lunch break here because I was mad at myself for making such bad mistakes in two straight games.
