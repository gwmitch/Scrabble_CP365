#note didn't know LAVALIERE. (N)OVENAE is the play here, missed it. considered WOE and ALINE mainly - didn't think AEINV was that great here (14% bingo chance, score a few more).

#note t(ab)ooe(d) here is cool, I like it. RETENE didn't inspire me very much, I didn't like my position a lot after it.

#note cadi doesn't necessarily hold a great bingo play, he could be cleaning up a vowelly rack here. JIN or JOIN are worth considering, though after that the S hook is really hard to block and the S is more likely than average after cadi... T(I)NTED is a cool play that I didn't see, setting up the J. Offers a couple bingo lanes but gets blocked very easily. the N column S hook is also open, so leaving another open wtih JIN only means a slightly greater score if it's hite. Jot doesn't accomplish anything.

>Jackson_Smylie: DEELMNT 9E L.M +15 177
#note maybe T(E)LEMEN or (E)LEMENT to open the right side... the S lane with razees is hard to block after that. I'm in a bad position here if he continues to block. 
>Ed_Saunders: OPU 8A UPO +24 242
>Jackson_Smylie: DDEEGNT 9A NEG +25 202
#note probably something like (E)DGE here, which I didn't consider. I have to start spending more time looking for a lot of plays, even if they don't seem like good ones. the lower edge makes the S hard to block, and keeps a nice DENT leave. GED/GLAM is okay (not with GI cause it makes blocking the bottom left too easy)... I just need to keep things open. if he plays to block after NEG I'm dead. this is a poor effort.
>Ed_Saunders: IQ E11 QI +44 286
>Jackson_Smylie: BDDENOT D12 BOND +26 228
#note really giving up here, this is bad. UNBONDED I should at least see, and D(E)BONED should consider. Gotta open before he closes. Bond accomplishes nothing.

>Jackson_Smylie: DDEERTT 13G D.. +13 241
#note exerted is the play I didn't see. TED(D)ED is cool cause it makes the S pretty hard to block. dex once again is terrible.

#note one of the craziest examples of "I should not have won this game". played really badly and uncreatively, didn't control the board.
