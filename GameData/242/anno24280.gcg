#note Somehow missing MIGRAIN(E). Evidently I am having trouble recognizing anagram pairs since I easily saw IMAGIN(E)R.

#note Scored as 42.
>Charles_Reinke: AEFMOQT 4A FA.TOM +30 149
#note This is an out-of-character play for me since I will usually dump the Q if given a reasonable chance (in this case, B3 QAT). 2B F(A)ME is best.
>Morris_Greenberg: DEINSTY 5E DESTINY +104 261
>Charles_Reinke: EFIPQRS 4I QI +24 173
#note 7H F(A)QIR is quite a bit better I think. Quackle is consolingly telling me that it's only a small error.

#note FES would be better but I really didn't want to telegraph my S at this point.
>Morris_Greenberg: ABEU 3J BEAU +17 329
#note Morris had the X here. Here I noticed that the E's were almost gone; not good for my bing hopes.

#note Final: 486-425. Conclusion after analyzing 31 games: still have major word knowledge holes and strategic oversights. Happily, most Scrabble players have generally the same issues as I do! Unhappily, there are quite a few players who are able to stay consistent over 31 games in a way that I'm not quite able to replicate.
