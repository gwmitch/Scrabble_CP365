>Charles_Reinke: AEGIOTZ H6 AZO +24 24
#note AZOTE sims a little higher. If I want to encourage an open board (which I always do) then I should play that instead of this.
>Craig_Rowland: ATX I6 TAX +34 34
>Charles_Reinke: DDEFGIT G8 FIDGET +26 50
#note FIDGED, same spot.
>Craig_Rowland: EEFLNTU 13B UNFET.LE +74 108
>Craig_Rowland: EEFLNTU --  -74 34
>Charles_Reinke: ?CDHNOS H12 HODS +47 97
#note I missed H(E)DONiCS, but for the millionth time this tournament, passing up the bingo-which-I-didn't-see sims best, so I guess I'm just lucky that way?
>Craig_Rowland: EEFLNTU 10B FLUTE. +20 54
>Charles_Reinke: ?ACELNP 15A ENCLAsP. +86 183
#note I saw SPANCELS but didn't realize it doubled the C when started at 15H? I also definitely saw E4 PLaCEN(T)A but must have thought taking out the S in the triple lane was more important.
>Craig_Rowland: AJOT G3 JATO +22 76
>Charles_Reinke: EEIINOQ D9 Q.OIN +28 211
#note Considered EQ(U)INE, but I don't need to set up easy lanes like that.
>Craig_Rowland: AY J5 AY +28 104
>Charles_Reinke: ?CDEEII E8 CI.E +27 238
#note I was halfway to my best play...E5 ElICITED for 108! I saw the other two bingos (4I EDIfICE, 14H (D)EICIDEs) but didn't want to open up 3x3s after Craig made a somewhat fishy play. Terrible miss and it snowballs.
>Craig_Rowland: AIV K3 VIA +16 120
>Charles_Reinke: ?DEEISU 13B DU.E +10 248
#note I was obsessed with dumping both my U and an E, but didn't like (J)EU. H4 DI(AZO) is nice. 
>Craig_Rowland: AEKLNST L5 LANKEST +69 189
>Charles_Reinke: ?EIIORS -  +0 248
#note Somehow I thought it was only ANKLETS in this rack? LANKEST is even a common word. So dumb. I should just play my bingo and take my win.
>Craig_Rowland: EOR 8L .ORE +24 213
>Charles_Reinke: ?EIIORS 14H .ERISIOn +70 318
#note bOISERI(E)...

#note Blanking on B(LANKEST)! 
>Craig_Rowland: AR 3G .AR +13 238
>Charles_Reinke: DEHIITY N6 YI.TH +27 367
#note I don't think I saw the Y hook on FOX.
