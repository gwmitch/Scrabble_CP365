#note N(I)gHTJAR is an awesome word that I missed, but I probably would not play it. JANTY is like 10-15 worse without that krazy volatility
>Jeff_Cook: DEFIOST I2 FOISTED +69 69
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EHNRRY 4D HERRY.Ng +84 146
#note maybe erythron to go for the challenge, but herrying nicely closes cause no S hook. I thought I knew the hooks to this, but it's only w! HERRY takes csw, HERRIED takes sw, and HERRYING takes w!

#note AWFUL mistake here! I looked for like 3 minutes at the QAT spot and could only come up with MINOR... somehow missing MINI and the vastly superior IMINO. If I know SMOOT*, then MOO(T) is a better version of my play cause he plays smoot a lot. I hated setting up the S with minor, cause it's so hard to do anything about, so I should have just not played it.

>Jeff_Cook: CO 1A CO. +21 263
>Jackson_Smylie: AEGLNPU K10 AGUE +16 331
#note missed PELAU, which is definitely worth it to outrun. I like what ague does for the board a lot, but would play pelau if I saw it.
>Jeff_Cook: EIV 2K .IVE +20 283
#note nice

>Jackson_Smylie: ALLNPRU 1N NU +8 339
#note still playing pelau isn't too bad.
>Jeff_Cook: GV 12J G.V +14 297
>Jackson_Smylie: AAILLPR L6 LAP +13 352
#note I felt confident I could outrun bingoes from the C, so LAP made sense. I considered ALP for 2 fewer, cause very often he plays from the P, whereas if he had to play from the L, not as many words would go and they'd score fewer. not sure
>Jeff_Cook: ADEINOT B6 .ATENOID +63 360
>Jackson_Smylie: ABEILOR A12 BOIL +37 389
#note Q says this wins 57%. YAW and YEW score hugely. I could play BIRO to block it, but Q says that wins only 27%?
