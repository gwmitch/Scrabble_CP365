#note I like to close the board on Mike. He's scary on an open board. I think this play is therefore a bit better than AUTO or OUTA at J6. Although it will be tough to keep it closed. Really just trying to cut his scoring to a minimum.
>Mike_Frentz: ANOTUW -ANOTUW +0 26
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDEIOS 10J DADO +17 41
#note This was odd. I didn't want to fish, and didn't want to set up  a huge S spot. I thought there was validity in acting like my rack was less strong than it really was. And I didn't want to be super aggressive.

>Joshua_Sokol: EIKRRSS O9 RISKERS +103 144
#note DADO definitely worked out extremely well. Lucky!

#note Starting to worry about FRISKERS a bit. Would like to score, reduce the damage FRISKERS would do, while retaining a decent leave that can score or even bingo next turn. My S is just about useless unless I want to tempt fate and try to achieve my own bingo ASAP with 13M WY(E)
>Mike_Frentz: EW F6 WE +28 257
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILOUY 15B LOUIE +10 329
#note Do I blow the board open here? Go for points? Start trying to close lanes? I figured this allowed me to score next turn, and blocked a big lane that I no longer have to worry about. Quackle heavily favours N13 YO(M) here, which I considered, since it leaves me with at worst A(C)ULEI next turn. But I thought I could just score next turn anyway with a play there, and I wouldn't necessarily get another chance to block A8, which is the largest immediate threat to my lead, given Mike's last play. The F is still out there, but he does not have it. So I am also going for it.
>Mike_Frentz: EEE -EEE +0 257
>Joshua_Sokol: ADJUVVY 14A JAY +35 364
#note Missing C7 J(EH)AD, which is a decent alternative. Would probably play that on a do-over.
>Mike_Frentz: ?EINOTT A1 TEcTONI. +80 337
#note Perhaps Mike should be proactive in leaving his options open, and play STENOTIC, but since I can't do anything if I don't have the F, this seems fine.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDEUVV 4C VA. +16 380
#note This time I saw a play too late. C7 B(EH)AVE is leagues better than this! Ouch
>Mike_Frentz: FO 8N OF +60 397
#note yup, this would have been totally fine after BEHAVE, but now it really isn't.
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEEGUV 7J DEBUG +13 393
#note I think it's obvious that I have to make one of two plays here. G2 BUDGE, or 7J DEBUG. A play like 2A (E)VE seems good in theory, but Mike could just play short and win. But perhaps it's my best shot. Hard to analyze this position correctly, since the Q is out and I basically lose if I draw it. But Mike doesn't necessarily lose if he has it. Maybe this play was really bad. I definitely didn't have a good chance, but I lucked out so bad! I chose this over BUDGE to outrun the Q and not give back easy points.
>Mike_Frentz: AEGHLNQ G13 Q. +21 418
#note Mike is winning with most draws here. But he took a long time to figure that out, while I was down to almost no time. We determined that with my rack, the only way for him to win was to play QI very fast and hope I blow the endgame, which is likely what would have happened.
