>Marc_Booth: ?DNOPRT 8G POND +14 14
#note Why do something smart like start a game with a BINGO? PORTEND or PROTEND would be decent options were you to make such a play.
>Stephanie_Brown: AADENRU 7F RUDE +18 18
>Marc_Booth: ?AGORRT 9I GARROTe +69 83
#note 9B GRAnTOR or GyRATOR is much better defensively.
>Stephanie_Brown: AAEKNQW 8M NAW +34 52
>Marc_Booth: AEFHINP 10J HE +30 113
>Stephanie_Brown: AAEEKQT 11K TEAK +22 74
>Marc_Booth: AFGINPR 12L FRAG +38 151
#note Not sure why I elected for this over FRAP... oh, I know, because I still make lots of mistakes!
>Stephanie_Brown: ACEOQVX O12 .AVE +24 98
>Marc_Booth: IINNPTY M11 ..TY +14 165
#note I like PINNY or YIP (RUDE) better. I remember wanting to block the E in the last row, but shouldn't at the expense of rack balance and points. Silly.
>Stephanie_Brown: CEHOQTX N7 Q.. +12 110
>Marc_Booth: AIINNPV 14J VIN. +18 183
>Stephanie_Brown: CEHOTUX E5 TEC +18 128
#note E4 TOUCHE 30 is best.  Stephanie was trying to set up (TEC)H for the next play with TWS.
>Marc_Booth: AIILNPR D2 PLAIN +18 201
>Stephanie_Brown: EHIOTUX 3C I.EX +22 150
>Marc_Booth: AABIJRT 6B JA.. +27 228
>Stephanie_Brown: FHOSSTU 2B FO. +18 168
#note Stephanie had FHOTU and 2 unknown tiles.
>Marc_Booth: ABIORST C6 .IRBOATS +78 306
#note Only BINGO on the rack. Glad I found it.
>Stephanie_Brown: EHINSTU 8A HU.T +24 192
>Marc_Booth: BLMOOOZ 11B B.ZOOM +38 344
#note As Doug Lundquist pointed out to me, BAZOO is better in that it protects from an S hook play to the TWS.
>Stephanie_Brown: EILMNNS H11 SMILE +50 242
#note For example...
>Marc_Booth: EGLLOUU -LOGUEUL +0 344
#note With a sizeable lead and the bag holding a potential blank and 2 S tiles, I like this play. Furthermore, I noted there was only 1 A left and given the placement of the Z, that's a valuable tile. The best play per QUACKLE is 4F ULU for 13 with a terrible leave of EGLO. I like my play better. 
>Stephanie_Brown: DENNOSW 10F WO +30 272
>Marc_Booth: ACEIIIS D11 .A +26 370
#note Well, I got an S and the A, so not so bad. Unfortunately, the 3 I's weren't great. I don't like playing just the A off. Not sure why I didn't play ETA for 32 (QUACKLE likes that best as well).
>Stephanie_Brown: DEILNNS G13 LED +13 285
>Marc_Booth: CEIIIOS 14F C.. +11 381
#note 2F OI 15 is much better. Even 1A OI 11 is better. My play is terrible. 
>Stephanie_Brown: EEINNSU 4F UNI +13 298
>Marc_Booth: EIIILOS 1A OI +11 392
#note Lot of BINGO options. 
>Stephanie_Brown: EEGNRSY 3H GREENY +25 323
#note 3H GYRENES 83 is great, but given my draw would've still resulted in a loss. 
>Marc_Booth: ?DEIILS 5H DaILIES +69 461
#note Also DoILIES, DIlLIES, DISLIkE, SEDILIa.
>Marc_Booth:  (ESU) +6 467
