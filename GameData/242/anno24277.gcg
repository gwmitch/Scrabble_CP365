#note Quackle likes 10J YID a bit more. The Z isn't great on this board so I didn't see the point in holding onto it. 10J IODIZE is just crazy.

#note This ended up not working out for me, but I still think it's right. If I play 1A RE(T)URN to block the 3x3, but Sal bingos on row 15, then I'm not in great shape. This play usually withstands non triple-triples since there's only one-point tiles left in the bag.

>Charles_Reinke: NNORRSV L12 R.VS +20 434
#note The best I can do on row 1 is RO(T)S for 15. If Sal bingos on row 15 for 77, I lose by two. The only possible racks he could have that doesn't bingo there are AEENRST or AEEINRT. Meanwhile, he misses his triple-triple if he has AEEINRS, AEEIRST, or AEEINRT. I don't care if he plays S(T)EARINE or I(T)ERATES on row 1 because I'll have scored enough with R(E)VS to win anyway. If my draw had been slightly better and I was able to play one more tile off on row 1, then this would have been a win.

#note Tough loss, but at least I didn't screw up the endgame like I usually do in "tough losses".
