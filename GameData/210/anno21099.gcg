#note Felt right to be really aggro with my own S here even though I knew she had her own. ISM is very threatening for the rest of the game. So a bingo with an S in 4th position seemed about as dangerous. Much more likely I'll get to score with my own setup. M2 ZIN was my other choice, but DISW seemed pretty bad.

#note Would anyone have seen the disconnected 10? Holy! 14I TREASON is 83
>Joshua_Sokol: DFGIOQS K3 GIF +29 242
#note Now I had the last S! That made me switch from playing O10 QIS to this. I need to keep my S for something even better, and hope to be able to dump my Q somewhere soon. Otherwise I am at the mercy of the blanks left to be drawn.
>Ella_Sobel: EEIIII -IIIIEE +0 182
>Joshua_Sokol: BFGOQSV 14J VOGS +31 273
#note Gotta play the S now though. No more S hooks on the board now except the crazy one at O12. I'm now sort of worried about 5s beginning in M and using the blank. Those are a lot of points.
>Ella_Sobel: O G6 O.. +3 185
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BDFKOQ 4G BODK.. +14 287
#note Couldn't think of a scenario where I was to play BODK(IN) this turn before she played, but I really like that word. She gave me a reason to play it!

#note blocking my Q spot ugh. I should play FID(O) here and hope for a U and make her look for eights.

#note 1E cABRETT(A) is the highest-scoring bingo, although it is wrong to play. What a cool word!

>Joshua_Sokol: ?CILNTU B2 T.LIC +30 378
#note Sometimes missing a bingo makes you make the right play instead. My average winning spread after LUNATIC is actually lower than that after T(E)LIC, simply because of the 1/8 chance I draw the V out of the bag!
