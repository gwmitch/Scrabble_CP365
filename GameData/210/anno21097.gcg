>Ella_Sobel: AGIO 8E AGIO +10 10
#note wrong placement probably
>Joshua_Sokol: BDDMNQT G7 Q. +21 21
#note so close between exchanging and this, I reckon. In these situations I just take the points, but I probably shouldn't.
>Ella_Sobel: EGIL E8 .GILE +12 22
>Joshua_Sokol: BDDEMNT D12 BEND +26 47
#note BENDED IS a word! Awesome. I also sort of missed that MEND(E)D also played for 26. 10B BED(I)M is much safer. This is a mistake.
>Ella_Sobel: ANW 15A WAN. +24 46
>Joshua_Sokol: DDMMOTT C11 TOM +23 70
#note This was so awkward. So awkward that I missed that DOM played where I played TOM. Three duplicates really messes with your head! MOM also plays! Oy!

>Ella_Sobel: IIII -IIII +0 94
>Joshua_Sokol: CDILSWY K9 .YIC +22 178
#note I lengthily considered dumping my S again here with something like YWIS. WILDS looks a bit better for that cause, but I felt like the S was pretty valuable in the future for this board. Maybe not. I assumed she probably didn't see A(CUTE). I also considered W(U)D for 14, but that seemed useless.
>Ella_Sobel: EEFHIRT 11A R.. +14 108
>Joshua_Sokol: ADLOSTW 1A DAW +28 206
#note I forgot to tack the T on. WAD is probably better cause of DAWK.
>Ella_Sobel: INORSTU L3 NITROUS +77 185
>Joshua_Sokol: DILLOST D1 STOLID +25 231
#note Yeah forget about that valuable S thing I said. I kept missing DAWT though, TOLD is probably better, slightly.
