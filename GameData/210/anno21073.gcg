#note I didn't think there were other options but I could just get rid of both of my esses with M2 DISSED, which seems OK, or just play 5E DID(O)ES which is both better for me since it leaves my prime S lane available and also since it doesn't give Deen plays like his next one. Mistake.

#note plays like JACAL make people make plays like this one.
>Joshua_Sokol: FIOOOST 6F FO.IO +18 164
#note So I know he can't hit me hard under BED. I decided that therefore my S was worth a lot, more than 13 points, and that I should play FOLIO over FOLIOS
>Deen_Hergott: AMU 11I AMU +24 125
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIORST 12H ARISTOs +78 242
#note And I just pry on people losing challenges to phony. Deen knew BEDU didn't take an S but losing a challenge and being on tilt forced him to forget that. 
>Deen_Hergott: EPY 1M YEP +31 156
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEENU M5 EAU. +12 254
#note This was an autopilot move. Not the right one. I think F6 (F)EUED is right, but 5B UNDEE is worth thinking about for a few seconds just because of how nice it is for ones own sake. I just wanted to keep DEEN on my rack.
>Deen_Hergott: INW 13M WIN +23 179
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEINST 13C ENDITES +76 330
#note 14H? Meh. I liked putting a consonant at D13 rather than the E cause the pool was conso heavy and more bingos play through that E anyway.
>Deen_Hergott: Q F12 Q. +11 190
>Joshua_Sokol: FGIIKMN D8 FINKI.G +38 368
#note or KNIFI(N)G. That encourages plays through the K that open bingo lanes though, but this time it actually would have blocked EVERYTHING Deen had...
>Deen_Hergott: ?AELNOR C2 LAdRONE +69 259
>Joshua_Sokol: HMOOPRU B3 POOH +37 405
#note Shoutout to Matthew Tunnicliffe for being the person whose strategy I emulated and also butchered throughout this tournament. POINTS POINTS POINTS AGGRESSIVENESS! B6 MORPHO is the play. I forgot about that word!
>Deen_Hergott: ERV A6 REV +24 283
#note Deen said he gave up here and kept like RRTT or something
>Joshua_Sokol: EEMRTTU 14J MUTER +36 441
#note It took me 8 minutes to figure out that there was actually no A in the pool, and that this play was safe enough for that reason. And Deen had to sit through me agonizing for no reason whatsoever. Sorry, Deen.
>Deen_Hergott: EGNNRRS D3 REGS +30 313
>Joshua_Sokol: EGTTTY 10B TE.TY +18 459
#note Apparently M1 (YA)G is a point better just because it blocks (YA)R and scores.
>Deen_Hergott: NNR L4 .RN +8 321
#note -1 to (YA)R
