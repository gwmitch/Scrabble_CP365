>Joshua_Sokol: CEEHLST G2 LETCHES +72 72
#note UGH takes an S, for future notice. Held and released
>Ryan_Chepita: ADFO H1 FADO +35 49
#note LETCHES takes an S, for future notice. A mistake for a mistake will leave the whole world blind.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABNRTTV 3C BRAV.. +24 96
#note Between VATT(ED) and BRAV(ED), seemed like BRAV(ED) gave back fewer points, and retained a better leave for bingos, but VATT(ED) could have led to a more controlled board. I wasn't sure about that last fact though, so I decided to take the points. BRAV(ED) actually gives Ryan back more points than VATT(ED), probably cause of where the R is. VATT(ED) therefore looks a tad better.
>Ryan_Chepita: AEKPR D1 PA.KER +30 79
>Joshua_Sokol: DINORTT 1A TOR.ID +27 123
#note TIN(P)OT looks good as well here. I preferred not keeping the I with so many out, and NT looked a tad better than NOT, so I decided that TOR(P)ID was a bit better than DRI(P)T or DRO(P)T.
>Ryan_Chepita: EIMR E3 .IMER +30 109
>Joshua_Sokol: INRTTVX -TVX +0 123
#note None of my options were all that appealing. I did not want to risk keeping VX here, but perhaps it's OK to play 1H (F)RITT and dig into the bag a bit for another vowel. Otherwise, the other route to take would be to keep the X and exchance the rest. Nothing else looks appealing in the slightest. Would anyone play (F)IXT?
>Ryan_Chepita: ILLMOOR 2B MO. +23 132
>Joshua_Sokol: IIINRTU 1H .RUIT +9 132
#note Now what? Do I exchange again keeping the same thing? I was really lost. I missed 5B UR(EM)I(C), which may be worth it. I was I guess hoping for FRUITING later, and also I just wanted to keep the board under some sort of control, blocking easy 7s forming SUGHS and eights with the F.
>Ryan_Chepita: AEZ J8 .AZE +36 168
>Joshua_Sokol: BEIINNT 10J .INEB +22 154
#note I hated EVERYTHING here. SSS?? out and my best equity play is (Z)INEB by far. Nothing else seemed to make any sense than to create another huge hook. I was hoping to bingo next turn, or at least draw one of SSS??, cause otherwise I'm toast after this play. Is there any way I can keep things controlled now though instead of blowing things open?
>Ryan_Chepita: OOY L1 .OYO +14 182
#note This seemed good for me.
>Joshua_Sokol: GIJLNNT 1H .....ING +36 190
#note This, though, might have been incorrect. I wanted to keep the J for scoring next turn, but maybe I have to play something like 11E JINGL(E). Issue is, he has a very wide range after (T)OYO, so I don't know what to leave open/what to block. This ended up being the correct play, I think.
>Ryan_Chepita: ?ACDERS O4 CRADlES +103 285
#note Cause I need a wide-open board after this.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIJLNTX K4 JINX +45 235
#note This was weird. I felt I needed to keep stuff open and score, but do I want to keep my J for next turn to score? My X? I need a bingo to come back from this large of a deficit, and LET seemed to be the best leave to keep here.
