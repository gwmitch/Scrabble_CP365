#note i can't tell why MELODY is so much better. Just the three points? You bingo slightly less often after COMELY but they look pretty similar in the sim.

#note getting out of what felt like a pretty mucky rack seemed like a good option here. Q likes ZOWEE for more score.

#note i think he's played this on me before. i coudn't be sure it wasn't new, so i held, but then took my points.

#note HAIR has a higher valuation and UTERI has a tiny bit higher win percent. i think when i see two plays that score about the same, i'm likely to try to hold on to higher point consonants.

#note this play made my brain freeze. i had no idea what to do. PLEA was the other thing i was considering, but it felt like i would lose more control of what was going on if i played it. ORLE L3 wins the sim.

#note okay - i have no idea how to read this sim result.

#note this was pretty poor on my part. i should've looked at more of the bingo possibilities. i saw uredinia and basically just hoped he wouldn't pull it. TAENIOID would've also been a possibility that I didn't block FA 7C leaves two ways to get rid of the Q and blocks the lanes. i got lucky.
