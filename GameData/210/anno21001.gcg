#note Spoiler alert: the -ITE extension to this doesn't get played, so don't get your hopes up.

Also, Snape kills Dumbledore on page 596.

#note I don't see how this is so much worse than plays at 6J. Another thing I don't see: bingos.

#note 3I BOCHE. If I saw 3J EPHEBI, I would have done that because I can't resist playing cool words.

#note 15G IMPOWERED is Quackle's choice, which is cute. But I don't want cute. I want bingo.

>Thomas_Reinke: ?BDEORS 3A .DSORBEr +72 294
#note N3 DOBBERS scores the most. I thought this might be one of the additions (it's not), because I'm already confusing old and new. Is this what Collins feels like?

#note This or 5D GOJIS. I wanted to have a chance to draw an out, but that's really unlikely at this point.
>Doug_Lundquist: DEISTTV K1 VEST +18 378
#note Lots of wins for Doug here. This is the best.
