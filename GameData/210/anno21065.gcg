#note Here is where I probably should have exchanged or made that S setup I had been thinking about making since I'm desperate. E8 LOB(E) looks good. N2 NOB also works for presetups. I took forever here and I just should have exchanged. I wanted to keep BAA open, but that's not good enough. Bad.

>Joshua_Sokol: BEGIS A8 SIG +33 379
#note But I didn't need to find GINCH. I needed to find M2 E(N)G! That wins by 2 if I play SIB instead. I only saw (V)EG and BE for 12, both equal.
