#note TAIKO, a new five, sims best. 

Not sure what I was doing not putting the O on the star. I guess I didn't think about the fact that the K has no front hooks! (-2.7)

#note ZAFTI(G) is flashy, but this is the play.

#note My play sims best! Usually I would open up, but not here. With this crappy board and down 17 before the play, opening up is asking for it.

#note Exchange 6....bailed out

#note 9I MAY(E)D is a nice option that I didn't see. My play still comes out way ahead, but this is still at least worth glancing at for a good moment, until you see that the X is out!

#note I did this to take out the the U line and keep rack balanced somewhat. 9C PODIA gives a lot of points back, despite making it harder to bingo. 

The 3 unseen O's made me a little less nervous about him bingoing. 11C is probably the right play here, though. 
>George_Asaka: LU 12B UL. +3 364
>Joey_Krafchick: DEINOOO G9 O. +3 447
#note I put the O here to make sure that he couldn't play SWEATED, because that's the only bingo possibility I saw. Of course, my genius self didn't slot it one space above for 8 more points accomplishing exactly what I need to! Jeez....Championship player agrees otherwise

#note AVOS 3F is best sequence. 
>Joey_Krafchick: DDOO K9 D.O +21 486
#note J1 (R)OD would prevent him from going out, which turns out being way worth it rather than my play scoring 21 this turn. Laziness.
