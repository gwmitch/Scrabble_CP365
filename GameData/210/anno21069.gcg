#note Was 1) scared about the board closing and 2) thought I was further behind than I really was, so I should probably play 14J FLEXE(S) or F2 FLEX. I was doing this to block scoring for Matthew cause he just scores too much. Bad.

#note Very interesting decision. Matthew missed the fact that I couldn't really hit the X spot he thought I was creating for myself. But he was hoping I couldn't bingo and he needed to score enough to win.
