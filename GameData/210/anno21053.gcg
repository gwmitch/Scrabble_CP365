#note I spent a while debating AVOW and AZON. Nine points is a lot to sacrifice, and I had doubts when the Z yielded nothing special next turn, but it looks like AVOW is the sim favourite

#note I saw ZENANA but blanked on ZANANA. It sets up my S, which is pretty big. Clear mistake

#note We talked about the new works before the game and Lloyd said he hadn't gotten too far studying. So I had a feeling TRIVIUMS+ was going to be a huge play at some point.

#note Tricky. I can't block everything and Lloyd will have at least one chance to open a new line. I decided to at least block the B and O, so that he may be forced to take a 64 pt bingo through the T and I can edge out a win in the endgame if he doesn't draw an out. Maybe I'm wrong. Quackle likes the outright block of G13 AH and the complete opposite play 8A HORA. Interesting
