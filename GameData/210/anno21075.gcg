>John_Stardom: EFLRY 8D FLYER +30 30
#note FERLY looks better, just slightly
>Joshua_Sokol: AALLPST 7G PALL +19 19
#note Here we go again. Didn't see PATELLA and chickened out of PLASTRAL

#note In the end, I chose the one that keeps stuff on the bottom half of the board, but the immediate stuff I give him doesn't seem worth it in the end. ECTASIS at K3 seems best here. I was hoping CISSATE* was invalid.
>John_Stardom: ?EEIORS 7C OE +8 67
#note he either has EIRS? or EIRST, the latter making the most sense, if it weren't for his draw.
>Joshua_Sokol: LMMRTUV 11J V.LUM +10 104
#note blocking 8s is all I can do here really. Not playing L4 VUM.
>John_Stardom: ?EIRSST B2 pRIESTS +69 136
#note vERISTS looks better, and perhaps N8 TRI(M)nESS. I guess he drew S? or just missed a few bingos last turn

>Joshua_Sokol: AAABEEJ M10 J.BA +26 242
#note this is an insanely bad play. Really really bad.

#note this is also really bad.

#note Knowing (R)E(R)ACK is key to winning games. Anything else usually loses. I had mistracked the H. It looked like I was in good shape cause the pool was crappy one-pointers from my perspective. I also considered playing off one tile to make things more difficult, but this seemed to score enough. Ugh!
>John_Stardom: EEENTUU 1E ETU.E +6 386
#note He played this almost instantly, and it's one of two winning plays. Beautiful.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEHNOV 13F HOVE +20 407
#note I saw (R)E(R)UN, completely missed his great outplay. He did it again, or, more like, I screwed up bigtime again. What a nailbiter.
