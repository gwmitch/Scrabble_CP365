>Joshua_Sokol: EHMOSTU H4 MOUTH +26 26
#note convinced myself MOUTHES* was invalid. Took a lot of willpower.
>Ella_Sobel: ACEEP I6 PEACE +25 25
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEOORS 11C ROADEOS +76 102
#note I keep missing this word. I only saw it cause I put down ROAD J5 and glanced at my leave.

#note Missed my Q play here. Not a big deal but yeah
>Ella_Sobel: BDE G3 BED +16 67
>Joshua_Sokol: IILOQTU 9B QI.IUT +20 142
#note After 10 years I finally get to play this word. It's probably the right play, too!
>Ella_Sobel: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 67
>Joshua_Sokol: ABLNORT H10 R.BATO +35 177
#note Phony. ROBATA is good and RABATO too. Should've remembered that. ROBALO is good though, and its leave is better than this play's. "Domorogato, Mr. Robato!" If you know what that is a reference to, you and I probably get along :)

>Joshua_Sokol: EINPSTZ M2 ZIN +42 230
#note Preferred ZIN over ZIT cause of how many N's were left, but obviously missed ZIT's new anagram. Ugh. Fishing the Z seemed pointless.

>Ella_Sobel: EGLOSUU F7 GL.E. +9 319
#note I only found one out in two for her, but there is another sneaky one with L10 GOES. The one I found, LOUS(Y)+(L)UGE, actually wasn't better than playing LU(C)E and then SOU, as I calculated as well.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGNV 13J G.VE. +18 431
#note I actually played TIL, not LIT, so this position is different. If I had played LIT, 14F N(IT)E provides a great setup for my VG.
>Ella_Sobel: OSUU 15C SOU +21 340
#note SOU is one more point with GIVENS!
