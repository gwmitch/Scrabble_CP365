#note Phil said he was sort of unfocused here. That explains this lapse. I was afraid this was a new stupid word, since Phil had been playing new words even when they were suboptimal just for the sake of playing new words and maybe drawing a challenge. But this just made no sense. Fun fact, I had a bingo against him in our first game to go out that I didn't know, and now he had this exact same bingo, among others!
>Joshua_Sokol: DDGGIIN I6 GID +21 43
#note I can't block him, but I doubt he'll see any of the 7s.

>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGINW 10D WEA.DING +67 110
#note Now that Phil has lost a challenge, I take the opportunity to phony. I thought it very unlikely he would even hold, and he didn't. Obviously the risks associated with this play kind of suck, the biggest one being giving Phil a premium double-double lane. Perhaps playing AWING would block more bingos and is therefore actually worth the points sacrifice.

#note ooh, K4 DiRTBA(G)S is 90.

>Joshua_Sokol: AIKMOPR 8A PARK. +45 187
#note I also considered C12 KOA, but I wanted points. Seems that worked for Tunnicliffe this tournament.
>Philip_Waldron: W 9K .W +5 116
>Joshua_Sokol: FGIMOOT C12 GOOF +33 220
#note I also saw F4 MOFO, but Phil being close to a bingo meant that keeping the M over the G was a good idea, since the M scores better and is more flexible than the G. The issue is that I'm leaving the X-bomb spot open, but if he doesn't hit his fish, I'm a huge favourite to draw the X.
>Philip_Waldron: EENORST M3 ESTRONE +75 191
>Joshua_Sokol: BEIMNTT D1 BITTEN +26 246
#note I was looking for a play that didn't open a 3x3 and other lanes, but didn't find B11 NETT, which is clearly an improvement, despite this blocking the X spot after I haven't drawn the X and after Phil has drawn 7
>Philip_Waldron: EELZ 1D .EZEL +48 239
#note But he was just as likely to draw the Z! Now it's a close game and that sucks
>Joshua_Sokol: CHMOOSU B13 MHO +46 292
#note Briefly considered POOCHUMS*, then realized I was confusing it with SMOOCHUM*, which is a Pokemon. This is what goes on in my head during a tournament Scrabble game. So many plays score massively well here, but this is my far the best of them.

>Joshua_Sokol: ACINOSU 2I ACINOUS +88 380
#note Ooh, a baby bingo of my own!
>Philip_Waldron: EJN B6 JE.N +27 302
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEILV O1 A.EA +15 395
#note I could go for 3A ELA(T)IVE over this, but I liked my chances with that S gone, even though I am not decreasing his chances of bingo-ing in the slightest.
>Philip_Waldron: DR 7L D.R +4 306
>Joshua_Sokol: EHILMVY O6 LEVY +35 430
#note I considered YLEM to set up my H but he has the last E so there's no chance that setup will yield anything decent.
>Philip_Waldron: EINORST 4F OESTRIN. +68 374
#note lol
>Joshua_Sokol: CHIIIMR J12 HIC +27 457
#note -2 to RIM at J12 and MIR at 3G. Close enough for this very tough endgame.
>Philip_Waldron: AAALUV 8K VA. +24 398
#note -2 himself to 2F AL, blocking MIR
