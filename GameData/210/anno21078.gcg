>Paul_Mulik: ACLNORU 8D CORNUAL +74 74
>Joey_Krafchick: AAEFNQU 7I FAENA +24 24
#note Quackle likes FA in same spot better...not sure why, to be honest. AENQU holds the E, but is that really worth that much? (-4.4)
>Paul_Mulik: AIJ 8M AJI +32 106
>Joey_Krafchick: EIOQUVX L3 VIXE. +30 54
#note I considered (C)OQUI...which Quackle likes best. I like scoring with X for 30 keeping the QU combo...(C)OQUI hurts board as well as keeps the V. (-6.2) I stand by my play
>Paul_Mulik: ADEESTY F5 EST.AYED +72 178
>Joey_Krafchick: DNOPQSU E2 QUOD +34 88
#note Time for the QU to go! PON(E) sims closely
>Paul_Mulik: EEEHNOW D6 UN.OLOR +18 196
>Paul_Mulik: EEEHNOW --  -18 178
>Joey_Krafchick: ?ILNPRS 12B SPaN.RIL +72 160
#note 3C SL(U)RPINg perhaps...I looked for a while here. This was the best I could find, slurping is only other option to consider since it doesn't put the S wide open for a homeless 7 that now can take an S
>Paul_Mulik: LNOOR 9K ORLON +21 199
>Joey_Krafchick: ?AEGIVY K5 AY. +35 195
>Paul_Mulik: ENOW 3J WO.EN +22 221
#note This was key, because I immediately remembered WOVENS from my hand-written word bible
>Joey_Krafchick: ?AEGIRV B5 VIRGAtE. +63 258
#note B10 VI(S)AGE leaving the blank sims best. Didn't even consider, to be honest. I was looking for bingoes the whole time, I need to remember to look for high scoring plays holding the blank, cmon now! (-8.9)
>Paul_Mulik: PUU C12 .UPU +16 237
>Joey_Krafchick: CDGORSW 15A DR.G +24 282
#note Quackle suggests not blocking the this spot...good one! CR(U)DO is worth considering, it's new...didn't see it
>Paul_Mulik: AEHT A6 HEAT +39 276
>Joey_Krafchick: BCEOSSW D4 BOW +28 310
#note E10 BO(N)CES is cute
>Paul_Mulik: EK N8 ..KE +25 301
>Joey_Krafchick: BCEFGSS 12K BEGS +30 340
#note With 5 I's out, this was a dream play. Blocks the last bingo lane pretty much, and I get 4 chances at drawing an I for FISC for a bunch.
