>Avery_Mojica: ?DEPRUY 8G DUPERY +32 32
#note Didn't see the bingos. This is the best non-bingo
>Nick_Purifoy: KNOO 7J NOOK +22 22
>Avery_Mojica: ?DEHHIS M3 SHEI. +24 56
#note Can you find the three bingos here? The middle-scoring one I thought of, but immediately dismissed it as crazy. SIDHE N7 is an improvement on this. Barely makes it onto the static
>Nick_Purifoy: GLORW 3H GROWL. +11 33
>Avery_Mojica: ?DEHIOO 2I OHO +34 90
#note Passing up the cheapie bingos - this actually sims second to 9D DHOOTIE
>Nick_Purifoy: ALOU G4 ALOU. +7 40
>Avery_Mojica: ?ADDEII 1K DIDIE +31 121
#note No spot for DIAMIDE which I saw, but 1C DAISIED fits, which I wasn't sure of. This is second best by a large margin
>Nick_Purifoy: ER K1 ...ER +18 58

>Nick_Purifoy: B I2 ..B +5 63
>Avery_Mojica: ?EGTTUV -GTUV +0 156
#note None of the choices seemed worthwhile. This actually sims moderately well, staying in the top 3. 6L GIVE wins the sim, but I don't like it.
>Nick_Purifoy: AESTX 1E TAXES +42 105

#note Can you find the best play here?
>Nick_Purifoy: AGQU 3B QUAG +34 139
>Avery_Mojica: ?AEMTVZ 9H MATE +22 189
#note I guess I got too excited by the overlaps - none of the other plays seem that great though. Quackle likes fishing off the V

>Nick_Purifoy: ABY 7A BAY +36 191
>Avery_Mojica: ??EOSTV 8A OS +30 255
#note Didn't know BEVOMITS, but since I had a comfortable lead, both blanks, and it was a club game, I wanted to go for a 9 - this actually doesn't sim that bad, but all the bingos worth  73 or more sim above it
>Nick_Purifoy: FG 6L F.G +20 211
>Avery_Mojica: ??ERTTV O1 .VERT +9 264
#note Championship player agrees
>Nick_Purifoy: CILP 10E CLIP +17 228
>Avery_Mojica: ??IIRST 4A TI +14 278
#note Still hopeful for a 9, passing up bingos through the C or at 11H.
>Nick_Purifoy: NNNV -NNNV +0 228
#note Actual exchange.
>Avery_Mojica: ??IILRS -I +0 278
#note I have inspiration, seeing as that 6 tiles will help me get a 9 that I see.
>Nick_Purifoy: DEEU E7 DEU.E +16 244

#note How do I know it? Joel Sherman vs. Matthew Tunnicliffe at Nationals 2013.
