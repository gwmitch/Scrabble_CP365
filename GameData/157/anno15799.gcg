>Kolton_K: EEHIMSU 8F HUI +12 12
#note My second Collins tournament. Q likes HUE quite a bit more than HUI, but I thought it would be a good omen to start the tournament with a # word.
>John_O: UUUVV -VVUUU +0 0
>Kolton_K: EEEMNST 7E MENTEES +71 83
#note Overlapping is slightly better than underlapping at 9E
>John_O: EHINZ 8K HIZEN +59 59
>Kolton_K: EEGLOOT K3 GOLO..E +22 105
#note Either this or (SH)OOGLE#
>John_O: ?AEIRST M2 SATiRI.E +86 145
#note Not going to be easy to beat a 2100 player when he draws SATIRE? haha... This or TRIStE(Z)A
>Kolton_K: AAEOTUY 6E OY +34 139
#note I had plenty of draws similar to AAOUY today. Q gives a slight edge to AY in the same spot. YA(O)U(R)T# is pretty cool.
>John_O: ADGRW J5 AW. +29 174
#note John said he couldn't pull the trigger on DARG# hooking GOLOSHED# and SATIRIZER
>Kolton_K: AAADETU J9 AUA +7 146
#note Q agrees with the play of AUA# but prefers the I3 placement
>John_O: ADEGIRR 11G GER.RDIA +70 244
>Kolton_K: ADEFNOT N10 F.NTOD +36 182
#note Surprisingly, this beats out H10 D(E)FEAT by a little bit on a 2-ply sim.
>John_O: EIJ 15L JE.I +60 304
>Kolton_K: AELOPQT 10F QAT +37 219
>John_O: CGIINT D1 CITING +31 335
>Kolton_K: ELLOOPR 1D .OLLOP +30 249
#note I saw LOOP at L1, but decided to take out the triple line. PRE(C)OOL is a dangerous option, but when you're down this much this early, it might be worth trying.
>John_O: EKX 12F KEX +44 379
#note This is worth 47 at C2
>Kolton_K: AEEFRTW 2H FEW +26 275
#note Q agrees with this. (TEX)TER# is another option.
>John_O: DPR 2B DR.P +18 397
>Kolton_K: AEENRST 13E EASTERN +82 357
#note I looked for a long time and only saw RES(I)NATE / TRA(I)NEES at 4A. Then bam. It hit me.
>John_O: BCMRU 14B CRUMB +53 450
#note Just won't let me catch up
>Kolton_K: IOOSUVY 5D .Y +26 383
#note Wasn't really sure what to do here. I was afraid of him bingoing still. Q says to do 5C O(N)Y and hope that the B and blank are in the bag for OBVIOUS.
>John_O: AABDINV N1 VINA +22 472
#note This was John's actual rack, meaning that I left the blank in the bag. Ouch. This blocks aVULSIO(N), eVULSIO(N), SOLUtIO(N) and VOLUtIO(N)... forcing me to find a bingo from the D or to the C or R
>Kolton_K: ILOOSUV 15F SOV +28 411
#note Had I drawn the blank, the only playable bingo would have been VOUSsOI(R), which I would not have thought of.
