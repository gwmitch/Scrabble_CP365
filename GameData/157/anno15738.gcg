>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGINU 10J U. +4 54

>Michael_Fagen: EINORST M2 NORITES +76 135
#note IRONST(ON)E is awesome.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGINZ L1 ZINE +54 108
>Michael_Fagen: BMOT M12 TOMB +22 157

#note cool.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AHIIRR 1C HAIRIeR +82 395
#note Too bad I couldn't have a 600 game with another 3x3.
>Michael_Fagen: ADD N5 DAD +17 254
