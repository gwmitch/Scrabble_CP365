#player1 Play Play
#player2 Along Along
>Play: HIIRRTX 8F THIR +14 14
#note Consultation game, TWL06, won't you play along? Considered XI or any placement of THIR. Nobody could come up with a clear winner here, so it seems safest to take XI or the most simple placement of THIR - hence this.
>Along: ?ADDEHT J6 HADDEsT +80 80
>Play: AIIQRWX K5 QI +27 41
>Along: ADLPRTU 10H PR.ADULT +63 143
>Play: AIJRTWX O6 TWIX. +45 86
>Along: EENNOOS L9 O.EON +12 155
>Play: AAGIJOR N5 JIAO +24 110
#note Seems to do little to the board, not give back much, keep a decent leave given the options. Not such a bright position.
>Along: EELLNSV H10 .ELVES +36 191
>Play: AFGORUY M12 FOGY +31 141
#note Nobody came up with M12 YOU, which has some potential merits, perhaps?
>Along: ABIILNO F4 LIBA.ION +68 259
>Play: AAAEGRU 15K GA.ER +30 171
#note 13E GUA(V)A may well be better - depends how dire you see the situation being. Tough call. On the bright side, there aren't many As left.
>Along: IILMNPY L3 PYIN +35 294
#note there's no play at 10E or 11E worth playing here to block the ES, although IMPLY was strongly considered by some. 
>Play: AAANRUU -AAUU +0 171
>Along: CFGILMT 14F CL.FT +18 312
#note G5 FIG(H)T would be worth it usually, but this is a nice chance to control the board.
>Play: AKMNORS 12A KORMAS +45 216
>Along: EEGIIMO M2 GIE +21 333
#note Not much in the way of options here.
>Play: ?NNOUWZ G1 UNWON +16 232
#note Compare to A12 (K)NOW. the Z setup from this play seems to make it a worthwhile endeavor. ZO(O)Ns, while scoring 66 seems out of the question.
>Along: BEEIMOU A12 .IBE +30 363
#note Seems to block the most 3x3s.
>Play: ?ANRSVZ E5 ZA +50 282
#note Seems like you have to assume that the U isn't staying open here, and take the points by playing the A, despite the 3x3 potential of playing off just the Z.
>Along: EEEMOUU H1 MU +26 389
>Play: ?ENRSTV 7M V.. +13 295
#note I have no idea why this was played, and wasn't watching for this turn. Seems pretty clear to play at B11 and go for the miracle outbingo - you'll never score enough to win after this play.
>Along: AAEEEOU C11 U.EA +8 397
>Play: ?CENRST 6D C.. +7 302
#note Fishing off the N goes for SpECTR(UM)S...not enough to win still though. This potential was noticed, but this play was made instead for some reason.
>Along: ADEEEOR 9C AER.E +13 410
#note DEAR(I)E/TEtR(I)/OE is two better.
>Play: ?ENRSST 7E p.ST +24 326
#note STERNS is 4 better.
