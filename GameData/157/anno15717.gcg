>Joshua_Sokol: BIIILST 3L BI +22 94
#note I should probably go with IBIS/WURZeLS here.
>Lou_Cornelis: ?FILNNS 8F FL.NSINg +60 142
#note Not bingoing is also pretty strong, something like 10E FINS to also eliminate the valuable S hook. I held this as I had never seen it.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIIILST F7 I. +5 99
#note I didn't even look for a bingo here. That'll teach me. ILEITIS...
>Lou_Cornelis: EEGINRV J8 .EVERING +72 214
#note Bingoing would have really helped me out.

#note Great.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEOORTU 13C O.A +12 230
#note Not sure what the correct play is here. I wanted to fake having the case N so he'd maybe block, which kind of worked.
>Lou_Cornelis: AA 11C A.A +12 311
>Joshua_Sokol: DEOPRTU 6B PROUD +29 259
#note PROT(R)UDE. Bad, bad miss.

#note I wasn't certain of BEGRIM.
>Lou_Cornelis: CCR M11 C.R.C +18 347
>Joshua_Sokol: AIKOOTT 6J ..OKA +23 308
#note I needed that case S. I hoped he didn't have it.
>Lou_Cornelis: ADEGORS O4 DOSAGE +43 390
#note Lou took a long time to play this. I was thinking maybe he didn't have the S, but of course he did.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIOTTU 7H .A +15 323
#note Alright, so he just drew 6/7 of the pool, meaning if he didn't have the Q as his last tile he has a very strong chance of having it now. I can therefore Q stick him. But just to be sure, I'll keep my U. This and (HOOD)E(D) are the plays I found that are doing best in the sim. My play is doing a wee bit better.
>Lou_Cornelis: DEMNPRT K11 M.D. +25 415
#note (P)REP is champ's play here.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIOQTTU 8A QUI. +39 362
>Lou_Cornelis: ENPRT N1 PEN +15 430
#note Blocking the TOTE I missed.
>Joshua_Sokol: EOTT C1 TOTE +13 375
#note I had a very good chance of winning here and I just missed two bingos I should have seen.
