#note COALED is also good.
>Conrad: AEGORRR 4H .ARGO +16 16
#note ROGER I6 is another good option.

#note Too many Is and esses make this good compared to VOILE.
>Noah: CFINOTU 2H COFT +40 145
#note Wasn't sure about OF. Didn't love it after Conrad had played off 9 in the last couple turns and I am playing off two. Getting turnover for SSSS?? seems good here as well.

>Noah: HIIINNR -HIIIN +0 168
#note Gotta play HIN. I need to write more hooks down on my scoresheet! I didn't write down HARBOURED even though I thought of it, and thus forgot it later in the game.
>Conrad: EEEIMNZ N6 ZE. +32 229
>Noah: ?AEENRS 1L EARN +31 199
#note A sim likes O8 plays but this seems like a good choice to me. Scoring 31 is pretty strong on this board, especially since row 1 is probably the most potent spot, and I'm taking it away.
