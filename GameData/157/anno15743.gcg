>Joshua_Sokol: AEHIINV 9F VAHINE +35 35
#note I laid this down really fast. I didn't consider 7D for maybe more defense or AHI 9G.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIIIMW 12I MI.I +12 47
#note WIRE, same spot?

>Wayne_Barclay: HLLU L4 HULL. +16 126
#note I held it, but didn't think too much of it as I wasn't 100% it was phony and it was only 16 points, and I had a bingo.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AINOTZ N1 NOTArIZ. +86 200
#note O1 hOATZIN(S). I knew I was missing something. Man, every game I think I missed at least 1 better bingo than what I played or just a bingo I didn't play. bOTANIZE is better.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?CDDEIS 2E SCInDED +71 271
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CDDEIS --  -71 200
#note Here's where I go full retard. I had the right idea in considering very carefully playing 9M ID or bingoing, and then I saw the defensive merits of this nonword and the points it scored.
>Wayne_Barclay: BEIORST 2E ORBIEST +65 209
#note Any other bingo would have blocked this...
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CDDEIS E1 D.CkSIDE +72 272
>Wayne_Barclay: EIPR 1A PRIE. +27 236
>Joshua_Sokol: AACDOPQ 8A APAC. +36 308
#note The spot looked to dangerous to keep open, which is why I didn't opt for QAD(I). I also had Q(I) if I needed it or the K5 spot to work with next turn. The sim disagrees :(. It even likes just QI better at H1.
>Wayne_Barclay: AY O3 AY +20 256

#note I was so paranoid that I wasn't 100% on DINGY, RIDGY and LINGY,
>Wayne_Barclay: OW N10 WO +28 361

#note Even better than what champ suggests... I think I held this too, to no avail.
>Joshua_Sokol: R G8 ..R +6 429
>Joshua_Sokol:  (GT) +6 435
#note I again played terribly, I didn't deserve this win.
