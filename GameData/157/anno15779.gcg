#note karris was cracking me up at this point as usual...he kept saying how unfair it was that I bingoed AGAIN. I didn't play REEARNS at K6 for no particular reason that I can think of, it sims a bit better

#note it never even crossed my mind to not play the bingo, mostly for the entertainment value of seeing john's reaction, but playing HM at J2 is unquestionably better - I have a great chance next turn at a higher-scoring bingo and I lower his score by 5 points per turn.

#note finally a sort of normal play, which of course I got wrong -some permutation of vodun looks best

#note fishing here is dumb, there's only one lane and he should be able to come up with some kind of block. I'm fine with just ANION, or maybe a more aggressive fish like VINO.
