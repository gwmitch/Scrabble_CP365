#note Interesting position here. ER, exch ER (I prefer the latter), exch R, EARNED, DARNER. I didn't know what to do here, but I decided not to waste so much time and scare her with exch R. Apparently it isn't the best move.

#note Hmm, NEOLITH is cool since it sets up my J if I draw HA or RA. I didn't see it.  Should I have inferred an S her and played JEON instead? It worked out in my favor, but I don't know.

#note LM is a bit better than MT apparently. OK.

#note I don't know about VOM(I)T G1.

>Joshua_Sokol: ALMNQRT 3G LAM +33 147
#note Do I just play Q(I) G3 here? I think I need to get rid of the nice spot with AFEARED either way.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: FINO 11E FOIN +21 120
#note Wonder if it was better to play it with VOLTI.
>Joshua_Sokol: CENQRST B7 Q. +11 158
#note An A would be awesome.

>Joshua_Sokol: DGIINOT 4D ......ING +38 281
#note I spent a good amount of time on this turn as both of the blanks were still out. I think I should play INDIGO(S) here. I didn't see it.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ??ADDEN 15D DANDiE.t +80 283
#note Surprised she missed so many 3x3s here. Still a bit unhappy about her draw though.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDIOOT 14C TABOO +23 304
#note I missed ADOBO and BIOTA. I knew the Z was maybe on her rack so I preferred to block a spot she may get 50 points in. I considered BAN(D)ITO (didn't know BONIATO), TABOO and OBIA. I still was slightly tilted about her next play.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEIRZ 8J .AZIER +81 364

>Joshua_Sokol: DEITUUW 13B WUD +23 327
