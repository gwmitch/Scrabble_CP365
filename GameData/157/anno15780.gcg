#note one of those really tough plays. exchanging IOU is dead even. I think an exchange 3 is likely to draw a very defensive play from jerry, making it unlikely I will actually bingo 48% of the time.
>Larry_Jerman: RUX 10C R.UX +27 138
>JD: GILMOQT 4D Q.ILT +30 159
#note I burned a lot of time on the euripi rack. this would later be painful. nice shot at GROOM here next turn.
>Larry_Jerman: ADILNST 6E .D +15 153
#note sharp play from jerry, although given his next play not sure what he drew - must be the E? he told me but I forgot
>JD: CDGIMNO J6 MOC. +18 177
#note I was looking forward to playing at row 6. with that unvailable I like this play in response to an X1 - there are tons of lanes, but maybe I block some bingoes by taking away the only S hook on the board.
>Larry_Jerman: AEILNST K9 SALTINE +76 229
>JD: DGIINVY 15K .YING +39 216
#note eying and ivy are even on static, but DING bingoes aren't going anywhere on this board.
>Larry_Jerman: AJW K5 JAW +35 264
>JD: DFIINOV L2 VINO +23 239
#note it's really surprising to me that my play of VINO is not a lot worse than FIDO, given how much better VIN fits with the open G, but I think I benefit from frequently hitting big plays on column M next turn whereas Jerry might not be able to play there.
>Larry_Jerman: ?GORSTU 14B OUTRaG.S +66 330
#note he could also play on column M
>JD: BDEFIOP M3 FOB +40 279

>JD: ADEILPS I4 SLAP +40 319
#note I'm down enough that I think I have to take the points and try to draw the blank next turn. quackle agrees.
>Larry_Jerman: IM 14M MI +16 377
>JD: ?ADEGIL H1 GIL. +15 334
#note ran out of time here, really tough choice - I thought about AD or AG at 13M, AIR or LARI at 5C/5B or something at H1. problem with this play is that I play the case I, so no real shot of hitting an -ING bingo. I sacrificed about 5% of winning percentage here. I don't think either AD or AG are real options given how he can block. AIR is rough if he plays anything on column B, whih is likely. LAIR has a shot but again will likely draw a block from jerry. In retrospect best might be EDIT at H1, but that's a tough find and I'm not convinced I wil even if I do hit that lane.
>Larry_Jerman: EFST N2 EFTS +39 416
>JD: ?AADEEO 13M AA +17 351
#note I think quackle is wrong here because my play must open a lane (else he will simply play up top and leave me to play a 9 to win). However, quackle's suggestion of TOEA does look like a better play, even though I'm down enough that I don't think I win even if I do bingo.
>Larry_Jerman: H 13M ..H +6 422
>JD: ?DEENOR B13 R.. +3 354
#note I couldn't find a bingo here, but none of the bingoes wins any endgames. however I missed a potentially brilliant chance to steal the game - fish the O and draw the C for bedrench/receding. O was in the bag, but still a missed opportunity.
>Larry_Jerman: AACEEUY 1F CA.EY +11 433
