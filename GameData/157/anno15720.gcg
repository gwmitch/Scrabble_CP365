>Joshua_Sokol: DEFGNNT H7 FEND +16 16
#note Josh: Game in Ottawa against Jackson. This is a dual commentary. I considered the Elise-like possibility of exchanging FGN here.
>Jackson_Smylie: AAILMOP G4 LIPOMA +25 25
#note Jackson: hi.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?GINOTW 11H sTOWING +78 94
#note Nice draw here. Sowwy Jackson. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AARTWYZ 10J YA +31 56
#note Jackson: I played this to set up WIZ/YAW. And I could score with the Z elsewhere if WIZ is blocked.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIIINRV M9 VI.IER +26 120
#note Josh: INVIRI(L)E. Oops? Did not know it. First triple I miss this tournament.
>Jackson_Smylie: AEQRTWZ F9 TZAR +36 92
#note Jackson: "I suck so much. ZETA H1"
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDEINX H1 CANID +33 153
#note Josh: Held by Jackson. Also NICAD, dunno which is better.
>Jackson_Smylie: BEIOQSW 13C BOWSE +36 128
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGOSUX 2G E.UX +27 180
#note Josh: I'm fine with SOX H13, I hate GOX 14B. I like blocking his highest scoring lane. Jackson: I like GOX, even though I could have an O or Y, and SOX looks good. Not a great board for bingoing. EAUX is good.
>Jackson_Smylie: BEINPQT 14B QI +26 154
#note Jackson: didnt see BEAUX/BE. QI is to open up some volatility. Maybe it`s a bit premature to do that.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?GHLLOS D9 HOLL.S +30 210
#note Joshua: As you all know by now I play paranoid, which my friends disagree with. :( I hate playing G(O)SH because it gives him a lot of points and maybe even a 3x3. GOL(O)SH I didn't know, but still I prefer HOLL(O)S. Jackson: GOLOSH, but between GOSH and HOLLOS, I prefer GOSH. Maybe I could play an ?I?H word for 40 something, but that's not very likely. HOLLOS opens up a new lane, and it's a lot more likely and dire for me to bingo. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ABEFNPT -  +0 154
#note Jackson: Lol, didnt know it. Josh: H_LLO works with every vowel and takes an A. I doubted that fact when he challenged though.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEGILO 15A DIG +32 242
#note Josh: GODLIke. DOGLIke. ObLIGED. GLOrIED. GEOIDaL. I suck? Or did I pull an Avery Mojica? Jackson: n1.
>Jackson_Smylie: ABEFNPT I6 AFT +28 182
#note Jackson: I was trying to score so I could get within enough points to where a bingo could win. Maybe I whould be focusing on bingoing now, and catching up later. BOFF looks a lot better. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEELO 1J OLEA +14 256
#note This is what I get for missing those bingos. A few plays are debatable here, and I'd like to think OLEA is one of them. 
>Jackson_Smylie: EGJNOPV 3J OVEN +24 206
#note Bad play, GIP L10 is much better. OVEN was to give myself room to open a lane later.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEEINR C3 EsERINE +72 328
#note I don't think I should go for one more point at N2.
>Jackson_Smylie: CGJOPRU F5 ROC +29 235
#note ROC was to set up JUG. GIP again!!! GROUP b1 is pretty awesome
>Joshua_Sokol: DEHNRSS J7 SH +27 355
#note Josh: I took the equity play. Sorry Sid.
>Jackson_Smylie: AGIJPTU E3 JUG +34 269
#note Josh: had a feeling that was a setup. Nice.
>Joshua_Sokol: DENRSTU H13 DUN +24 379
>Jackson_Smylie: AABIOPT 12I OBA +21 290
#note Jackson: I'm not gonna win at this point, going for spread, but not doing a very good job. F1 ABO. I suck too.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEERSTY 14J YEA.S +32 411
#note Sealing the deal I guess.
>Jackson_Smylie: AEIKPTU 4L TEAK +32 322
>Joshua_Sokol: EMRRTT N4 .RMER +13 424
#note Josh: I chickened out on MERK and missed TREK. Cool. 
>Jackson_Smylie: IPU B9 PIU +15 337
>Jackson_Smylie:  (TT) +4 341
#note Josh: Any last words, Jackson? Jackson: ABO.
