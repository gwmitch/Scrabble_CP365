>Joshua_Sokol: DEGLRSS H4 GELDS +18 18
#note This is the most ridiculous game I have played in a very long time, if not ever.
>Ella_Sobel: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 0
#note This game begs the question: Do either of us even speak the language we play in?
>Joshua_Sokol: CCEOPRS 5E COP. +16 34
#note Less extreme of a question: is English our native tongue? Perhaps me talking myself out of the French PRECOC(E)S* is proof. But the question remains to be debunked, as you will see.
>Ella_Sobel: AHT 6F HA.T +32 32
>Joshua_Sokol: ACERSSS D1 CRASSES +83 117
#note (I knew this was phony, but "insert silly reasoning here")
>Ella_Sobel: IK C3 KI +26 58
>Joshua_Sokol: BEELLLU 1D .ELEB +27 144
#note OK English dictionary, I'm totally fine with being 1/2 on the topic "Is this French word an English word too?" How do you even pronounce CELLULE? I lengthily considered playing it, too. But then what would this game be about?
>Ella_Sobel: OP B3 OP +16 74
>Joshua_Sokol: AJLLQRU 8H .QUALL +16 160
#note Here's a quiz for you. Just hold on while we advance a few turns...
>Ella_Sobel: AGU I8 .UAG +15 89
#note Can you guess when the real quiz will pop up? It's turn 10 now, you have on average a 1/13 chance of so of getting the answer right, as most games seem to last 23 turns.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFIJNR 11C JEERIN. +30 190
#note I'm actually making that last fact up. This isn't a good move. I have a 51 point play. But then what would be the point of posting this game?
>Ella_Sobel: DIOOOTV 8H ......OR +51 140
>Ella_Sobel: DIOOOTV --  -51 89
#note Ella strikes first in the "Do you even English speak?!" category.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEFMRT K4 FERM.TEs +98 288
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEFMRT --  -98 190
#note You've been through this already Josh. FERMATA, FERMATE, FERMATES*, FERMATAS. How do you not remember around a year ago at this same Scrabble club when you attempted to triple-triple with FERMATES*, missing FERMATAS?
>Ella_Sobel: MOR 12B ROM +27 116
#note Where are these basic English failures coming FROM?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEFMRT A12 FEME +52 242
>Ella_Sobel: DOT 13C TOD +33 149
#note Ella was sort of annoyed at herself here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AHRTTY 8A HART +35 277
#note What's that, Josh? You can't remember if there is a word in AHRTY? WELL SHUFFLE YOUR TILES G'DARNIT! Oh, and you missed two bingos. One of them you didn't know, but the other one you did. But you also chickened out of SQUALLY. This is not yet a comedy, but rather perhaps a B-rated soap opera of errors. Oh, and B1 TR(OP)HY. Oh, and RATTY or TARTY.
>Ella_Sobel: OZ B6 ZO. +32 181
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ENORXY 14E OXY +32 309
#note OK, this is definitely a comedy of errors at this point.
>Ella_Sobel: AIR 15E RIA +21 202
#note Do not fret, audience. It gets far, far worse.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BDENRT 15A .NEB...TeD +45 354
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BDENRT --  -45 309
#note Literally this was me, during this turn. "Screw it, I can't go all game without making a really flashy play. There you go! 

Ella wondered aloud if I was actually inebriated here.
>Ella_Sobel: AO 14A .OA +21 223
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BDENRT 8H ......ED +54 363
#note I still have 90-point bingos. But I started to devise a plan here. A malefic plan.
>Ella_Sobel: FI 2A IF +26 249
#note Have you noticed how poorly Ella is drawing?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABNORT A1 B. +12 375
#note Quiz time, guys. Question one: Why on earth did I play B(I) for 12?
>Ella_Sobel: GIINV 4H .IVING +22 271
#note Question 2) Did I hit my fish?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AINORT 1D .....RATIONs +98 473
#note 3rd and final question: What is the only other 7-letter TWL extension to CELEB?
>Ella_Sobel: WY F10 W.Y +17 288
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEINN 2J NE +10 483
#note I lied! Bonus question: Am I creative enough to have made up this entire game?
>Ella_Sobel: UV F1 .UV +8 296
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEINUW M8 .AUWINE +22 505
#note Of course this actually happened, not even Matthew Tunnicliffe can come up with a game so bizarre, so spectacularly impressive and at the same time so absurd.
>Ella_Sobel: ?EINTT L12 TINE +18 314
#note  If Ella knew TENUTI, my play of (L)AUWINE would not have been correct. I know, who cares? Just a force of habit to give you the salient details of this endgame.
>Joshua_Sokol: D 10I .D +7 512
