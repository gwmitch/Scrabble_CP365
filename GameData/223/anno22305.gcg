>Wes_Eddings: ?ACEIRS 8F AtRESIC +72 72
>Josh: ACDEEUY 7H AYE +23 23
#note I imagined CAUSEYED* was invalid, so I didn't attempt it. It is indeed. Wonder if Wes would have challenged though...
>Wes_Eddings: NNOUW 9B UNWON +11 83
#note Put it up two spots and it's quite better defensively. 
>Josh: CDEEU 10F DUE +16 39
#note I don't remember what my leave was, but this was definitely a mistake. I hope it wasn't CERO, because then I missed a bingo.
>Wes_Eddings: EVX J4 VEX.. +31 114
>Josh: CDEORUU 11H DOUCEUR +73 112
#note I was angry about my draw at first, but hey... He held this play for a couple of minutes
>Wes_Eddings: ILMNRST 5D MINSTR.L +90 204
#note Both Wes and I managed to get a bingo with, at first sight. not very attractive tiles. Kudos to both of us!
>Josh: IKLNP B9 .PLINK +36 148
#note I don't remember my leave here either, but this play seemed quite automatic. I think I had two consonants, but not an S, yet. I knew I needed one.
>Wes_Eddings: AFGL 4B FLAG +27 231
>Josh: AEEIOQR A12 QI +44 192
#note no need for my leave here either, but I know I needed to hope for something next turn, as I had neither an S nor a blank.
>Wes_Eddings: HMOT M9 MO.TH +26 257
#note L8 (C)OM(E)TH for just as many provides superior board control, but it doesn't seem that this was ever Wes' aim this game, so he might as well just give the board another lane and hope for the best.
>Josh: ?AEENOR O6 ARENOsE +81 273
#note Miracle blank draw brings me back into it.
>Wes_Eddings: BDEIJ N2 JIBED +45 302
>Josh: DGIIITT H1 DIGI. +24 297
#note Terrible triple I draw brings me right back out of the game.
>Wes_Eddings: FNO O1 FON +29 331
>Josh: EITTTYZ 14I TITTY +24 321
#note Drawing that Z was nice. I was hoping his rack was unbalanced here and therefore couldn't hurt me much. If I wanted to be safe I could have played (W)ITTY for 22, but I wanted to take out that MOUTH spot with no hope for hitting it myself on the horizon.
>Wes_Eddings: AEPV 15F PAVE +29 360
#note whew
>Josh: AEZ M3 ZA +50 371
#note I think Wes was quite annoyed after I put this down, understandably, as I am pulling ahead yet again after hitting both the Z and the Q bomb. I could be wrong.
>Wes_Eddings: W 4L W.. +16 376
#note It seems I also blocked his only good scoring play down L.
>Josh: ABEGHOO B2 BE.OG +30 401
#note The perfect play managed to bring itself to me. How lucky I was to manage this. But I'm not out of the woods yet! I must ensure he cannot bingo.
>Wes_Eddings: O 10A O. +4 380
#note Wes naturally goes for a bingo, having none available this turn.
>Josh: AAHIORR 1D AROI. +7 408
#note This is 10 fewer than the best play, which I indeed saw, A5 HAIR. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something in ADEELSST, a rack I have not studied enough to know its solutions, DATELESS, TASSELED and DETASSEL.
>Wes_Eddings: AEELSST 15A EST +22 402
#note -8, playing 4 tiles for 6 more is best here.
>Josh: AHR A1 RAH +27 435
>Josh:  (AELS) +8 443
#note I fought back weakly at times (notably on my DUE turn), but ferociously for the rest of the game. I think that I deserved to come back and win it!
