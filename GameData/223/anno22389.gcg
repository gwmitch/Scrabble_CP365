>Michael_Fagen: ?EEILOR 8C REOILEd +64 64
#note Bam, static Quackle at its finest! +1 for Michael. +100 to you if you catch my drift.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEGIO C3 CAGIE. +20 20
#note Ooh, static Quackle has competition! That's +1 for Josh too.
>Michael_Fagen: DOY D4 YOD +30 94
>Joshua_Sokol: AEOORTW G3 WATER.OO +67 87
>Michael_Fagen: ADEGMRT B4 GAM +35 129
#note His leave. No question that this is the best play. He thought it was a gamble to leave H1 open.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAIKTTT F2 KATA +27 114
#note Annoyed that he blocked TAKA and (T)AY*. Seriously I thought TAKA played for a lot. Instead I miss A6 IKAT for a pretty large swing. Probably a 10-point loss.
>Michael_Fagen: DEELNRT 10F R.NDELET +63 192
#note Missing REDOLENT. That even plays for 71 at 9D with 5 underlaps. At least this makes up for my error last turn. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AFIIRTT H1 FIAT +34 148
>Michael_Fagen: AHM 11J HAM +29 221
>Joshua_Sokol: GIRTUUW 12K GURU +24 172
#note Oof, ugly pull there. Michael unknowingly saved my rack though. Yay for having to wait your turn to know if you need to exchange or not!
>Michael_Fagen: ENOZ 11C ZONE +28 249
#note Jeez, he's all sorts of volatile this game.
>Joshua_Sokol: IIPSTTW H10 .ITWIT +30 202
#note Was quite angering to have to leave two humongous and easy scoring spots open.
>Michael_Fagen: APX 12B PAX +53 302
#note Cheezus
>Joshua_Sokol: CJLOPSU 13A COP +46 248
#note Seems I must forgo O8 JUCOS this turn to take away the underlaps from Hell that Michael has created. But maybe I should play 13C SOJU for 56 and throw away my S... Definitely missed that POL for 48 was better than this. Another large mistake caused by unwelcome results orientation
>Michael_Fagen: EEEEE -EEEEE +0 302
>Joshua_Sokol: ?JLNSSU O10 JUS +18 266
#note This turn was extremely tough. I wanted to prevent almost instant death by S-hook, so I played JUS for 18, blocking myself. I considered leaving the board very volatile here and playing elsewhere, but I missed 3E J(AWA)N/J(AWA)NS. Those were definitely worth considering, and probably one of those is the right play here. Can I even consider N8 JUS though? That's what Quackle is suggesting is the correct JUS. Insanity. Anyways, the board seemed like it was never going to get closed, so I felt I could definitely afford to block myself and play comeback defense.
>Michael_Fagen: BY D10 B..Y +27 329
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IILNQS G14 QI +24 290
#note Boy was that Q draw stifling. Luckily there was still some light on the horizon for me. I could still make my way out of the woods.
>Michael_Fagen: EEEVV -EEEVV +0 329
#note Michael seemed to need some sort of machine here. The clunky tiles seemed to stick to one another. when he drew them. 

Just a side note, although A6 still exists as somewhere to score, this board was extremely good for me and my attempt at a comeback, as it is bereft of places to score and open enough for places to bingo.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EILNOS 1H .ELONIeS +83 373
#note I saw this and played it. FOILSmEN and FLExIONS also play. They are better than this as they allow fewer bingos to play on Michael's end.
>Michael_Fagen: DEFINSS 14B IS +29 358
#note All game, Michael missed I(MID). At least I can say I only missed it for one turn... His play is A5 DIFS. That play is very strong, although Michael will still have trouble managing to win after DIFS.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEHLNNV N1 .LVEN +14 387
#note My play, on the other hand, is 7B B(E)L. I knew this was not risk-free, since I will lose if Michael manages a bingo (perhaps that happens up to 1/7 times based on his range). I will also lose if I don't draw anything useful and he manages a big play down column O. But his range after IS usually does not contain an F, given that that isn't a good bingo tile and there are many spots he could have scored and rid himself of the F last turn. That was my hunch. I was wrong, but only because Michael did not make the right play last turn. So this play is much better than it looks at first, as it sets my H up for next turn if I can manage to draw into something, which is actually somewhat of a coin flip. Anyways, I missed 7B B(E)L which is 100% my play (that's actually blocking the primary bingo lane for Michael). I also did not consider exchanging, which would have been strong too.
>Michael_Fagen: DEFINRS O4 FENDS +50 408
#note This play gives Michael around a 60% shot of winning, if Quackle's championship player is to be trusted in this relatively simple pre-endgame.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDEHNV A5 DAVEN +40 427
#note But with a great draw, I manage to eke out a win. I am extremely lucky, because I was close to playing E7 H(O)B first, as I am guaranteed to go out next turn. As Michael and I had been doing all game, I missed I(MID). If Michael finally saw that possibility, he would win the game by playing IRE/IMID for 16 after H(O)B, winning the game 424-421. I obviously miscalculated the endgame by missing I(MID), but DAVEN was without a doubt my play no matter what. He can block H(O)B next turn with (O)R for 2, and then play OURIE 7I next turn for 9, but I end up winning by 11 in that case.
>Michael_Fagen: EIORRU M4 ROUE +14 422
#note In reality, his best block consists of E7 R(O)O for 3, setting up (O)URIE K1 for 10 next turn, which I can block or let him play it for the same point differential. 6A (AMID)O for 8 also allows for the winningest loss, equivalent to R(O)O. My find of (O)R is 2 points off the optimum. Michael's play is 8 off.
