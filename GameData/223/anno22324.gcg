>Matthew_Larocque: EEFINOO 8G FOO +12 12
#note FOE? Also, Quackle says that Exch. EFOO is as good or better than playing FOO. Really?
>Danny_Panganiban: IPRTUY 7D PURITY +33 33
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIKLNV 8A LIVEN +34 46
#note I saw KEVIL/KELVIN. KEVIL creates a very dangerous spot so I didn't like it. KELVIN is a little better, but still gives him some big chances to score. LIVEN made more sense to me. It's easy for Danny to score from 8A, and it keeps the K to hook YO next turn.
>Danny_Panganiban: EHNW B6 WH.NE +21 54
#note Danny taking a point sacrifice here.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEKOO 9H OKA +30 76
#note Missed rack, but I'm fairly certain I had 6 vowels and the K. 30 points was enough to play through. 
>Danny_Panganiban: AGO 10J GOA +15 69
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEIJOU C2 JUICE +33 109
#note I did not know ACAJOU, so I was gritting my teeth between JUICE or 11I JOE to block. He must have kept decent letters after a play like GOA, and he opened the 2x2. I didn't want to chew away all my time so I took a risk and played JUICE. I did not want to keep ACIU and potentially have a difficult time scoring next turn. He can still bingo by hooking GOA, so I just wanted to reset my rack and try to outscore him instead. I don't know.
>Danny_Panganiban: ?AEEIPS 11E APErIES +90 159
#note He was going to bingo no matter what.... but he potentially only scores 64 next turn for APErIES/GOAS if that is all he sees. 26 points is a big hit, so I still question if playing JOE last turn was correct.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAIIMO 12C AMIA +18 127
#note I noticed A(J)I, but I have too many vowels here and I'm not that desperate yet. No good options really. I guess A3 AMIA is safer, but I didn't think playing scared here was going to get me back in the game.
>Danny_Panganiban: OOX 13B OXO +42 201
#note Ouch, but he's giving me a huge underlap in return.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAIOOW A5 WOO. +18 145
#note But I fail to draw an E. I miss A(L)OW for 19 which unduplicates all my vowels. I'm going to be hurting if Danny milks that X.
>Danny_Panganiban: ADEIRST 13F DIASTER +66 267
#note Unlucky for him that nothing fits there for monster points.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEEGI 2B A.I +20 165
#note Now I decide that I need to play A(J)I, because I'm going to need to bingo more than once to catch up, and that means I need more than just playing a bingo down to GOA.
>Danny_Panganiban: FGIST 1D GIFTS +38 305
#note Could have been worse, but still pretty crappy.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEEGL M4 GELAtED +66 231
#note I looked for other possible bingos to try and keep the easy GOA line open, but it turns out I have no choice but to play there.
>Danny_Panganiban: NV 4B V.N +12 317
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEERTZ L1 ZETA +52 283
#note 11A ADZ is awesome, so is ZAMIA/ZOA B12. I also forgot that I could play ZEDA here instead. This gives a lot back, but it also allows me to play underneath AX next turn since I am keeping an E and he's going to be focused on the Z.
>Danny_Panganiban: INS 1L .INS +39 356
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEHRTT 14B HERD +41 324
>Danny_Panganiban: BR H13 .RB +15 371
>Matthew_Larocque: BDETTUY K2 BUTTY +30 354
#note I admittedly forgot all about the Q still looming here. I was low on time and I saw BUTTY really quickly. I doubted there was much else I could do here. Sim somewhat agrees, but also points out 1A BY which would allow me to dump the Q if I draw it (and also lessens my chances of drawing it).
>Danny_Panganiban: CELLNRU E3 CEL +17 388
>Matthew_Larocque: DEMNQR J5 EM +25 379
#note All I can do now is lessen the spread.

>Danny_Panganiban: NRU 15H .URN +6 405
>Danny_Panganiban:  (QR) +22 427
#note The JUICE play felt like the point in the game where I lost it, but getting myself Q stuck was careless either way.
