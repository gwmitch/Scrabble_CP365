#note A little bummed that MALL(E)OLI got blocked. MOLAL is better.

#note 4C DRIF(T)Y. I got tunnel vision once I saw that I could drop both the V and the Z for 34 points.
>Mike_Johnson: I -I +0 51
>Charles_Reinke: ADFKMUY 2F F..AKY +34 187
#note I missed 14G FUMY for 40, but that's a horrible play given that Mike probably hit his fish.
>Mike_Johnson: AENORTT N8 NOTATER +76 127
>Mike_Johnson: AENORTT --  -76 51
#note This should have been an insta-challenge but I held for a while making sure that NOTATER* didn't get added along with NOTATOR+. The funny thing is I challenged both words, but thought that MAILLE* was valid.
>Charles_Reinke: DEMNSSU N10 MUSED +36 223
#note I swear I thought MAILLE was good here and that I wasn't trying to take advantage of the fact that Mike had just lost a challenge on the same word. 1K MUSED is the "correct" play, but I probably should block TENTOR(I)A since I wasn't sure if Mike would see TE(V)ATRON. I figured I at least guarantee myself a TWS with this play even if Mike bingos.
