#note Too many counters and I had no clue what to do with this.  This socres better than anything else I have but it gives back an awful lot of back hooks and I'm still saddled with the Y.  That said, the consolation is that I reduced his next play by 7 points by putting this down:
>Mike_Willis: CDDINTU I2 INDUCT.D +66 158
>Jim_Burlant: EEIOOVY D8 .IVEY +36 72
>Mike_Willis: BMO E11 MOB +29 187
>Jim_Burlant: ?EILOOT 14E sTOOLIE +67 139
#note One of the new words, LOOKITED, is best.  3C OILSTONE is also good.  This isn't so good, but I actually benefit from it.  Back up from 6% to 16% winning chances.  Woo hoo.
>Mike_Willis: ADLTUV K9 VAULT.D +22 209
>Jim_Burlant: AAFLPRS 15H FA +32 171
#note With no E, EARFLAPS won't play and there's no 7 in this rack.    It's this or ARF 15F.  Back up to 27%...but not for long.
>Mike_Willis: GHINRST 2G SH.RTING +78 287
>Jim_Burlant: ALNPPRS L1 P.RN +18 189
#note Anything is as good as anything; nothing stands out, eitehr from a win percentage or equity perspective.  BRAZEN F7, 12B PAYOR 27, or 10J PAN are all reasonable choices as well as this.

>Jim_Burlant: AAELOPS 15K .OPAS +27 216
#note Didn't now the S back hook on SHIRTING, so I just wanted to open lines.  If you don't know that hook, this is as good as anything else.  The only thing trying to do by now is to hopefully let myself be able to bingo somewhere to close spread.  Nothing wins as much as 2% here.

>Jim_Burlant: AEILOQR 5H Q.AI +26 242
#note An autopilot play slapped down out of frustration. I should  play 9C QI to leave things open.  Not that the game is remotely winnable unless Mike falls asleep for 10 minutes and concedes 100 spread points from time penalties, but at least I have a faint chance at a spread saving bingo on row 4 if I play at 9C.

#note Not sure I've got this written correctly - regardless, seeing UY in my rack after another bagging  led to my knee-jerk exchanging out of frustration.  No need to exchange when 13E BUY is an optoin.
>Mike_Willis: AGN N2 .ANG +6 401
#note Annotation stops here - yet again, the bingo I've tried to manufacture takes one turn too long to appear in my rack.  My final three complete racks of ACEELRS, EELNRST, and EEGLNRT don't go down anywhere and I shuffle tiles to end the game.  Final score 321 - 483.
