>Paul_Holser: ?ILPRSU 8C SPIRULa +72 72
#note Other bingos include PURLInS or PURSILy for the same points.
>Jim_Burlant: EEGLOOT J8 EGO +15 15
#note I chose this because I couldn't find anything that scored well and I wanted to unload my G and take out the (SPIRULA)E hook.  The duck confirms that nothing stands out and all my choices score between 14 and 18 points.  This, C8 STOOGE, or J5 OGLE are the best of a mediocre lot.  
>Paul_Holser: EFH 9E FEH +29 101
>Jim_Burlant: BELNOST 11E NOBLEST +91 106
#note Only bingo.  Sad but true:  it took me minutes to find this as I kept looking for 8's before I even recognized there was a 7 in this rack.
>Paul_Holser: AIMNNO 12A AMNION +22 123
>Jim_Burlant: BOORRSX 7B BOOR +20 126
#note I struggled with this turn, debating between this and 13E BOX.  I realized BROO scored 8 fewer than BOX, but for reasons I can't put a finger on, I felt that if I kept ORRS, I'd be fishing for chump change on the next turn.  A sim gives slight preference to BOX, but not by a whole lot.   BOX wins 48.4%, and this wins 47.2 and sims 2.1 points down at almost 1500 iterations.  Maybe BOX if I had to do this again...or maybe not.
>Paul_Holser: ?AEMNSU H2 NUMErA.S +72 195
#note H1 MENSURAL scores 80 and UNSEAMS scoers 81 on row 13.  That said, the ensuing sequence was, in retrospect, an omen for how way too much of this tournament would go.
>Jim_Burlant: ADIRSTX G2 AX +36 162
#note I debated between RADIX A11, G1 TIX and G2 AX.  With the blanks gone, turnover wasn't  necessarily a good thing.  TIX leaves me more balanced than AX, but the biggest advantage of AX is that I have R, S, and T in my rack to front hook AX, and with all the unseen AEI,  I had an excellent chance of drawing into a 7 to hook it whle Paul is sitting on a random rack. As volatile as row 1 is, the A column is more dangerous and defending that is probably his first priority.  The only thing a sim confirms is that I overthought this, as it indicates that my play was the no-brainer best.  This is wins just shy of 37%.  G1 TIX is runner up, winning almost 4-1/2% less often and evaluating 7 points down. 
>Paul_Holser: AEJ 5E AJE. +22 217
>Jim_Burlant: ADIRSTU H11 .URID +21 183
#note I didn't spend much time here; I saw I could unload the U, score 21, and leave a decent AIS and that was that.  Q thinks I should strictly fish with B12 MUD or play 11A DUI. I sort of see that, since MUD significantly reduces the A column threat while preserving the rack.  Given that this outscores MUD by 9 points and takes away the H column scoring threat (admittedly not as big as the A column) I suspect that Q's main complaint is that it feels I've broken up too much of the rack. A secondary complaint Q may have is that the IRD I've given myself for potential 8's are overrepresented in the unseen pool.  If you want to say this is a mistake, fine.  But to me, the punishment far exceeded the crime: 
>Paul_Holser: CDEFIIO 15A CODIFIE. +98 315
#note Ouch!  Had I fished with MUD, Paul probably plays COIF on row 1 to take out the AX hooks, and with my next draw (the Q was one of the first 2 out of the bag), it wouldn't have mattered.
>Jim_Burlant: AEKQSTT F14 Q. +31 214
#note I'm rattled, which made me miss my best play, but the loss is mainly equity. 2F QANAT looks best here for the extra 5 points, better rack balance, as well as its setting up a hook for the case S, which I have.  Regardless, this is bleak no matter how I look at it:  This wins 1.8%; QANAT wins 3.6%.
>Paul_Holser: DEIL 1D DEIL +17 332
>Jim_Burlant: AEKRSTT 2F T..K +14 228
#note A sim indicates anything is as good as anything here.  1.8% to win.
>Paul_Holser: EIPTW 4A PEWIT +28 360
>Jim_Burlant: AEIRSTZ J1 ZA +24 252
#note This has the Highest equity but 4H MIRZA wins a sim.  Regardless, beyond bleak - barely 0.76% to win with this.  Nothing wins as much as 2%.

>Jim_Burlant: CENORVY A1 CRE.Y +36 349
#note Didn't know that CONVEYER had an anagram of RECONVEY, but that only saves spread.  Unbeknownst to me, the 3 tiles in the bag are GIT.  If I find RECONVEY, with his rack of ADRTVWY he comes back with VROW 8L 42, I go out with GIT 14B and lose by 28 points.
