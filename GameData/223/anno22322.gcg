>Jim_Burlant: EIMOOTZ 8G ZOO +24 24
#note The 7th tile:  the duplicated O. In last month's one-day, I have no doubt it would have been an A for ATOMIZE.  Anyway - I rushed this.  There's no good reason for me to not play MOZO here.  That said, this isn't a huge miss if the sim is to be believed.
>Dave_Stone: ADEEV 9E EVADE +29 29
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIIMT -II +0 24
#note Interesting sim result.  I didn't consider anything but exchanging here, though the duck feels that  I should unload all 3 I's.  AIM for 22 (which I never even considered) only wins 1-1/2% more often and sims only 4 points better.
>Dave_Stone: FLORU 8A FLUOR +29 58
#note Held, but released.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIMRT J9 RAGTIME +78 102
#note Best bingo, and it's 59% to win.
>Dave_Stone: BDDETU 15I D.BUTED +36 94
>Jim_Burlant: ABHKNRY 13I H.NKY +38 140
#note Best, and it's 65% to win...but not for long.
>Dave_Stone: ?ENNRSS K3 SiNNERS +73 167
#note This is the 7th opponent in 14 games to draw a bingo off of a draw of 6 or 7 tiles.  <<sigh>>
>Jim_Burlant: ABIORTT L1 OBIT +18 158
#note This is what happens when you literally watch every other opponent draw 6 or 7 tiles into a bingo, and without missing a bingo you're out-bingoed 11 - 3 in your last 5 games and you're looking at literally the 11th no-go bingo in that same stretch (in this case, the 8, ABATTOIR, doesn't play).  To this point in this game I've played within reason, but this play was a major miss that may have cost me whatever chance I had at this game. BIRRETTA E5 scores 40.  Even BIOTA L1 (which I never saw) would have been an improvement on this.  That said, even if I find BIRETTA, he still comes back with WAX for 39 on his next turn:
>Dave_Stone: AWX M1 WAX +55 222
>Jim_Burlant: AENRTTT 2L ..TT +12 170
#note Surprisingly, this is best.  26% to win.
>Dave_Stone: ?CEIPRR 7H CRe.PIER +73 295
#note Yet another opponent with a bingo/x-bomb/bingo sequence. <<sigh>>
>Jim_Burlant: AEENRTV B8 .EVANTER +88 258
#note Still alive, but only by the hair of my chinny chin chin.  12% to win.
>Dave_Stone: GIOU O4 GUI.O +24 319
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHIMS 6M AH. +29 287
#note I saw AHA A13 for 31 but felt it would make it too easy for him to gum up the southwest, so I opted for this.  In addition to row 11, I was also hoping I could find something ending in IUS or OUS down the C column so I hadn't given up hope just yet.  Q agrees - this is best.  22% to win.  
>Dave_Stone: CIU 15A U.IC +27 346
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOPS 14N MA +19 306
#note Didn't look very hard here - best is apparently MISPAGE 11E for 48, which I never saw.  My misguided thought process was that I needed the home-run ball and I didn't look for the double.  MISPAGE may have kept it close enough for me to still win...or it may not have been enough depending on whether I drew a useless Q with the extra turnover.  Anyway - played off the A instead of the O since there were 3 A's unseen and 2 O's.
>Dave_Stone: EFIO 11H FO.IE +18 364
#note <<sigh>>
>Jim_Burlant: AEILOPS 12L LAP +29 335
#note And SPOILAGE for 94 gets blocked.  :-(  Again, still playing off the A because I'm hoping for a miracle ending in OUS down the C column, but this is bleak.
#note Annotation stops here:  he scores 26 on his next turn, my next rack is AEEIIOS, he draws a bunch of heavy consonants and gets both the J and Q.  I Q-stick him to close spread.  Final score 409 - 446.  Maybe this turns out differently if I play BIRRETTA for 40 instead of OBIT for 18 (+22 for me) and he comes back with WAXfor 39 (-17 for him) - a 39-point swing in a game I lost by 37 points.  Ouch.
