>Evans_Clinchy: EEINNUV 8D VENUE +24 24
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: IOSV D8 .IVOS +22 22
#note Noooooo, this is phony! I realized like 2 turns later that hey, wait a minute, maybe I should have challenged that.
>Evans_Clinchy: EFINTUX 7E FIX +45 69
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: ES 7E ...ES +18 40
>Evans_Clinchy: BEGNOTU E11 BOG +22 91
#note Completely whiffed on UNBEGOT. Just didn't even look for a bingo.
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: Y F6 Y.. +14 54
>Evans_Clinchy: EGNNTUW 5B UNWET +23 114
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: AEEINRS 13E .ESNERIA +61 115
>Evans_Clinchy: DEGINRT M9 GRIND +40 154
#note Thought about just dinking away the D for 22 and fishing with the ENGIRT stem, but nah. 18 extra points is a lot, and I don't mind extra turnover with 2 blanks still in the bag. Sim agrees with GRIND.
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: OZ F10 ZO +36 151

>Evans_Clinchy: AAGHLOY 14F HOYA +40 340
#note OFAY's better, missed it.
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: ?EIINOR 15I NOIsIER +71 291
>Evans_Clinchy: AGILMOQ M2 QI +26 366
#note The unseen tile pool is pretty Q-friendly, including two U's and a blank, so keeping it isn't terrible here. Quackle likes GLIOMA M1 and OFLAG 1A. Interesting. I played QI without much thought - a small mistake.
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: ADEJP 6H JAPED +33 324
>Evans_Clinchy: AGKLMOU 5K MOK. +31 397
#note Bad bad bad. Missed LEUKOMA in the double-double lane for 52. Also ALUM fits above JAPED for 38.
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: DLU L11 DU.L. +17 341
>Evans_Clinchy: AACGHLU 4K AH +29 426
#note At this point the pool is horrifying and he's almost sure to bingo, and there's not much I can do to block. The plan is to score, leave 1 in the bag and outrun him in the endgame. His 1-tile rack won't score much next turn.
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: ?AELNRS 1B .uNERALS +83 424
>Evans_Clinchy: ACCGLPU 9H PLUG +21 447
#note CALPAC and CAPUL are words but I wasn't totally sure. I had time to recount the whole game and guarantee that PLUG won by 1, so I chose that.
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan: T E7 ..T +8 432
#note Phew. Close one.
>Hassan_Hadi_Khan:  (ACC) +14 446
