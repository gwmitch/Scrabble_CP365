#note It took some effort for me to find this, and I thought this placement would make it easier to keep the board closed after. Strangely enough, my backup play of D(I)TCH sims about equal to either bingo. No so sure I agree on that. When I'm given the chance to strike first, I should take it. 
>Jeff_Fleetham: ABII 12H .IBIA +14 22
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEEJOR M11 JEE +28 92
#note I thought about either REJOICE but they both tempted bad consequences. Then I remembered that I could just do this (and shut down easy hooks).
>Jeff_Fleetham: IIIII -IIIII +0 22
>Matthew_Larocque: CEOORRT 14H .OCTOR +26 118
#note CRORE is a word apparently for 37, but I don't think this is too much worse. Keeps the board pretty bad for him aside from that wide open S.
>Jeff_Fleetham: AEIZ F5 AZI.E +34 56
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGINOR 9H .O +6 124
#note I think this is justified, EARING bingos with a lot of letters and he can't do much to stop me.
>Jeff_Fleetham: HLL 5E H.LL +14 70
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGINRS J4 REAGINS +68 192
#note Duh, just play REGAINS for an extra two points. I probably spent too much time here looking at every seven to find the best defense.... 
>Jeff_Fleetham: AEEN 4I A.ENE +10 80
#note Jeff not having a good game so far...
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DDMSTW M3 D.W +14 206
#note Missed ST(O)W(S) for 32 which also shuts down the S and protects my lead.
>Jeff_Fleetham: BDENR 8J .NBRED +36 116
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DGMSTT K3 G.M +20 226
#note Now that DA is valid, this felt like a better fish than it otherwise would have been.
>Jeff_Fleetham: IOTUV 13C OUTVI. +18 134
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DOSTTU 3C STOUTeD +75 301
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DOSTTU --  -75 226
#note I barely even doubted if this was valid! I missed the eight OUTSTOOD and didn't know TESTUDOS. 
>Jeff_Fleetham: GMU 3G GUM +18 152
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DOSTTU 11E OUT. +8 234
#note I was stuck without seeing the valid bingos.... If I know DOUTS, that scores 29 at least. Pretty weak.
>Jeff_Fleetham: IPQ D12 Q.IP +36 188
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEFSTY 15K EFS +33 267
#note STY/JEERS to get rid of the Y, or D(E)FY to keep the stellar EST?. But then I'd be limited to playing a bingo down to the D.
>Jeff_Fleetham: AIN 6D NA.I +20 208
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADLSTY 6L AY +16 283
#note DOCTORLY! As usual when I lose a turn and then fail to find bingos, I was wasting too much time. I quickly played this to give me some breathing room. It might have been better to just play off the Y. Either way I was still in the mindset of playing a bingo even though I should be protecting my lead.
>Jeff_Fleetham: INV 9C VIN. +13 221
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADELST O8 .ESALTeD +80 363
#note But I get lucky, this time around.
>Jeff_Fleetham: RU G1 RU. +4 225
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEOPY 1G .EPAY +30 393
#note Only 80% sure PEERY is good, so I play REPAY to be safe.
>Jeff_Fleetham: EFKLRTW 4B FLEW +29 254
>Matthew_Larocque: AEOX B9 OX +33 426
#note (F)AX then N5 OE or the other way around looks like the best sequence.
>Jeff_Fleetham: KRT K11 K. +12 266
>Matthew_Larocque: AE C3 A.E +6 432
#note Play off the X, duh, but I ran out of time.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (RT) +4 436
#note Got way too lucky, and played silly for that whole second half.
