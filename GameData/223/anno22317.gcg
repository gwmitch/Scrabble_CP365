>Jim_Burlant: BEIOTTU 8G BOUT +12 12
#note Yuck. This is lame.  Don't ask me how, but I just couldn't think of BUTEO - not that it would have stopped him from bingoing on his next turn:  
>Ben_Withers: AACEIMN F6 ANAEMIC +76 76
#note This plays at 9E for 81 and would have prevented this:
>Jim_Burlant: DEIOSTT 11D OT.TIDES +86 98
#note Best bingo.
>Ben_Withers: AFG 10J FAG +30 106
>Jim_Burlant: IINNOOS H11 .NION +18 116
#note Less may be a bit more here:  I(C)ON 12E keeps better balance.  Better yet would have been 12B IONIC to clear the vowel overload...though it does give an awful lot back if he's got a B.  49% to win.
>Ben_Withers: GLRR E3 GRRL +12 118
#note Confusion with the new words:  GRRRL is the good word.  GRRL*  is phony and I should have challenged it.
>Jim_Burlant: EEIOSXY D11 .XEYE +32 148
#note Board blindness.  OXIC and EXEC score 46.  I was too busy grooming the rack, if you can call an IOS leave rack grooming.  59% to win, but my letting him get away with GRRL* was about to bit me big-time:
>Ben_Withers: ?ADEHOT 4C tH.OATED +74 192
#note Or CHORDATE.  This is Ben's best play and he's 67% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: ABIOSUW C13 BOW +34 182
#note  I saw a chance to unload BW and score 34 and that was enough for me.  Q agrees - this is best, but it's bleak - I've blundered my way to 30% winning chances.
>Ben_Withers: EEFRY 3I FEYER +42 234
>Jim_Burlant: AADILSU 15A LA..D +27 209
#note Statically, fishing with UTA is best, but I felt I had to score first and rack-build second.  A sim can't decide if UTA or this is best, as these two plays toggle back/forth atop a sim approaching  2000 iterations.  I opted to score because, if there had been one constant to this day, the fish just were not going to bite so I might as well take my points.  21.7% to win.
>Ben_Withers: GV L2 V.G +14 248
>Jim_Burlant: AILSUUV 6B UVU.. +10 219
#note With this garbage it didn't occur to me to try and score. A sim thinks VISUAL M8 is the star play - I think it sucks since it kills the board and I still will trail by a half step after his next play.  5K VAU looks best here but I just wanted to unload both those U's.   22% to win.
>Ben_Withers: JNN 13G J.NN +20 268
>Jim_Burlant: AIILPRS 12K PILI +17 236
#note Just trying to open a line and give myself a chance to hook my S.  25% to win.
>Ben_Withers: CEEHKLT 14B H.. +28 296
#note  One form of luck you need to do well in tournaments is opponent mistakes, and I caught two HUGE breaks here.  This was Ben's actual rack, and for reasons he couldn't fathom post-mortem, he absoutely struggled to find a play he was happy with here. He had flashed every one of these tiles at one point and couldn't figure out what to do until he put this down for points.  He realized afterwards that if he'd played CHIEL or CHILE N10, the game would have been over.  Instead, watch what happens:
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAILRS O6 ARgALIS +79 315
#note .  I wasn't entirely sure the hook was good but given the situation I had nothing to lose when I put this down.  The source of my confusion is that it's HILI that doesn't take the S.  The bingo I couldn't think of was LATRIAS.  RADIALS also looks good here.  This is a lot better than nothing, but it still gives back huge Z plays.  Fortunately for me, I was about to catch my second break:
>Ben_Withers: CEEKNQT -  +0 296
#note Ben only knew of PILI as the plural of PILUS; he was unaware that PILI is a Philippine tree of some kind that pluralizes with S
>Jim_Burlant: AEOQRRW 2J WA.ER +60 375
#note Too many points available to worry about dumping the Q just yet. This is best - 90% to win.
>Ben_Withers: CEKU N4 CUKE +38 334
>Jim_Burlant: IMOOQRS 11N Q. +22 397
#note More patience is needed - with 3B QI and N11 QI available, the Q can wait - I need to be more concerned with taking out row 1.  ROOM 1H looks best here.
>Ben_Withers: EOP M6 OPE +23 357
>Jim_Burlant: IMNOORS 1G MORON +35 432
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  MORION is apparently a hair better.  I wanted  to leave a vowel, but I can see why Q doesn't like it, as it does give back ZA for 35 if he has it.
>Ben_Withers: DEIISTT 13L TIS +24 381
>Jim_Burlant: AEISZ 2F ZA +35 467
>Ben_Withers: DEIT 9E T.ED +14 395
#note Ben also went over on time.  Final score recorded as 483 - 371.
>Jim_Burlant: EIS 1M SEI +14 481
>Jim_Burlant:  (I) +2 483
