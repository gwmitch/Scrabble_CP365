>Brian_Bowman: EIINNRT H7 TINNIER +66 66
#note Game seven, win the game, win the tourney... lose, maybe third and cash, maybe lower and nothing.  So of course, opp bingoes to open.  Don't panic...
>Pete: AAFFILR 13F FI.FARAL +88 88
>Pete: AAFFILR --  -88 0
#note So naturally, I panic.  I was hoping that this would be low prob enough to be allowed to pass, and Brian held for a long time... but he kicked it off.  I did not know TAFFRAIL, and with the exception of fifteen-twenty of you, most of whom wouldn't deign to check out my games, you didn't either.
>Brian_Bowman: HLOW 12D WHOL. +22 88
>Pete: AAFFILR 13H .AFFIA +26 26
#note Other than the bingo, mine's the top equity play, but sims a shade behing FAR 13f.  I wanted to throw the board open a bit.
>Brian_Bowman: AMTU 11C MAUT +29 117
>Pete: CKLPRUV L11 PR.CK +36 62
#note I hated leaving LUV, but it seemed the only reasonable option, and duck agrees.  best.
>Brian_Bowman: BOS 15L .OBS +30 147
>Pete: EELOUVZ K8 LEVO +22 84
#note Duck likes the cute OVULE g5.  I wanted to keep things open and score, while hopefully drawing into a big Z play.
>Brian_Bowman: BDEEI L4 BEEDI +21 168
>Pete: AEINTUZ 10B ZA +35 119
#note Not exactly what I had in mind, but EINTU has some potential, and it's time to cut bait and take what I can with the Z.  best
>Brian_Bowman: INX M3 NIX +33 201
>Pete: EIJNPTU 9C JUT +38 157
#note I know I'm in for it here, with the spot he opened up.  I can't really block, and I just have to hope he can't totally kill me with it.  best.  I wanted to open a new line.
>Brian_Bowman: HMO K4 OHM +51 252
#note ugh.  Everytime I threaten to make a game of it, he scores huge.  
>Pete: DEEINPQ G8 QI +26 183
#note Duck says it's best.  I hate the play tho.  It kills one of the precious few good lines.  I took forever trying to find a reasonable alternative, a cute setup, anything.  I almost exchanged, but couldn't pull the trigger.  wise choice, I guess.
>Brian_Bowman: EORY O11 OYER. +12 264
#note And Brian shuts the board down further.  oh brother.
>Pete: DEELNPT 6K ..ET +19 202
#note I miss the cool extension.  Duck likes LINED just about as well.
>Brian_Bowman: AEERSU O4 RESEAU +28 292
#note At this point, I got frustrated and went on a shooting spree... well, not really... but after losing the previous two games while being significantly outtiled, and now seeing the board excellently shut down, I'm starting to get a bit angry.  I'm seeing the money fly away.
>Pete: DELNPSU F11 ..LU +6 208
#note Let's open a new line... duck likes PUL 13B, which I don't really get. It's second choice, UNJAM, is more to my liking.  My play, not so good... 
>Brian_Bowman: AA 14I AA +13 305
>Pete: ADDENPS N2 PA +10 218
#note Let's keep on opening.  I'm still thinking there's a chance to win. Duck likes DEDANS 15A
>Brian_Bowman: ?ACIORT I1 CORTInA +63 368
#note RICOtTA 2 points better, but it's pretty academic.  CORTINA is tougher to bingo thru.
>Pete: DDENOSV 1G DO. +18 236
#note I'm torn... I still think I can bingo twice, but I also need to bingo at this point to save spread.  a blowout kills my cashing chances.  with the blank unseen, I also don't want him bingoing and killing my spread.
>Brian_Bowman: DNWY 2H D.WNY +23 391
>Pete: DELNSSV 15G VELD +34 270
#note Scored as 35.  
>Brian_Bowman: EGOR 3E ROGE. +12 403
#note Yep, I'm screwed.  I'm not gonna cash.  Brian's gonna kill the last line, which I can't hit, and I am dead.  As long as he doesn't fish, I'll need a miracle.

>Pete: ?EGNSST E1 ST.oNGES. +68 338
#note After a few seconds of wallowing in self pity and anger, I look at the board.  I notice the Column E line, and start with the EST end and STR front, and the play jumps at me.  I find it, and end up cashing by 14 points.
>Pete:  (EGIIN) +12 350
