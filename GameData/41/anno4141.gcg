#note NIXY wins the sim by two or so. Everyone I asked likes NIXY. This was a stupid play, I do this type of thing too often on opening plays when it is not merited.

#note god i suck donkey balls. 5 more points idiot!

#note this exchange is sort of stupid. but they all are, too. i don't know. i know i drew bad tiles and am about to draw more bad tiles, though.
>Orange_Pants: EOQRU K3 ROQUE. +30 69
>Dooger: AEGGNUW 4H WAG.N +26 131
#note sim conclusively likes WAGE 12L. hmmmph. seemed too risky at the time. but keeps a better leave for more points. maybe that was the play.
>Orange_Pants: FLO H1 FLO. +30 99
>Dooger: EGGSTUU 1H .UGU +8 139
#note thought FUGU was obvious...GLUG sims 3.5 points better. certainly helped by having all the Us on the board. stil, an unexpected result to me. i guess i overrated EGST and underrated ESTU at least a little on both sides.

>Dooger: EIINNOY N9 OY +30 357
#note Champ Player likes OI 14J. huh? i'd think OY is the spread play. things like INANELY are easily blocked.
