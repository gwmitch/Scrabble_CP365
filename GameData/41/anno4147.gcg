#note DETACHER F5 seems like a slightly-lame word that scores 3 better.

#note Quack is a lot more V-phobic than I am, probably rightly so. It suggests V(A)IL 8A. With nice Q-tiles in hand and 3 Us still out, that seems like the way to go.

#note I hated this play when I made it, and still do now. This just closes the board too much. GAUZ(E) - L1 seems like a much better chance to win.

#note What else? Have to open while scoring enough that a bingo will still matter.

#note A desperate play. Suggestions?

>Big_K: EEGLMRW 5D G.. +5 338
#note Hmm. If I can dump the G and draw one of those Os, maybe the duck will come up with one of its distorted pre-endgame win percentages and not block row 2.

#note No dice. MOREE(N) and MERLO(N) - N10 are two points better.
