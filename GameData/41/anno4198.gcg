#note I hated this rack, and this play, But at this point, I was dead tired, and rather stupidly thought that I should make a B play difficult.  Which my play doesn't actually accomplish.  Duck likes AJEE 9B, which I considered.  I didn't consider 9F EAT, which I actually really like.

>Steve_Grob: AAGINSU I2 IGUANAS +75 101
#note Nice find by Steve.  This is the kind of seven that's easy to miss.
>Pete: AADEEWW 9F WAD +28 48
#note drawing into AAEE, i suppose it could have been worse.  I considered duck's choice of WAW, but I like my play.  At this point, I am less concerned about dumping both Ws and more concerned about maximizing points, and not surrendering quite so much in return as WAW at j5.
>Steve_Grob: FI J1 IF +26 127
>Pete: ACEEEPW 10D WEEP +33 81
#note Best.  Considered a bunch of options, but nothing else came close.
>Steve_Grob: ?DEKRST 5E STRE.KeD +98 225
#note Ruh roh.
>Pete: ACEEQTU 4A QUATE +50 131
#note After Steve's last play, I no longer have the slightest compunction about throwing the board open.  I did consider QUATE f2, but that was just way too aggressive.  
>Steve_Grob: AFOY 4L OFAY +34 259
>Pete: CDENNOU K5 .NOUNCED +70 201
#note Tried in vain to find a better bingo, there were none.  After this play, my nagging feelings of "screw this, let's go home" vanished.  I wanted to find a way to pull this rabbit out of the hat.  I was hoping for a challenge; Steve held for a while, but let it go.  
>Steve_Grob: BMO 3L MOB +34 293
>Pete: EIINNSS C7 .INS +22 223
#note I considered fishier plays, but settled on JINS, which duck agrees with.  I don't like killing the (admittedly weak) line, but I have to keep scoring to stay in contact, and it does serve to make the 11 row a little less dangerous.
>Steve_Grob: ?AAEILV 12G VALI.AtE +74 367
#note The only bingo.  Steve's gotta like where he is right now.  I certainly don't.

>Pete: EEGINOS O7 GENOISE +90 313
#note No brainer.  puts me back in contact, but my timing is awful.  I still need a lot of help.
>Steve_Grob: ABY N8 BAY +35 402
>Pete: EHILLRX 3C HILL +29 342
#note Wow, a big miss.  I was hung up trying to draw into a big X play and a bingo draw that I missed the big X play.  My play sims second, about 11 points behind.    
>Steve_Grob: HO 11D OH +25 427
>Pete: EINRRTX H11 T.XER +36 378
#note Unable to will Steve into giving me an E to play through, I decide to score and open, and hope for a miracle.  Duck agrees.  Nothing else is close.
>Steve_Grob: GIV 12B VIG +28 455
#note Steve originally set down VERTIGO 14G, then picked it up for this.  I started to see hope...  
>Pete: AEIINRT 14A INERTIA. +70 448
#note I quickly play the bingo, as steve is a little short on time.  Duck says the winningest play is NINE 6I.  Interesting gambit.  Of course, that counts on Steve not blocking the obvious bingo line.  LI I12 also beats the bingo. I still think that against a real live human being, I have to bingo.  
>Steve_Grob: CELORRT M7 ROC +22 477
#note Steve finds one of his many wins. TORE 15A sims best.
>Pete: DMPR A13 D.P +18 466
#note RAMP sims best, as it blocks his out, but I still was hoping that between time shortness, and and human nature, maybe steve would miss the out, and not score, or maybe run over.
>Steve_Grob: ELRT H1 ER +12 489
#note The outs at L11 sim best, but this does the job.  
>Pete: MR N3 ..RM +14 480
#note My part of the endgame worked, but Steve didn't cooperate.  All I get is a 484 point loss.
>Pete:  (LT) +4 484
