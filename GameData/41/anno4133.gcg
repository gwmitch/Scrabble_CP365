>Noah_Walton: AJLOPRZ 8G ZAP +28 28
#note Already yucky, as I miss JALOP to start off!
>Nathan_Benedict: AEELOSY 9G AYE +30 30
>Noah_Walton: AGJLOOR 7H JOG +31 59
>Nathan_Benedict: ELNOSTW 10H SNOW +29 59
#note I kind of like NOW here. While SNOW scores great, ELST is great, especially on a board with 4 S hooks open. If Nathan draws a bingo, it is almost guaranteed to play.
>Noah_Walton: AALMNOR 11J MOLA +26 85
>Nathan_Benedict: DEILMTU 12K TIMED +34 93
>Noah_Walton: AAENNRR O12 .ARN +15 100
#note I really agonized over this play. I thoughth about playing AR(E)NA, but didn't like what it did to the board. Unfortunately, I overlooked ERRAN(D), which looks like the best play.
>Nathan_Benedict: CEKLTUU 14J KULTU. +40 133
#note The slaughter begins.
>Noah_Walton: AEINOOR 15G NAOI +18 118
#note I held KULTUR for a long time, as it was so devastating with such good tiles. I finally let it go because it looked really familiar.
>Nathan_Benedict: BCEHNOT 14F COB +19 152
#note I think Nathan made a great play here, closing the board so I have to open to do anything, and keeping a good leave for when I do. Quackle prefers HOB or TECHNO, but I like this play best.
>Noah_Walton: DEEEOOR G11 ODE.. +7 125
#note Quackle puts DOE, OE, and exchanging EEOO at the top. I am put in a dilemma here. DOE closes down the board and doesn't leave me much. This opens the board and makes t hard for him to close. However, I certainly would've played DEE(JAYS) if I had seen it. I disagree with Quackle here.
>Nathan_Benedict: EFHNTTU 12B TUFTE. +20 172
>Noah_Walton: EEGHLOR B10 HO.EL +32 157
>Nathan_Benedict: ?AEHILN A4 HyALINE +94 266
>Noah_Walton: ACEGRRV 6I CARVER +29 186
>Nathan_Benedict: AEFIUVY A13 FAY +34 300
>Noah_Walton: ?EGINSX B6 XI +52 238
#note The perfect rack to stage a comeback! Quackle prefers EX to this, so I guess GINS is better.
>Nathan_Benedict: ABEITUV C3 VIBE +28 328
>Noah_Walton: ?EGINOS E5 GOoNIES. +82 320
#note GeNOISE wins a sim here. I guess GeNOISE is better because it scores more, plus it sets up a strong S hook while blocking another strong S hook. And if I draw the S, it can really damage Nathan here.
>Nathan_Benedict: AEGITTU 13A ..TA +23 351
#note Quackle likes G(AM)UT or GUITA(R). I like this or G(AM)U(T) here. The question is: is GAMUT worth the point sacrifice?
>Noah_Walton: DPQRRRW M4 DR.W +12 332
#note A heartbreaking draw!
>Nathan_Benedict: EGIINTU M2 UN.... +20 371
#note I thank Nathan played this to "draw" a challenge. What about something like (D)IG? That really blocks stuff off. I like DIG here, myself.
>Noah_Walton: EIPQRRS -  +0 332
#note I have one play that wins at all here, according to Quackle. The play is QIS. It wins 25% of the time. Low on time, I didn't think it could win, and it took too long to figure out. Instead, UNDREW looked like a ridiculous word to me, because I was thinking about drawing cards. Actually, it has to do more with something like curtains. It turns out QI wasn't going to win anyway in this situation.
>Nathan_Benedict: DEEGIIT 3H DIETI.G +10 381
#note Quackle rates this second best, to TIGE(R) K2. They both win all the time.
>Noah_Walton: EIPQRRS O4 QIS +34 366
>Nathan_Benedict: ES K5 E.S +18 399
#note To wrap up a very well-played game by Nathan. He deserved this one.
>Nathan_Benedict:  (EPRR) +12 411
