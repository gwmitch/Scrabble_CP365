#note i think this was her rack.  keeping X to score in one of the spots next turn seems reasonable... there are tons of great X spots, and all she has to do is draw a vowel and she's got some good choices.  and there are three As unseen...

#note so i want to block both PIXY and the easier EX spot. I would've played TAB otherwise. this also keeps the ambiguity level high, and since jan has a great endgame, i figure ambiguity is good for me.  this also might make her think As in the bag, which might help me later.
