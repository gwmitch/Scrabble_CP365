#note i almost didn't see that this still played up top.  hooking to EOBIONT scores more. i should count these things up rather than just going for the stylish.

>k8: EEIOQSU G4 QUE.. +14 113
#note  he blocks both QUOIT and QUITE/QUIET and i have no other backup, and i took a long time with the other racks. quackle wants me to hold on to EIQSU.  or maybe SUQ for the points holding EEIO.  this is overvaluing a bad rack.
>vince: ?AELNRS 11D .LeANERS +82 222
>k8: BEILLOS M3 BILLOSE +82 195
#note basically, i felt like i had to make something happen, and decided that this looked enough like a word that it might slide by (or i might lose by a million).  he held for a couple minutes.

#note i think this was my leave?  i can't read my writing. if it is, then i should play ANYONE or ANONYM and open up the bottom of the board.
>vince: GNP 4L P.NG +34 294
>k8: CDEENOU 8L U.ED +18 245
#note i considered CONGEE, but thought it gave up too much to ever get caught up, and putting a C at the top is not likely to help me bingo in the top of the board.  hoping he'll slot something useful there, i go for decent rack balance and a lane from the D...

>k8: FINPRRU H1 UNRIP +40 369
#note i kind of hate opening the top of the board, but i feel like i still need to score here.  i'm also running low on time (for me - like less than 8 minutes, probably) and i want the time for the endgame.  he held for awhile.
>vince: AO H11 .O.A +5 350
>k8: AEEFHJR 14F AF.R +24 393
#note it felt like i had to muck up the lane here, but maybe i didn't.  maybe i shoudl just assume he's gonna bingo somewhere, and move on. the most points i saw were 31 (HAJ), and i decided that giving up 7 points, holding the J to score, and breaking the lane as best i could was the best choice here.  i also have about 4 minutes left by the time i've worked all of this out so i'm freaking out a little.

#note really don't want to Z on this rack. trying not to get Z or J stuck.  argh. i lost on the last turn + this draw.
