#note Almost considered REEFAGE*.  No kidding.
>eyedoc: AINRY 7E RAINY +30 30
#note Counted as 29.  This single point *may* play a role in the end result.
>sneaky: AEEGIRT I6 E.. +6 18
#note So I'm exhausted at this point and I'm thinking how good AEGIRT works with various consonants.  Me tired, brain no work good.  GIE/GRAINY is best, with GAITER/TRIAGE (on the same row) not too far behind.

>sneaky: AEEGIRT D7 GAITER +29 47
#note Nice draw, moron.  OK, let's blow it up.  Quackie agrees.
>eyedoc: ARUW C11 WAUR +21 73
>sneaky: ?CEESSW 9H ESChEWS +77 124
#note Saw C(R)EWlESS 14b for 74 but somehow blanked on SC(R)EWErS one spot over.  Whoopee, it's only one more.
>eyedoc: EIOO 14A OO.IE +10 83
#note Dangerous, are we? Gotta assume most/all of her other tiles are vowels.
>sneaky: ?BELLLO A12 OB.L +21 145
#note Briefly contemplated BELL(H)OLe* and BOwL(H)ELL*.  Surprised to see my play sims on top along with BOL(A) f4.
>eyedoc: GOX J4 GOX +52 135
#note Yep.  Carry on.
>sneaky: ?EIKLLS 15E SKILLEd +82 227
#note Yeah, that's how talented I am.
>eyedoc: HINNY 14J HINNY +52 187
#note Ruh roh.  Time to start worrying.
>sneaky: CDDQRTT -CDDQTT +0 227
#note And continue to fret as the consonants mount.  No problem, there's still lots of Scrabble to be played.

#note Hello again, Mr. Q.  There could be a tendency to hold on to the B for the IOTA hook, but I ignored that notion.
>eyedoc: AIOTU 4I A.OUTI +14 285
#note Someone has the case S.  I'm guessing it's not me.
>sneaky: DEHINRR K3 N.H +22 319
#note With only 1/3 vowels remaining, I thought it was a good idea to retain both while still counting decently.
>eyedoc: ABDU 3C DAUB +21 306
#note Mesmerized by the IOTA spot, I guess she didn't see the same at 13k for 9 more.
>sneaky: DDEEIRR G2 REDE +28 347
#note I ignored my earlier warning of vowel shortage and maxed out.  DE e11 or ID e10 are clearly better.
>eyedoc: ENV 8A VEN.. +24 330
>sneaky: CDDIQRT D2 Q.T +24 371
#note Boy, Scrabble is more stressful when you're tired as hell.  Thought about just Q(I) at n3 to block the O column, but saw POIS o1 as a possible larger setup.
>eyedoc: FMOPSTU O1 FOPS +39 369
>sneaky: CDDIIR E10 ID +24 395
#note I had plenty of time to look at this play.  I was hoping for more, but then I saw that her best outplay and my remainder would result in a 1-point victory.
>eyedoc: MTU M1 MUT. +12 381
#note Which should lead to a tie, although...
>eyedoc:  (CDIR) +14 395
#note ...let's not forget her first move was underscored by ONE and confirmed as THE SAME by both of us on the recount.  I don't think she could've played the endgame any differently.  Maybe other than re-checking the RAINY score another time.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
