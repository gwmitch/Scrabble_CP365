>Sharon_Moser: AGIV 8E VAGI +16 16
>Jason: AADEIOX E7 A.OID +18 18
#note Or AXE at 7G (the clear sim leader) or ODEA at 9G, a cute setup. (-1)
>Sharon_Moser: CLT 9C CL.T +11 27
>Jason: ACEILMX C9 .IMEX +32 50
#note Losing play No. 1: The bingo miss here. I played (C)LIMAXEs in a game recently and was so focused on the fact that the D was in the wrong spot ... never occurred to me a seven could be available. (-53)
>Sharon_Moser: DEEGOST B12 DOGE +24 51
#note (Sharon's exact rack. Staticly best.)
>Jason: ACEIILV 15A L.AVE +36 86
#note Best. Considered C(E)ILI, but Duck agrees that the 12 extra (despite leaving CII vs. AEV) is worth it.
>Sharon_Moser: JO A11 JO +15 66
>Jason: CIIMSUW -IMUW +0 86
#note Missed UMI(A)C, 7B. (-9)
>Sharon_Moser: EOSSTTU I2 OUTSETS +68 134
#note Losing play No. 2. As soon as VAGI went down, I thought "I'm pretty sure I should challenge an -S hook." But then this goes down and I think: "Well, she had it at 14E for five less or 7H for seven less ... Pete made a comment before the game about how I was 1900 a few months ago ... why would she risk it?" Ugh. I was letting phonies go using stupid thought processes during my lengthy stay in the 1400s (and before). And it sometimes seems like I've progressed embarrassingly little in that department.
>Jason: CFISTYY 6F FYC. +20 106
#note F(E)Y is slightly preferred by Duck. (-1)
>Sharon_Moser: ADQ 3H Q.AD +14 148
>Jason: IRRSTYZ D3 RITZY +39 145
>Sharon_Moser: GINP 2I .PING +27 175
>Jason: EINORRS M1 I.NORERS +70 215
#note Only playable.
>Sharon_Moser: BDEEORS 14E BEDSORE +68 243
#note Considered that I just learned this word in study, it was unnerving to see it thrown at me here. After the game she asked if it had an anagram. It plays for three more at 12E.
>Jason: ?EEOPRW 15H OWE +31 246
#note Whew. One of those "I know I'm missing something" racks where I wasn't. Maybe I should've "flexed" and played (D)EPOWERs*, put the onus on her. So disappointing that POWEREd was blocked by a bingo. Yay for this simming clearly best.
>Sharon_Moser: BHT 4L B.TH +26 269
#note Eh? Where in blazes are these vowels? I had quite a few games like that this weekend, where we burned through the consonants early and the endgame was Vowel City.
>Jason: ?EMNPRW 13I MEW +30 276
#note Wow, W(E)N at F13, sims way clear of anything else. Never would've considered it. (-13)
>Sharon_Moser: AEFHLL 12J FELLAH +45 314
#note Whoa. Held for probably about two minutes, but wisely did not challenge. Sharon said it was one of those situations where she wasn't sure if she wanted me to challenge or not.
>Jason: ?AINNPR O12 .ARP +27 303
#note Didn't know the obvious play of HARPIN. Looked for a opening play top left, didn't see NAP at C2. Bad, bad, bad. (-14)
>Sharon_Moser: ANTU O4 .AUNT +24 338
#note At dinner, Stock asked for suggestions for future tourneys. George (echoing my thoughts) asked why it was Division 1 made 12 and Div. 2 made 8 instead of the other way around. Stocky answered that usually people want to play up, so Div. 1 would be largest. Joyce said that Sharon was excited about playing D-1 "and she was more excited after her first game," winking at me. Yeah, apparently winning this game was a thrill for her. That was actually kinda nice to hear.
>Jason: ??INNNU 3C U.N +6 309
#note Sim says (D)UN is the better opener, to the tune of 98% wins (to 75% for this) and a hella valuation points. I think Quackle isn't considering a human's response to DUN, though. I took so long on HARP, I had only like two minutes left when this went down. (-34?)
>Sharon_Moser: EIU 5C E.UI +13 351
#note Sweet play No. 2 from her. I thought even if she blocked (she said she almost played UTE), I could still outrun with a good out in two while she drowned in vowels. UTE would've ended up losing by one, BTW. grrr...
>Jason: ??AEINN A8 bAN..s +42 351
#note Best, even though I think I might've gone wrong order. Problem is, it looks like all plays threatening BANJO as an out 1) are blocked by K(I) at 10B and 2) give her better plays in reply.
>Sharon_Moser: AIKOR 4G KI. +20 371
>Jason: EIN M12 .INE +8 359
#note Too many mistakes, too many good plays late from opponent.
>Jason:  (AOR) +6 365
