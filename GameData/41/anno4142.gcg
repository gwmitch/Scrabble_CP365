#note WAIL 7H is simming a little better. extra points and some good synergy...makes some sense. tho not great board-wise. so i don't really hate WHIG.

#note ugh, i realized after the game this was a mistake. at least i think it was. should have taken out the triple--ROUE probably. bad play here. perhaps frustration from having looked at IL first on the draw.

#note errrrm. i thought i had to get rid of all the high pointers with this deficit. didn't think of YAK 13M, which doesn't look too bad. other quackle faves are AQUAE and YANQUI. i do sorta like QUACKY tho. whaddya think?

#note blucky. perhaps OAF was better...but certainly not in the 9M spot champ player likes. idk.
