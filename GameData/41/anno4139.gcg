>Pete: CENNOTY 8H CONEY +28 28
#note Duck actually CONY 8G a touch better, which for 10 points seems kind of much. 
>Brian_Bowman: BILM L4 LIMB. +24 24
>Pete: ENRRTTV 5J TR.VET +18 46
#note Best on equity... Duck likes EVERT K8 just as well.  I wanted to turn over tiles, and I like being aggressive early.  If he can't hit me hard, I may get him sacrificing points and stronger tiles for defense.  Any thoughts on this position are welcome.
>Brian_Bowman: ADIR O5 .RIAD +18 42
>Pete: ?DINRST N8 NITRiDS +73 119
#note Turnover works.  TINDERS and NITRIDS the only playables.   My play sims best.
>Brian_Bowman: IILRX K8 .LIXIR +26 68
>Pete: AACGSUW M2 GUA.A +24 143
#note Didn't like any options here... I can't take any strong scoring spots, and all my decent plays leave poorly.  I was pleased to see GUAVA, and it sims best by a lot.
>Brian_Bowman: ?EIPSSZ 14F ZIPlESS +103 171
#note One of the disadvantages to being Brian Bowman is that you don't draw challenges on cool-ass plays like this one as often as you should.  CAPSIZES is better, but this has challenge equity... I didn't though, because he had too many places to scroe with those tiles, and he knows his power tiles bingoes very well.
>Pete: CEILOSW H12 WI.E +39 182
#note Easily best... I saw that I had the case S, and I survived his big play.  I'm scoring, and setting up a new line.  I like where I am at this point.
>Brian_Bowman: AHO J10 HAO +38 209
>Pete: CFJLOST 7I JO +36 218
#note best again... I hate my last draw, and I hate the leave, but I still figure I'm in decent shape here.
>Brian_Bowman: OOOO -OOOO +0 209
>Pete: CFLNQST 13G Q. +42 260
#note As much as I want to exchange, sacrificing the 42 easy points would be foolish.
>Brian_Bowman: ABEOPRT 4D PROBATE +76 285
>Pete: ACFLNST E3 C.AFT +20 280
#note FATAL sims best... CRAFT is a fairly bad miss.  I saw the opportunities on Row 2, but wanted to save the S.  CRAFT also sets up a place to score big with the S on a nonbingo.  FRANC in the same spot as CRAFT is far stronger.
>Brian_Bowman: EKLU 2J KLU.E +40 325
>Pete: AEEGLNS L11 EL +20 300
#note Duck likes EEL.  KEET is actually really sweet, fishing at a strong rack and setting up a very dangerous S spot.
>Brian_Bowman: IORVY 8A IVORY +50 375
#note And this, ladies and gents, is why FRANC was so much better than CRAFT.
>Pete: AEGNNNS H1 NAN. +12 312
#note All of a sudden, I'm a huge dog.  Duck likes NA 15E... I want to open a new line and untriple my Ns.  This NN draw is the kind of untimely draw that happened in my losses this weekend.
>Brian_Bowman: AAEGNOU D8 .UGAE +12 387
>Pete: EEGNOOS O13 EON +14 326
#note And I miss my bingo.  I forgot to look through the vowels... I tend to forget 5v8s exist.  OOGENIES Still leaves me a huge dog.  My play is very weak here.  Accomplishes nothing, although I did want to prevent a huge F play that, while unlikely, would kill me.
>Brian_Bowman: ADDEMNO B6 UN.IEWED +69 456
>Brian_Bowman: ADDEMNO --  -69 387
#note After holding, realizing I couldn't win, and not recognizing it in my recent prob study, where it would fit, I challenge.  I figured it was probably good, but it wasn't.
>Pete: EGHMOST E10 OHM +33 359
#note with his rack known, The cute HIGHT 10J wins more than 54%.  HM E11 and 1N, and HAG 11C also win above 50%.  
>Brian_Bowman: DEEINUW B6 WI.ED +24 411
#note OWE F4 sims best, which is counterintuitive.  WIVED blocks nicely.
>Pete: AEFGOST C12 FOG +22 381
#note My play has the best valuation, tho FAG there somehow has 9.2% win %.  I was pleased to see the unblockable setup.
>Brian_Bowman: DENU F9 ED +16 427
#note KLUGE takes a D... 
>Pete: AEST 15C SETA +24 405
#note I miss the cute TEASE.
>Pete:  (NU) +4 409
