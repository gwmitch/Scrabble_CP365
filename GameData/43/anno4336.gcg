#note Kenji proves that he's not worthy of winning the Nationals with this play, which takes Kenji from a 60-40 favorite all the way down to about a 5-1 underdog.  I'm not sure I would've found this play if I weren't distracted by Ian's play.  I generally don't play well if my opponent isn't.  I'd like to think I'd find this against Dave or Nigel, but I guess I'll never know.

#note If I play off the S, Ian blocks with TRIADS.  At the time, I think there's no way Ian would ever find that though.  It's Worth trying if the score were closer; alas...
