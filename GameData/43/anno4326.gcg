#note I like my play okay.  Trading is also possible.  I don't exactly like this board right now, especially after my opponent just played off FA.

>Kenji: IMOOSTT E3 TITMO.S. +30 225
#note Clearly I made this play for the style points.  Just kidding.  With two blanks out, and the S not having a lot of value, this play seems to make sense.

#note To be honest, I didn't even notice that this blocked TRAWLEYS.

>Kenji: ?BHIOOY H1 a.HY +45 373
#note Too conservative.  Let him bingo and try to hit the lucky shots.  Even though your spread is bad, there is still some value.  I'll adjust because this prevents some miracle wins, and my spread at this point is just hopeless, but still, -10
>AFiszbein: ARU 6B ARU. +8 252
#note Setting up the L hook.
>Kenji: BDFIOOO 5A OF +10 383
#note This is different, since it's not just bingos, but also scoring plays I have to worry about.

#note Kind of tempted to play TOLIDIN for style points.  Okay, not really.
