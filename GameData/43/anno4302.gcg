>Jason: BEEEHKQ 8G HEBE +18 18
#note Slightly preferred to the exchange keeping EH.
>Orry_Swift: AX 9G AX +25 25
#note Orry put down AXAL, then changed his mind.
>Jason: ACEEKQU 10C QUAKE +34 52
#note Even with the U, the only Q play.
>Orry_Swift: ?ADLORR E6 LAbR.DOR +66 91
#note Orry asked after the game if LABRADOR had an anagram. I suppressed my immediate reaction: "WTF are you asking me for?" Sure enough, Orry's instincts were right. LARbO(A)RD's a double-double and stops ...
>Jason: CEEIJOR 13E .EJOICER +76 128
#note this. RAILRO(A)D's also a double-double, but it gives up REJOICER too.
>Orry_Swift: DNP H12 P.ND +30 121
#note I dodge the S bullet.
>Jason: EGIMNUV L12 G.IM +20 148
#note Close. GRUM. I spent long enough on this move ... not sure why it never occurred to me. (-7)
>Orry_Swift: NOW 15L .OWN +27 148
>Jason: EINTUVY C10 .UEY +32 180
#note Oops. E(Q)UITY. (-5)
>Orry_Swift: CEHZ D4 CHEZ +49 197
>Jason: IIMNTVY F4 VIM +25 205
#note I'm starting to recognize a series of "I can't beat a 1900 drawing like this" draws.
>Orry_Swift: ABNO J10 BAN.O +17 214
>Jason: DIINPTY K9 YID +24 229
#note It was a little frustrating ... here I am knowing I need to turn over, but my racks won't let me. (Of course, I could've played off two more tiles when I missed EQUITY. I just never see that word in EIQTUY...)
>Orry_Swift: EGILNT L4 TINGLE +21 235
#note Wow. It's all still in the bag...
>Jason: INOPTTW M9 WOT +23 252
#note So, I play off three tiles for the fifth consecutive play. Whee!
>Orry_Swift: AFR N10 FAR +29 264
>Jason: EINPTTU 15A INPUTTE. +86 338
#note Eh, who needs power tiles? Orry held, trying to remember which of INPUTTED and UNPITTED are good. (Both.)
>Orry_Swift: ?ADEORU O4 READOUt +79 343
#note Three S's *still* out! Yikes! Orry said before the game his first three games were all decided on the last play. It looked like four in a row here...
>Jason: GILSTTV 13E ........S +36 374
#note Considered Duck's pick of VIG(I)L. Thing is, I saw this spot as 1) easier to hit (17/20 chance he draws at least one S) and 2) More dangerous than the F plays. Surprised VIGIL sims so far ahead; I stand by this play. (-6)
>Orry_Swift: IN 11E .IN +17 360
#note Nope, no F...
>Jason: AGILTTV K3 VITA +22 396
#note The A's a perfect draw. And then I inject needless drama into the endgame by forgetting the front hook for TINGLE. VITAL/A(TINGLE) all but seals it. Considering that I was only spread points behind Tangredi, who played at Table 1 the following round, this might've cost me my spot there. So close, yet so far... (-18)
>Orry_Swift: AEIL N2 ILEA +12 372
>Jason: EGLOSST F4 ...S +21 417
#note Naturally, I pull SS after my mistake. Thanks for the bailout, bag! A more complex endgame than it appeared, as it took me until now to see the 14F spot for the F (I was focused on 6J and 6N). However, blocking messes up my rack and Orry can take the only good S spot (7F) for himself. So, I took it first, leaving GLO(B)E, scoring enough even after FO(N). Glad CP agrees. Blocking FO(N) first is the same in the end, though.
>Orry_Swift: AFORS 7I AR +10 382
#note Somehow counted as 13. Orry thought FON was unblockable.
>Jason: EGLOST 14G O.T. +16 433
#note So had I at first, until I saw this.
>Orry_Swift: FOS I6 F.. +8 390
#note Orry was in big time trouble here. Five worse than OF, same spot.
>Jason: EGLS 4F .EG +9 442
#note Missed S(E)G(O), one better. Nice to, with the exception of one mistake, play such a solid game against such a great player and win, esp. considering the circumstances.
>Orry_Swift: OS I10 OS +11 401
#note Orry makes his best play and finishes with 0:00 on his clock.
>Orry_Swift:  (LS) +4 405
