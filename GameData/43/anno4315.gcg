#note I just went braindead here after Nigel misplayed this situation.  If I were thinking properly, I would realize I missed a golden opportunity.  I attribute this to rust and the fact that I had not played a world class player for a year or so before this.  Nigel just gave away the farm, and I essentually through the farm away here.  Nigel just telegraphed his whole rack: it pretty much had to have a D in it, and had to be a bingo line.  Basically his leave was something like RIDE, ADER, ADEN, or something of that sort.  Against this set, the best play is clearly TOLUID, as it threatens a lot and does well if he does hit bingos, and buys time if it doesn't.  Trying to outgun his obviously monster leave by trading is not even close to the correct theme here.  While there are a lot of killer draws (the Q, H, or K), I'm gonna have to live with them.  He will sacrifice the points to block if he misses, and I really just don't have any other options against that range.  (-16)

#note I need a hailmary here.  This seems like the best shot, as MOT gets blocked too easily, anything that scores can't hit very well or doesn't leave well.  The T is a great tile here, but unfortunately it has to go, since line 15 just isn't likely to work out.
