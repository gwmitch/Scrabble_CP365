>Phil_Wertheimer: ACEOSTU 8C ACETOUS +74 74
>Sam: IILOTTX 9E LOX +39 39
#note I think I whiffed on TOXIC D4--can't see myself passing that up if I see it.
>Phil_Wertheimer: FRZ C7 Z.RF +27 101
>Sam: EIIINTT E7 T..II +10 49
#note Remember, I basically know exactly which words Phil knows and which ones he doesn't.
>Phil_Wertheimer: LP 10C .L.P +26 127
>Sam: DEIKNTY D3 DENTI. +30 79
#note It might seem like it's not worth it to play a phony when SKY is pretty close to DENTIC in equity, but I disagree. I know Phil well--after SKY, he is likely to play something like TAV 7E (or even just something like GOX by itself), and he certainly won't open things up for me unless he has a huge play of his own. In the long run, DENTIC can help me out a lot.
>Phil_Wertheimer: DDEGINU C1 GUIDE +25 152
#note Phil didn't know DENUDING, but really beat himself up about choosing this over GNU 7G. The best non-bingo is DUDING 2A, making a cool hook.
>Sam: EFHKUVY 1A VU.H +45 124
#note Of course, he was mostly upset because GUIDE had me lucking into this play, saving an otherwise awkward rack.
>Phil_Wertheimer: AOV I5 AVO. +8 160
>Sam: CEEFKOY H1 COKEY +50 174
#note This was by far the riskiest phony. I did think all three phony words had some chance of being good, though.
>Phil_Wertheimer: DEERRSS 5H ..RD +16 176
>Sam: ?EFLMNP 2F FL.P +17 191
#note And all of a sudden, I've turned myself from a heavy underdog to a 70% favorite (according to Quackle, but that seems about right).
>Phil_Wertheimer: DIN 3H .IND +15 191
>Sam: ?EGIMNN A1 .ENoMING +89 280
>Phil_Wertheimer: AW D10 .AW +14 205
>Sam: ABEIINR 13B BANI +19 299
#note Quackle likes INIA 13C...this seems particularly insane, even for Quackle.
>Phil_Wertheimer: AGM 14A MAG +23 228
>Sam: EEINRRS 15B RERISEN +83 382
>Phil_Wertheimer: EJ G13 JE. +18 246
>Sam: AABEISW 12F WAB +22 404
#note Just AW is another choice, though this looks most defensive of any plays other than BA or something.
>Phil_Wertheimer: AEELRST 7I .UTTRY +10 256
>Phil_Wertheimer: AEELRST --  -10 246
>Sam: ?AAEIOS 3C ..EA +10 414
#note Easy static plays like JIAO or ABO are eliminated now that I know part of Phil's rack.
>Phil_Wertheimer: TY 4F TY. +12 258
>Sam: ?AAEIOS H11 A.O +14 428
>Phil_Wertheimer: ELORSTU I13 ET +14 272
>Sam: ?AEIOST L4 ISOlATE +73 501
#note This was probably a really stupid play. Bingoing after OI 4J is way more likely than I had thought, with 7H and 11H both open, plus unlikely fits at J9. ISOlATE was way too risky with that Q--I considered the Q, but thought it might be too hard to bingo if I didn't bingo now. 
>Phil_Wertheimer: EHQRRSU 10J QU.ERS +37 309
#note Of course, I luck out with what's in the bag.
>Sam: LOO O7 LOO. +12 513
