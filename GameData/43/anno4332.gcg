#note Despite what Dave might say, I don't believe for a second that this wasn't an intentional phoney.  That being said, I missed his FURCULA play, and thought he would play FUMULI, which I was okay with.  LAMSTER is of course MUCH better considering his rack.  (-10)

#note Intentionally saving the RENVOI spot for later, so that I could have either a place to score or distract him so I could block the board. I prefer this to TRIBADE or REDBAIT, as this makes it harder for him to stall.

#note This is a brutally tough play.  I missed ODONTOIDS when I was looking, but I saw BONITOES, STATIONED, and COONTIES as possible ways for Dave to come back. I don't really trust a simulation to do this correctly.  I spent a while over the board trying to find this out, but not long enough.  Of all the plays, it turns out the best play that I see after 20 minutes is MU f11.  This play allows PEG after BONITOES, blocks COITIONS/COONTIES/STATIONED, and GRIPE after ODONTOIDS.  This is, of course, brutally hard to find.  It took me 10 minutes or so over Quackle, and over a board this would be quite difficult.

#note My intuition told me ODONTOIDS wasn't valid, but I wasn't thinking about that at all this time.  The only question:  do I win?  After the answer is yes, it's an easy decision.  If I thought about it more I actually knew ODONTOIDS was good, as I've actually played it before in Reno about 2 years ago, as I remembered later.  Still definitely wasn't positive one way or the other at the time, and under pressure, probably wouldn't be.
