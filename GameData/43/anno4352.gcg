>Jim_Burlant: ADEIINO 8E IODINE +14 14
#note Everything is pretty much as good as anything else, though I do see why OIDIA is probably the best of the bunch.  Just saw IODINE and figured I should clear the rack and try again.
>Adam_Townsend: ACDI 9C CADI +15 15
>Jim_Burlant: AEFJNNR J6 JE.R +27 41
#note Didn't like keeping duplicate Ns but couldn't see anything else that didn't give up too many scoreboard points.  JERID was also an option but I didn't like a possible OX comeback.
>Adam_Townsend: OOT K4 TOO +15 30
>Jim_Burlant: AFNNNOR L1 FANON +30 71
#note Obvious choice.  Scores nicely, clears the duplicates.
>Adam_Townsend: CIU 1L .UCI +27 57
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABNRSS 10J SAB +21 92
#note Missed the 9 at E5.  Quackle doesn't like this play a whole lot but it gets the job done.
>Adam_Townsend: OOW 11K WOO +26 83
>Jim_Burlant: ?DENRST O1 .NSERTeD +77 169
#note Figured incorrectly that the triple would be the more dangerous bingo line.  Bad miss here, as the 7 would have been the bigger scoring threat to have to block.  I would soon pay for this indiscretion.
>Adam_Townsend: EEGIMNS 12F SEEMING +90 173
>Jim_Burlant: HLOORTV C9 .LOTH +20 189
#note Didn't know most of the other choices and felt turnover was the most important thing with this rack, easy back-hook or no.
>Adam_Townsend: APPU 11E PUPA +24 197
>Jim_Burlant: EORRSTV 14A OVERT +27 216
#note Entering this day at 12 - 9, a good run could have still put me in with a distant shot at thebottom end of the prize $$$.  Unfortunately, a 1 - 3 start to this day had put the kibosh on that.  Since I was out of the  running for a good finish I figured I had nothing to lose by living dangerously here.  I had looked for an E for OVERREST* (which I thought was good) and didn't know that OVERSTIR was good.
>Adam_Townsend: AIT D12 AI.T +19 216
>Jim_Burlant: ABKLRSW A12 BL.W +36 252
#note Too bad there wasn't a U to play through.
>Adam_Townsend: EF N10 EF +17 233
>Jim_Burlant: AEKRSXZ 15D .AXER +38 290
#note The difference between playing a computer and playing a human.  
>Adam_Townsend: EIT E5 TEI.. +12 245
>Jim_Burlant: AEGKRSZ 13L SAG +15 305
#note I personally liked this play a lot more than Quackle did.  On the surface it's a defensive play that kills the  obvious bingo line on row 14.  But, at the same time, the defensive motif hides its true intent.   Worst-casing it, if he comes back with VEIL O12 or something like that, I'm still up 7 pts and come back with ZEK 6D 26 and pretty much kills the lines he's just opened, with the only bingo line open being a 60-point airball on row 2 that gives me a very easy comeback on the H1 triple.
>Adam_Townsend: IY 8M YI. +7 252
>Jim_Burlant: AEKMRUZ O12 ZERK +86 391
#note Following through on the plan from the previous turn.
>Adam_Townsend: DEIQRUY 6C RU. +3 255
>Jim_Burlant: AELMQUY 2J QU. +32 423
#note Felt it more important to make sure I didn't empty the bag.  That didn't keep me from messing up my next turn.
>Adam_Townsend: ?GILNV B1 LIViNG +35 290
>Jim_Burlant: ADEELMY 1A A.LEY +27 450
#note Whoops.  Spend 5 minutes plotting the end game, only to whiff on the best play.
