>David_Pearl: DIKR 8E DIRK +18 18
>Jason: ADEGGRT E8 .RAGGED +22 22
#note Duck prefers the fish-y (I)GG, but where am I bingoing after that? (-7)
>David_Pearl: OZ 10E .ZO +32 50
>Jason: AEFNPTU F5 PFU. +17 39
#note Missed the (K)ENAF/(AZO)N fit. (-1)
>David_Pearl: DGMMU 13A GUMM.D +24 74
>Jason: AAENOTU A12 A.UE +18 57
#note Missed the sweet NOU(G)AT for 31 at 12B. (-10)
>David_Pearl: EEILNST 5F .ENLITES +70 144
>Jason: AACNOTW 4K AWA +26 83
#note Everything sims close. Duck likes keeping the A and just playing AW.
>David_Pearl: ?EILTTV 3E VITTLEs +63 207
#note (Scored as 64.)
>Jason: CJNNOTW 3M WON +24 107
>David_Pearl: IQ 2F QI +64 271
#note Yeah, I was afraid of that.
>Jason: BCJNRST -BCJ +0 107
#note B(U)NT or BR(U)NT at B11/12 is definitely better. Frustration had set in. (-17)
>David_Pearl: FOX 1G FOX +45 316
#note I am so quitting Scrabble...
>Jason: EIINRST C7 INTERI.S +62 169
#note So frustrated I even considered playing off I or IN to try trip-tripping through the N, but came to my senses. Only playable. CP puts my win chances at .66% after this play.
>David_Pearl: HO O1 HO. +18 334
>Jason: AACEETT B2 ACETATE +76 245
#note Can't remember if the last tile I looked at was the A or E ... either way, I remember being 6/7ths of the way to ACETATE and that the last tile was the vowel I needed. After bango, my win chances double, going to 1.31%.
>David_Pearl: LOP A8 POL +30 364
>Jason: ACDEHNR 11G RANCHED +78 323
#note Didn't know RANCHED's anagram, preferrable because it -S hooks. After bongo, win chances jump all the way up to 10.63%, says CP. (-1)
>David_Pearl: J N2 J. +36 400
>Jason: ?AEILOU J7 EUsO.IAL +63 386
#note For a while, I thought nothing played; happy to see this fit. Win chances only at 13.26% now, even after bungo. CP says to pass on the bingo and play AU(D)IO or EAU, 10M. But for the first time, I thought "OMG, this might actually happen!"
>David_Pearl: INORR L7 IRON.R +14 414
>Jason: ABBEIVY D4 VIBE +21 407
#note Best.
>David_Pearl: ENOSSY H10 N.YS +24 438
#note Also best, although neither of us thought so in the post-mortem. I had (G)ABY at 12E, which I certainly would've missed over the board.
>Jason: ABY A4 BAY +25 432
#note You may be wondering why the score says 438-438 when we signed for 449-438. In addition to overscoring VITTLEs by one, my scoresheet shows the score after FOX as 272+45=327, not 317. Noooooooo...! Certainly a very informative lesson, on a few levels. Maybe I'll warrant a mention in the next "Total Scrabble" update for this "comeback that never was." :)
>Jason:  (EOS) +6 438
