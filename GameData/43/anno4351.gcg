#note I didn't like blocking these lanes, but the points and leave were hard to resist.

>Joey: AELLNOR 7C RENAL +23 132
#note I thought about LORAL, but it gave away more easy comeback plays.  I only wanted to open bingo lanes.
>Laurie: ADN 6B DAN +12 233
>Joey: ACLLOOS F3 COLZA +16 148
#note The same three letters play for two more points at 5C, but it again would give away easy comebacks.  Tough choice.

>Joey: ??AIITY M1 JAY +38 296
#note Once I found this play, I didn't bother searching for bingos, since they likely wouldn't be worth it.  Can you find the only one that plays?
>Laurie: DFI 8A DIF +27 322
>Joey: ??EIITW A1 WIPE +30 326
#note No bingos available this time, amazingly.
>Laurie: AEIMNST B8 INMATES +30 352
#note DOPS!  DIETETIC just barely doesn't fit, but it would have if she had found MANIFEST!  (She told me she had an I leftover)
>Joey: ??EEIIT 11K IRE +6 332
#note This move can't possibly fail, can it?
>Laurie: AB 10K BOA +11 363
>Joey: ??EEIIT N9 IT +12 344
#note Same old rack.  This was a microcosm of my tournament.  Start slowly, come all the way back, and seem to be in control, but can't finish it off.
>Laurie: UV 2H LUV +14 377
>Joey: ??CEEII O10 sICkEE +33 377
>Laurie: DEIMRW A11 MIRED +38 415
#note Mired indeed!  At least it was one of my friends who won.  I was at least hoping that this game would get her on a roll.
