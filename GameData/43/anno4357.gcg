#note An inauspicious start to the tournament, to be sure. I really did think this was the anagram of TOOTERS.
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: ADO 7G ODA +15 15
>Sam: ?ENORRY 6I ORNERY +22 88
#note An even more inauspicious start. Here I miss hERONRY, which I didn't know. This isn't even a good nonbingo play...TRY would have been fine, keeping a way more bingo-prone leave.

>Sam: DEMNRST 15A MED +25 361
#note Quackle's favorite is MEND 13G, which cuts down a little on 15H plays. I didn't like blocking the FUBSY hook, since there's a chance he doesn't know it anyway. This wasn't bad anyway, as I have a good chance of bingoing, but MEND is probably better. I even considered MEND O1 on this play, but that seemed stupid.

#note When I told Bruce about my rack here, he made a comment implying that I could have gotten away with STRONGS* 6A had I played it.
