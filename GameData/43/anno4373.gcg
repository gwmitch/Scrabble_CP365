#note this was definitely a bad move. never again will i try to play thru a rack like this -- there's NO reason i shouldn't exchange here. if i'm gonna play thru though it seems my first instinct of G3 FOB is right. additionally if i exchange and he bingoes he gets stuck with all the crap. my fear was that if i exchange, he doesnt bingo and scores, then i have to worry another turn about it. that's misguided though. to be honest though, i just don't like FOB that much.. thoughts?

#note 10B W(IN) is the only move that wins. i had less than a minute and a half to think thru it, and i couldn't see a way to win with it and all the clunky letters, so with just a few secs left i saw that he might miss WUSS... (-2)
