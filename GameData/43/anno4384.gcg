#note quackle says: yes, stick the extra N on, by about a 0.1% win margin. i normally don't like the idea of giving up an easy 65 pts, but it seems to happen not too often.

#note tunnel vision.. M4 EYNE is better. i wish there was a way i could keep looking after i spot such an obvious play. (-7.5)

#note you have NO idea how much i hated making this move. a couple of people jokingly suggested SOUARI, but i don't know. nothing else sims even close. jesse also said "hm, interesting" after i played it, or something of the sort. what ELSE can i play!

#note this goddamn Q ruined my game. watch and see. QI sims much better than my move, but i really didn't want to fish with something uncertain-looking. turns out AEENPR is strong. i guess the point is i'm not exactly fishing -- i can STILL get PARVE for 30 pts or something comparable below next turn. my thought was that even though i had the turn advantage, i still needed either of the S or the ? to win the game -- the tunover fallacy again? (-5.5)

>Cesar: EGNOQTZ B1 .ZON +26 303
#note QI is STILL the right play. i guess if i just do a static comparison of leaves and scores this should be obvious, but i wanted that blank and/or S!! also, i missed stupid AZOTE. (-9)

#note ok, this time quackle doesn't think i'm a total idiot. i don't know if i should exchange though.
>Jesse: AGLS O7 LAGS +25 345
#note no S or blank for me, i lose

#note welcome to unwinnable game. at least i should have played GREATEN to make the spread less. (-9)
