>Kenji: EEINNOS 7I ONE +12 30
>Hoekstra: ?EILPRU F1 fIREPLU. +64 86
#note Nice find by Ron, but it took  him another 7 minutes.  Judging from Ron's history with me, the speed rush is on.

>Kenji: AHINOST C4 .ANIHOTS +65 170
#note Ron played ADMIXED immediately, and it took me almost a minute to see this play, and another 3+ minutes to look for other possibilities.  
>Hoekstra: EJNNO 2B ENJO.N +26 150
#note He plays this immediately, afraid of the speed rush to ensue, and missing JOHN.

>Hoekstra: Q M7 Q. +21 283
>Kenji: DIOOUVW E4 .U +26 357
#note Playing the U off is mostly just so that Ron doesn't have an easy place to make a big play, and also protects against an immediate bingo fairly well.
