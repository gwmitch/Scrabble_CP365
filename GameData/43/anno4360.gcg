#note I'm stealing Jon's racks from the annotation website.
>Sam: ABDPTTV 6I VAT +18 94
#note I won a one-dollar bet with Kenji about what would sim better, VAT or exchanging. I really liked this play.
>Jon_Shreve: AEGORTT D8 .OTTAGER +74 87
>Sam: BDIOPRT 15C T.IPOD +27 121
#note Completely missed PROBIT, which I wouldn't have been sure of anyway.

>Jon_Shreve: ENORRSX 9L OX +40 163
>Sam: AELNRWY 13F WALY +33 174
#note Another option is the fishier play of WYN 10J, but I think WALY is fine.
>Jon_Shreve: EMNRRSS 12C M.RS +15 178
>Sam: EIILMNR K9 LIMN +22 196
#note I had to take away this easy lane after Jon's fish.
>Jon_Shreve: EEINRSS 13B SE. +16 194
#note Missing SENTRIES.
>Sam: EFILORT 7G OF +15 211
#note I should have just played it straight with FILE. I did like the logic of this play, though, aiming to bingo back if he bingoes.
>Jon_Shreve: BEINRSV 6D VERB +17 211
#note Pretty much the best case scenario.
>Sam: EGIILRT O6 TI.GLIER +60 271
>Jon_Shreve: CEIINNS E3 CIN. +12 223
>Sam: AFINNSZ 4A ZINN.A +50 321
#note Noah Walton suggested FIZ in this position on his blog. That is an interesting play that Quackle hates, but I think it sacrifices too much with the QUA spot and row 10 still open for bingos. Another interesting possibility (and one I considered over the board) is ZIN 10J, which blocks the QUA possibility that I hadn't considered. ZIN might very well be the best play.
>Jon_Shreve: EEILNOS A4 .INES +42 265
#note I'd probably play SEIZE.
>Sam: FHHIKRS 10B KI.H +21 342
#note Yikes, completely whiffed on KHI J10.
>Jon_Shreve: DEEELOU N2 ELUDE +20 285
>Sam: DFHRSTU 10G DHUT. +11 353
#note And another whiff, this time on FUDS 1L. I was trying to block the QUA possibility. Two huge blunders in a row.
>Jon_Shreve: AEEEJOU M1 JOE +26 311
>Sam: ?AFIQRS 4M S.Q +33 386
#note I thought FAnZINES was unblockable, but realized as soon as I hit my clock he could just play AZINES. FAnZINES is two points better than QI, but SUQ 4M is eight points better, getting more out of the Q.
>Jon_Shreve: AEEUY L11 YEA +23 334
#note Better than AZINES, since I could trump that with dIAZINES.
