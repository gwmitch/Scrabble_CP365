#note this seemed like an easy trade 6 here, but quackle is torn between 8G WOW and 8F WOO. wow. (-3.5)
>Rod: DDEKU 8D DUKED +26 26
>Cesar: BCEENTT 7G BENT +20 20
#note or BET. CENT is a nicer leave. (-1)

>Cesar: AEGNNUY 4K YUAN +31 80
#note ooooh.. didn't see UNYEAN(ED) H1. i feel like the equity loss should be higher. (-1.5)
>Rod: BMO 6F MOB +24 84
>Cesar: AEGHNPV 10F PHAGE +34 114
#note (-3) PAVE in the same spot. makes sense.

>Cesar: GHJNNSV -GJNV +0 114
#note nice draw. keeping SH is best according to quackle. (-2)
>Rod: EILPT H10 .PLITE +27 134
>Cesar: HILMNRS 3M HIM +30 144
#note HIMS is definitely worth considering. i saw it and didn't like it, but i'm definitely wrong. (-5)
>Rod: LTUZ 2K LUTZ +57 191
#note when i was looking at HIMS vs HIM, this spot never entered my consciousness. i know THAE but it's not easy to think of especially when i don't have the T. i really need to work on this aspect of my game.
>Cesar: JLNRSVW -JLNVW +0 144
#note argh.. so frustrating. seems like another forced exchange but V(I)RL is simming higher! how could i talk myself into NOT exchanging with this rack? (-5)

#note and he doesn't get this down if i play VIRL !! game over

#note draw an I draw an I draw an I draw an I draw an I draw an I draw an I draw an I (-3%) the dumb A1 ENOW is at the top. i guess QIS is equally dumb, though.
>Rod: IJN 12A JIN +25 366
#note this is a nice move if i bingo elsewhere
>Cesar: EEINORT 14B TENORI.E +70 371
