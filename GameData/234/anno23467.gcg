#note I'm getting all of my awful whiffs out in one game...this time I saw it (OUTBARKS), but decided it was ridiculous and passed on it. Still made the wrong nonbingo play even then (KA at I6 or AUK at 11H are better).

#note Nice play.
>Jesse_Matthews: AAEHIMY L1 YEAH +38 219
#note Right word, wrong placement...L4 placement is one point more and doesn't offer options back.

#note After his last play there's now only one R and a blank left for MARJORAM. I should've given up on drawing it on this turn, because GLIM at 8L is a better play. I go for this play because it opens a lane on the left side and still lets me go for the miracle draw for MARJORAM.

#note My only chance at winning is to bingo once and score highly the rest of the game, so I have to create another viable bingo lane.

#note Up until this game, I was quite happy with the level of play I was exhibiting in my games, despite the errors that of course transpired during other games. This was by far my worst game. No excuse for the loss of focus, no matter how unfortunate the circumstances surrounding the losing streak in the previous rounds were.
