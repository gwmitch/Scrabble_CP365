>Jonathan_Lindh: BINOTUW 8H UNWIT +18 18
#note 2nd best play! BOW at 8G is somehow better? That can't be right. I'll take mine. -1 to the Duck.
>Joey_Krafchick: AIPTT 9E PITTA +14 14
#note This word always looks strange to me so I held but accepted.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ABEEOY E9 .AYEE +20 38
#note 3rd best play! Why don't I see 7J OBEY? That's obvious. -5
>Joey_Krafchick: BDEHLOR 12D B.HOLDER +80 94
#note PAYEE was a very costly mistake because OBEY doesn't give Joey a bingo.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BHJOST L10 JOSH +58 96
#note Best play! Why did it take me forever to see this?
>Joey_Krafchick: GLM F7 GL.M +23 117
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BEGSTT 7K BEG +14 110
#note Quackle has this -5.4 back but I think this is the right call. Opens a lane for my blank and keep the board open. 14B BEGS for 25 is Quackle's top choice but that's poor because it closes the board when you have a blank in tow.
>Joey_Krafchick: ACMP H11 C.AMP +33 150
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?IIISTT -IIT +0 110
#note That's a terrible draw. I'm exchanging.
>Joey_Krafchick: ERR M13 ERR +16 166
#note Joey takes out a lane that would have given me a higher scoring bingo.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EIOSST N2 nOSIEST +73 183
#note Tricky turn! OSTOMIES and DISTOMES at 14D and 14C score 74 and are less volatile than my play. Those may be the plays. I wanted to scare Joey by jacking up the volatility but I don't think it worked.
>Joey_Krafchick: CEELNR 4H CRENEL. +24 190
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEEFIO 15L F.AE +33 216
#note FROE is slightly preferred in this spot. Mine is 2nd best. -2.5
>Joey_Krafchick: DEOTU O8 OUTED +30 220
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADEIOR H1 ERI.A +21 237
#note No clue what to do here. Quackle likes D11 OBA but that leaves a vowel heavy leave with lots of I's left. My play scores the most and is only -6.5 on equity. I'll take my play.
>Joey_Krafchick: Q 3G Q. +21 241
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADFINO 1D FOIN.D +14 251
#note My play was paranoid. I was concerned about Joey bingoing. O1 OAF is clearly the best with a X and Z out. -22.4
>Joey_Krafchick: KNW J10 KN.W +21 262
#note Joey was nowhere close to a bingo.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AADIOV 2B VIA +17 268
#note My odd play did allow me to pick up a blank! I like taking out this spot although Quackle like 6I AVO. I like mine better because there are 3 I's out and multiple I's are a kiss of death. 6th best to Quackle and -4.5
>Joey_Krafchick: AIILTUU -AIIL +0 262
#note Joey exchanges! Is he going for the good stuff in the bag?
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AADOUU O1 OUD +16 284
#note Horrible pull but with an X and Z out this spot needs to be shut down. Quackle has this as 3rd best behind two exchanges but exchanging here is silly. -.9 to Quackle but Q's plays are silly.
>Joey_Krafchick: INSZ 14B ZINS +37 299
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AAGOUV 15A VAsA +36 320
#note I'm not going to be bingoing here Quackle so this is clearly best. 
>Joey_Krafchick: EINT N11 TINE. +25 324
#note Joey said something after the game about missing a better endgame that would only lose by 2. Given what I pulled out the bag, victory is mine!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGIOOUX 6I OXO +31 351
#note Best play! Or is it? It's either this or AXING. AXING blocks LYRE but leaves OOU and no way to score the next turn. I like mine more.
>Joey_Krafchick: LRY G12 .Y +18 342
#note Joey misses LYRE for the out. 351-342 would have been the final. Joey instead goes for the win hoping I screw up since I am a little low on time.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGIU 3D GI +10 361
#note Need to block FARL. Which I did. This is best.
>Joey_Krafchick: LR 10D R.. +5 347
#note Best play for Joey!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AU B2 .AU +6 367
#note Best play for me!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (L) +2 369
#note Really liked the way I played this game especially the endgame. Half of my games at Nashville I played like a 1900-2000 player and half I played well below that. Gotta work on the consistency in tournaments, although this was easily a 2000+ game on my part.
