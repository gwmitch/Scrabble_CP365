#note I spent a really long time on this opening rack, unable to decide what would score well, do something good for the board and leave me nice leftovers. I saw F6 YIELD, which the duck prefers, but didn't like the OT leave for only 5 more points. F7 YO, despite being only 11 points, also sims higher than my play.

#note I decide to channel Nigel Richards a bit here. I know I'm leaving a horrific rack, but I'm fairly certain I'll be scoring 60+ next turn. I'm assuming Allan has all one pointers on his rack (otherwise D or G for -ED or -ING bingos, respectively), and so the only way he'd play there is if he had a bingo with an N in it (to hook with NU), and the likelihood of a vowel being played after an N is very high. I can make any vowel work in my favour there. Pleased to see my play sim highest despite not even being on the initial suggestions list!

#note Bam!

#note Allan spent a long time on this rack before finally playing this. Fortunately for me, he didn't find a new OWL3 word as a 3x3. Can you? Not the easiest to spot by any means...
>Jesse_Matthews: ADGIINT 11D DI.ATING +90 182
#note Lucky me!

>Jesse_Matthews: AEEMNSZ 8L M.ZE +54 278
#note I decide to score 15 less to keep a nicer leave. The duck still slightly prefers ZEES by about 3% in winning chances (85.19% after my play, 88% after ZEES)

>Jesse_Matthews: DIKNOVY --  -64 340
#note With a comfortable lead and momentum going my way, I decide to be cheeky and test his knowledge, but he's having none of it.
>Allan_Pengelly: EGU 9D GU.E +19 265
>Jesse_Matthews: DIKNOVY 15M IVY +29 369
#note Given that he's probably fishing, I'm going to take out the easiest lane for 8s first.

>Allan_Pengelly: EE B13 .EE +10 293
>Jesse_Matthews: BDEENPR 7B BEND +19 419
#note He's still fishing, so at this point it's just time to block off the last remaining bingo lane.
>Allan_Pengelly: HO A14 OH +32 325
>Jesse_Matthews: ?EMOPRV 13K MOP +30 449
#note Might as well balance my rack and wait for him to open up the board with another bingo lane.
>Allan_Pengelly: AANORSS E5 RA. +8 333
#note There's the opening!
>Jesse_Matthews: ?EHINRV 4D HoVER +26 475
#note One of a number of plays that secures the win.

>Jesse_Matthews: INP -  +0 475
#note For some reason I draw a blank on SEASONER and figure now's a good time to check, so I challenge unsuccessfully.
