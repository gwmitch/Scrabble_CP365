>Joshua_Sokol: ANNPTVW H7 PAWN +18 18
#note It was an interesting choice here between PAWN and VAW. I didn't consider exhanging as much as I should have, though. Keeping ANT is also an option, and something like that does well against the similar style of keeping bingo-heavy leaves that Steve seems to adopt. I also talked myself out of VAW, like I did many other plays this tournament that were nice and defensive, under the delusion that it would be better for spread to play more open. Seems like a grand old mistake to start things off. I definitely should not be setting up two S hooks against an underdog.
>Steve_Ozorio: TT 8H .TT +3 3
#note This play fascinated me. What did he keep? What was his reasoning behind this play? 

I wondered if he thought he was setting up another S hook, but knew that ATT did not take the S. Maybe trying to fool me? 
>Joshua_Sokol: BEHMNTV 9H .HEN +25 43
#note When it rains, it pours! I must have been that mesmerized by Steve's last play that I completely lost focus on reality. I have never accidentally played such a blatant phony two before. I have played NI*, WA*, OT*, IL (blank L)... My reasoning, if that even matters, is that this seemed better than an exchange, since it scored and blocked the best lane for an 8, the open T!

I realized what I had done while I was reaching for the bag, and unbelievably was able to draw in time before Steve could notice. I don't know when he actually noticed, but for most of the rest of the game it was hard to retain my laughter. Poor Steve, I gave him a front row seat to another episode of me blowing another game. Really if he had noticed TH* in time, I do not think I would have had any chance of making a good play for the rest of the game.

#note An amazing draw to my abysmal leave.
>Steve_Ozorio: QT E10 Q.T +12 23
#note The struggle is real for Steve...
>Joshua_Sokol: CEKMTVW 10J W.CK +35 120
#note A sim is giving a small favor here to W(A)VE instead, which I considered. Both WACK and WAVE are difficult to defend, but I felt like keeping the VE for next turn if I wanted to block was better than just hoping to keep scoring big, but just slightly.
>Steve_Ozorio: ILL M10 .ILL +16 39
>Joshua_Sokol: EMSTTVY D11 .ETTY +42 162
#note Another consideration was N9 MY for 40. That seems alright but a bit risky for the range I am continually putting on Steve, who is using up a whole lot of time. I feel like he has the blank, but it's possible he was keeping weak bingo leaves this whole time. In either case, setting up a baby bingo lane isn't the best of ideas, but it could work out quite well for me. I preferred the seemingly safer idea of setting up a scoring spot and taking away another.
>Steve_Ozorio: COR 15A COR. +27 66
#note hmm, probably a lot of consonants in his range?

>Steve_Ozorio: RRRRR -RRRRR +0 66
>Joshua_Sokol: DMOORSV N5 VROOMS +31 222
#note I liked the board control, turnover and scoring spot opening of this play, but he had indeed exchanged 5, so I probably should have played it safe with 12J V(I)O(L), which I considered, or just kept my S with G4 VROOM. Unsure about this one.
>Steve_Ozorio: IX O8 XI +58 124
#note why VROOMS was a mistake. Now I know there are also 4 U's still out

#note not in a good position here, didn't know what to do. Felt like it was good to block this lane. Should probably take the points with 5I EGER. :/

#note Forgot to add Steve's rack to my score, he was fine with that apparently.
