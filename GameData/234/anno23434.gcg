>Trevor_Sealy: ABBL 8F BLAB +16 16
>Jesse_Matthews: AEIJOQV F6 JO. +28 28
#note The duck has a slight preference for G3 JOVIAL over my play, but I'd rather score more and leave myself QI to play somewhere next turn assuming he opens something up
>Trevor_Sealy: ELY 9H LYE +23 39
>Jesse_Matthews: AAAEIQV 6F .AVA +14 42
#note I saw AJIVA but dismissed it as giving him easy points with the first A. If I'd thought about it more I'd have realized that I'm almost certain to play QI from that I on my next turn and hopefully with a balanced rack already. 
>Trevor_Sealy: DEMNTUU 10D UNMUTED +88 127
#note I didn't even hold this. I thought for sure it was good...nice phony!
>Jesse_Matthews: AEIILQR D9 Q.AIL +28 70
#note I'm curious about this move. I was debating between my play and QUAI, but opted for this one ultimately. QUAI sims a bit higher, but I'm not sure why. Seems more volatile when I don't have to be, but then perhaps because I don't have an S it's a better idea?

>Jesse_Matthews: AGINORT K11 O. +4 135
#note It was either this or F10 MOS for one point more, both sim about the same. Figured this would be better since it created one more lane and was only one point less, so how could it be that big a difference? Little did I know...
>Trevor_Sealy: IIW 14H .IWI +19 173
>Jesse_Matthews: AAGINRT 13C A. +4 139
#note Trying to maximize volatility, I opt for this play over E10 NAN, which sims best but doesn't create any further openings. I again decide 6 points is not that big a difference. Little did I know...

>Trevor_Sealy: AITX 5I TAXI +24 226
>Jesse_Matthews: CIOPSUV N11 VOIC. +20 239
#note I'm definitely overvaluing my S here. L2 VICIOUS is more points, plus more turnover for those two unseen blanks
>Trevor_Sealy: EITY 4J YETI +32 258

>Trevor_Sealy: DEHNOR C3 HORNED +31 353
>Jesse_Matthews: CFRSTUU M1 FUC. +18 320
#note I need to create a distraction at this point and hope for the best. While my play does accomplish that, scoring 2 less points and play CURF at 6L instead would at least use up one more tile and continue to go for turnover for that blank
>Trevor_Sealy: ?AEEGIM 1M .EM +24 377
>Jesse_Matthews: ?GORSTU 2A OUTRiGS +83 403
#note My bingo scores the most points, yet it isn't the 100% game winning play here in the pre-endgame! Can you find the winning move?
>Trevor_Sealy: AAEGHIN 1F AAHING +35 412
>Jesse_Matthews: E D2 .E +7 410
#note Remember when I said those one or two less points earlier in the game wouldn't matter? They did! The positive spin on this, however, was that spread was no longer likely to be a factor for me in the tournament. It became all about the wins from here!
