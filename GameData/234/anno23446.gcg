#note Right play, wrong spot. It didn't even occur to me to look for hooks, and if I'm to be honest I didn't even know CROUPILY was a word. How embarrassing.

#note Debated RIOJAS but settled on this. I know he's got one pointers and they're probably decent so I'd rather force him to play a 7 ending in S instead of potentially giving up a 3x3.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ACDEET N1 ..ECrATED +70 178
#note Nice play.
>Jesse_Matthews: AIJLNNS 4A NINJAS +40 212
#note I hated leaving that spot on the right open but this is the best play...

>Jesse_Matthews: ELRSTUZ B3 R.TZ +33 245
#note My overconcern for my leave shows itself here. I shouldn't be worried about not drawing an E after NERTZ. LUTZES at 13J is also an interesting option.

>Jesse_Matthews: ?IIKLST 15F KILTS +30 380
#note I was fixated on KILTIES but passed on it. I know for certain that KELTIES# is Collins only and thought that KILTIES perhaps was the same. No excuse for missing KIDLITS though, I knew that one was good in both books and just plain missed it. KILTS sims next best after them.
