>sneakyofverb: AEGIPTW K4 TWAE +27 85
#note considered 6b WAITE and k3 WETA (both 25). but TWAE is two more and GIP is ok as a leave. a perfect four for four with quackie. somebody hold me; i'm getting scared.

>sneakyofverb: AEGINNP D4 PEANING +76 161

>jello_ankers: EEK O12 .EKE +29 342
>sneakyofverb: EIOORRT M11 O.E +16 365
#note honestly had no idea what to do here. balance and score nothing? blow it up and get more? opted for the middle ground and a chance at one of the three remaining Es.
>jello_ankers: INQS 11E QINS +39 381
#note yup, there's an S. well, this game is over. or is it?...
>sneakyofverb: HIOORRT 2H .HO +17 382
#note three in the bag and a relatively bingoey unseen pool. if i go with HORI 12b and don't pick the X, then i'm done for. after long deliberation, i went with something that provided a brief lead and a outside chance of connecting if i draw an E. sit back and see what happens...
>jello_ankers: ELX F11 .LEX +27 408
#note remember when i said earlier BREI was going to prove important later on?...
