#note I could have given more thought to VOG here. Against VIGOR I liked the defense+synergy, and PE vs PR seemed very close. But after a mid-range exchange VOG gains value since it gives less back.
>Diane_Wittman: AABERT G6 ABATER +24 24
#note AER(O)BAT with the same tiles is a tough find for 12 more, but 13 since this was misscored as 23.

#note I liked that this board was bereft of S hooks and full of scoring opportunities, so I allotted to play this to close the top left indeterminately, leave myself scoring spots and make sure she didn't hit a huge Z or J play in that spot in the future. I could have given more thought to FLEAM, but it seemed like that unnecessarily gave the board some breathing space, and I wasn't really equipped to do anything about a play at G1 with an X, for example, or any play that opened the board a bit for that matter. It is 6 more points though, and that could tilt the scale enough to make it worthwhile. The play I could have made for the sake of spread was 10J FEMALE for 36. Perhaps one day I will gather enough courage to make a play such as that.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEIJMNT 12D JAM +36 128
#note I did not like that she had just opened an S hook with 4 of them out, but I couldn't do anything about it for now.

#note only bingo, nice find
>Joshua_Sokol: ??BEILN K5 BLINkE.s +66 268
#note It was at this moment in the game that I got angry for what I had been drawing. I couldn't see any decent plays. 3 options simulate better than this, 4H (V)ENDIBLy, which I didn't know was valid and disagree with it being better, B2 aBELIaN for 80, which is safe as there are no more G's to hook onto N(U) (I believe that this is the correct play) and D1 BINE. BINE opens up a triple-triple that Diane can hit with 403 distinct racks, but that I can hit with more than twice as many given my L?? leave. It's an interesting option that gives a good example about risk aversion in Scrabble. Would you make that play?
>Diane_Wittman: ORX 8A RO.X +57 227
#note Missing ABELIAN was costly.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIOOSWZ D1 ZOWIE +60 328
#note Quackle here prefers to open the board with L1 ZOWIE for 2 fewer. I cannot agree less with that suggestion. 15A WIZES was probably the play I should have made here, as it is not nearly as risky.
>Diane_Wittman: AHW 13B WHA +28 255
>Joshua_Sokol: DILOSUV 2A VOD.U +18 346
#note Huge points sacrifice from 15A plays just to shut down two risky areas. Definitely the right play.

#note I honestly had no idea this wasn't a word!!! That's crazy!
>Joshua_Sokol: AAFINRS 10J F.AR +28 398
#note I missed M3 SIFA(K)A here, which is definitely a good play, as well as INFRA 15K, which I don't know if I knew! This is fine.

#note This usually guarantees me an out next turn. I like this play, but I wonder if there is something better. Hard to tell. Diane challenged.
