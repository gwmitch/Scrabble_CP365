>Joshua_Sokol: EEEEGJP H7 JEEP +26 26
#note It seems marginal, but if I play with the second E on the star, I can better reoverlap if Keith overlaps himself with an O. Otherwise I am giving back points, so I sort of prefer my placement, especially after an exchange.

#note Saved by his play, I get to keep 2 doubled vowels. Hooray! EIDETIC here I come?

#note This was an out of the box play by me, but I saw that I hit a lot of things, and I didn't want to have to worry about that H for the rest of the game. Also blocks the A partially, a tile that my leave has little use for as well. I'd do it again against an opponent of Keith's caliber.

#note Missing COqUINA for one more, which probably isn't a mistake since COqUINA opens up a game-saving lane for Keith

>Keith_Hagel: CEI 15L .ICE +18 166
#note Keith doing what he can to keep the board open.
>Joshua_Sokol: GIKNNRR 3G RINK.NG +28 369
#note Was debating RINKING*/KIRNING for a while, thought this was more likely to be left on. KIRNING is good!
>Keith_Hagel: ERY 7K .REY +9 175
>Joshua_Sokol: EFIQRRV C11 F.QIR +34 403
#note F(A)QIR seemed better before Keith's play, definitely, but I was unsure if it was better after the huge opening. I decided that chancing myself at getting another bingo and leaving my options open if I didn't made more sense than taking the points now. REV seemed like such a better leave at the time.
>Keith_Hagel: EM 6N ME +23 198
#note Normally this would worry me, but there are very few triple-triples to hit with no T in the unseen pool. This leaves a bunch of -L(E)SS words that Keith could hit, which wouldn't win him the game anyway. VIEWL(E)SS is 221, and after my play that leaves him behind 37 on a dead board.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEORV 15A VA.ROA +30 433
#note That is why I allotted to leave the spot open. If he gets it, good for him, it would make this game memorable.

#note -1 to 13E FAW(N), which I carelessly missed.
