>cesar: ACEIKLV L4 VAKIL +32 177
#note my equity game was not on point this tournament. i saw AKELA, AVAIL, and VAKIL, but thought VAKIL might be stronger because of the leave. i usually don't like giving up points, too. -3.5, AKELA and AVAIL are better.

#note i just kind of ran out of time here, but in any case, i definitely am no good in this type of pre-endgame. i have NO idea what to play. anyone? i considered 14B WE since i have the A for ODEA, and maybe i shoulda done this. quackle likes KAME 6L best but that empties the bag! so yeah.
