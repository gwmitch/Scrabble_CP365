#note Best play!
>Andrew_Gardner: DEZ J2 ZED +40 86
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIPRTU G2 REPUTI.E +66 128
#note PHONY! ERUPTIVE is the valid word in this rack. I knew ERUPTIVE too but couldn't find it. Well, they both score the same and are best plays.
>Andrew_Gardner: ?DFIRTT 3A ReFITT.D +72 158
#note Probably why Andrew didn't challenge. This is best for him.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IIMNOOY A1 MI.Y +39 167
#note Best play!
>Andrew_Gardner: AFK D1 KA.F +32 190
>Jonathan_Lindh: GINOOUY 2J .OOING +32 199
#note PHONY! M6 YOU is somehow best but sets up a dangerous opening. I probably play ZINGY here is I'm playing a valid word. ZOO (VERB)- to encage in a zoo. NOT! My phony ends up as 2nd best on equity. Since YOU is dumb, this ends up being best lol!
>Andrew_Gardner: HU O1 U.H +21 211
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAETUVY 1L YA +20 219
#note Didn't see F1 VATU for 17. I probably play it if I do. Mine is -3.3 and 2nd best.
>Andrew_Gardner: L M1 ..L +6 217
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACETUVW H1 WE. +23 242
#note 3rd best play! Hesistant to open so CRAW or CRU at I7 are out of the picture. Mine is 3rd best behind those two at -1.3. I think my play is best.
>Andrew_Gardner: AGIMN E3 .AMING +23 240
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACLRTUV I7 C.U +20 262
#note Best play! Now I have to open a bit.
>Andrew_Gardner: EU 1C U.E +7 247
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAGLRTV 7C VA. +10 272
#note Not a good play! I chickened out of ARVAL which is the 2nd best play to Q. VAGI is a bit better but leave the 8 line open for triples. ARVAL it is! -10.6 to ARVAL.
>Andrew_Gardner: DEN B2 N.ED +17 264
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AGILRT 5K ..G +4 276
#note CHOKE CHOKE! bATGIRL for 62 or ALRIGhT for 61. Mine was -19.7.
>Andrew_Gardner: AEILOST C7 .IOLATES +74 338
#note Best play for Andrew! ISOLATE is available in two spots as well.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AILQRT 13B R.QuITAL +68 344
#note Best play! I pick up the Q and silently bemoan my luck but then Andrew opens an E. Problem solved! Only playable bingo!
>Andrew_Gardner: ANN H12 N.NA +15 353
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEIIOST J10 BITS +29 373
#note And I throw the game away. First I miss NIOBITES off of 14H. I wasn't even looking for bingos and auto piloted to BITS. If I'm going there, BIOS is my play anyway.
>Andrew_Gardner: AEPS B11 PA.ES +24 377
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEIOORX A9 ODOR +15 388
#note Then I straight up choke the game away here. DOXIE, OXIDE and EXODOI all win. I overcomplicated the endgame, mistracked him at SCENT, and tried to get too cute and block an out which did not exist. One my most epic chokes yet.
>Andrew_Gardner: CENRS 15F CR.NES +8 385
#note 2nd best play! RANCES, NACRES, CASERN, and CANERS are one more. This wins thanks to my stupidty.
>Andrew_Gardner:  (IXE) +20 405
#note This was easily my worst choke job ever in an endgame.
