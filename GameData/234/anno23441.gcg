>Andrew_Gardner: AEFGIMO -AE +0 0
#note Exchange 2 for Andrew.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEINOW -AAIOW +0 0
#note Normally I might play AWA but I decide to exchange and keep EN. Quackle says -2.8 but I like my call.
>Andrew_Gardner: AFGIMOW -AF +0 0
#note Exchange 2 again! Uh oh!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEFNNU 8D FAUNAE +26 26
#note Best play! Stick the N on or leave it off? I wanted to make Andrew work for the bingo and not give him easy 7 hooks onto FAUNA. FAUNA and FAUNAE are within .2 equity of each other so it's a tossup.
>Andrew_Gardner: CINOSST I7 S.CTIONS +65 65
#note Andrew drew into CONSIST, TOCSINS. He picked the second best bingo with SECTIONS. 7H TOCSINS is 66. -1
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADILNNO H12 LOAN +22 48
#note This was horrible. I searched for a very long time for NON bingos but couldn't find NONTIDAL. This was big. ALOIN is also the best of the non bingo plays on the H line. Mine is 6th best. -37.8
>Andrew_Gardner: ?EHILSW 10B HoWLIES. +73 138
>Andrew_Gardner: ?EHILSW --  -73 65
#note WHIFFLES for 82 was the best of his bingos. Also the new word LIMEWASH, and WELSHING along with the WHISTLE bingos. I catch a break.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDIINRR E7 B.IRD +16 64
#note This is another terrible play. I miss RAINBIRD which I knew and play this phony 5. Work on your anagramming Jon! 5th best and -52.3.
>Andrew_Gardner: ?EHILSW J14 HE +27 92
#note Andrew missed WELSHING again but J14 HI now is better than the bingo according to Quackle. Andrew's play is 4th best and -4.5.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AINOORX D11 OXO +23 87
#note I'm not doing the J5 OXO because I know Andrew has the blank. D11 AXION runs into a similar problem since I know Andrew has an S as well.
>Andrew_Gardner: LP 14F PL... +16 108
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADINORR C11 RADIO +31 118
#note Best play! I loved this find!
>Andrew_Gardner: DIWY G6 WI.DY +15 123
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEFINOR 15A FO.D +30 148
#note OOPS! ROOFIE in the same spot is best. Overvalued leave here. Only -5.7 back and 4th best. This is better than ROOF in the same spot I feel due to knowledge Andrew has ?S.
>Andrew_Gardner: GI 7C GI. +13 136
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEINQRZ J6 QI +33 181
#note Best play! Nervous about opening but I sorta have to with this rack.
>Andrew_Gardner: IK K5 KI +23 159
#note This makes me very paranoid.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEENNRZ H4 ZEE +27 208
#note Best play! I like how this cuts volatility on the SKI hook.
>Andrew_Gardner: EES 4H .EES +20 179
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGNNRRV -GRVNN +0 208
#note I'm not sure what my rack was, but every play opens the board for peanuts with Andrew holding ?S. Not worth it.
>Andrew_Gardner: CU 15J .CU +6 185
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEEHORT 14A OB. +23 231
#note Shocking I make the best equity play but this is wrong. Play THOU L12 and make Andrew work for his bingo. He made not have been able to get it down had I done THOU!
>Andrew_Gardner: ??AGGPS M9 PAGinGS +80 265
#note Only bingo! Should have done THOU!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEHRTU N9 EH +30 261
#note Best play!
>Andrew_Gardner: AILRT O8 TRAIL +29 294
#note Could Andrew have had a bingo here? i don't know his other two tiles.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEJRRTU 11K JU. +22 283
#note Best play!
>Andrew_Gardner: AEMUV F2 MAUVE +26 320
#note This was a good find by Andrew that likely puts the game away.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EENRRTW G1 TEW +23 306
#note I needed to NEW here. 4th best and -4. It's not even for the leave it's minimize Andrew's comeback. This may have been the losing play.
>Andrew_Gardner: EORV 1G .ROVE +24 344
#note That should not have happened.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAENNRR 2B RENA.. +16 322
#note This is supposedly 3rd best, but my play allows me a greater chance of going out first. Quackle says -3.2 but I do mine again.
>Andrew_Gardner: ILNTTTY 1C YIN +17 361
#note TITTY/NITTY/LINTY block my outs at K2 and therefore are better. -6.2 for Andrew and 9th best.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEMNR 2K NAMER +16 338
#note Best play! Along with RAMEN and REMAN for 16 as well.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (LTTT) +8 346
#note Not drawing a single blank or S was sad, but I need to find NONTIDAL and RAINBIRD. I played the game well except for those two misses but that's like saying "other than the shooting Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?"
