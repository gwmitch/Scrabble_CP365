#note "Just the letter I needed!"

I don't like coming into a game thinking I'll be able to relax a bit, then something like this happens and my playing-from-behind senses kick in...
>Joshua_Sokol: AAIMOPR I9 PRAAM +31 57
#note I took forever on this turn, looking for bingos and words I normally have a tough time finding. I missed two this time, 12G M(Y)OPIA and C7 M(E)ROPIA. Laid this down in frustration, but at least I knew that it was a good thematic play. Score well, don't leave too badly, block scoring plays that block the board, keep it bingo-friendly enough for a comeback. Many qualities to this play, but they fall short of just pure equity.
>Judy_Horn: EX 9B EX +39 137
#note welp, punished for my mistake of not playing MEROPIA I guess, but perhaps she had an I
>Joshua_Sokol: BINOSTU J10 BO +24 81
#note Ouch, bad miss. This time I did everything right, alphagrammed it, looked for it, but just couldn't find BOTULIN or BOTULINS. There should be a clause in Scrabble that when someone is attempting a comeback and miss their best opportunity to get back into it, they are forced to forfeit!
>Judy_Horn: DLRY F6 DR.LY +21 158
>Joshua_Sokol: AINSSTU K9 ISSUANT +78 159
#note She was consonant-heavy, so K9 ISSUANT is definitely better here than the alternative

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EILNPT N8 PLENIsT +75 286
#note misread her here, this was clearly a mistake.
>Judy_Horn: EINSZ O7 ZEIN +55 259
#note Apparently Judy had an S here, if we believe Sal Piro's witness of her side of the game. If that's the case, this is a mistake, most likely. 20 points less than ZE(P)S or ZI(P)S
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIINO M4 OIDIA +12 298
#note I was far enough ahead to play a lot of bingo defense here, in my opinion.
>Judy_Horn: TU 10A UT +12 271
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EENNRV A10 .NEVEN +30 328
>Judy_Horn: K C7 K.. +19 290
#note although that E was still there, so probably wrong to play that OIDIA!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEORTU L4 TOE +15 343
#note time to shut it all down. I had two board vision misses here, G1 fOURTEE(N) and OUTpREE(N).
>Judy_Horn: DFIO E3 FIDO +19 309
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEFORU 4B OUR.E +10 353
#note just needed the win at this point, so this
>Judy_Horn: OOW N2 WOO +15 324
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEFSV O1 VEStA +31 384
#note Blocks her big scoring plays to perhaps threaten outs next turn. VA(W) is perhaps worth considering to accomplish the same thing and keep the ever-flexible block tile.

>Joshua_Sokol: AFGR B14 FA +22 406
>Judy_Horn: AERST 3E .ASTER +13 349
#note I should have played FAR(ED) 6I last turn, to prevent her from playing L12 T(R)ES to run away with more points.
