#note Quackle likes HOME(Y) best. It does keep the I for QI but kind of shuts the board down. Tough to say. (-9.2)

>Joey_Krafchick: JLLOUUW F3 W.UL +9 389
#note Although this blocks some lanes nicely, I think I'll just have to be content if he bingoes a 4th time in a row. 10D LOW is probably my best bet, saving the J and regaining a big lead. The U's suck, but this is still a better path.

I originally thought, well this blocks bingo lanes and saves JO for JO(I)N if I draw an N. Another option is 3K ULU, making it harder to score with LAMBERTS but also saving for JO(I)N potentially. Either ULU or LOW are better than WAUL

#note I go for points here. The S isn't of much use on this board, so JO for 29 is pointless. I need the 40
