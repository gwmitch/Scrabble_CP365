>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEEILR 8H LAREE +12 12
#note I think this was my rack. AERIE at 8H is clearly the play. WOuldn't have mattered much though. -9.4
>Will_Scott: AAEINST M2 TAENIAS +72 72
#note Because he has this. Will scored this as 70.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEINRU 2H REUNI.E +18 30
#note I felt like jacking up the volatility on this board. Surprisingly I made the right call according to Quackle. This is best.
>Will_Scott: CKLR 4K CL.RK +32 104
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGHIOOU 1G OOH +29 59
#note 2nd best play. ERUGO is a bit better but mine scores 5 more. -2.4
>Will_Scott: DEZ 7I ZED +49 153
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEFGIUY 3G BEY +31 90
#note Toss up between this and 9G FIG. I figured I could set up my Y with BEY. Mine was the 2nd best play according to Quackle. -1.4
>Will_Scott: DINWY 4C WINDY +31 184
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFGIOQU 3A QUAG +41 131
#note Best play!
>Will_Scott: ELLV O4 .VELL +36 220
>Jonathan_Lindh: FFIOOUW 5D FOO +26 157
#note I'm not doing QUIFF Quackle. I think this is best.
>Will_Scott: EHMRT 6D THERM +32 252
#note It was around this point when Will whined to the director because I was supposedy "excessively gesturing". I opened my hand for 3 seconds twice, dummy, and didn't obscure your view of the board. Now if we want to talk about actual rules violations, let's talk about you REACHING FOR THE BAG BEFORE RECORDING YOUR SCORE REPEATEDLY!
>Jonathan_Lindh: SU A1 SU. +36 193
#note Didn't record my rack but pretty sure it was best.
>Will_Scott: AA 1N AA +8 260
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEFOPTW 6J FOC. +35 228
#note Can't read my writing. This is 4th best to Quackle but I wanted to save my P to hit the ZAP spot the next turn. -2.6
>Will_Scott: AOSTU 9E AUTOS +22 282
#note Well Will hits it first but no big deal.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IJOPRTW 8A TWIRP +37 265
#note Best play! I think I have a serious chance of coming back.
>Will_Scott: DENP 10B PEND +19 301
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BEIJNO B6 JO. +29 294
#note Best play!
>Will_Scott: ?EINRTX 2A .X +36 337
>Will_Scott: ?EINRTX --  -36 301
#note <Smirk>
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BEIMNN C7 M.N. +17 311
#note Best play! I thought I was missing something here.
>Will_Scott: OX 1K OX +36 337
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ABEINV L8 .NVIABlE +76 387
#note Best play! Nerve racking situation! Do you pass on the bingo here? Playing the bingo empties the bag and leaves me with all 7 letters on my rack. This is an argument for PAVIN at B10 for 20 or sAVINE for 43. I just decided to take the points and I ended up choosing wisely.
>Will_Scott: ?DGIIRS A10 SIDInG +35 372
#note I don't normally smirk when my opponents have epic fail moments like this as I have been there before, but unnecessarily calling the director on me warrants a big smirk for sure. GIARDIAS for 59 is hard to see and an understandable miss late in the game, but missing RIDGIEST, RINGSIDE, and the new word RIGIDEST for 77? Karma is a mother isn't it? Will did get the best of the non-bingo plays and his was 5th best. -68.6 for Will.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGIITT M12 GAIT +24 411
#note 2nd best play! Looks like I had a bit of an epic fail moment here too but at least I didn't miss RIDGIEST! If I bothered to look around the board, DIGITATE would have come to me for 72, but I didn't. -65.8 but doesn't make a difference in the outcome.
>Will_Scott: R C7 ....R +7 379
#note 2nd best play for Will. I thought he played WINER* at first and then realized I read the M upside down. REUNITER and AR is 10. -3
>Will_Scott:  (EIT) +6 385
#note Final score recorded as 411-383. TAENIAS was underscored by 2. Today's lesson of the day: Don't throw stones if you live in glass houses, especially if you commit <actual> rules violations during games. I have only been involved 3 director's calls in my life. 1. The flying tile game vs. Greg Feldkamp at Nationals. Funny moment. We both laughed at that. 2. Game 20 against Harriette at New Orleans when I was slow in holding her phony and wanted to make sure I couldn't challenge it off. We both just wanted to make sure even though my slowness on the hold is 100% my fault. No biggie 3. This bogus call. Anyways, whatever Scrabble beef that occured at Nashville is now over and I've said my peace in the Nashville writeups. I'm not holding any grudges, but people deserve to be called out publicly for ratchet actions like this.
