#note I thought this was a good play from Ross. It scored enough, made a new threat, and perhaps balance his rack.

#note I was trying to remember which of GANOF and GONOF are good. I thought there were only 7 spellings, but I could write down 8. I had the words right, but the wrong count! Luckily, GOOF worked out better for me.

#note This drew the free challenge. Ross gave me a thoughtful compliment on my play after this game, saying it was the only game where he felt outplayed. He pointed to MANEB as an example. He was quite gracious.
