>Jonathan_Lindh: ILLMNOU 8D MOULIN +22 22
#note If this right I missed MULLION as an opening bingo. BAD BAD. Mine is 2nd best to MULLION plays. -52.7
>Carl_Davis: AINOQ F7 Q.INOA +17 17
>Jonathan_Lindh: FIJLOUV 12B JOVI.L +32 54
#note Best play!
>Carl_Davis: EW B12 .EW +26 43
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ACFGOU A13 FOG +31 85
#note Best play!
>Carl_Davis: HO C11 O.H +30 73
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ACEMUU E10 EM.C +26 111
#note UMIAC at E10 setting up my blank and scoring 28! I like! Maybe I wouldn't have to exchange the next turn. -15.6
>Carl_Davis: EEF 9H FEE +15 88
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AIKPUU -UUKAPI +0 111
#note Quackle likes playing through with AUK for 16 at G13. I wnat to get rid of this garbage so I dump 6 keeping the blank. Quackle has it at -11 but I am fine with my play.
>Carl_Davis: EGINRST K7 RESTING +73 161
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ADELTT L2 bATTLED +75 186
#note Tied for the best play!
>Carl_Davis: ACP 10A CAP +18 179
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDEPRUZ 3J BR.ZED +36 222
#note PUTZ at 5J seems much better than mine. -9.7 and 7th best.
>Carl_Davis: DENTT N2 N.TTED +18 197
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BIOPSU O7 OPUS +21 243
#note This was a horrible turn. SUBOPTIC and SUBTOPIC for 92 at A3. Why did not look there? SUBTOPIA at B3 is for 61 as well. -45
>Carl_Davis: ADEU 11I AD.EU +6 203
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BEILRY 4D LIBERtY +81 324
#note 2nd best play! Bailed out by the tiles but still miss BRULYIE for 3 more. I know that word too! -3
>Carl_Davis: AW O1 WA. +23 226
>Jonathan_Lindh: GIIINOV 5C VINO +24 348
#note 4th best play! OOH! VINIC for 30! Should have seen that one. -9
>Carl_Davis: AER H1 REA. +12 238
>Jonathan_Lindh: GHIINOS M9 HO.SING +30 378
#note Quackle like plain old HIC here for 24 possibly anticipating a bingo that won't come. I just went for the points. My move scores the most but seems risky at this stage of the game. I just didn;t want to give Carl multiple cracks at a bingo.
>Carl_Davis: AAEIRRT A4 ERRATI. +30 268
#note Actual rack. I discovered while quackling Carl missed TERRARIA for 59 which would make the score 378-339 catching me with KAUSIXY. I knew HOUSING seemed dumb. Carl got the second best play. -81.6 for Carl.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AIKSUXY 15K KA.US +33 411
#note I don't see D2 KYLIX which saves some spread. 4 points worth to be exact because I offload all of my powers.
>Carl_Davis: A M3 .A +14 282
#note Best play for Carl!
>Carl_Davis:  (IXY) +26 308
#note Score recorded as 413-309. Not a well played game on my part but still good enough for a 104 point victory.
