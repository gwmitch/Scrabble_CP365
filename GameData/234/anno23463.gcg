#note HAFIZ sims just above, but I don't like giving away easy points with the H next to the DWS after HAFIZ.

#note I spent a very long time looking for 8s that would make AXED or EXED for lots of points, for 8s to the D in XED, and for potentiail 9s through the RE. Unable to find any, I play this. Turns out there is a 9 through the RE that would've significantly helped my chances to win had I known it - PREATTUNE.

#note He just keeps on scoring *sigh*
>Jesse_Matthews: BIIOORT 14K ROBOT +26 382
#note With this draw I'm hooped. The duck suggests 9B BIO for 23, but I'm assuming he has the J and I at least want to make him work for the points if he's got it, so I'm taking out the easiest J spot to score with.
