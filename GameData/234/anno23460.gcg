#note Didn't see BINME(N), which actually sims second to this by 2.9, but I prefer BINMEN given who I'm playing. A " B" in the triple-triple isn't too threatening, and I need to keep it as open as possible obviously.

#note I wanted to play CITY, but I figure rather than letting him score 40 here next turn, I'll just tie the game up and make this a closed board duel

#note Two T's out still, but G8 TR(O)N(E) is slightly better, missed that. Eliminates pretty much all bingo opportunities, but I would still kind of have to bank of drawing the blank anyway.

>Joey_Krafchick: CDINRSW 6F CI.N +18 332
#note Now I have the case S for 15L, and he surely won't bingo now that I clogged everything (while scoring a decent 18, mind you)...


>David_Gibson: ?EEGINO E1 GENOIsE +70 401
#note Or he can be just that lucky
>Joey_Krafchick: AADRRSW N5 RAW +20 352
#note With only one unseen E and both blanks gone, I needed to not turn over too many letters. DRAWS for 47 is pretty much throwing in the towel, so I played this and Gibson even complimented this play.

#note Best

#note I played well this game! No blanks, no bingoes, lost by 44. I'll take that.
