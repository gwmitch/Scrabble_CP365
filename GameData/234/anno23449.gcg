>Jonathan_Lindh: EFGMNOT 8D FOMENT +30 30
#note Best play!
>Ruchi_Gupta: AEGMNTZ G6 BY.gONES +67 67
>Ruchi_Gupta: AEGMNTZ --  -67 0
#note Not the right spelling of BYGONES. Challenged quickly. Also note the double doubles of BALONEYS and BOLONEYS that Ruchi missed.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGGLUVY F8 .UGGY +16 46
#note This play was hard! Do I block BYGONES? I couldn't find a way to do it. Once again, right letters wrong spot. FUGGY at D8 is my play. 6th best and -10
>Ruchi_Gupta: ?BENOSY J2 BYgONES +81 81
#note SOYBEAN in the same spot is 83. Note I also blocked the double doubles of BALONEYS and BOLONEYS from the Ruchi's first turn. One positive of MUGGY although FUGGY does the same thing.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEILSTV 12C BEV. +24 70
#note Best play!
>Ruchi_Gupta: GIO 3J .OGI +16 97
>Jonathan_Lindh: HIJLSTW 5I J.WL +28 98
#note Best play!
>Ruchi_Gupta: AE E11 A.E +18 115
>Jonathan_Lindh: EHILRST M5 SLITHER +80 178
#note Best play! SLITHER is the only bingo with these letters and I picked the best spot.
>Ruchi_Gupta: EIU 8L E.UI +15 130
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACHLRUX 13C AX. +37 215
#note 4th best play! CULEX at 10J for 36 of course! Mine scored the most  but is -4.2.
>Ruchi_Gupta: DEOT I5 .OT.ED +21 151
#note Cool overlap!
>Jonathan_Lindh: CFHKLRU 10L F.CK +19 234
#note Bad play! FUCK at N1 is best. I wanted to block the I because I though Ruchi had a bingo and I wanted to seal the win. Well she did have a bingo, just not in that spot. -22.5
>Ruchi_Gupta: AEIINRT G1 INERTIA. +60 211
#note Scored as 59. She made the right choice to play it. Bad luck for me.
>Jonathan_Lindh: HLNORUW 1E WH.RL +33 267
#note 2nd best play! WHIN is preferred by .4 but scores 3 less. I am fine with my play although it said up a bomb by Ruchi later in the game.
>Ruchi_Gupta: ?ADRSTV 14E STARVeD +69 280
#note That was a terrible sequence for me!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEENOU H12 AU.A +15 282
#note I  like my play but 2D AEON is preferred by 4.2 somehow. Mine is 7th best.
>Ruchi_Gupta: Q 6F Q. +31 311
#note It gets worse. Sigh.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EENOPRT 15J REPENT +37 319
#note 3rd best play! KETONE and POTEEN offer a little better equity although I would do my play again in a second. Mine once again score the most.
>Ruchi_Gupta: ADEIOZ D1 ADOZE +45 356
#note Ruchi said I blocked AZIDES with REPENT so I'm glad that play accomplished something. ADOZE is the second best play here, with AZIDO offering the same score and slightly better equity. This was a beautiful play on Ruchi's part, so I give her props.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEIIOPR 13J PORED +24 343
#note OUCH! The hard to see PIROGI for 23 may have won it for me because it breaks up the double I. Mine isn't bad but not ideal.
>Ruchi_Gupta: CIIN 10B ICIN. +18 374
#note PIROGI blocks this too!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AIILMSU E4 AM +27 370
#note I think this is best.
>Ruchi_Gupta: ANOO K11 AN... +12 386
#note Ah crap! There was an O left in the bag that never got played! Ruchi should have taken it but she said it fell off the board. How would have it affected things?
>Jonathan_Lindh: IILSU N1 LIS +15 385
#note She still wins no matter what. That's what happens. My play is best here.
>Ruchi_Gupta: OO H8 .OO +8 394
#note Ruchi played F1 HO for 11 to go out not NOO. There was an unplayed O left in the bag. Wouldn;t have changed the result but cost me 3 spread points. We both should have caught that.
>Ruchi_Gupta:  (IU) +4 398
#note Final score recorded as 400-385. Maybe playing FUGGY, PIROGI, or FUCK would have made the difference given the close spread? Still a disappointing loss where I was outdrawn once again.
