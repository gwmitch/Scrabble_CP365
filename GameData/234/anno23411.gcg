#note this game came right after a 215-point loss. last match of the day. against one of the best in the world. no pressure. just play the tiles, not the opponent.

#note even had i seen THIEF e11 (31), probably wouldn't have considered it. because i don't have a death wish.

#note damn you, beardo. right when i had a nice cleanup with my rack in that spot.
>sneakyofverb: AAHRSTU G12 AH +27 352

#note ranks #1 on the hit list. 12 points, a number of chances to hit a 7, makes him think a bit longer. jackpot.

#note he did take his time with this play. it does give him a small lead but he's not really gonna like the last 6 tiles on this board. oh, there's another reason for him to be upset...

#note ...had he not bingoed covering that area, i would've played BRA(N)KEST 14e. the only problem with this word is that it is NOT ACCEPTABLE. had the alphagram written down and convinced myself that was the correct 8 (find the one in there that's legit). but it's tough to forego TOOLIES because you can't magically foresee your opponent immediately laying down a phony. he played out several hypothetical sequences involving not bingoing and didn't really find any he liked. in summation, i totally lucked out by being spared major embarrassment.
