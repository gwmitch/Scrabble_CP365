>Nicholas_Schneider: ADM 7H DAM +24 24
>Jesse_Matthews: AADEILN 6H AL +16 36
#note Quackle seems to strongly prefer ALE in the exact same spot for 10 more points. I'm assuming that giving up 10 points to keep a slightly better leave isn't considered to be as good here and hence why my play is considered -8.1 in equity loss

>Nicholas_Schneider: ABIJLNO -ABIJLN +0 52
>Jesse_Matthews: ADEEHIN J2 HE.. +17 73
#note I decided to chance him not knowing about THEBE so I played this instead of HEAL

>Nicholas_Schneider: CEU 9J CUE +12 84
>Jesse_Matthews: EELPRTT 1G PELT +28 186
#note The duck slightly prefers six tile plays up top rather than PELT
>Nicholas_Schneider: IKP N7 KIP +21 105
>Jesse_Matthews: ?AEIQRT 2F QI +35 221
#note At this point I'm feeling pretty good. But...
>Nicholas_Schneider: ?EGORST 10E GORiEST +73 178
#note ...he finally gets a bingo down. So what do I do?
>Jesse_Matthews: ?AEORRT E5 TERRA.On +82 303
#note I get greedy and decide to push the limits. He holds and accepts, but then...
>Nicholas_Schneider: EGINRTY 3B RETYING +91 269
#note ...has pulled this naturally out of the bag. Not supposed to happen!!
>Jesse_Matthews: BDLOTUW D11 WOULD +29 332
>Nicholas_Schneider: CEOV 8A COVE. +33 302
>Jesse_Matthews: ABIJTTV 6B JIV. +30 362
#note The duck prefers 15D DAVIT but I hate the vowelless leave, no way.
>Nicholas_Schneider: AEHLN H10 .NHALE +36 338
#note He's not letting up with scoring. This is not good!
>Jesse_Matthews: AABIITT 12H .ABIT +20 382
#note Ok, I don't understand this one. Quackle prefers HABITAT (which I saw) to my play by about 5% for winning chances and about 6 equity points. There's two unseen esses to me and some dangerously high scoring tiles...why would that sim higher??
>Nicholas_Schneider: MOY 13G M.YO +29 367
>Jesse_Matthews: AEINNTU C11 TINEA +27 409
#note At this point it's looking very very bad for me. He's going to score at least 40 next turn and I've got one pointers!
>Nicholas_Schneider: ADEISUZ 4A ZEDA +57 424
>Jesse_Matthews: FNSU 15H .NUF +7 416
#note I decide to block his out and leave myself some points to go out next turn, hoping for a mistake from him.
>Nicholas_Schneider: ISU M11 US +13 437
#note He was low on time, so while this was a point-related mistake, it still didn't cost him the game.
>Jesse_Matthews: S 6B ....S +17 433
#note And there you have it...how I lost Game 1 at CNSC!
>Jesse_Matthews:  (I) +2 435
