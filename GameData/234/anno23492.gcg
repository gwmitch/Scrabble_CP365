>Jackson_Smylie: AADEOTW 8F AWA +12 12
#note very close between awa and woad, woad edging out a sim. average score is about 4-5 lower after awa for arod, which I like. 
>Alex_Rodriguez: AEFMORS 7F FOAMERS +79 79
>Jackson_Smylie: DDEOOTT 9D DOTE +19 31
#note maybe OTTO? I don't need to open the board so fiercely right now; this gives back a bit to much.
>Alex_Rodriguez: BEY 6H BEY +38 117
>Jackson_Smylie: ADINOST 8A NODI +22 53
#note DATO? NODI? DO? my instinct says to score points and play NODI
>Alex_Rodriguez: ?AEGINV K7 .EpAVING +72 189
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AASSTW 13F SeAWA.TS +78 131
#note I saw WASTAGeS and SeAWANTS and SWASTIkA but wasn't sure enough of swastika to play it - thought it might be a proper noun or something. the best play is of course SWASTIcA to bait the challenge. 
>Alex_Rodriguez: DIQ H12 Q.DI +72 261
>Jackson_Smylie: EIINTUY 11J I.Y +9 140
#note hated this play but hated everything. I considered UNITED for a bit as well, but IY is so uninspiring. I didn't want to play ETUI and close off that part. 
>Alex_Rodriguez: BDLO B6 BL.OD +18 279
>Jackson_Smylie: EIMNTUU 5I MENU +25 165
#note again hated everything... I didn't see any nice way to open things up, so in my quest to do something useful I end up just trying to score as I saw nothing. (A)MU seems silly. I just dn't see how I win after MENU though. maybe hope he fucks up...

>Alex_Rodriguez: OTT I9 TOT +21 368
>Jackson_Smylie: GIIRSTU 6L TUI +8 205
#note the plan: he blocks at 4L-4O, I triple triple while hooking the S. or maybe he blocks along 4 and I hit an S bingo and then another bingo. Plan C is to hit a double double along D.

>Alex_Rodriguez: EL N9 EL +10 398
>Jackson_Smylie: EFGINOX 3M FOX +41 336
#note Hoping he plays at 01 and I either double double or hit a big 1 row bingo. 
>Alex_Rodriguez: EJRRRUV O1 RE. +30 428
>Jackson_Smylie: EEGIINP 1H PEIGNIE. +86 422
>Jackson_Smylie: EEGIINP --  -86 336
#note hoping he accepts this cause he thinks he has to (cause it empties the bag, challenging unsuccessfully could cost him) and then he miraculously fucks up the endgame. I dont' see another great way to win here... maybe he'd mix it up with peignoir as well.
