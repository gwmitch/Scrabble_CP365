#note The duck doesn't like me giving up 17 points here for a nicer leave; it prefers TILE or LITE at 11D. ALU isn't so horrible as a leave I guess, but against Mike I can afford to fish a bit more.

#note I see AGLITTER and think 1) I'm not sure it's a word and 2) if it is, is it just Collins? I should've just tried it anyway given that I have the lead and several other spots to play bingos if it's not a word and it's challenged off. Bad decision.
>Mike_Ebanks: AEK A13 KEA +38 159
>Jesse_Matthews: DHIOTVW D1 WHID +38 260
#note It's a tossup between this and VOID in the same spot. While VOID doesn't leave any vowels, the TH and WH possibilities make for better synergy than WHID does with the uglier OTV leave
>Mike_Ebanks: DEIOR 1D .EIRDO +30 189
>Jesse_Matthews: EGGORTV 6B V.G +15 275
#note C12 ERGO for 32 is a nicer play. Leave isn't as nice as it is for my play, but the 17 extra points are worth it.

#note Mike challenges VEGA and then remembers as we're walking to the challenge computer that it's a new word
>Jesse_Matthews: CEMNORS N8 .NCOMERS +86 435
#note Quackle would rather I play it safe with the 13E placement of this word for 18 less points but no chance at a 3x3 for Mike
>Mike_Ebanks: BEIN F4 BINE +32 321
>Jesse_Matthews: FGLNNOY 15L NO.Y +24 459
#note Even though it empties the bag, this is the only available play that wins me the game 100% of the time. Other candidate plays might get me more spread but also leave him a chance at a 3x3 to win the game. I have to take it out, so I do.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?IORSTY 13G TYROSIn. +74 395
#note Turns out he wouldn't have had a 3x3 or even a bingo in general on that bottom line, but I'm quite alright with taking the precautionary measure to ensure the win.
