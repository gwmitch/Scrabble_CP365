#note i played this way too fast. although it still sims best, i think HIND or HINDS or something is at least worth considering. or maybe i just got unlucky because i was not drawing many vowels for a while.

#note -1, quackle likes 14A NAVS (a lot more than VANS in the same spot... ?)
>frentz: ETT 9I TET +11 196
>cesar: AHNNRRS 10J HA +28 246
#note this was literally physically painful to play. 10J RAN is the best move here. -3.... close enough.

>cesar: ANNPRRS O2 NAP +19 265
#note i like this, keeping the S. if only i could draw one of the fifty million vowels in the damn bag. -1.5 K9 TARPAN

>cesar: CLNRRSS 11K N.RL +14 279
#note lol omg. quackle wants me to play off the S as well which no i'm not going to do quackle come on jesus christ.  that is never right. -1.5 but not really.

#note i forgot about WHIRRY until i started simming this game.. :( although if i do CAY there keeping RSST i'm going to draw three consonants. -15

>cesar: CEEIMSU O12 EMEU +30 352
#note i was not 100% on EMICS, which is new. ETICS got added too. i thought it was both of them. UREIC 13C sims best, saving the spot for another turn?? this is weird. -13

>cesar: BCDEIOS B6 CO... +31 383
#note at this point weird things started happening around me at the tournament with people leaving and director calls and blah blah and XP really helped with it. thanks XP. i was kind of flustered and decided i was very likely to win after COMIX even if he blocks because he has three Is and i am at the very least saving BIN for another 28. i thought maybe 14B COSIED was the best play, but i was having doubts about its wordhood, and worried i was missing something.
