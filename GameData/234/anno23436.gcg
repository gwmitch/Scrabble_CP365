#note Quackle dislikes my play in part because it gives Heidi the potential to 3x3, as hard as it might be. COOFS or FOOLS at 9C are the recommended options. I saw both, but FOOLS gives an easy TWS play in lane 8 and both COOFS and FOOLS allow for the possibility of a 2x2 through an O, which isn't the easiest but is still a possibility. My play might be better if I didn't already have a tie, because my play is more conducive to running up spread. With my tie, spread doesn't really matter, so FOOLS or COOFS are probably better, with my preference being COOFS.

#note With no esses left and no easy way to block me after this play, I decide to go for it.

#note With four Rs unseen to me, I feel pretty good about drawing one for BIRDIES next turn. If not, then she's stuck with 4 Rs, so either way I'm not too worried here. Here fishy fishy!
