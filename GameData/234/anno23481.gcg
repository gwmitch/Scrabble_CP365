#note too many overlaps, this was a mistake (this is the 3rd time I am annotating this game so commentary will be to a minimum)
>Karl_Higby: AHJ 6F HAJ +51 79
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEIIZ -AEII +0 22
#note should just play through with AI. Does a lot of good and not that much bad to do so. Keeping the A for A(JAR) was smart at least.
>Karl_Higby: CIM 5D MIC +25 104
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEILOZ J7 DIAZOLE +95 117
#note I kept the A for A(JAR), did I say? I actually kept it for DIAZOLE hooking (TOGAE)D! Fooled you good!

>Joshua_Sokol: AELOQRU D1 QUAL. +52 169
#note From now on I just get very lucky. Talk to you when it gets sort of interesting again.

#note A word that I know and that my similarly-rated opponent does not is quite the rarity. This happened three times this game, and this is the first occurence!

#note probably would have lost my turn to ROTUNDS* if he had left me the spot.
>Karl_Higby: DEENOSV N3 NOSED.VE +72 333
#note this was a very clutch find by Karl!

>Karl_Higby: ?DEGILY 14B DEIGnLY +77 410
>Karl_Higby: ?DEGILY --  -77 333
#note Took a very long time to make this play. Luckily I had the other blank and could make a fearless challenge of this plausible phony. GELIDLY is a word, and was available. If Karl had played that instead, I would have lost my turn and it would have been quite close.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BGIRSU I1 SIB +38 477
#note This was a tough turn, not that it mattered if I made the worst possible play or not. I wanted to play BUG(LO)Ss at 12G and probably should have, though I feared he would find something else and play it under BY. BUGLOSS would have been great though, as Karl didn't know the word, and might have challenged. That's word 2/3 that I knew. Already a miracle, I would say. Karl knows a ton of words. Apparently I should play 6A RUGS with the inference. Seems to hit a lot of stuff in the pool. Underscored by 1

#note gotta block in the 1/5 chance he has drawn the M.
>Karl_Higby: ?DEGIKL 12J ..sE +36 378
#note -31 to (TA)LKED E7, blocking my out. But first, you have to know MERGUEZ is a word, and second, you have to have tracked well, third, you have to see it while imagining that you have my tiles. Lastly, I have to go through that first step and also see it over the board.
