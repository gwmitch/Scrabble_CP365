#note drew to see who went first. both picked Rs. he picked a blank. i didn't. true story.
>sneakyofverb: CDIMNRY I8 RICY +16 16
#note (G)YMNIC. ooh, fancy. MINCY/MIDGY gives back too much. and anyways, you should know by now i only make shorter suboptimal plays like this so i can instantly fall into playable 7s/8s.

#note when solid analysis fails, hope swoops in and picks up the slack.
>unsafe_art: JO 14J JO +52 101
#note boo. but wait, i've got a blank. i can't possibly screw this up, can i?
>sneakyofverb: ?EFISSV J4 FIVES +22 101
>sneakyofverb: ?EFISSV --  -22 79
#note you bet i can. not only because i can drop a phony three but also since i wrote down FISSIVE and thought i went crazy and made it up. save this sequence for the memoirs.
>unsafe_art: BGU G11 GUB +27 128
>sneakyofverb: ?EFISSV 14E EF +30 109
#note once again, the lack of FISSIVE becomes obvious.

#note had this spot not been around, would've still had the same word pluralizing MELANOID for eight less.
>unsafe_art: LOTU D11 LOUT +14 176
>sneakyofverb: ADGIKNY E10 KAY +29 234
#note thought about c9 KIANG (40) (yeah, forgot about KYANG) but got worried after LOUT and didn't want him to hit a double-double right away.

#note highest scoring bingo. now, i'm REALLY getting worried.
>sneakyofverb: EFGIMNN B6 FE..ING +21 299
#note the score for 10a EF (26) is decent but i'm not leaving myself with a clunky four-to-one consonant-vowel ratio. fork the board, ride the wave, go for the case S.
>unsafe_art: DORU A10 DOUR +15 291
>sneakyofverb: BCIMNTZ 6J Z.T +32 331
#note there's no reason to reach for n13 BIZ/MIZ (36) because you could get hurt by the S but more likely, the other guy will score more for a chintzy two-tile effort in the corner with six As and two Os unseen.
>unsafe_art: EO 7J O.E. +16 307
>sneakyofverb: ABCIMNP J9 BA +20 351
#note once again, don't have to up the anxiety with n11 MANIC (36). and since you're also thinking about it, yes, i was aware of that hook down the N column.
>unsafe_art: DEIOW C2 DOWIE +23 330
>sneakyofverb: CHIMNPS 8M .CH +21 372
#note nothing looked particularly appealing through DOWIE. n12 HM (21) is awfully enticing holding the S but i became fixated on knocking out [OBES]E and this was the best way to accomplish that.
>unsafe_art: AQT B1 QAT +32 362
>sneakyofverb: AILMNPS 13L ..M +8 380
#note really wanted to ditch the P since the available As are more plentiful than the Es. but also saw the possibility of HERNIATE/ATHERINE from the unseen pool and wanted no part of that.
>unsafe_art: I 10E .I +8 370
#note you gosh darn stinker. curse you to...nah, i can't be mad at you.
>sneakyofverb: AEILNPS D3 PENS +35 415
#note other plays exist, i don't care. la la la. i'm scoring as much as i can see and win this mofo.

#note look, it fits. how, um, fitting? huge exhale.
