>Joshua_Sokol: AGLRSTU H7 GUL +8 8
#note Originally thought to play long with GAULT, but GUL's defense and the great ARST leave caused me to rethink that decision. I think this is warranted as an 8-point sacrifice.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AENV G6 VANE +18 18
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEERST 10H SEDATER +69 77
#note Was just about convinced that this did not take an S, but after hitting the clock that assertion became very shaky. I need to be comfortable with my word knowledge in a play such as this.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ANORY 11I RAYON +35 53
>Joshua_Sokol: DLOSTTU M9 T..DU +14 91
#note I think I must have missed L7 OUT(TO)LD? No, I took a very long time on this turn, and I must have seen it. I think I might have forgotten about it though. It's an aggressive play, but this board is quite bingo-heavy already, and will be tough to control in most situations. I think that was my play here. Perhaps I wasn't sure OUTTOLD was good.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: FN I9 F..N +21 74
>Joshua_Sokol: ILOOSTW H12 OLIO +18 109
#note This wasn't the best of draws, nor was it the worst, but it ended up making me think for a while again! The only play that doesn't spend my S and score was OLIO, but that kept a W. I guess keeping the W is relatively balanced, and I won't run in to many unscorable racks. OILW(AY) is the option I missed, but this is better, as it scores more, doesn't give much back and takes away a scoring spot. I am not fishing here. That's just a mistake.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: BLMO 14G L.MBO +15 89
>Joshua_Sokol: HIKQSTW 15K WHISK +62 171
#note Unfortunately I was going to pluralize SEDATER here. Luckily he gave me a better option. Ugh, flip-flopping between validity and invalidity. Schrodinger's word.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EEINRST 7G ..ENTRIES +62 151
#note OK, well if he doesn't think SEDATERS is good, then it must not be good. Yay...
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILQT O4 QAT. +23 194
#note 8Type a note here!
>Mark_Przybyszewski: DER N5 DE.R +14 165
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIILN 8J AI +6 200
#note I wa going to play 13C LINEA(L) because I felt like I should be building my spread, but that was just ridiculous. This board was dead, I needed to keep it that way. I did put in on the board, though, so that was a mistake. I decided that his play last turn was fishy, but I was confused as to why he didn't open anything up. His range seemed to indicate that he couldn't do anything after this play. So I decided to bleed equity, by preventing Mark from scoring or bingo-ing, and preventing me from doing the same thing.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EFT G12 FE.T +19 184
#note He said I blocked FRAGME(N)T, so I guess my gut feeling was good enough.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEILNO 12L O.E +14 214
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AGZ O11 ZAG +20 204
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEIILN 5K CNI.. +16 230
#note I was starting to feel like I was losing my lead, so I almost played ICIE(R) here. This is the beginning of me blowing this game. How long can I keep the board closed? 
>Mark_Przybyszewski: PRU F9 PUR +16 220
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEILW L3 WI.E. +16 246
#note This is the last time I will ever consider the validity of WINER*. After I made the play I thought "shoot, this takes a T hook. Why didn't I notice that?" I didn't notice because I was playing a phony word I never saw played and hooked. Blegh, huge mistake number one.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AAAU -AAAU +0 220
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEELO 3L .AE +12 258
#note I felt very fortunate to have drawn the blank here, as I had a read that Mark had been keeping a blank this whole time. Given T(WINER) I should play A(W)E or A(W)EE here so that I can more likely bingo next turn.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: INX I4 NIX. +11 231
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AELMOP H1 POME +30 288
#note I missed an insanely good play here that I normally would have seen instantly. I tunnelled here, looked a while for bingos, and didn't realize that I was setting up a huge spot for my opponent. This play was probably my biggest board vision failure of the tournament. MO(GULS) H5!
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ?AHIORS 1G A.HORIaS +63 294
#note Lucky he missed ApHORIS(M) here. I didn't consider holding, despite this nonword ringing alarm bells in my head. I have played this phony before. It's APORIAS. I saw him write VAPORISH on his scoresheet before playing, and knew that was valid. In any case, I wasn't sure enough of APHORIAS* to consider challenging, since the game seemed to be under control, still.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACJLOU 11D JA. +20 308
#note However, I should have held, because although this position seemed quite winnable, it took a lot of time (that I didn't really have) to even come up with something that seemingly won all the time. This was very counterintuitive, but allowing him to play (J)IVEY seemed to win me the game, as he would be left with 3 consonants that were mostly unplayable. I didn't however have enough time to realize that just (J)IVY would be tough to outrun, since it doesn't give as much playback and leave Mark with a vowel.

I felt the need to get rid of my J here, but saw no other way to do so. Before analyzing this game, I was thinking about the position again and realized that this was not a winning move. I lose the game if I draw the T or the G, so long as Mark plays out the endgame right. The endgame with a G draw is actually quite complicated, so perhaps I would have tied instead, which is how the most obvious move ends up. So this pre-endgame was tough. My play wins 75% of the time, but the best play is the unorthodox 2M LAC, leaving me with very little to work with. But that's fine, as Mark is the one that has to do something with his junky tiles to end up winning the game. LAC wins with every draw.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: BDEGITY D11 .IBED +34 328
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CLOUV 2M LUV +20 328
#note Over-fancy. Playing COL(D) first allows me to go out with VUm for 21 next turn. I hoped he would attempt to block with TY(E) or G(E)Y and give me more points. I was down to mere seconds on my clock.
