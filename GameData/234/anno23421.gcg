>Joshua_Sokol: DENOSTU H6 SNOUTED +70 70
#note honestly almost missed this.
>Fern_Lindzon: DEEEGIN 6F DE.IGNEE +68 68
#note She also almost missed this, which is much more understandable. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?MQRSUU 5K UM +16 86
#note Would have been awesome to get to play QUORUMS here. I decided to be a bit fishy here, as I could hit many devastating bingos next turn in multiple spots. I can see why someone would prefer playing USQU(E) for points or just QU(O)RUM for 17 to keep the variance low.
>Fern_Lindzon: BEGIY 4K BEIGY +45 113
#note huge backfire to punish me for increasing variance
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EQRSUW O1 QUE. +48 134
>Fern_Lindzon: FILRTU 11E TIR.FUL +40 153
#note I let a phony go! Sounded good to me but I did get a little spark of perplexity when this came down. Don't worry, I will avenge my mistake.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIRSTW 5A WAISTeR +72 206
#note Challenging would have probably almost sealed the game, with many 2x2s available in the spot she took. 224-153 becomes 206-153 on an out-of-control board. TRIShAW is 76 in the same spot, and that becomes a missed bingo, and a mistake as well.
>Fern_Lindzon: AEJN D1 JEAN. +40 193
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CEFILL B1 FELL.tIC +74 280
#note What a phony! That is up there in terms of hilarity and embarrassment...

I missed ICEFALLS here, saw FLEECILY and doubted its validity, saw FACILELY and doubted its validity, and missed FOLLICLE until I was on hold for a few minutes. Luckily she let this go, and I indulged in my unknown phony vengeance. 
>Fern_Lindzon: ERRY 1D .ERRY +45 238
>Joshua_Sokol: AAGOORT A1 ORA +28 308
#note I would like 12A AGOROT here, if it weren't for all the A's unseen. This play was the type of play you make when you really don't have much of a plan to win the game other than scoring and keeping balanced leaves. In this case, there isn't much to do anyway but leave decently and hope to maintain your lead.
>Fern_Lindzon: EIOWZ 12A ZOWIE +56 294
#note AGOROT looks very good in hindsight!
>Joshua_Sokol: AAGOPST 13A APO +35 343
#note Quite the pull of an S here reduces my worrying to just a moderate level.
>Fern_Lindzon: AIKN 14B AKIN +36 330
#note Fern has been making very strong plays this game. No wonder she gained so much rating and got back up to 1700!
>Joshua_Sokol: AGHNNST 10D NAH +30 373
#note Getting HA(ZA)NS down would have been satisfying, but alas, I was supposed to see the awesome 8-letter word here, SHANT(U)NG. There is much for me to learn! If I am to roll the dice here, I can play 15D SANGH, but I the play I made is positionally better. I just need to draw a vowel or two.
>Fern_Lindzon: BCH J9 CH.B +19 349
>Joshua_Sokol: EGMNOST N2 MO.GS +45 418
#note Since the year 2013 I struggle to remember which is good between MOGG and MUGG. I guessed wrong again, and luckily once again my opponent did not pull the trigger. As with TIREFUL* there was a bizarre, eery silence that filled the gap between hitting the clock and drawing tiles, that should have been replaced with the word "hold". I was very greedy this game, and thus have not managed to mature much as a Scrabble player since I realized that I should not play a word I have any doubts about unless it is necessary. 
>Fern_Lindzon: ALOTX 15D TAXOL +44 393
#note I did, however, hold this for a few seconds, since I had not seen the word in a long time! I managed to come to my senses and released the play.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINPTV I11 .IVE +20 438
#note I could have gone with M1 NEV(I), which I did not consider, but this seemed like it was definitely the play that would win the most games. 
>Fern_Lindzon: ADDEV 14I .VADED +38 431
>Joshua_Sokol: AINPSTT 13K TAPIS +30 468
>Fern_Lindzon: OOR -  +0 431
#note Desperation challenge, as Fern was only so sure this was valid.
>Joshua_Sokol: NT 7A T.N +4 472
>Joshua_Sokol:  (OOR) +6 478
