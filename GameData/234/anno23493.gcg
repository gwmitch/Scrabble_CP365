#note liking MIRI more now... somehow tunneled MIRIN and MINI. MIRIN has better equity but I didn't like the position with it, I think it gives back too much easy stuff.

#note saw otaku but missed the spot at j7. I like OTAKU a lot as well cause she might put an S on it. Kayo does take away that annoying spot though, which I like.

#note missing RAGEE, BUTEO looks fine. Considered BOUGIE and TUBE for a little bit... after TUBE, there is 12 row mainly, as well as NOTICERS as a smaller lane. BOUGIE leaves 12 row completely as well as noticers and then 11 row. BOUGIE works well as a play with my leave, but not as much for board control. TUBE is better for starting to close the bottom right, especially if I can take care of the RAGE hooks easiliy next turn. I think BOUGIE, even though opening a lot short term, can be closed quite easily, so at least in the short term it works better if she does bingo. I usually play things like TUBE so I tried something different.
