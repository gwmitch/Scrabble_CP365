#note More Collins-related confusion here. I knew for sure that AGNISE# was Collins only, and I wasn't sure that AGNIZE worked in TWL. Given that it's a North American spelling (-IZE), I shouldn't have worried. Bad mistake.

#note I can for sure peg him with an S and probably a nice rack in general, so time to take that lane out!

#note Nice play.

#note This and 13G YO for 18 are virtually identical in a sim. My play makes the game unlikely to be decided by a bingo, while YO makes it all about who draws a bingo first. The pool looks too good though so I decide to take points.
>Chris_Williams: EGLLT B10 G.LLET +22 370
>Jesse_Matthews: FHLOOSV 14A S.V +6 373
#note Both of us are very low on time at this point. I have him properly tracked with GILNOOT, so I know that I have to block TOOTLING. I unfortunately get fixated on SEV because of it blocking the bingo. LEVS does that, plus it gives me HOOF in two spots next turn (15D or 13G). With just over a minute left on my clock I pat the bag twice and don't feel any more tiles, I put my hand in the bag once and don't feel any tiles, so I make my play.
>Chris_Williams: GILNOOT 13G NIL +8 378
#note I fail to look at Chris' rack the entire time I'm making my decisions and ultimately my play. He's only got six tiles and makes an optimal game-winning play based on only having six. However, his play loses if I notice that he's missing a tile.
>Jesse_Matthews: FHLOO 14H FOH +24 397
#note Wanting to unload my two high counters and down to 20 seconds, I make this play. I again pat the bag to make sure there's no tile in there, feel nothing, and hit the clock.
>Chris_Williams: GOT K10 GOT +21 399
#note And he makes a play to go out after checking the bag as well. It turns out that both of us had tracked correctly but neither of us were able to feel the tile (an O) that had wedged itself into the corner of a very low quality tile bag that we were using. If I had somehow felt it when I checked the bag after he played NIL, he would have had to put the tile on his rack and I would've won after FOH and then my next play. Very tough way to lose, but as it stands I might've lost anyway because I didn't see LEVS in a time crunch.
>Chris_Williams:  (LOO) +6 405
#note Final score is actually 403-397 due to the missing tile not being a factor in the final score.
