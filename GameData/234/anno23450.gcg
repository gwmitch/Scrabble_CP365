>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BDGNOO 8D DOGBONe +74 74
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BDGNOO --  -74 0
#note BONGO is my best valid play but I was feeling very bold after my game 10 victory against Will Scott. Of course this is phony.
>David_Brown: EEFM 8G FEME +18 18
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BDGNOO 7H BONG +19 19
#note I missed FOGBOUND here which i didn;t know. -17.2 and 8th best but not too bad of a missed bingo.
>David_Brown: ?BEEINO 9B EBONIEs +72 90
#note David should taken the other spot as it scored 3 more and would have caused me a lot of problems. I did have WOMANHOOD on the next turn if I could find it, but how likely is that?
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ADHNOW L6 cOWHAND +92 111
#note Best play! And only bingo! That's why the other EBONIES was better. One of my best finds of the tournament.
>David_Brown: GIJOY E5 JOYI.G +34 124
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACCDFNT 8L .AFT +30 141
#note FACED is best here but mine is bad. -3.9 and 4th best.
>David_Brown: INR 6D N.IR +6 130
>Jonathan_Lindh: CCDEENR B6 CRE.D +18 159
#note That's a horrible miss and one I didn't know until now! CREDENCE! I got the best of the non bingo plays. -60.6 and 4th best.
>David_Brown: EENRSTU 13F TENURES +73 203
#note Best play for David.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEELNP A10 ENLACE +30 189
#note I miss another bingo PENTACLE! Probably my worst game of the tourney. 5th best and -33.5
>David_Brown: EILRV 12C LIVER +20 223
>Jonathan_Lindh: AMOPQSU 10I AQU. +33 222
#note 2nd best play! Cover A7 with OP for 26 and then take AQUA next turn. -1.1
>David_Brown: AW A7 AW +32 255
#note Regretting not playing OP.
>Jonathan_Lindh: MOPSTTU M8 .M +17 239
#note 6th best play! COMPT is somehow best but opens a triple. I don't know what is best here. -3.7
>David_Brown: DIZ O6 DI.Z +14 269
>Jonathan_Lindh: OOPSTTU H12 S.OT +25 264
#note PUTTO may have been better at N2 in retrospect. With 2 S's out I was paranoid about this spot. 9th best and -9.2
>David_Brown: GHOS 14C GOSH +30 299
>Jonathan_Lindh: OPRRTUV 15C OP +17 281
#note This isn't good. 13A AVO may avoid exchanging. -13.1
>David_Brown: AI 11I AI +15 314
>Jonathan_Lindh: KRRTTUV -KRTUV +0 281
#note Best play!
>David_Brown: DEIOX N2 DOXIE +35 349
#note PUTTO looks good now!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIIKLR O1 LARI +30 311
#note Best play! I don't know I recorded my rack right on the kast turn.
>David_Brown: APU 5C PU.A +17 366
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIKSVY D8 K.A +26 337
#note Rack not recorded.
>David_Brown: RSTTTU 4B TUT +16 382
#note Best play for David.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EILVY 3A LEY +30 367
#note Best play for me!
>David_Brown: RST F9 .S +10 392
#note David misses LEYS at 3A for 11. He was overtime at this point and his clock showed -56 seconds. One fewer point for his play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IV J5 VI.. +9 376
#note Normally VINE would be best. However since David is at -56 seconds, I need to make him put down TOR in 3 seconds without going over. I do this by immediately playing VET after LEY. This was a mistake on my part.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (RT) +4 380
#note Final score recorded as 382-380 David's victory because he went over by 56 seconds. I had chances to win this game but it got away from me.
