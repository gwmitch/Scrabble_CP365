>Saloma: IIII -IIII +0 0
#note I don't know what tiles you had, so I just made up four to exchange.
>Jeff: DDJKMNU 8G JUNK +30 30
#note Actually, I wasn't kidding, I kind of did have junk.
>Saloma: ESTV K5 VETS +30 30
>Jeff: DDMNNOZ 6J Z.D +33 63
#note DOZ(E)N is better, especially with two Ns on my rack- I think I would've played it were I focused.
>Saloma: EFOSX M2 FOXES +44 74
>Jeff: DIIMNNO 3G DOMINI.N +66 129
>Saloma: CLP H1 CL.P +33 107
>Jeff: ?EEIOTW G8 .OW +14 143
#note Best play is 2F WI(L)E. I was hoping to draw into something and create another place to bingo.
>Saloma: ESY O1 YES +30 137
#note Interestingly, Quackle (the simming program) likes 2M (F)EY better- it scores 22, and I guess it thinks you should hang on to the S for a higher scoring play.
>Jeff: ?EEHIOT 2J HO +28 171
#note HE in the same spot is probably better, since I have 2 E's.
>Saloma: I 5K .I. +9 146
#note (F)I(E) is 7 more points.
>Jeff: ?DEEIOT F9 DOE +16 187
#note Missed gEODETI(C) and E(N)TOIlED (that's an L).
>Saloma: ADEEGNR 12D ENRAGED +77 223
#note Best bingo here is E7 GRANDEE with three overlaps. 
>Jeff: ?AEIRRT 5B TARRIEs +70 257
>Saloma: BGINOPS D4 P.OBING +26 249
#note Best play: 11I BOP for 21, leaves you GINS which is a great bingo building rack. Worth taking less points for.
>Jeff: EFHILLT B2 FIL.H +38 295
>Saloma: IQ A1 QI +38 287
>Jeff: EILORTY 8A YET. +21 316
#note Quackle suggests (P)OLY(P)I. Of course! How did I miss it?
>Saloma: ?ABESTT 11I BATTErS +73 360
>Jeff: ACILNOR O5 CARLIN. +27 343
#note Thought I was missing a bingo here, thankfully not. However, the best plays are ones that score more than I did and use less tiles, like 10I OCA. I think I even saw that one.
>Saloma: AEW 10J WAE +33 393
>Jeff: AIRU N10 U.ARI +16 359
#note Missed N1 AI(N).
>Saloma: AEV H12 .AVE +24 417
>Jeff: AEGLMOR 13G M.LE +31 390
#note Saw GOMERAL, which doesn't play, and didn't know GLOMERA (which also doesn't play)
>Saloma: AOTUU A8 .OU +6 423
#note Btw I like the 'out in two' move this sets up, not sure if you did it on purpose. 
>Jeff: AGOR 14J RAG +17 407
#note Didn't know ARGOL or GORAL which I could have gone out with.
>Saloma: ATU B10 TAU +9 432
>Saloma:  (O) +2 434
#note Scored as 28.
