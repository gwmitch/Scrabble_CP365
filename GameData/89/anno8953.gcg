#note This sims best. Dinky little fishes like this work well when two early bingos have swung the board wide open. I'm 78 percent to bingo next turn, which is pretty insane.

#note This sims slightly ahead of TIKIS, the static leader. Better defensively not to dangle the K above the DWS, I suppose.

#note The sim gives a higher win percentage to EAU 12J, scoring 14 and keeping GINO. I'm not sold about that one. A play like that seems to be putting all the eggs in the "bingo right away" basket, which I don't trust with only a so-so leave on this so-so board. Taking 28 points now was a surefire way back into the game. Couldn't pass that up.

>Evans_Clinchy: EEOOOTU 6I OUT.O.E +10 278
#note Probably my favorite play of the tournament. Wades through the crappy rack, scores a little bit, and opens a bingo line that can help me seize control of the game if I get lucky.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?EINORY 5C jOINERY +73 351
#note Like I said -- if I get lucky.

#note Sims best. I can block his AJEE setup with APEX, but his bingo chances are probably better in lines 13-14-15 anyway.
>Joey_Mallick: CEFGLRS 2J FE.L.. +20 330
>Evans_Clinchy: AACEEPW 1H WAE +23 410
#note This seemed like the natural choice -- block up top, balance the rack, leave a tile in the bag. But CAW 2F is interesting, setting up APE for 35. Since I have the case A, it's not likely to be blocked.
