>Kate_G: DEGY 8F EDGY +18 18
#note HEDGY, LEDGY, SEDGY, WEDGY are all good.
>Jeremy_J: ABCENRS 7H AB +20 20
#note Q likes this as best play. :)
>Kate_G: DIK 6F KID +23 41
>Jeremy_J: ACENRSS J1 RESCANS +68 88
#note Phoney #1 (ANCRESS/CASERNS). ANCRESS for 83 at 9C with quadruple overlap is pretty sweet.
>Kate_G: IORTV 4H VI.TOR +30 71
>Jeremy_J: EEFNRUV 1F FEVE. +33 121
#note Q picks this second to NE(R)VURE. Didn't know that one and not sure I would have played it even if I did.
>Kate_G: BMOO M3 B.OOM +24 95
>Jeremy_J: ANPRTUW L7 UNWRAP +28 149
#note Glad I didn't try UNWRAPT*! Q likes any W- word from N6. I guess even though that would only score a few more and open up a nice 3x line, it does block the cheapo monster X play.
>Kate_G: ?EEGINT 10H pETE.ING +62 157
#note Q finds the stylish bEIGNET for 77 at 2A for 15 more points.
>Jeremy_J: EEIILNT O7 TIN.LE +24 173
#note Q likes LI(G)NITE. Didn't know it.
>Kate_G: AAEQU 2B AQUAE +39 196
>Jeremy_J: AADEIOS 3B AI +28 201
#note Q picks this second to the "puzzle book" play of O(I)DIA at M9.
>Kate_G: ADF 11K F.D +27 223
>Jeremy_J: ADEOSSY 13L SAY +24 225
#note Missed another nice "puzzle book" play of SAYED for 54 at N2. Also I overscored this play by 1pt.
>Kate_G: JLOW 9C JOWL +24 247
>Jeremy_J: ADEENOS 11B ADENOSE +67 292
#note Phoney #2. ADENOID is good. EASED for 45 in the N2 slot would have been best real play.
>Kate_G: LOX 12B LOX +43 290
>Jeremy_J: GIILORZ 7C ZORI +31 323
#note Phoney #3 KIEL* made this play possible. I thought either KIEL* or KEIL* was good. Wasn't sure which one. Turns out neither. Only LIKE.
>Kate_G: INPT H10 ..PTIN +30 320
#note Phoney #4. You finally join my phoney party. PEPTID is good.
>Jeremy_J: CEGHIIU 15E ICI.G +8 331
#note Here's where I lost the game, but not for the reason I originally thought. I did miss the R(AI) hook that I set up, but my win wasn't to block that, it was just to score and outrun you. Something like GHI at 3E pretty much wins the game.
>Kate_G: ?AHRRT A3 RATHeR +30 350
>Jeremy_J: EEHLMUU B10 H..EM +36 367
#note Might as well pad my spread here. Also, this gives me a hail mary shot at winning if you challenge, it's magically in there, and I then get to outrun you.
>Kate_G: OT 14M TO +16 366
