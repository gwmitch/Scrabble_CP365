>Matt_Canik: ADEEHTW J5 WHA.ED +25 25
>Geoff_Thevenot: DEIRUVW K2 WIVE +30 56
#note Despite leaving the S/WIVE hook, definitely the best score and leave combo here.
>Matt_Canik: BEENOTU I2 BUTEO +19 44
#note Good play by Matt. Scores decently, cleans up a mediocre rack, makes the S/WIVE hook he doesn't have harder to use. Decisions like this are often crucial to a game.
>Geoff_Thevenot: DDRSUVY L5 RUDDY +19 75
#note RUDDY sims best. I like it better than DUDDY J10 because it leaves only 2 consonants instead of 3 and seems to lead to a more open board.
>Matt_Canik: EIIJNPR 8L .JIN +36 80
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEHPSTV 1K SHAVE +56 131
>Matt_Canik: EGIPRRS O4 SPRI.GER +62 142
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?GMPRTT H6 PR.G +15 146
#note Takes a few points, adds another S-ending line with a blank in hand.
>Matt_Canik: AEINOSU M8 .EU +17 159
#note MATT: Prefer this to (V)AU because it clogs up the N10 spot that he could hit for a lot. GEOFF: I agree with Matt, and so does Quackle - JEU sims best, 3 better than JOE or VAU. This is good board management.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?MNOTTT N10 TOM +14 160
#note When I got home and was going through this game, I saw this position and said, oh yeah, TOT N10...and then looked at my score sheet and saw that wasn't what I played. Whoops! Got too fast and careless, I guess. Not a terribly costly error, just a few points of equity, but in a close game like this those points can matter.
>Matt_Canik: AAINOOS G7 A.AN +22 181
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?BNOTTT F9 BOTT +18 178
>Matt_Canik: ?AIIOOS 12D IO.A +8 189
#note This suggested to me that Matt was keeping well, maybe with the other blank in hand.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?AENOTY 13G bAYONET +77 255
#note This is the highest-scoring bingo. Quackle likes ANOLYTE (blank L) in the same spot a smidge better, scoring two points less but providing better defense against row 14 plays (either bingos or horizontal plays from J14 to the double word square, or possibly an X play). I agree with Quackle, I think - not just because Matt happened to hit back hard with just such a bingo next turn. Though it is close.
>Matt_Canik: ?AFINOS 14B INSOFAr +87 276
#note Nice find by Matt. The two other sevens in that rack are FASHION and FANIONS. Quackle prefers playing FANOS for 51 at J14 and keeping the blank - a lot of replies I could have at H15 (forming ARC, ARF, ARK or ARM, say) would score well. Sure hard to turn down 87 juicy points, though.
>Geoff_Thevenot: AAIIIOQ 13B QI +37 292
#note Uh, wow...well, 37 points is 37 points. I can trade next time if necessary. (Quackle agrees that QI beats exchanging here by a lot.) Matt's very likely to score well at the 15H hotspot I can do nothing about, so I'll need those points.
>Matt_Canik: CDEEGRS 15H CREED +42 318
#note CERED edges out CREED by a little, I would guess because it avoids creating a hotspot for the K. (KENAF J14 coming back for 68 would leave a mark!) That's not terribly likely, though.
>Geoff_Thevenot: AAIILNO 14L NAOI +14 306
#note Quackle prefers ALOIN 14J 19. Making ELD instead of END would have been better, since it takes fewer front hooks. With the remaining pool very consonant heavy, there's no reason to worry about keeping a two-vowel leave here. I did like setting up IF in the corner should I draw the F, but what I really could use is the X for an H1 play; I have the last A. That again favors ALOIN, since it turns over an extra tile. This play may have lost me the game, though I was a significant underdog at this point already.
>Matt_Canik: EGORSTX 12L RE.S +40 358
#note MATT: This scores so well, and between the N1 and 11D spots for my X I think I don't have to worry about dumping it. Sims best by a good bit. GEOFF: I ran some longer sims and it wasn't as clear, but in any case, I think Matt's right to take the best spot on the board and 40 points.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ACFILLU 15N IF +32 338
#note There's IF. Quackle says I'm 17% to win here. In real life I don't think it's even that good; Matt will know what I have and if it's a bingo he can almost surely block it.
>Matt_Canik: EGKNOTX 11B KEX +23 381
>Geoff_Thevenot: ACELLMU H1 CAME +38 376
>Matt_Canik: GNOT F4 TONG +11 392
#note A well-earned win for Matt here. No major errors and barely any minor ones during the decisive portion of the game - that's a very high standard of play.
>Matt_Canik:  (LLU) +6 398
