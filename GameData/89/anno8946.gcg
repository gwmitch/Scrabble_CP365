>Evans_Clinchy: DENORTU -U +0 0
#note I'm pretty sure a short exchange is correct here... but I chose the wrong letter. DENRTU hits the high-probability tiles like A, E and I, where as DENORT doesn't. Trading the O looks best.

>Evans_Clinchy: ABEFMQS 10L FAB +21 82
#note I passed up FERBAM 5F to open a juicy S-hooking lane and make things a little more volatile. Sim says it's a four-point mistake. I'm OK with that.

#note This play is weird and Quackle hates it. I just really wanted to muck up bingo lines. I'm open to suggestions on this one.
>Marlon_Hill: AGP 13C GAP +21 203
>Evans_Clinchy: DEILOWY 14B YODEL +37 301
#note Not bad, but there are better options. I spent a while looking for a way to score with these tiles without opening anything dangerous. I missed a good one -- DOWDY 13J, which I probably would have played had I thought of it. Sim recommends DEWILY 14D, which I think is a little loco.
>Marlon_Hill: ACIMU 4D UMIAC +39 242
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EIRTTW 15A WET +27 328
#note I didn't even look through the U for airball bingos (there are two, OUTWRITE and WURTZITE). Figured it would be better to hold onto the blank for a little while and take out this spot. OUTWRITE sims best, for whatever that's worth.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?IIRRTU 15E dIRT +16 364
#note It's right to burn the blank now and block this lane, but I missed the best way to do so -- IRRUPT 15F, which leaves only one tile in the bag instead of three and denies him a chance to fish for the outbingo.
>Marlon_Hill: ?AEKN 3C sNEAK +45 358
>Evans_Clinchy: CEIPRUX 10B CURIE +23 387
#note This is where Marlon went nuts and accused me of being stupid and sticking myself with the P. False! I'm not stuck with it, because the P fits both underneath the U and above the I in CURIE. He can block both with NO, but if he keeps AIU, then my LOP 6J becomes unblockable. Nevertheless, CURIE is still wrong on my part -- CRIPE 10B is better because it leaves me XU in multiple spots to go out next turn. Missed it. Silly ending to the 11-game losing streak... but I'll certainly take it.
