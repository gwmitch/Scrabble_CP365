#note took this idea from the book. after the fishing and obvious leave i felt TRY would make it super tough for him to bingo and i can try to control the board after that. QADI will likely be available next turn. obviously i expect this to sim terribly, but i'm trying to start getting good at defense! :)

#note again the same idea, but i think i did it wrong. i would do toledo in a heartbeat normally, but i'm trying to prevent him from bingoing for as long as possible. i think there may be a better way, like 10C OLIO? (-10)

#note well now i have a bingo that doesn't play anywhere since i was trying to block up the board so much, and i'm in a terrible position all of a sudden. i ahve no idea what to play.
