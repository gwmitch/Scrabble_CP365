#note I wasn't 100% of CROUPY/CROUPIER because I know that mainly as a noun, but had to try it for 53 more points. TACHISM is just a hair better, perhaps because it gives less bingo possibilities on column B. Not sure.

#note No way am I going to play ROTO and keep this open, even though the leave is better. Sims 2nd best to that play.

>scott_jackson: EFOOSTZ 4K FEZ +35 226
#note HEFT rates way better, probably because my play takes out the S hook on JOULE (and I have the last S).

#note I really wanted him to take the other hotspot. Quackle likes 9I BABE more keeping ENX, maybe because there's not many big consonants that can hit at O12 (really only the M).

#note Missed APEAK/APEEK. Quite a bit better, though my winning chances are still pretty low. I have to hope to draw an N for NIX/XU afterwards.
