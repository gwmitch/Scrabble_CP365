>Evans_Clinchy: AORTUUZ -OUU +0 0
#note Apparently throwing back the Z also is 1-2 points better because of the bingo possibility. I didn't think ART was a strong enough leave to merit going for broke on bingoing. I liked having the Z to score with next turn.

>Evans_Clinchy: ADRRSTZ E5 RAZ.R +28 28
#note Ewww, not good. TZAR 9B is definitely better. DRS is a far stronger leave than DST.
>Jason_Keller: ABER F6 BA.ER +38 68
>Evans_Clinchy: ADIRRST D4 RAD +16 44
#note TRAD sims better, presumably because it doesn't hook. I figured a hook was a good thing -- I have a decently strong leave and I'm looking to bingo. I don't want to shut this board down.

>Evans_Clinchy: EIQRSST 11D QIS +32 76
#note It's interesting that QI 2B sims a little better than this. I guess with so many R's already gone, it's nice to set up a bingo line for mine.

#note Sim recommends EVE 2A, which looks stupid at first glance. Why stick an E in the triple lane when he'll obviously just take the spot himself? But then again, my play does nothing to ensure that bingo options stay open long-term, so with a 39-point deficit and a blank in hand, it might be wrong. I'm open to suggestions here.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?ABEGGP 1M .AP +23 227
#note Thought this was a little better than HAP 14D for three points extra, since it leaves that P open as a bingo line. I guess since PA takes a front S, HAP isn't so bad after all. My play sims 3-4 points back.
