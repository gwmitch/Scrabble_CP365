#note I love trading one to open and do it whenever it's anywhere close to correct. The MAINER# stem bingos with any of CDFGHKLOPRSTVW, or 49 of the 93 unseen tiles. That's good enough for me to take a shot. The sim thinks it's a close call -- MBIRA, BREAM, BARMIE and the exchange are all within 1-2 points of each other. What would you do?

#note AIMER 7I sims well, but it didn't feel right to me. I'm already playing from behind, so why muck up the board?

#note Sims even with YET 13I to unload an extra consonant. The board's not great, so I'll lean toward taking the points.

#note Sim likes dinking away the V with REV N12. My gut said the board wasn't quite bingo-friendly enough to justify that. In hindsight, I may have been wrong about this. Sim says I'm bingoing over 62 percent after REV. Not bad at all.

#note Just trying to score without giving anything back. I missed a couple better options here, most notably IDENTIC D6.

#note SHOD sims better than HOD. I figured with the case S and blank in hand, I could make a spread play by opening for a bingo here.
