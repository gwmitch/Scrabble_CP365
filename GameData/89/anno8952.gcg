#note 10G BRO/BROS (I don't like the latter a bit since it gives the nice E/Y hook)

#note Fortunately this didn't get blocked. I wasn't 100% sure, I thought I may have been confusing it with ALGIDITY but it's good. The two words basically mean the same thing (icy and cold respectively)

#note No place for LAZARET, but it has a playable alternate spelling of LAZARE(T)T(E)!
>opponent: DHIK M9 KH.DI +36 320
#note This did look odd but I didn't even hold it. It's no good - only KHADI.

#note LUX in the same spot looks like suicide, but it's actually not bad since I have the other U and there's only two I's out. The only big threat against it is MI. 
>opponent: ?AEFNOR 1H .iNAFORE +98 418
>scott_jackson: EGLMRUX 2N EX +31 378
#note LUX(E) preferred by a wide margin, perhaps because there's a good chance of drawing IN to the EGMR leave.

#note Quackle likes L(O)G, I'm not sure how it's 15% better when it's 12 points less. Both plays leave one in the bag, the only difference is keeping the M instead of the L. 
>opponent: EINNNQV N8 QI +17 456
#note pretty unlucky, since I either have at least one bingo with a blank or TORULAS/PLOWS.
