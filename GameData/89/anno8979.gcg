#note Debated keeping the T. I thought it would be close, but DIP is simming way higher.

>Tunnicliffe: ACENSTV 12K STAVE +31 118
#note Did not consider VAC, which leaves Adam with nothing. It's definitely the best play. STAVE is supposedly second, but I totally forgot VESTA. I dunno if it's hindsight speaking, but VESTA feels better than STAVE. VESTA kills the board better than VAC does.

#note In between talking myself out of GLYCON* and GLYCEN* (AGLYCON and GLYCIN), I was trying to decide if CLOY was good enough. Then I realised that CLONES was a pretty solid fish. I'm happy to see this sim pretty well, because it felt so wrong and it felt like the turning point in the game. Maybe that's just hindsight speaking again. CLOY sims less than a point better.

>Tunnicliffe: CEGLNOS M11 ..G +8 131
#note These plays felt so wrong. It's going to be so easy for Adam to kill the board. So what am I expecting to hit here? TAG actually sims second best behind GONOF, but I think it was a moronic mistake. That said, I have no idea what's right. GONOF at least gets some points and opens up a new quadrant.

#note Considered CORNELLS*, but I don't know ENSCROLL. There's the game.
