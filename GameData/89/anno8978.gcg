>Mike: FLRSTVW -FLVW +0 0
#note Gotta love these opening racks with no legal plays on the board.
>Chris: ADEINOS -O +0 0
#note Seems pretty standard; Chris will hit a bingo well over 50% of the time.
>Mike: EOPRSTW 8B POWTERS +82 82
#note Or at 8D, sacrificing the two points for defensive purposes. Maybe I should after an exch-1, but it doesn't appear to make too much difference.
>Chris: ?ADEINS E4 SEDA.INg +82 82
#note Nice draw. :) Take your pick of 82-pointers.
>Mike: AGMORUY D1 YUGA +28 110
#note Or GUY at either 7A or D3. I don't think the Y is too dangerous, though.
>Chris: ILOOOSU 1A OIL. +21 103
#note It's this or exchange, and this seems pretty clear.
>Mike: ILMORUX 9A MIX +41 151
>Chris: INOORSU 10B NOU. +23 126
#note We're not exactly sure this was Chris' rack (he wasn't recording them as the game was played, but we tried to reconstruct them afterwards). If it was, then he missed ROSINOUS H1.
>Mike: BELORTU H1 TROUBLE. +83 234
>Chris: DEIMORS 7H .MEROIDS +65 191
#note MOIDORES 3G is the star play here.
>Mike: AEHIOTW O4 WHO.E +45 279
>Chris: AAEINTZ K5 AT.AZINE +118 309
#note Of course, if Chris plays MOIDORES and I block the R, this doesn't go anywhere. (Misscored as 122.)
>Mike: ACILRTY 12H LIT.RACY +86 365
#note Whee! I think it was right around here we both realized something special might be afoot.
>Chris: AEHILNU J10 HU. +29 338
>Mike: ADEEEFI N10 FA.ED +38 403
#note The leave's ugly, but I need to keep scoing points.
>Chris: AEGILNP 8J L.P +17 355
#note Ouch--GRAPLINE 2G would have made things very interesting. (Not that they weren't anyway, mind you...)
>Mike: EEFIIKO J2 KIEF +26 429
#note My one bad mistake of the game; FOLKIE H10 is pretty clearly best. I just didn't see it; I was more focused on shutting down the lanes at the top.
>Chris: ?AAEGIN 13B ANErGIA +68 423
>Mike: AEEIOQS 6B QAI. +34 463
>Chris: BGNTTVV 3G V.T.NG +15 438
>Mike: DEEORRS 2B DO.R +18 481
#note Anything reasonable should win the game at this point; simulation favors SERE 13K, but I don't see a good way Chris can block it, so I prefer to save it for later.
>Chris: BCEJNTV B12 J.B +24 462
>Mike: EEORS 13K SER. +32 513
>Chris: CENTV H11 C..VE +30 492
>Mike: EO C12 O.E +16 529
#note Perfect endgame on both sides. What a game! (Final score recorded as 533-496.)
>Mike:  (NT) +4 533
