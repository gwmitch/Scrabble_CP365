>Evans_Clinchy: GILOOST 8F OLOGIST +68 68
#note Hemmed and hawed about which placement would minimize high-scoring counterplays; happy to see this one sim best. By the way: Is there a more entertaining opening rack than OLOGIST? Will and I would both spend the rest of the game brainstorming possible extensions. There are 43 five-letter ones out there, plus 23 more in Collins. Crazy.
>Will_Anderson: ELMOPST J3 POLEM.ST +66 66
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEEGTU 5J .UGE +10 78
#note Sims second behind DEGAME 7F, which I missed. I liked this play for maximizing my shot at bingoing next turn.
>Will_Anderson: DORWY N2 WORDY +47 113
>Evans_Clinchy: AADEEIT O6 AIDE +20 98
#note Sims best. AMIE 7I keeps a nice leave, but it's worth taking out line O here.

>Will_Anderson: DEGINRY N9 DYEING +41 235
>Evans_Clinchy: ACIINWX H1 NIX +41 204
#note I missed WAX! I guess I tunneled in on un-doubling I's, which is something I do far too often.
>Will_Anderson: KRSU 15L RUSK +39 274
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ACCITW 13I WICCA. +34 238
#note CAW M1 is a little better. Bingo chances are significantly higher than after WICCAN.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?DHINNO 12C NOH +25 346
#note This is fine statically, but I've got to get more creative if I want to open something up and make a comeback. The sim suggests DINO 12A, which at least gives me a slight chance at a high-scoring bingo down the road.
>Will_Anderson: AP B14 PA +32 446
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ADINOZ 15A Z. +33 379
#note This sims best. Extending OLOGIST to ZOOLOGIST looks like a really cool idea at first, but there would actually be zero possible bingos in the pool through that Z.
>Will_Anderson: Q H10 Q. +11 457
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AADINO D10 A.. +5 384
#note Trying to hit a bingo that plays in both spots -- ORDINAL, NODICAL, DIPNOAN, etc.
>Will_Anderson: EFILNRV C7 VIRL +14 471
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ADINOO 8A qA.D +18 402
#note Lazy. Best is the awesome RADON E5.
