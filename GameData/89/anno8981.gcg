#note Figured 11 points was worth it. I wanted to nerf the AJAR hook a little bit, too. The sim is preferring exch EEUU.

#note It's not a bad fish, but it's really counting on Patrick to open a spot once I draw my bingo tiles. Should just take points with UREA.

#note I really didn't want to play TAWIE here. Maybe because I'd just gotten burned setting up my opponent twice in a row. After TAWIE, there isn't much else. TWA seemed okay, but the leave... the top-simming play is actually exch IW.

#note Realised this was phony and that I was thinking of BARRETTE, but it felt like a good time to try something. He's still going to have a healthy lead and potentially a big play if he has an A, so he might not feel compelled to challenge. Really, I didn't need to get desperate, yet. I have BETTER and that's enough to stay within striking distance with plenty of tiles left in the bag.

#note Quackle is suggesting insane stuff like 1D IONONE or EONIAN. Yeah, I need a couple bingo lines open to win this game. I have to hope he takes no points to block one, and I hit the other. I don't like ditching the E, but I can't see anything else which works. Am I desperate enough for OAR? Fishing off one O isn't going to hit often enough. Shrug.
