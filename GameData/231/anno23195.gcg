>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?CDENSU 8H iNDUCES +74 74
#note Calgary, March 19-20. I managed to win enough games to secure second place, despite some legendarily bad decisions and ill-timed guesses. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDFHIO 7M FOB +23 23
#note Sets up HA next turn.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?DIOSSX H4 OXID.SeS +65 139
#note LOL I actually held this for a couple minutes because I was pronouncing it as OXI-DEEZES. Don't ask. I feel asleep for like 45 minutes the entire night before the tournament.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEHIR 10A BEARHID. +67 90
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEHIR --  -67 23
#note He just played 3 esses, 2 blanks, and the X in two turns. It's time to make up words! I also considered *BRASHED. AIRSHED is the 2x2! But HA might be better because it still scores and gives me a chance to bingo to one of the open esses.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ORWY L8 .OWRY +26 165
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEHIR 6N HA +31 54
#note I also considered BRASHIER here, but it was only a guess and I didn't want to score 0 again.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EEILTU 5E ULE.ITE +56 221
#note This game is so over.
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEGIQR E4 Q.ID +14 68
#note This was one of the most painful turns of the tournament. I didn't want to play either of the QI(S) in the interest of keeping that area open. QUID only scores 14, and there's like a 90% chance that he's going to play EQUID and score a ton of points. But I didn't want to keep just BRG, and I kind of need a dangerous board if I want any chance to make it close. The sim is favouring Exch. GQ here, actually, but we're talking 1.16% to win instead of 0.76%. 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DEIOUV 11B DEVIOU. +22 243
>Matthew_Larocque: BEGGLOR 9A BOGGLER. +65 133
#note I should have just played BLOGGERS which I didn't think of, because there's a chance BOGGLERS isn't good. I honestly just played BOGGLERS without a second thought because I didn't think it would get challenged. Luckily it is good, but Juraj accepted.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIV A7 VI.E +27 270
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAMNRZ 9K M.Z +53 186
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAMNRZ --  -53 133
#note I don't know why I keep thinking this is a new three. I must have seen it in CSW games and it lingered in my head.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CIN 4B CIN. +30 300
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAMNRZ K11 AMA +21 154
#note Missed ZAMIA in two spots, even though I looked at 6B. For some reason I don't even know the word NIZAM. I do know ZIRAM, but I missed that too? I chose not to play AZAN for some reason? I'm not sure why I think I'm going to get a better Z play if I wait.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AU D11 .AU +12 312
>Matthew_Larocque: AINNORZ B1 ZIN. +30 184
#note Maybe I get to play A(Z)ON next turn. ZINCO is good now. Haha, sim likes B9 (O)R(D)AIN to potentially set up a destructive Z play. I can't imagine that actually works, though.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AELNRST 14D SALTERN +68 380
#note I'm going to spend the rest of the tournament trying to get my spread back to 0, aren't I?
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOORT 1A O.ONATER +212 396
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOORT --  -212 184
#note I know this isn't a word, but there's a 0.1% chance it's a new word, and it's 212 points in that case.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AFIW 15E WAIF +54 434
#note THE PAIN MAKE IT STOP
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOORT 1A O.ONATE +51 235
#note No dees or esses left that I can hope to acquire to help me reach 300 points.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: JT G4 J.T +21 455
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHIRR M7 ..H +22 257
#note I barely tracked for this entire tournament, I certainly felt out of my groove. But I did note a tiny chance to draw RANGIER up top. Plus, prolonging the game should allow me to score a tad more right?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AKPR 4K PARK +24 479
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGIMRR 13C M.RA +21 278
#note I was really out of time here, but I forgot about ARMIGER. I haven't seen it in ages.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EELOPTT 3I ELOPE +29 508
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGINRY 2H EYEN +24 302
#note I wanted to play PARKY so bad, but I thought there was no way it would actually be valid. GREY is 54 :(
>Juraj_Pivovarov: TT 11J T..T +4 512
>Juraj_Pivovarov:  (GIR) +8 520
#note -10 for overtime. I felt pretty helpless this game, but I also lost THREE turns in one game. Let's hope it doesn't become a trend.
