>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGGNS H6 SNAGGED +74 74
>Michael: ER I7 ER +8 8
>Joshua_Sokol: IIOOTUU -IOOUU +0 74
#note Normally I exchange everything here, but there was no I or T on the board to play through, so it seemed stronger than average to keep IT.

Sim inexplicably prefers just the T
>Michael: ELM G11 MEL +13 21
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGIMRT F10 MEG +22 96
#note Bad, bad miss of IM(ME)RGE. I definitely knew that I played this turn too quickly. I also meant to play GEM for one less, just to make the 2x2 far less accessible, as well as overlaps. This is a really bad play.
>Michael: AIOT G6 IOTA +19 40
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIKLRT F4 ILK +34 130
#note I continue my horrible play streak with my not knowing KIRTLES or KIRTLED well enough to see them on my rack. I also, surprisingly, still didn't know SEME, even though I have studied SEMEE+!!! Very unnerving! I couldn't manage to find a bingo I liked so I just waited for Michael to make a move, knowing that I was making a mistake.
>Michael: RUU 10H .URU +7 47
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ERRRST L4 TERRoRS +68 198
#note This looks about right, though. I don't want to play at 14A
>Michael: T 5L .T +2 49
#note Looks like I am not the only one making mistakes, at least.
>Joshua_Sokol: DIINRUW E9 WUD +32 230
>Michael: ILT K3 LIT +14 63
#note This was a mistake by Michael, as you will see, since he thinks (TET)E* is a word.
>Joshua_Sokol: BHIINRY 3D INBY +23 253
#note I missed the cool play of 6D RI(KIS)HI here! That might be better than this, but I like where INBY is going. He might doubt INBYE.
>Michael: AZ 2J ZA +35 98
>Joshua_Sokol: BHIIOQR 2D QI +24 277
>Michael: AEJP 1E JAPE +49 147
>Joshua_Sokol: BDHINOR D8 HOB +24 301
>Michael: DINOW C5 INDOW +33 180
>Joshua_Sokol: DINNORY 2J ..IDY +36 337
#note Held and released, since it gave him easy points. Not liking getting outscored here, it's been 4 plays that I really misread Michael's range. (ZA)YIN is far safer here.
>Michael: AEPT 1L PEAT +42 222
>Joshua_Sokol: AAENNOR B5 AEON +21 358
>Michael: CIILOST 14A SOLICIT +78 300
#note Perhaps COLITIS instead, since it doesn't give back as much, but I think Michael just needs to pray here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACENORV A12 VA.E +33 391
#note Chose over COVER since I have the case R and I don't want Michael to be able to score and threaten a bingo.
>Michael: AFH C12 HA.F +20 320
#note whew, FASH would have been bad
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEFNOR F14 .F +5 396
#note I should play (I)N since I score better with the F, making up for the 3 immediate point sacrifice. Or I should not worry about that spot and play 8K O(o)F. What would you do?
>Michael: EO 7L .OE +4 324
>Joshua_Sokol: ACENORU A1 CANER +27 423
#note He almost had SONOVOX!
>Michael: ?ENOSVX N4 VEX.S +35 359
>Michael: ?ENOSVX --  -35 324
#note Wow, E1 (JIN)XES!!!!
>Joshua_Sokol: OU J8 OU. +7 430
