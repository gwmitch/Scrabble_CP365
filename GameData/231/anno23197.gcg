>Emil_Rem: DGNO 7H DONG +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: AELRRSU L7 SURREAL +73 99
#note I was happy I saw this, but I missed the 86 point REGULARS!
>Emil_Rem: ABO 6H ABO +27 47
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AGNOSW 11G WAGON.rS +72 171
#note Shockingly, this is the ONLY bingo. I seriously wasted a crapload of time looking for other possible plays including a 2x2. However, I can play the same word up one spot playing through the R. That placement has better defense. 
>Emil_Rem: AFH 10H FAH +38 85
>Matthew_Larocque: DEFORTW N7 FROW.TED +96 267
#note I know FROWST, but what happens if I play FROWSTED?
>Emil_Rem: AMP -  +0 85
#note YES
>Matthew_Larocque: EELMNNY 12G EYEN +39 306
#note Not too worried about the triple word scores, this is way too good of a play to pass up. Although I guess you can argue YEN for 33, but WE doesn't take R or S hooks so it's alright.
>Emil_Rem: AMP O13 MAP +28 113
>Matthew_Larocque: CEILMNU O8 EM +22 328
#note Now I just want to play annoying defense and make it hard on Emil. Plus the C is handy to defend other areas.
>Emil_Rem: IQS 14J QIS +40 153
>Matthew_Larocque: CIILNUU 15G UNCI +29 357
#note Well, I could not challenge with confidence, and UNCI for 29 is a trillion times better than any other play. Unless I really want to keep the C and play UNI.
>Emil_Rem: AEINRTV 13A AIRVENT +79 232
>Emil_Rem: AEINRTV --  -79 153
#note He might as well exchange V, I may not know a lot of words, but I do know RETINA bingos :/
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIILNU 14G NU +6 363
#note I think this is logical.
>Emil_Rem: AEINRTV 5J INVERT +21 174
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIILRS 4J LI +8 371
#note I might actually bingo on this junkyard of a board!
>Emil_Rem: ALOT 3K ALTO +11 185
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIRSTY N2 Y. +10 381
#note Let's try one more fish....
>Emil_Rem: ?AGIIKP 2E PAIKInG +70 255
#note I did not expect this. I held for a good while, but decide I should just bingo for 81 and not try anything silly like challenge and lose my turn.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIORST 3A STEROID +81 462
#note Actually, should I take less points here to avoid opening the TWS? 9 points is a pretty big drop, if there were blanks left I might be more worried.
>Emil_Rem: BTU A3 .TUB +7 262
#note Not BUST?
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEEHIJ B1 JE.E +24 486
>Emil_Rem: AZ O1 ZA +38 300
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHIIOT 1B .OE +11 497
#note Bad play etc. I wasn't tracking so I was like better make sure he doesn't have AJI.
>Emil_Rem: ACDELR D3 .ACED +16 316
