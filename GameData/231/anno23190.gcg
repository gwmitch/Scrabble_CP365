#note yagh i spent so long on this move! i was convinced that PAVINED was good but i couldn't pull the trigger. i know SPAVINED. I didn't consider KAVA because of her last move, but VENA 10E is probably ok. -5.5

#note surely HOUSY isn't a word and i knew HOUSIER got added so this has to be good, right? it was just so much better than LOUGH or YOGHS that i had to go for it.

#note the careful reader will note that i went up to the challenge computer with confidence, as this word was played on me at NASC2015 and I failed to challenge, in a losing effort. not challenging a phony at nationals is equivalent to losing 30 games in a row at a regular tournament.
