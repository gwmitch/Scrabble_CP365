#note Not so good. My thinking was I'd be fine in this game as long as I blocked up rows 13-14 for bingos and scored/balanced a little bit. Unfortunately I missed some far better ways to do so - the star play here is BUSHIE/FRITH for 39, giving me a 50-point lead on a dying board that should keep me safe. Instead, this doesn't score enough and doesn't close enough.

#note Yeah, not protecting against plays like that is a massive fail on my part.
>Evans_Clinchy: EGHINSS B9 .H +26 425
#note Many-ply sim and CP preendgame solver both like this best. It puts me within 1 point, threatens a bingo and also complicates the preendgame significantly for him. A lot of ways to pull this game out from here.

#note This is Allan's actual rack, which means 2 of the 4 remaining tiles in the bag when I fished were O's! Bummer that I couldn't hit COGNISES for the win here.
>Evans_Clinchy: DEGINSS 11D SDEIGN +29 454
#note I'm superlow on time at this point so I had no way of figuring out that racing to the outplay wouldn't work. Down by too much. Quackle says I have no choice but to dink away a D or S and fish for COGNISED/COGNISES.
