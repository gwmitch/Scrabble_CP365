>Jeremy_Hildebrand: HIORU 8D HOURI +24 24
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIKNRTV 7H KIVA +18 18
#note 9C VAIN looks a little better. A little too keen to unload the K.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: BEOTU 8K BUTEO +28 52
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADJNRTW E7 J.WAR +30 48
#note Also considered 7c JAW. But it didn't seem like the board I wanted with a DNRT leave.

>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AGIIPV 9I PIA +23 75
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CENOSTY 12C COSY +34 147
#note Somehow COYEST didn't occur to me. That's a silly miss. It's not hugely better than COSY... except with knowledge of VIG on his rack, it sure looks good. I also considered F6 YOU.

#note Actual rack.

>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AAX 13J .AXA +39 248
#note Now I'm pretty sure he had the second blank last turn. Though it's not guaranteed.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEGLNSU 11K AG +28 280
#note I might normally play LANGUE here, since LUNES is not the kind of leave I want on this board. But it really seems likely he has the blank. And with IIIIINNN unseen, I can't afford to stick that G out there. I just have to hope I get some scoring tiles for a HOLDS play, or he opens a bingo lane I can hit.

>Jeremy_Hildebrand: IQ 9B QI +15 279
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AABERRT 4C ERRATA +17 357
#note This makes it reeaallly hard to bingo. I just need to be prepared for a setup now.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: GO 3B GO +10 289
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BCDINNU B6 CIN. +21 378
#note I was fairly sure he had no bingos, but I blocked anyways in case I mistracked. Plus this blocks a lot of his best nonbingo plays.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?EFIIPR O1 RE.F +33 322
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BDNU 5H BUND +19 397
#note Umm... oops. I guess I forgot to draw the last tile in the bag after CINQ. I should have an M on my rack. Game ended here.
