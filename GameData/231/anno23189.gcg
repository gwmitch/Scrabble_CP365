>cesar: AAINOPR 8D PIANO +20 20
#note debated for a bit and thought PIANO would be better than APORIA. quackle suggests i actually score a bit more after APORIA, even though bingo average is a bit higher after PIANO. kind of counter-intuitive. -0.3
>rachel: EFU 9E FEU +17 17
#note she played this really quickly
>cesar: AEKLRRY E7 R..ELY +24 44
#note i missed RARIFY. i did see RIFLERY, but I wasn't 100% on it and I thought RIFELY would be better anyway. they all sim pretty close but RARIFY gets about a 0.1 pt edge on RIFELY. it's pretty close. I thought she'd bingo because of the speed of FEU and an L is harder to bingo through...

#note i had a feeling this was phony but thought i didn't really have anything better. I considered KNAVE but not with 4 Ss unseen, even though I need the volatility now.

#note this is a mistake. I need to take the JEHADI spot for ~40 and score next turn with the X. my chances of winning are not actually that bad here. unfortunately, i forgot about JEHADI. -4

#note obviously i need to block here. however, i didn't see her actual bingo, and even if i do, i probably have to hope she misses it.

>cesar: ADGIRTT -  +0 309
#note i was reasonably sure that was good, as it looked familiar, but i feel like i have no winning shot if it's good so boo me.
