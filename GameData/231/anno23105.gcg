#note things are not looking good! there are two blanks and esses left so nigel could murder me on column N, but I thought I had to fish.

#note phew...except that I missed CHINESE which would've been massively better on defense! hugely costly miss, about 9 points worse on sim

#note ALERTEST is a pretty special play here at A8 - the EELRT leave isn't doing much on this closed board, and it hunts for the blank while also keeping the Z, the best scoring tile left in the game. big miss!

#note Nigel had just taken a really long time on his last play, which I took as an attempt on his part to hunt the blank out. I almost missed PRAELECT, my only bingo on this turn, and went for it right away when I spotted it. At the end of the day I think I have to go for it - his bingo percentage is only about 8% and his rack is presuambly very close to random. Even giving him the best possible leave of ES he only bingos 15% of the time - so this is definitely a worthy try. PRAELECT is also nice because it usually requires him to bingo with a word ending in a vowel.

#note unfortunately for me, I drew my next bingo but so did he! close but no cigar. plays like CHINESE and ALERTEST would've greatly helped my cause.
