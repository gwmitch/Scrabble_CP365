#note Her last play called for this, it would seem. But she still has a couple of lanes, so perhaps I should go for raw equity with G8 M(E)D. Doesn't seem like the right style to adopt though. I also considered 8A MELT, but that didn't make position sense. I am opening up a lane and a bit, and my S isn't extremely strong here, despite going very nicely with my DN, since I shouldn't be racing for a bingo here more than I should be scoring. This was an interesting position though.

#note I missed L7 A(B)ANDON. It seemed like she was close to something by a few tells I have learned about, but this doesn't really do much to stop that. I kept on forgetting about that lane at 10I. This was bad. Quite bad. And I burned a lot of time too

#note Another misled play perhaps, but this time it's OK, as there aren't any fantastic options. C1 UREA springs to mind as the play I should have made. Missed it.

#note I can't do anything right! I was worried S(NIFTY)* was a threat, but I have learned that to be phony multiple times. Now I should remember.

#note Should definitely not be setting up a scoring spot here if I can help it, and I think I can. 2J O(V)A or A(V)O are fine
