#note AUREOLE and COULEE are way too risky. Played this instead of WEEL for one more to take out the B10 hotspot. Quackle insists that I play AUREOLE on a sim, but I'm fine with my play.

#note I didn't love making this play since I wanted more turnovers for the scoring tiles and the case S, but it scores well and I can't afford to let Lloyd have something like OF for fifty points. Quackle agrees convincingly.
>Lloyd: OX 8M .OX +33 327
>Mack: AELPRTT 2A PRE. +32 340
#note Quackle likes just REZ, but it seems too easy for either Lloyd to play at 1A with a hook fo ER or for me to get a consonant overload next turn.

>Mack: AFKLTTV K9 F.LK +22 362
#note Killer draw here, everything sucks. I considered this, KIVA, 11K FLAT/FLAK, and VITTA, but the other options seemed to give too much back to Lloyd. Nobody was able to find a significantly better option here in the postgame analysis at the tournament, so as ugly as it looks, FILK is probably alright.
>Lloyd: DEIOSTY 1B OY +13 348
#note Lloyd's actual rack. Great play by him here, setting up the S at A1 while leaving himself a good chance to draw a bingo in various locations and also keeping one in the bag.
>Mack: AFHITTV 12K .HAF +28 390
#note Nothing seems to win here unless I draw the S, which Lloyd obviously has at this point. Quackle is suggesting G11 VAT, setting up HEFT with an E draw, but if I get an E, Lloyd can just play H12 DEIL first keeping SPIT for a huge score to go out.

#note Great game to end the tournament. Congrats Lloyd, definitely a well-deserved victory!
