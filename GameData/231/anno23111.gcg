#note I thought it was obvious that I needed to block HIDEOUT and OUT(WITTED), but Quackle suggests something devious - VINO D2. You let him take OUTWITTED but leave yourself a spot to score 40+ with the Q. Interesting. I didn't think of it. Went the straightforward route instead.

#note Ah, GENIE to set up QI for 34 next turn. Definitely best. Didn't see it.
>Andrew_Fisher: DEEINT 1A DETEN. +24 105
>Evans_Clinchy: EGIOQRT -GOQ +0 160
#note Or GOITER, but I'm getting sick and tired of this Q nonsense.
>Andrew_Fisher: IKU 5I .UIK +20 125
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIRTVZ L3 ZE. +32 192
#note ZERK is a little better defensively. There's also five R's in the bag, so I have a shot at drawing VEZIR for 50.

>Evans_Clinchy: EFIRTVW K4 W.VER +17 209
#note I thought this might minimize his bingo chances, which is only a little bit true. Quackle pegs him at 18.9 percent, versus 20-23ish after my other plays. Meh. Probably the better option is the more straightforward FIT 2B for the score and leave. (There's also IF F5 for 31, but keeping ERTVW is just too gross.)

>Evans_Clinchy: AFIJNNT 11I JAN. +22 231
#note I knew Quackle would like FANJET, but I hate it. With a small lead and all the S's still unseen, why open a big S hook? The board is pretty closed right now, and JANE keeps it that way. I guess the upside to FANJET is that even if he bingos in that line, it's likely to give me back a solid score on the TWS. I still don't know though. JANE is reasonable IMO.

>Evans_Clinchy: FILNORT 10J FO.L +30 261
#note OK, that backfired. Now it's to my benefit to pry the new line open. Heh.

#note Obviously there are plays making ADDINGS that are stronger, but I wasn't sure of it and had no reason to take the risk. This seems plenty safe.
>Andrew_Fisher: CGLOS N6 CLOGS +26 355
>Evans_Clinchy: FHLRSTU 14I SH +39 406
#note Same as before, unsure of ADDINGS. Of course TUSH/RUSH/LUSH is best.
