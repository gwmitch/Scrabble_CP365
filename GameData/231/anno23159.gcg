>Joel: EOPRTX 8C EXPORT +46 46
>Mack: EHMNRSU 8A RE...... +51 51
#note Wasn't sure of HUMPERS, but this is better anyway to keep the S and prevent Joel from doing this himself.
>Joel: ACENOS I3 CANOES +30 76
>Mack: HMNRSTU J6 HM +32 83
>Joel: AHLU 7C HAUL +35 111

>Mack: ?AINRTT A1 NITRATo. +74 185
#note Looked for nines here, but the only one is TRIATh(LO)N, which I actually saw but clearly stinks.
>Joel: AGZ 2J ZAG +46 181
>Mack: EEIIPST D3 EPIT..IES +86 271
#note Was about to play L1 EGIS then realized I had a better play...
>Joel: DFJL 10B FJ.LD +28 209
>Mack: ADINNRR E1 RANID +24 295
>Joel: CDEI 1D C.IED +33 242
>Mack: EINORUY 11C O.IER +26 321
#note Definitely not playing JUNIOR, and eschewed JOEY since I wanted to keep the Y for scoring . JURY is another option I didn't consider, but OSIER is fine.
>Joel: AT 3K .AT +28 270
>Mack: EGNNTUY C10 ..EY +28 349
#note Still haven't quite absorbed the fact that TENNY got added to the dictionary. That word at 3C is slightly better to unduplicate the Ns.
>Joel: AELO 1L ALOE +21 291
>Mack: GNNRTUV -GNNTUV +0 349
#note No reason to try to play through here, when I can barely score anyway. Much better to clean up the rack and go for the blank.
>Joel: ELOV 12F LEVO +17 308
>Mack: BBFIORW 2E .FRO +33 382
#note I can't really block the new lane Joel created effectively, and I don't mind keeping scoring potential with BBIW for comeback plays if Joel bingos or blows the board open further.
>Joel: EIV H12 .IVE +30 338

#note Lucky draw of S? here
