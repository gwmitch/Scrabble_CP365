#note I thought of GAUN, but the Z setup didn't feel like it was worth it.

#note It seems like I had the stupid idea that I wasn't going to use the Z unless I scored 30+ with it. NOT/TON and OUZO seem fine.

#note I waffled over whether to bingo or not here for several minutes, but in retrospect I have no idea what I was thinking. It seems so obvious now that I should not bingo. I even drew the D! It's sad that I was able to formulate a decent plan to steal a win in this game, only to abandon it on the next turn. CP's pick of ERRS is nice since it makes blocking a little tougher.
