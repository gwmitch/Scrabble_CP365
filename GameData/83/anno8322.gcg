#note I had no idea what to do here. The board is really great for having a leave, as there's little in terms of solid bingo lines. I didn't see BRUTAL/AWAIT, though I did see TABUN/AWAIT. I didn't really want to give a nice hotspot with the latter play. BLUNT and BRUTAL are favored on the K column, though my play is only one percent behind.

#note EPIC FAIL!!!!

I first though of HUMERIC*, but that looked off. Then I thought of RHEUMIC, but that looked kind of strange too. In the end I couldn't decide if both, neither, or just one was valid. If I play RHEUMIC this becomes much easier, and it blocks my opponent's bingo in the same spot. I mean it's almost impossible for me to lose this game either way, but still a terrible miss for me.

#note I wanted to open a second bingo lane just in case my opponent draws a playable bingo on the fourth row. Quackle wants me to just play BIZE.

#note Fortunately that stayed open. Some pretty crazy bingos in this game (both played and not).
