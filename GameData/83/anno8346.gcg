#note I saw TENURIAL 2x2, but I thought the play to the triple was only a point less, which could probably justify not opening the nice F10 hotspot. Then I realized it was only 74 and was apparently just too lazy not to change my move. I'm THAT GOOD.

#note JUROR, whoops. This is about five % behind. The great plays just keep on coming.

#note Saw GINZO but missed the best spot for it. Also better because it doesn't take the -S hook (only -ES). Not a big difference from my play though.
