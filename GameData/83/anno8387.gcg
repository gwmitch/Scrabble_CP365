#note already a star play miss. i looked for a bit and didn't see envoy. i wouldn't call this a word knowledge miss but just general lack of practice with finding lots of words in a rack. the best way to practice this is probably to write a program to generate random racks and try to find as many words as possible.

#note the two moves i was trying to choose between were UPHILL and POILU. 10E HOLDUP is another alternative. G13 HUP is what i wanted to play before ZIBET. overall, the 4 moves sim closely, but holdup edges everything out. UPHILL may be too volatile even though it tries to kill the Z spot. (-1)

#note very bad move. i don't understand how i could possibly miss the glaring X spot at 11K unless i somehow have misannotated something, but that's just being in denial. HAPAX is also something good.  the only thing i can imagine is that i wanted to kill a couple lanes now that i'm up by so much to maintain spread or something dumb like that, and didn't even consider playing on top of overlaid.

#note definitely laziness. insecure is better but championship player likes K11 RIF best so that i can bingo out. i guess if i gotta go by quackle for this experiment... (-27)
