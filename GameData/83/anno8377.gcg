#note 12G looks like a good spot to play this.

#note I didn't even hold.

#note I didn't consider YOGEE. DOGEY is probably okay but it does somewhat needlessly create lanes for me to worry about.

#note I thought this would be a good play to deny most O column bingos that would hit 15O and to mess with the row 14 and 15 lanes a little bit. I did not pick up on a critical nuance that made CUTER in the same spot a hugely better play. I still had plenty of time at this point. Hopefully in time I become more consistent at noticing and digesting more of the important details of these late-game positions, because it is so painful to lose games in this way.
>Scott: ESTZ O12 ZEST +77 378
>Will: CEILOOT B10 .ELIC +14 380
#note Total meltdown after ZEST. I could hardly believe I was even in this situation, and I was angry at myself. There are so many wins and many of them popped into my head, but I did no math to figure out which of them won. Pretty sad way to lose.
