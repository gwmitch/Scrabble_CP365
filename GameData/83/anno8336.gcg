#note sims best.  It's a greedy play going for the Z two ways at 14F on an A draw.  Worst case scenario I can dump C11 W(HI)Z next turn, and I have a V spot at 11L.  L11 VUM was close behind.  The board is dead, so I can unload my clunkers without losing ground hopefully.
>Matthew: DEIR 8J ..IDER +30 161
>Jeremy: ANUVWXZ 14F ZA +64 266
#note ZA sims best, but it is not a slam dunk. It is less than 4 pts ahead of I12 (E)X

#note 0.2 L11 SWUNG on wpct. L11 VUG wins on valuation. My play just below the other two. The top three choices are all very close.
>Matthew: AIQU D1 QUAI +52 256
>Jeremy: GNSTUVW L11 VUG +19 319
#note it might look wrong shedding the U with the Q up top, but it sims best
>Matthew: KOW B10 KO..W +44 300
>Jeremy: NNPRSTW L6 TW.N +13 332
#note 0.2 N6 WREN.  I considered it, but if I keep PSNT and draw a vowel, I'm bingo prone.  I want to keep both the U and the E wide open so I can bingo, especially since Matthew could smack me with a blank bingo any moment. Playing TWIN made more sense to me so I had chances to bingo next on a good draw.

>Jeremy: CLNPRSS 2C C.SP +14 346
#note 23.5  Big miss.  2B SCULP, SLURP, even SPURN, they are all much better.  I became super paranoid of giving away a blank bingo in row 1, and I also lost my concentration a few times.  I could have thrown away the whole game here. I had single turn lapses like this at Saratoga Springs which cost me whole games.  I have to eliminate this late game mistakes under pressure.
>Matthew: EFIIRTU O7 F.UITIER +67 393
>Jeremy: ?EGLNRS 3F aNGLERS +62 408
#note 6D L(U)G is about +1% to win.  I spent a minute looking for nines through ID which might have been more defensive, just to be sure.
>Matthew: LOY H1 LO.Y +36 429
>Jeremy: AAEMNRT 2J MEANT +40 448
#note The backup play was C3 CARMAN, which would have lost.  CARNET can win though.  Perhaps I would have come to that conclusion if MEANT didn't play.
