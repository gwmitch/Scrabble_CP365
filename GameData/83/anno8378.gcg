#note Haha, superb play here. Disclaimer: I am still a little frazzled at this point and that is partially why this game is also a total mess.

#note Joel spent five minutes shuffling tiles around before playing YUM. Why might he be doing that, I wonder? The amazing thing is, I was fully aware of the fact that he probably had a monster blank-containing rack during the game. I was also aware that HEAP in the same spot setting up CECA is arguably a better play anyway, even without considering the likely strength of his leave. No better way to learn a lesson, I guess.

#note I sincerely thought YUMS* was good because I knew YUMMIES was good. Just as a reminder, I was in fact a member of the Premier division for this tournament.
