>Jim_Burlant: ELNOPST 8B LEPTONS +74 74
#note Great start!
>Mary_Pastore: ACL E8 .ALC +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: EEIRTTW 7A TEW +21 95
#note Contemplated TWEETIER* but thought the better of it.  This is clearly best.  Nothing else worth consideration.
>Mary_Pastore: OTY 6B TOY +19 31
>Jim_Burlant: EIIIRTT G7 I.TI +6 101
#note Hmmm.  The sim is conflicted; this play has the highest winning chances, but it sims roughly 1 point down to exchanging IIT, which wins 0.3% less often than this.I guess Q prefers that I don't obstruct the S at H8 for easy triples.  
>Mary_Pastore: AEHK 5C HAKE +37 68
>Jim_Burlant: DEILRTU 4F DILUTER +71 172
#note Maybe the sim was onto something.  If I exchange instead of playing INTI on the previous turn, this scores 80 at H1 and I'm up 104 - 68.
>Mary_Pastore: QU D3 QU.. +32 100
>Jim_Burlant: AEFIINU H1 FAI. +21 193
#note Couldn't decide what to do here.  Q prefers 5K FEU by almost 7 points.  I saw that, but didn't like keeping dupe I's.  And this worked out much better than Q's recommended play; it probably won me the game.
>Mary_Pastore: W F4 ..W +15 115
>Jim_Burlant: DEINNOU L1 UNI.ONED +62 255
#note Play incorrectly scored as 61.  I'm winning 96%.  
>Mary_Pastore: EGIOPRS K7 PORGIES +77 192
#note SERPIGO M7 scores 80.
>Jim_Burlant: CINSXYZ 12A ZINCS +59 314
#note Too eager to put the play down and not spending enough time looking at the board.  ZINCY 2J scores 78 and saves the S for possibly another bingo.
>Mary_Pastore: BGNR B10 BR.NG +28 220
>Jim_Burlant: DEGINXY 5K D.XY +36 350
#note Hmmm.  Q prefers I dump as much of the rack as I can with H10 DINGEY, probably due to the unseen blanks. Q doesn't like this a whole lot.  Then again, I've got scads of options that score 36 - 39 and even this "whiff" is winning 97% - even with both blanks unseen.
>Mary_Pastore: AAJV 13G JAVA. +27 247
>Jim_Burlant: ABEGINT 8J B..ING +30 380
#note Q prefers 8J BODEGA by quite a few points to this, and I can see why.  While practically all my options score 30 - 36 here, BODEGA plays the pool (with  AAAEEEE still unseen) much better than my choice.  
>Mary_Pastore: EFM H12 F.ME +39 286
>Jim_Burlant: AEEELRT O6 RE.ELATE +60 440
#note Then again, when it's your game to win, you make iffy plays and are rewarded for them.  Best bingo.  Q says she still has 0.09% winning chances.  What can she conjure up to win this game?
>Mary_Pastore: ?ADHIOS A12 .OAS +44 330
>Mary_Pastore: ?ADHIOS --  -44 286
#note Courtesy of a phony she tries on the next turn, I know her full rack here.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEOOR A12 .EAl +41 481
#note Had Mary not tried the phony 4, I might not have looked for a play there.  I figured that 41 was enough and that there was no need to fish for a bingo at this point.  Q disagrees with this, preferring C12 NOO and N11AERO.
>Mary_Pastore: ?ADHIOS M7 H.AlOIDS +94 380
>Mary_Pastore: ?ADHIOS --  -94 286
>Jim_Burlant: EOOORRU 15H .URO +4 485
>Mary_Pastore: ?ADHIOS 1J HO.nDS +27 313
>Jim_Burlant: AEMOORV 2H .RM +24 509
#note Not looking too hard at this point.  2J MENO and 14D VROOM look better.
>Mary_Pastore: AI E2 AI +13 326
>Mary_Pastore:  (AEOOV) +16 342
#note Too many math/scoring errors to figure out here.  Final score recorded as 508 - 323.
