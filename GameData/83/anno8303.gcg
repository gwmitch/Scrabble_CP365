#note Had no idea what to do with this rack, as I didn't see 9F BEAD or BEAM.  This is weak.

#note Why play a legit word when I can make up a phony one? :-)  The only legitimate bingos I saw were ANTIMALE/LAMINATE down the I column.  The best bingos are H1 TAILLAMP and H8 PRIMATAL.  This actually fares better than the rest of the legitimate options, but the H column bingos are definitely best.
>Wes_Eddings: AZ 10J ZA +64 182
>Jim_Burlant: EFINOTV 12A FIVE +32 122
#note Best.  I'm winning 14%.

#note Eh.  Q prefers that I just ditch the Q.  Problem is, I don't like my odds of bingoing on this board. I'd rather string it open and force him to defend.
>Wes_Eddings: FOO O1 FOO. +24 230
>Jim_Burlant: ACINQRU H11 .RANQ +45 189
#note Thought long and hard about this felt the points took precedence.  Gotta stay in the game, ya know?  Q says QUIN B10 is best.

>Jim_Burlant: CEIILNU 15H .UINCE +20 209
#note 14H NUCLEIN is best, didn't know it.  Don't know why I missed 13H ACULEI, however.
>Wes_Eddings: EY F6 YE. +31 289
>Jim_Burlant: AIIJLLX 14J XI +52 261
#note Best, but still only winning 19%.
>Wes_Eddings: EEKNS N11 KNEES +36 325
>Jim_Burlant: AIJLLRY 14F JI. +26 287
#note And once again I fail to find JIAO.  This sims a close second, though.
>Wes_Eddings: EITU O8 ETUI +18 343
>Jim_Burlant: AGLLRWY N2 WY. +33 320
#note Anything is as good as anything else here.  At this piont I was feeling like I had accomplished something by merely being within 23 points after this turn, given that Wes's racks never had a turn off.
>Wes_Eddings: DOS M11 SOD +23 366
>Jim_Burlant: AGLLORT I1 TROLLAG. +61 381
>Jim_Burlant: AGLLORT --  -61 320
#note Perhaps a bit of panic, but I didn't see another choice.  Even if I had found BLOG 7K, I felt like it was now or never - with Wes defending this effectively, this rack was going to take at least one more turn to clean up, and by the time I had a bingo, it probably wouldn't go down.  How many turns did I have before he would have killed the I column?
