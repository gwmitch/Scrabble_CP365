>Rob_Robinsky: ADEGOST 8C DOTAGES +70 70
#note Rob: "I'm not sure why I went for the more defensive positioning, I don't usually do that. The difference according to Q is pretty much negligible, but leans towards taking the extra 2 points."
>Evans_Clinchy: EIIORRU H4 OURI. +6 6
#note Evans: "This leads the sim in valuation, for whatever that's worth. There are other spots to play OURIE for more points (like 7I and 9I), but those give back way too much. Looks like the three best options are my OURIE, DURRIE for 10 points more, or just trading. All roughly equal."
>Rob_Robinsky: CEINOUZ F6 ZO. +32 102
#note Rob: "ZOA leads in valuation, ZORI in win %. I think the difference is mostly stylistic - I prefer not to give back cheap points for relatively crappy tiles, especially if I'm not in position to take advantage of it (i.e. an S for ZORILS)."
>Evans_Clinchy: DEIJOQR 5G Q.IRED +32 38
#note Evans: "Close call between QUIRE and QUIRED. When in doubt, take four extra points and dig deeper into the bag to find blanks."
>Rob_Robinsky: CEILNNU C3 NUCLI.E +24 126
#note Rob: "Q agrees, which I'm pleased by. This is the type of play I often get wrong, trying to play too short."
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEEJOY 4L AJEE +30 68
#note Evans: "Definitely overthought this one. I decided that because I was down 88, I needed to keep options open for bingos, so I'd rather dangle an E in the triple lane than a J with JOYED. The correct line of thinking is actually 'JOYED IS 48 POINTS. PLAY IT, DUMMY.'"
>Rob_Robinsky: AENNTTT O3 T.NANT +18 144
#note Rob: "Q prefers ATTENT, which I understand. The front extensions probably hurt TENANT despite not opening another triple line...though as it turns out, if the draws remain the same you'd have had ATTENTIVE instead of VICED."
>Evans_Clinchy: EIMOOVY J2 MOO.Y +24 92
#note Evans: "The sim thinks IVORY in the same spot is a little better. Makes sense, since keeping the M will come in handy with a couple nice spots for it. The other option is YO N6, which I kinda like better in hindsight. The MOVIE leave isn't bingo-prone, but it could be more potent long-term."
>Rob_Robinsky: AAEOTUY N6 YOU +31 175
#note Rob: "Best, though I did consider TATOUAY to make a run at a blank or S."
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEIPSV 5A VI.ED +22 114
#note Evans: "Don't remember my reason for passing up VEEP D1, but I'm sure it was stupid. Obviously the play."
>Rob_Robinsky: AAEEGLT M8 GALEATE +72 247
>Evans_Clinchy: EGINPST 2G PIG.ENTS +76 190
>Rob_Robinsky: BHMORTU 1D THRUM +49 296
#note Rob: "As I was entering this rack, I saw RHUMB and thought 'ooh, I bet Quackle will love that play!' It likes it more than I realized - having to slot a vowel over a P somewhat negates the hot spot at 1H, with the added benefit of killing the GALEATED hook. Wish I'd seen it over the board."
>Evans_Clinchy: AAFIOPR 10F PARAFOI. +77 267
>Rob_Robinsky: BEEFNOW L12 FEW +35 331
#note Rob: "Best, and I'm starting to get worried about those blanks and S's now."
>Evans_Clinchy: ??DEHLN N13 HEN +30 297
#note Evans: "My first instinct here was not to bingo. What happens if I take INHALED 11C for 78, which is the best bingo? I go up by 14, I leave the TWS in line A open for him, and I give him a distinct tempo advantage going into the pre-endgame. Seems destined to lose. So passing up the bingo is probably right, but I totally missed the best non-bingo play: HEWED 14J, scoring 40 and keeping both blanks. Plus it opens up another TWS line. I'd have two high-scoring lines to bingo next turn and he can't block both. HEWED is 53.44 percent to win in the many-ply sim, HEN is 43.93, and bingoing is worse."
>Rob_Robinsky: ABEINOX A5 .IXEN +45 376
>Evans_Clinchy: ??BDLLR 4B L.BeD +26 323
#note Evans: "Pretty clearly best. Gotta score as much as possible now, keep a blank, and keep options open to bingo next. This does the trick."
>Rob_Robinsky: ABCIKOW K10 .W +10 386
#note Rob: "Totally complicated. The three candidate plays are COBIA 11B, COBIA 11C, and OW K10. COBIA 11B loses if your rack is AIRRSS?, as you can play RISTRAS. COBIA 11C loses if your rack is AILRSS?, as you can play D7 f(O)SS(O)RIAL...lol. Q has decided that K10 OW wins ~93% of the time with a many-ply sim inferring that you have the blank...I have no inclination whatsoever to go through the possible permutations and figure out what loses and how."
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AILRSV 11A ReVISAL +74 397
#note Evans: "If the A is in the bag, I can go out with TAJ M2 next turn and win 427-426."
>Rob_Robinsky: ABCIKOS O13 SKA +45 431
#note Evans: "The A wasn't in the bag."
