#note Surprisingly bad (but not completely awful) - ARDENT 7s don't play on this board and Joey is likely to deny most 8s on his next play (which probably isn't even reflected in the sim results)

#note 9E DEANERY is very nice.

#note W: Ridiculous. Great play.
J: I only knew this because Dave Wiegand played it once.  Finding it the second time is easier than the first, but I was still pretty excited to play it myself.

#note Pretty horrible rack, but this is the time you don't mind as much.

#note B6 RIOJA is the only play with any win chance worth mentioning, but I highly doubt my 'real' chances against Joey are that high.
