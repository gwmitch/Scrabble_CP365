>Jim_Burlant: EHIOSTZ F6 ZE.O +33 33
#note The obvious plays are F6 HERTZ or ZORI; I didn't see them.  While this surprisingly sims not even 2-1/2 points down on HERTZ, this mistake is one of three that could have cost me the game.
>Cesar_del_Solar: EHP 7H HEP +18 54
>Jim_Burlant: ACHIIST 10B CHIAS +34 67
#note And if I played ZORI like I should have, I'd be sitting on ACEHIST and be looking at a bingo.  Instead I have this.  Q doesn't particularly like this, saying that, in stead, I should play KHI G8 23, docking me 8 points.
>Cesar_del_Solar: EINQU B6 QUIN.E +37 91
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAIJTW A11 AWAIT +38 105
#note Best, and I'm winning 57%.  Burning the blank with AJIvA for 59 sims 6 points down.  I was figuring to bingo with the blank in a couple of turns...but I was about to screw up royally.
>Cesar_del_Solar: EITU C3 ETUI +19 110
>Jim_Burlant: DIIJRTV I4 JIV.. +16 121
#note This is not a typo - I lost the blank on an overdraw.  When he turned the tiles over and I saw IV?, Cesar's question as I tossed the blank into the bag: "How'd you know I was going to put the blank back in?"  To which I replied, "Yeah, let's put that nasty blank back in the bag."  Anyway this is best, winning 45%.
>Cesar_del_Solar: ELRU 4I .UREL +24 134
>Jim_Burlant: DIRSTUW B1 WUD +17 138
#note The first 2 tiles out of the bag were UW.  You have got to be kidding me!  Best, winning 50%.  Of interest:  D2 WRITS 36.
>Cesar_del_Solar: DENO 1A O.NED +30 164
#note Well, that could have been a lot worse.
>Jim_Burlant: GILORST E10 .LGOR +12 150
#note Not even one of the oiriginal kibbitzer choices, this sims very respectably - while D3 LOTS (which I didn't consider) wins the sim, this is one of only 3 plays within 3-1/2 points of LOTS after 500 2-ply iterations.  I figured that with this pool, I should set up my S and try to turn a few tiles to see if I could get my blank back.  I was in for a rude awakening.  Of note:  maybe 2D LOG would have been better than this.  While it wouldn't have stopped him from making a big play on his next turn, the end of this game would have been much easier for me to figure out. 
>Cesar_del_Solar: ??DEFGO 12C Fa.GOtED +74 238
>Jim_Burlant: INRSTVY H12 .IVY +27 177
#note Play scored incorrectly as 30.  This is best, winning 8%.
>Cesar_del_Solar: ABNORTY 11I BARYTON +81 319
>Jim_Burlant: CEINRST N2 CISTERN +85 262
#note There are no bingos down the triple line, and this is best.  Q still says I have next to no chance, as it claims I'm only winning 3%.  Woo hoo.
>Cesar_del_Solar: AELNOTT A8 TO +14 333
#note Post mortem, Cesar told me his rack; it didn't take a rocket scientist to see he was concerned about the unseen X, and my comment as this came down:  "Well, someone doesn't have the X."   We chuckled.
>Jim_Burlant: AAAGMNP 8L PA.G +30 292
#note Q prefers 10J GAMA for winning percentage, though this play sims with highest valuation.
>Cesar_del_Solar: LX G11 L.X +35 368
#note Both of us laugh out loud as this comes down.
>Jim_Burlant: AABEIMN 10L BAM +32 324
#note Did not know this spelling of the word, as I only knew it as being spelled AMBIENCE.  2H AMBIANCE scores 70 and wins 17%...and this miss set up a rather bizarre finish.
>Cesar_del_Solar: O C9 O. +10 378
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILNS 14H .ASELINE +76 400
#note If you're me, which bingo do you put down?  I'll explain this choice shortly...
>Cesar_del_Solar: AEINRST 2D RETINAS +66 444
#note At the time, I had dickered over whether to put down VASELINE or the lower scoring SALIENCE on row 2.  The unseen M made me worry that he could still outrun me in the end game if he had it, and that SALIENCE's 62 points weren't enough given my deficit and the unseen M.  Hence, this choice.  At the time, we thought that I had missed the winning play, but replaying the game shows that we weren't quite on target - if I play SALIENCE I still lose by 1.  Oh well, I get what I deserve.   If I can't find ZORI, and if I can't pay enough attention to what I'm doing to not draw too many tiles, I don't deserve the win.  A shame, since i otherwise played about the best game I'm capable of playing.
