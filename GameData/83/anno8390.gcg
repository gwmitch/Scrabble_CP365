#note Surprisingly, static evaluator slightly prefers QAT here.  Yeah, the six tile leave wasn't likely to do much on this board, but 9 points seems like a lot to give up here.
>Marty: AEIIMNR G5 IMA.INER +63 111
#note I can't see any good argument for playing this over its anagram.  Unless the sight of the other word just gives you a headache.

#note In retrospect, I should have known this was phony, as I've often typed it in this way in Zyzz, and thought that I had trained myself "LEFTOVER, not overfelt*".  But in the heat of battle, and perhaps swayed by the cuteness of the play, I couldn't resist.  FERVOR is the best legitimate play.
>Marty: BENN B10 B.NNE +26 174
>Dave: AAEEIRS E10 A.EAE +23 167
#note Very glad to find this play that bailed me out of a terrible rack.

>Marty: ?CEILTY 2H C.EsTILY +84 275
>Dave: EIJOORR O1 O.ER +24 263
#note An interesting moment.  I thought about JOE or JO C5, but I decided that the O column was likely to be his best scoring spot, and I could still possibly play the J there the next turn.  Not to mention, an A draw would give me a nice RIOJA in two spots.  Also, the (E)IORR leave might put me into a low scoring situation on the next turn.
>Marty: ABEGHNS K2 .HEBANGS +76 351
#note Marty got some luck with the tiles at just the right time.  After this, I still have some fight left, but it's an uphill battle.
>Dave: IIJORTU 3C JI.T +22 285
#note This was a tough situation, but the alternatives don't look substantially better than this to me.
>Marty: ETU C3 .UTE +19 370
>Dave: ?IORTUY 8K .OUTY +30 315
#note Maybe GUYOT is a tiny bit better, but it's not likely to make a huge difference.
>Marty: EIP 9M PIE +22 392
>Dave: ?AIKOPR H1 I.K +33 348
#note The K draw stopped me from bingoing, but at least I can score well and still have two bingo lanes, albeit hard-to-fit ones.
>Marty: CDOS 10L DOCS +35 427
>Dave: ?AOPRSW B5 SPeW +32 380
#note Nope, didn't hit it.
>Marty: EOUV L10 .OVE +16 443
>Dave: AOR A7 OAR +25 405
#note Oops, ORA was three more points.
>Dave:  (U) +2 407
