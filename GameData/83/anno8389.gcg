#note So I was thinking of GOOIE(R)  or OO(R)IE. If you don't know OURIE/OORIE, you should, it's a great vowel dump. The sim actually likes 10G GOO or D9 (F)OOTIE best. 
>Jeff: EEGIILR 10G GIE +17 65
#note You may have noticed that I've had two I's on my rack every turn, which is why I've played an I on every turn (always try and get rid of one doubled vowel). This play leaves EILR which is also good for building a bingo.

#note I'm just seeing VARIOLE now, oops, I missed it. I blame your coffeehousing about BAT.

#note Would've played 15A HORA but didn't see the A hook til next turn.
>Albert: MY B14 MY +22 120
>Jeff: ABNOQRT 8A BOTA +30 208
#note Now, B10 QAT is actually best. Always get rid of the Q for points if you can.
>Albert: AADESUW -AAEUW +0 120
#note Just made this up since I don't know what you had

>Jeff: DNNQRUY B6 QU.D +34 242
>Albert: AEGOSTU 12K .AGE +10 130
#note So OUTAGES won't play; looks like L1 GOUTS or A12 TOEA (another vowel dump you should know) are your best scoring plays.
