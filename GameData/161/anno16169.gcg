#note Quackle likes M3 PEG best by a good margin....Not sure why I didn't just play PAGED for 29, the 2nd best option....29 leaving Q? is good, plus P in that position isn't too volatile...bad move here

#note (S)ALADAnG didn't score enough...plus I figured he'll drop 35 points in this spot if I don't block it. fAn(E)GADA, also.

#note Actual rack. Small chance of me bingoing next turn, but he wants to eliminate all options by playing this. Championship player found many players that win 90%+. 12M (U)TS led way.
