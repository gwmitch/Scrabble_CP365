#note KANJI sims better. Had I seen it, I don't know, the K in that spot is kind of volatile..... (-3)

#note I saw KI(A)NG, didn't realize it was ACTUALLY a Scrabble word! Where else would I have seen it Joey?? (-8)

#note I saw KH(A)N, but I figured for the same points I could not open up the 3x3, of course NNRX is way worse than ENRX but that's where I went wrong! KH(A)N sims best! (-9)

>Joey_Krafchick: CEIMNOW 15A .ENIC +9 286
#note (AUTO)NOMIC! And I made this play because now I'm up by 60 and he's incredibly unlikely to have a bingo after I shut the board off like that. 
>Joe_Gaspard: DEERS F9 RE.SED +43 268
#note Nice. I was not anticipating a 43 point play on this board, hence my strategy from my last play, but oh well.

>Joey_Krafchick: ?LNOOST N13 SOL +19 357
#note I was fairly low on time too, also a bit lazy.
>Joe_Gaspard: OR K13 .OR +7 323
#note I didn't play too great this game, but I got it done. NIXE was a mistake, I stand by (G)ENIC although had I seen autonomic, I would have played that! H(I)KER and JAMB were also mistakes, and INTI was questionable.
