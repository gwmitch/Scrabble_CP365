#note The thinking here was that if I draw an I, I'm in an extremely good position- I get DEWAXING for 60 and keep a blank. If I don't, I still have DEWAXiNG for 57, and I'm likely going to have to exchange after I play it because I'm drawing into EOOU anyway. What do you think? Also, how does the game score factor in to the decisionmaking here?

#note Sure, Matt, don't play (A)WARDiNG for 8 more.

>Matt_Canik: BEEEIOS 13C BIO.E +20 204
#note I didn't like this play because it created an unnecessary and hard to block bingo line in a game where I've got a lead. BOI(T)E has to be right, but I didn't see that or (D)OBIE. One thing that did factor into my decision-making was that bingos at 14G often give up the S hook to the S I have. 
>Cree: AHMOOOR B5 OHO +34 164
#note He said he held AMOR here. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEEEOS A6 ADO +25 229
#note AEDES is a nifty little 5 that plays for 41. I dunno if I should knock out the triple here or play ODEA D2 for 19. Also noteworth is EASE D4 for 29. 
>Cree: AEFIMOR 14G FOAMIER +73 237
#note Aw, now I can't cash my S.

#note APpOSES is 107. 
>Cree: DTU L12 DU.T +12 295
#note He spent a really long time here. I feel like I probably should have deduced that something beyond fishing was up, and that he was fishing for DEWAXING. 
>Matt_Canik: EEEIJKT M1 JEE +29 358
#note But I just want to kill off the L and O. I should have thought harder, I think..
>Cree: GIN 8H .....ING +60 355
#note But maybe I'm just playing into the "I know what happens so I should have blocked it" game. 
>Matt_Canik: EEEHIKT O3 KHI +34 392
>Cree: ET 12J TE. +9 364
#note He's pretty clearly holding something like AENRT or EINRT now.
>Matt_Canik: EEEIOTT D3 TOE +15 407
#note Trying to kill his best line...
>Cree: AAENNRT E2 NA +4 368
>Matt_Canik: EEIINTY F1 YETI +16 423
#note The thinking here is that if he has a bingo from the G, I lose no matter what, so I may as well empty the bag and stop him from having another shot at fishing for something (potentially something through N?A also). 
>Cree: AELNRTV 11E L.V +12 380
>Matt_Canik: BEIILNR 9K BINE +25 448
#note Last game of the tourney and spread isn't a factor, but I guess I still should have blocked RANTE(R).
