#note I needed to beat John by 66 to pass him in the tournament, though Conrad was 1 spread point behind.

#note I wanted to play HAYIEST#, but even though I figured it was good I had never seen it so I took the safer points

#note man, what now? I saw REALIA but didn't like how many cheap points it gave up. I was thinking about playing pretty fishily because the blanks were gone and I wanted to keep my good letters, but the pool is chock full of bingo letters. my ultimate choice was pretty bad. I think I like REALIA now, especially because the volatility increases my chances of beating john by a margin greater than the 66 I need to pass him.
>Olaugh: CDNOOS N8 CODONS +20 279
#note what a nutso play! I think he was scared of PEEKABOOS.
>JD: AAILTUW M9 WAI +24 321
#note trying to create some kind of lanes
>Olaugh: EGM 5E MEG +24 303
>JD: AEILOTU 14B LOUT +29 350
#note the pool is unusually consonant-heavy so I figured I would get greedy and take the 5 extra points for LOUT (misscored as 30). Quackle likes it.
>Olaugh: LST L12 S.LT +44 347
#note guess he had CODONSS or something
>JD: AEILNRU H1 URINAL +28 378
#note with unilinear now blocked twice over I felt the best chance  had of getting the big win I wanted was getting some turnover here and then bingoing.
>Olaugh: EIJRT 15J JI.TER +39 386
>JD: AEEGRTU 4G U.EAGER +19 397
#note well, I did draw a bingo, but it doesn't go anywhere (TREAGUE#). unfortunately for me I missed the key hook - forgot about GLOUT. If I play there I take his best scoring play away and let myself go out next turn. TEGU# is a 100% win, EUGE is 7/8. With my actual draw of the V only TEGU does it.
>Olaugh: DEGIISY 5J YID +28 414
#note easy win for john, GIE at 5J was best by a couple over this.

#note nice win for john! egis best. also grise#. I came two big mistakes away from going 6-0!
