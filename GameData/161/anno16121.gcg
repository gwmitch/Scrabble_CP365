>dacrON: EHIKUWY 8H KYU +20 20
>Jesse: ?DEOPRT 9G DiOPTRE +78 78
#note JD: redtops wins a sim pretty consistently. why? something about there only being one place to score?
>dacrON: EGHISVW 8M HEW +32 52
>Jesse: AEEFHNT L8 T.EFAH +37 115
>dacrON: EGIISTV 12E VESTIGI. +63 115
>Jesse: ?BEMNOP M13 MOB +28 143
#note JD: MOB just gives back a lot more points than BOP.
>dacrON: AAAIOUW H12 .AWA +21 136
#note cBB: Dang, what to do here. Maybe could take O(B)IA now, saving (T)AWA for next turn and hoping my rack is cleaned up a bit. AIOU is bad even in Collins though. Got a hold, but no challenge.
>Jesse: ?EILNPU 10B LUPINEs +70 213
#note JD: nothing is significantly better than this, a bit surprisingly
>dacrON: AAEINOU 15K NU.IA +24 160
>Jesse: ADOOSTZ 14J ZO +33 246
>dacrON: ACDEIOT 14M .DA +16 176
#note cBB: The salient 11K O(F) wins the sim, but it seemed pretty bleak. Not sure why I rejected G12 (S)TOA, as it looks pretty solid. This play is also bad - I was so dejected with how bleak 11K O(F) was that I felt I had to play something else - weak rationale. I'd take (S)TOA if I could do it over.
>Jesse: AADORST 7M TAO +18 264
#note JD: There's a dictum in Starcraft 2 - when you're ahead, get more ahead. that seems to be the case in CSW, as opposed to TWL which encourages more defense. Kwak's favorite play is something like AHED at M7 keeping a fishier leave, especially with lots of Es to draw to complete the rack. But the real issue is that with ETHE# available (which I had forgotten about) I'm just giving him a great lane.
>dacrON: CEIINOT 11L .OCI +9 185
#note cBB: I spent about 15 minutes on this move and the one before because they were so tough! I hoped he didn't know E(THE)#, so I was really just going for a bingo and a lucky draw. Maybe (DE)I(S)T G9 or T(AX)I 13G is a better way of doing that, as they score 9 more but sacrifice a bit in leave.
>Jesse: SX I11 S.X +35 299
>dacrON: EGILNRT 6H RINGLET +74 259
#note cBB: Got the hold, but no +5.
>Jesse: ADENRRS E10 .N.AR +16 315
#note JD: snarred# would've been really nice right here, just haven't seen it yet. Suspect it's in the next batch of 7s I'm looking at.

>dacrON: ABJLNRT O10 J.B +15 328
>Jesse: EEGORRV H1 VERGE. +36 387
>Jesse: IMORSUY (challenge) +5 392
#note Cbb: Not sure why I gave him the +5 here. I guess I felt like I was in too much trouble.
>dacrON: ALLNORT 15A AL +17 345
#note cBB: I'm somewhat shocked just how terribly this play sims. I don't understand how a play like 5E LOR(E)L wins 25% of the time on manyply, and this does under 3%. That's definitely not right - especially when considering my expected bingo % next turn is 55% LOL. I do like 4H (G)ALLON that goes for the outbingo - a line that will win occasionally. I figured if I got an E, I could be in business. I get that this play is bad, but is it that much worse than GALLON?
>Jesse: IMORSUY G2 YOU +18 410
#note JD: I think YOU might be right here. it cuts down his bingo percentage a decent amount.
>dacrON: DELNORT F1 ENTROLD +77 422
#note cBB: At no point did it occur to me that I could move this ONE SPOT DOWN for a MUCH BETTER PLAY. I was also down to 30 seconds. This is a gigantic mistake.
>Jesse: ACIMNRS 1A MARIN. +27 437
#note cbb: 1A CAMIS(E) is the straightforward win here, but 5E C(O)R(E)MIA for 63 is absolutely filthy.  JD: or rainstorm!
