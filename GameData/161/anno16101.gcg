#note Considered PIRACO* here, as I bingo with AHLMNT. Actually bingos with the other C too, but I'd have missed ACCEIOPR. Also thought PIRACO might stay on, which gives me an interesting advantage. Ultimately, I didn't see how getting cute here was going to help me enough to make it worth the risk...6 minutes later.

#note OK time to go for a Noah-style train-of-thought analysis. I put AX down, thinking I was setting up ZIG, realized PAG*, then eventually decided on AXE for the defense. Going over the game now, I realize EX sets up ZAG, whoops. Tossup plays - I still think I'd choose AXE because I like the control. Note I've got a pretty solid spread advantage here, too, so the win% has higher importantce for me. So maybe in a normal situation, EX is better, and let the T risk be for now. Also, I can alays parallel the ORT if need be. OK, EX it is.

#note I thought I was fishing for RE(SHAVEN) or RE(VANCHE), but uh, I'm playing off the H, so this play is terrible. I think I'd have played B4 HAVE if I'd realized my mistake - don't mind opening the lane as Mike is over on time now.

#note heh, if I'd been greedy with (R)EV the turn before, I'd bingo out here! 9J V(I)NES is 8 better than this.
