#note Ehhh....
>Walker_Willingham: ADEMNPS 7H DAMPENS +67 87
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIIRV 6F VIA +18 37
#note AIVER E9 perhaps, but I always seem to forget about that word.
>Walker_Willingham: ACGIRU K7 .UGRIA +18 105
>Walker_Willingham: ACGIRU --  -18 87
#note Walker said after he was testing me to see if I'd challenge some random made-up word. Having scanned over some of the various ways to spell PUGREE, I assumed he was getting it wrong. Or just trying to slip one past me.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIJRTU K5 JU.E +26 63
#note Good for me to have that P back.
>Walker_Willingham: ACGIRU M3 CARI.G +18 105
#note I asked him after why not play CURING instead haha, guess he just had a brain fart.
>Matthew_Larocque: EILORST 2G LOITERS +69 132
#note To my benefit.... and overscored by 1.
>Walker_Willingham: EILOU 3D LOUIE +11 116
#note And I caught him with a vowel rack at a bad time....
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DDEERT H1 T..D +21 153
>Walker_Willingham: ABORT E9 ABORT +19 135
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEERSU D1 DE.oUSER +72 225
#note Just spin the wheel of bingo fortune here.... pERUSED 14A is ahead, bu I wanted to avoid a potential counter-bingo on the TWS.
>Walker_Willingham: ADI -  +0 135
#note Or that could happen and it becomes a much better play.
>Matthew_Larocque: FILOQTU 1A QUO. +42 267
>Walker_Willingham: ADI A1 .ADI +15 150
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFILTT L4 FA +30 297
#note Oh, FILT(R)ATE. Not sure if I would have been that confident about it though.
>Walker_Willingham: APSW 14B WAPS +26 176
#note This would normally look like an obvious S setup, but there's none left and I have the blank. Why not play C7 WAP for 26 then?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGILTT C13 G.T +8 305
#note Really thought I was missing bingos here. Almost played TEG for 20 instead, but then reasoned that he just gave me a great place to bingo - no need to ruin that.
>Walker_Willingham: AAEEEII -AEEII +0 176
#note As I was mentally flopping between GAT/TEG, he told me was sitting on 7 vowels.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEITTY C7 YET +22 327
#note Still no bingos, but YE(T)I for 34 should have been an auto-pilot play, nevermind not even seeing it. 
>Walker_Willingham: CHINR L7 .NRICH +29 205
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEIKLT A8 TALKIEs +92 419
#note Just my luck that he had to leave this open (or did so on purpose). LAKIEsT if I want to get greedy and stupid. And sometimes, I really do. Looks like  I added 102 to my score here and we didn't notice.
>Walker_Willingham: ENVY M12 ENVY +25 230
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEHIOZ 15L O.EZ +51 470
#note Sorry Walker, this just isn't your game.
>Walker_Willingham: GNRW 10J WR.NG +21 251
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHILNO 2A .H +20 490
#note I looked at that promising scoring crevice on the B column and for some reason missed OLEIN and HEIL. Doesn't really matter here but I prefer not to get lazy even if I'm drawing the bag.
>Walker_Willingham: ABFN B9 FA +17 268
#note 19 points up 3 spaces.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILNO 12D O.LE +8 498
#note Weaksauce but I was really out of time so just had to make a play of some kind.
>Walker_Willingham: BN 5C N.B +10 278
