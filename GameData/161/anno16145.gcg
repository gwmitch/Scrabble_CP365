#note Forgot to record my full racks for some reason at the start. At least I talked myself out of *BU(R)K here, but why not BO(R)K? Also thought about B(L)OB for 23. KAB(O)B also decent but depends on what my last letter was too.
>Eric_Tran: GIR G5 GIR. +20 58
>Matthew_Larocque: BCOPTUU B2 COB. +20 74
#note I must have whiffed BU(B)U here, because the double-U leave is just about as wretched as it gets. I didn't know COP(O)UT could be a single word.
>Eric_Tran: IIIII -IIIII +0 58
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEPTUU 9H TUP +8 82
#note What in the world..... just exchange and get it over with. I didn't see (G)ETUP which would have been way better than my turd of a play.
>Eric_Tran: AJT 10I TAJ +20 78
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEEENU K10 .EED +24 106
#note Thought about playing DENUDE 11D for turnover and shedding the U. Oddly enough I didn't know the THREE anagrams of DENUDE - ENDUED 11E scores 25 and takes out the J hotspot.
>Eric_Tran: ?AAEEIT 11C TAEnIAE +65 143
#note And this doesn't happen.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHNOU 13G HOUN.ED +34 140
#note Missed last letter, if it was an S I missed UNHOUSE(D), but I'd like to think I would have seen that. But I know that's never a sure thing haha.
>Eric_Tran: HNOP 12A PHON +30 173
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIOSU 13B ODE +24 164
#note EIDE scores 30 in the same spot, but Es are scarce so maybe not? Q seems to like (H)UE too, but do I need to be that desperate?
>Eric_Tran: AV H13 .VA +18 191
>Matthew_Larocque: EISSU 6A US +17 181
#note Not sure what I had...
>Eric_Tran: ?AAGLNS 5G .ALANGaS +68 259
#note Thankfully I had gone over some 3xA bingos prior to this tournament. 
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILORS 3D .ALORISE +63 244
#note SERA(G)LIO, sims better despite the cheap points it gives.
>Eric_Tran: EFIWY 2K WIFEY +33 292
#note Eric hesitated but then decided he was okay with it.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGNRRRZ L12 R.G +12 256
#note I miss (P)REZ for every turn here on - I forgot about the spot right when I drew an awesome play there! :( Also missing (C)R(O)ZE, I decided to gamble for the last S and hope to get SIZE down.
>Eric_Tran: FLY I2 F.L.Y +11 303
>Matthew_Larocque: ENRRTTZ E1 TR.N. +13 269
>Eric_Tran: IMSW 15L SWIM +36 339
#note Well I tried
>Matthew_Larocque: ENNRTXZ 15G Z.X +19 288
#note Ugh, I forgot about the blank A on the board, so I thought I could get Z stuck if I cashed the X somewhere.
>Eric_Tran: IIIMO 1N OM +35 374
>Matthew_Larocque: ENNRT M4 T.NNER +7 295
#note Slow playing is better but I was out of time.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (III) +6 301
#note -20, mishandled the early ugly racks, shouldn't have missed (P)REZ either.
