>Matthew_Larocque: ADFFGNS 8E GAFF +22 22
#note Wasn't sure on DAFF, had no idea NAFF was a word also. Kinda hoped I wouldn't get burned too bad here.
>Wayne_Clifford: ACDENT I4 CANTED +24 24
#note Lucky, wonder what he kept here though?
>Matthew_Larocque: DEELNPS 5E DEPL.NES +94 116
#note I didn't know the anagram - thankfully I didn't need to here.
>Wayne_Clifford: IMTY 4K MITY +26 50
>Matthew_Larocque: ?GIRRRS E8 .RIG +12 128
#note I thought about tacking an R on GAFFE but I wasn't sure if it was good, and didn't like fishing off only one letter from this rack. This opens dual s hooks for me which is good.
>Wayne_Clifford: UUUUVVW -UUUUVVW +0 50
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ELORRS 3C ROlLERS +77 205
#note I knew I was playing with fire here. I literally played this instead of LORRiES for the 2 extra points. I couldn't even think of REROLls and I didn't know sORRELS or ROLfERS.
>Wayne_Clifford: EITU B2 ETUI +15 65
#note Got lucky again though.
>Matthew_Larocque: CELMNRU A5 MERC +28 233
#note This must be better than 3L CUM for the defense, right?
>Wayne_Clifford: IK H1 KI. +21 86
>Matthew_Larocque: ILNOTUV 3L VIOL +29 262
>Wayne_Clifford: JW D2 J.W +26 112
>Matthew_Larocque: DEINOTU J7 ODE +23 285
#note (N)UDE 6I maybe, but I kinda like taking out the GAFFE hooks.
>Wayne_Clifford: AE 6L AE +9 121
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINSTU 12E SINUATE +65 350
#note lol I didn't even see the other place to play SINUATE. I didn't know UNA(K)ITES.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?ABEIQ 2N BE +26 147
#note He thought for awhile, then was in the process of playing QAdI L10 before playing this instead.
>Matthew_Larocque: EHOSUVW L8 HOWES +46 396
#note Didn't like the UV leave, but it's too many points. Something like WOVE 11K is tempting, but no reason to open any dangerous hooks.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?AEIQZ 8L .AZE +48 195
>Matthew_Larocque: AHNOOUV 13I HON +23 419
#note  I think this was me trying to block the U for his Q..... not sure if that's worth docking 7 points off my score (OOH for 30). Plus it opens the board more.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?AIPQ 11K P.A +20 215
>Matthew_Larocque: ADOUUVY 14H DAY +35 454
#note I could just play AY instead, didn't occur to me for some reason. But it's a heinous leave either way.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?IOQX 6E OX +53 268
#note Should have just taken that spot when I had the chance.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGOTUUV 15F AVO +27 481
>Wayne_Clifford: ?IQR G8 .IR +7 275
>Matthew_Larocque: BGITTUU N11 TUTU +14 495
#note BUTUT! It's a monetary unit of Gambia. Plays at 14B or C5. N10  UT sims best. Okay.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?AQ 14M Q.A +12 287
#note He wasn't going to get Q stuck so I didn't care.
>Matthew_Larocque: BGILN 14C GLIB +23 518
#note GIB instead.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?INOR C9 ROwIN. +14 301
>Wayne_Clifford:  (N) +2 303
#note Lost -10 on time. Yeah, I use all my time even on games where I can't possibly lose. SO WHAT!
