#note Quackle prefers QI keeping EMRSTU, but I don't know all those bingoes and Quackle does.

>Matt_Canik: AAINNST 2M .AN +10 76
#note She won't hit me very hard after this fish, I'll probably pull a bingo. As far as fishing foes, I think this is right. Of course, I could have just played ANNA(L)IST!

>Matt_Canik: BCDEPST 7E CEP +19 284
#note I need to score points to stay in this, but I also need to clear off the rack. This scores more points than most plays (but not DE 13B).

#note I think about playing KELP to make SKELP, but I decide double Ts are bad.

>Harriette_Lakernick: DEIT O6 DIET +37 369
>Matt_Canik: AHNNRTT 9I H.T +21 381
#note Here's what I'm thinking: The ONLY thing she can play in the 13b spot is RE for 26. That will leave drek in the pool, and I'll likely be able to outrun her after that. I decide to try and balance the rack while scoring what I can now. 
>Harriette_Lakernick: EFI 15H FIE +22 391
>Matt_Canik: ABENNRT M9 BE +17 398
#note This was interesting. She has NOTHING that plays in the 13B spot now, and I still hold RAN after this play. I'm worried that, if I pull the Z, I am stuck with it if she blocks the Z(IT) spot at 9M. Therefore, I only have a 7/8 chance of winning. BE lets me hit RAN the next turn and win handily, or I can play ZAG or something should I pull the Z. 
>Harriette_Lakernick: IIORUUZ 13G .UZO +28 419
#note As it turns out, I also had (OY)EZ if I pulled the Z. So I had this game won either way.

>Matt_Canik: T 9C T. +6 446
#note A great game, in my mind. I played well, got away with a phoney bingo, and won a sweet endgame, right? 
Well after quackling, I missed two bingoes and the endgame was won either way. That deflates my ego quite a bit, lol. Oh well, I still think I played well.
