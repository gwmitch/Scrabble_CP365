>Dave_Koenig: MNU 8G MUN +10 10
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEILMW J6 WAILED +26 26
>Dave_Koenig: ACCINOS 5D COCAINS +83 93
>Dave_Koenig: ACCINOS --  -83 10
#note I challenged them both and was pretty sure they were both bogus.  We were both half wrong.  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: AFHMNOR K10 FOHN +31 57
>Dave_Koenig: ACCINOS L4 COCAINS +80 90
#note Dave pointed out he also had (M)OCCASIN which is very nice.
>Ryan_Fischer: ALMRTWY -  +0 57
#note And I still thought this was bogus.
>Dave_Koenig: AOR L12 OAR +18 108
>Ryan_Fischer: ALMRTWY I10 RAWLY +23 80
#note RAWLY is valid.  Dave held, and when he did, I thought I was making it up.  But then he let it go.  OUTLAWRY... so LAWRY* right?  Nah.
>Dave_Koenig: EINORTU 4E NEUROTI. +61 169
>Ryan_Fischer: EEMSTTU 5B MUSETTE +78 158
#note I just learned this in my most recent session, most likely along with GOMBEEN.  Who says studying doesn't pay?  :)
>Dave_Koenig: IJN 3G JIN +43 212
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEEIOO H13 ABO +24 182
#note B2 BIO(M)E 22.  Okay, but I hate giving back something so easily potent.
>Dave_Koenig: AY 6A AY +28 240
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEIIOT M11 OBE +24 206
>Dave_Koenig: DIOZ A6 .ZIDO +45 285

>Dave_Koenig: AQST C3 SQ.AT +43 395
#note Just a beeeeautiful play!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGLNPV E10 GANEV +34 411
#note Champ has V(e)EP 42% to win.  I did not consider that, and I really should have.  I was fixated on GANEV or LEAVEN and hated staring down the barrel of an X bomb in two places.  At least GANEV was 2nd.
>Dave_Koenig: EEFGIOR 15A R.IF +30 425
#note This, EF, FOGIE, and OE all win 100%.  Aw.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGLPX K2 AX.L +26 437
#note Champ says P(I)G to block OGEE, leaving LAX (I guess).
