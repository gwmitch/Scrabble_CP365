>Matt_Canik: ?ANQRTU 9A QUARTiN. +69 115
#note Someone very wise told me that if I wanted to win d2, I would have to phoney the weaker players. I know this is no good, but hey, it's 69 points! Also notable is TRANQs/SCUT for 73, but that holds a U and sims worse.

>Matt_Canik: ?ADEGII 15G AIDInG +29 321
#note Sigh. Great way to open the tournament. Aside from whiffing VAGABOND and WALTZ on the first two turns, I played really well. Oh well.
