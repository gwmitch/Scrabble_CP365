#note A funny situation occurred here. Jesse was really unsure if SATSUMI* was a word, and everyone hated it. Luckily, he didn't try it. After his play, me, Jesse and Conrad argued about the position--should he play MAUTS or trade the U? When I got home from club, I typed it into Quackle and was greeted with a hilarious surprise. We all failed. :)

#note Perhaps K10 HAAF if I want to play very openly.

>whatnoloan: AEENNRW 9E WEAN +30 126
#note Correctly chickened out on REWANNE(D). WREN is likely right here, blocking the nicest scoring spot on the board. WEAN keeps a bingo leave on a closed board and leaves that strong spot for my opponent.
>JD: ACIV H1 CAVI. +33 174
>whatnoloan: EENOORY 4C EYNE +32 158
#note Took a little while comparing this to (S)OOEY 10J. This puts me close to Jesse and blocks a good scoring spot, and SOOEY just sacrifices too many points, opens more for Jesse, and isn't that hard to close.
>JD: IPSZ 10B ZIPS +45 219
>whatnoloan: ?IIOORU D10 .OI +10 168
#note I hold the case "S", which means POORI might be called for. On the other hand, POORI gives more back to Jesse, making a bingo on my part less likely to catch up. Exchanging is another choice, but I think I need to open some more lanes. I forwent PIU and CURIO for the same reason.

>JD: CEMNO M1 .NCOME +20 323
#note I didn't think about it at the time, but this seems a lot like a try for an X setup. Perhaps he was trying to confuse me? (I know he didn't have the X because I ended up drawing it later.
>whatnoloan: EEGILOT L4 GO +16 315
#note Seemed like the best of a mediocre bunch. 
>JD: ABJ 6B JAB +41 364
>whatnoloan: EEILTUY 1A .UY +7 322
#note I hadn't a clue here. Perhaps (S)UETY 10J, which I missed. This isn't a wonderful play.
>JD: RV 6L R.V +18 382
>whatnoloan: EEIILTX 10J .ILEX +28 350
#note It would be nice to make some sort of set up, but I didn't see anything. This may give back too many points, and I don't really know what to do here. (O)I is the only other thing that looks any good, perhaps that instead? I do need to get lucky to win this game though. I don't know.
>JD: AEEILNR 9L ARE +18 400
#note Jesse told me his rack after the game, and it is an interesting position for him. I rather like ER 7L here, as it blocks bingo lines, makes fishing hard for me, and keeps decent counters to threatening, high-scoring plays I might make.
>whatnoloan: DEILOTT 8L DOLT +40 390
>JD: AEEILNW F11 ANEW +19 419
>whatnoloan: DEIKT B12 KID +25 415
#note Tracked correctly, then didn't look at my tracking again and remembered him having EIL. (I thought he had AEL.) Given his actual tiles, KITE is correct.
>JD: EIL A13 LIE +15 434
#note A small time penalty made the final score 428-415 in Jesse's favor.
