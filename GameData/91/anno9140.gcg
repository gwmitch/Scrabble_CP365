#note enormous mistake; next time look harder. L10 DUO is easy to find. ULU is an overreaction to his last move. (-20.5)

#note ok.. WHAT THE HELL do i do here, especially after DAG.... i play ridiculous sometimes; clearly ABOMA is a good move if i see it; maybe i should just do N6 AB and try destroying the board... i don't know. (-1)

#note i immediately saw CERA(MA)L when i simmed this. 2I RECAP is one point better. the problem is during the game i had less than one minute left here and I spent most of it trying to go out with an overlapping play at E10. F8 LACkER, LACiER or LACERs would have also tied but i think I thought it would be too little so i didn't really look there. i need to play faster and less badly. (-6)

#note amazingly i have been given another shot to win but missed the two plays here. i saw l(Y)R(I)C about a couple minutes later as i was staring at the board. blah. (-10)
