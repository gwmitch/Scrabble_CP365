>Geoff: EIKOTUV 8H OUTVIE +20 20
#note Spent two minutes figuring out where to place this. And....after 2000 iterations or so, 8G, 8C, 8D and 8E are all ahead of it. We're talking a point of equity here, but still, I'm trying to reconstruct why I thought 8H was right. 8H appears to be the weakest defensively...
>Wally: EM 9H EM +16 16
>Geoff: BDFGKPY M5 GYB.D +17 37
#note Considered FYKED# until I remembered the D was #. But then saw GYBED, which I thought was better than G9 GYP. Quack agrees with me, and plus, I think it defends against the bingo rack suggested by his EM play.
>Wally: AEILPRT K6 LI.ETRAP +76 92
>Geoff: EFKNOOP 12H KEN.F +34 71
#note Almost OPGEFOK#....
>Wally: IQ 13G QI +27 119
>Geoff: HNOOPSU H12 ..NO +24 95
#note UNHOOPS#, I noted (wasn't 100% on it). Took a while on this one too, 16:00 left on clock when I hit it. Thought of N1 PHONO but thought it was too impatient. Quackle loves 14H POH, setup, yeah...but he's more likely than Q realizes to have an S and burn me on that. I agree 7E OUPH (2.5 better) would have done fine.
>Wally: EN 13K .EN +15 134
>Geoff: ?HJOPSU I7 J..P +23 118
#note Oh, please float me a D or an R in the right spot...rejected both SHOP and JUS for reasons I don't now agree with. Unclear what I'm waiting for here. Too afraid of either closing off the board (though JUMP does that) or giving him triple lane access since he's fishing. I don't like burning the blank for JOUSt, though. 
>Wally: OSX 14L SOX +28 162
>Geoff: ?HINOSU 15M HUN +33 151
#note Saw SHUN for 47 there, but decided to hold my S. Looking at this board now, that seems wrong. Quack says SHUN's about 8-10 better.
>Wally: BI 14F BI. +22 184
>Geoff: ?HIORSW 15D WHOS. +31 182
#note SHOWRING got blocked...now I really need to open things some way, I figured. I saw J10 HON, Quack's choice, but that opens nothing.
>Wally: AADORUZ L5 AA +11 195
>Geoff: ?AADIRT D12 DRA. +16 198
#note I'm under 8:00 now, I think, and Wally's playing pretty fast. Very rare I get rushed, but I was becoming aware that time was getting important. And I'm pretty sure Wally's sitting on something good by now. Quackle likes N7 AD, which seems awful if it backfires (Wally bingos from O1, I don't bingo back with ADIRT? plus two). 
>Wally: EE 13C E.E +6 201
>Geoff: ??AEGIT B9 mEGAhIT +69 267
#note ERE, what's he doing there...two blanks won't help with the time trouble....B8 CAGIEST is what I should have played, but B8 MEGAHIT is what I did play. First time in the tourney I felt any pressure - heart racing, brain whirring, found it hard to think clearly. Made the play with 4:32 left and 36 tiles in the bag. Had to hope he wouldn't hit me back down the A column.
>Wally: ACL J4 LAC +26 227
>Geoff: CDEIOTV A5 VOICED +40 307
#note Shocked that he didn't or couldn't play on the A column - half expected a bingo there in reply. Needless to say, VOICED went down in a hurry.
>Wally: DGILNRR 10A ..N +4 231
>Geoff: NORTUUY 4E UNTRU.Y +11 318
#note Quackle likes D5 RUNOUT or C5 OUTRUN, but given his fishing I wanted to block as many bingos as I can. Though, come to think of it, RUNOUT does that as well as UNTRULY (which does create new lanes through the U and N). Yeah, RUNOUT, okay. Was low on time and just glad to get rid of this crap.
>Wally: AAG H1 AGA. +15 246
>Geoff: EEORRWZ F2 ZO.ER +36 354
>Wally: DFI G9 FID +23 269
>Geoff: ELMORRW 2H .OR +6 360
#note All the choices are 100% now, and this is much worse equity-wise, but I didn't know it at the time and decided to play it safe, try to block the bingo lanes and leave one in the bag.
>Wally: S 6A .S +4 273
>Geoff: ELLMORW C3 MOWER +25 385
>Wally: AEIISTT N2 TATES +30 303
>Geoff: LL 10F L. +4 389
>Wally: II 10I .I. +7 310
>Geoff: L 3M L. +4 393
#note Finished with 10 seconds left. Optimal endgame 19 points better.
>Geoff:  (I) +2 395
