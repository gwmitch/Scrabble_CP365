>Orry_Swift: ORUVW 8H VROUW +30 30
>Ryan_Fischer: FILOSSV M4 VIOLS +21 21
#note I guess F(R)IVOL is a bit better considering it doesn't telegraph my other S and then I have 2 and 2 hooks.
>Orry_Swift: IKN 6J KIN. +18 48
>Ryan_Fischer: FILLRSS I7 F.ILL +13 34
>Orry_Swift: ADIMO H11 AMIDO +35 83
>Ryan_Fischer: OORSSTT 13G R.SOTTOS +70 104
#note Well, that was fortunate.
>Orry_Swift: AEGIR 11E REG..IA +32 115
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEINT 12K TENIA +23 127
#note Not A(V)E, no.  But A(N)E(W) is much better.  I guess this is just way too aggressive.
>Orry_Swift: ?DEENPT F5 rEPENT.D +64 179
#note Best.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEGHN 4J HEA.E +22 149
#note This turn is where I lost control of the game.  I really didn't like GHEE.  It's not even close anyway.  12A HANGE(D) 32 is 2nd.  GE(IS)HA is first, but a bit risky.  My play is 3rd, but with so many hooks, it's so unnecessary.
>Orry_Swift: AIJOR O4 RIOJA +52 231
#note I should note I rolled the dice here 'cause he drew 7 so he could have random drek.  He'd've had RIOJ(A) for 36 anyway.  Still, not a good gambit.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGHNRT N10 HE..T +32 181
>Orry_Swift: AUW 5C WAU. +12 243
#note He finally slows down a bit...
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEGMNR 8A BARGE. +33 214
#note BEAM kills row 3.  No.
>Orry_Swift: FUX B7 F.UX +30 273
>Ryan_Fischer: AEMNOSY D1 YEOM.N +30 244
#note SAMOYE(D) is a play I will someday make.  4C OY, again, kills a lane.  I have to risk it with YEOM(A)N, which Orry said he liked.  Maybe there's something better, and sure, I could be convinced.
>Orry_Swift: DDE 1A EDD. +27 300
>Ryan_Fischer: AILPQST 10D QA. +14 258
#note Champ says 15L QIS 31.  I think that's too much.  I may be wrong.

#note Well, I think I did okay for being double-blanked against a 2k player.  Lessons learned though.
