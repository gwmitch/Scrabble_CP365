#note He says "I've never seen nar-cee-ein before, but I hope it takes an S'.
>Matt_Canik: EIIMQSZ 14A QI +30 91
#note Only 5 Is left unseen, I'm holding a second one after this. A bit of a gamble, but I have good odds. 
>Jerry_Scheiten: IT 15A IT +44 205
#note FML
>Matt_Canik: EIMPSVZ J7 V.MP +17 108
#note Although I have MEZE for 35 or MAIZE for 36, I need to clean off the rack. This actually sims the best, too. 
>Jerry_Scheiten: ABW 7M WAB +24 229
>Matt_Canik: EGIOSYZ F11 OY.Z +36 144
#note Though I wanted to use the Y for VAMPY, I need to take the points here and keep the board open. Opening this 2x2 like holding that S is nice. This again sims best.

#note Not a big fan of MAUNDERS, handing him more points with that S. 
>Jerry_Scheiten: AFNO 3B FANO. +16 305
>Matt_Canik: DEGOORT D11 OG.ED +24 262
#note ORGO(NE) scores more and has a nicer leave, but I want to keep the lanes through the F and A open. 
>Jerry_Scheiten: EIKLOST B3 .OLKIEST +77 382
#note goddamnit
>Matt_Canik: BEIORTY A7 BY +40 302
#note Fairly consonant-heavy pool, I prefer holding my E here. 
>Jerry_Scheiten: ?CNSTUU 2F .NCTUoUS +61 443
#note He's coffeehousing here, says 'well I guess we can try this'. When I challenge, he says 'uhhh, I mean I guess that looks like what I put down'. I'm just being a grump because I lost the game and the challenge, but the coffeehousing probably shouldn't have happened. 
>Matt_Canik: EIORRRT -  +0 302
#note And after pulling RR into my leave of EIORT, I kinda have no choice but to challenge. 
>Jerry_Scheiten: HOT 3L THO +24 467
>Matt_Canik: EIORRRT M5 R...R +9 311
#note I figure this doesn't actually block too many potential bingoes from the M. 
>Jerry_Scheiten: DEOO L8 .OOED +18 485
#note Blocking (E)XTERIOR.

>Jerry_Scheiten: AF K11 FA +23 508
>Matt_Canik: ?AEIRRT 1L RATE +25 369
#note Adding insult to injury, I pull the blank as the last tile out of the bag. 
>Jerry_Scheiten: EGIIU J12 GIE +11 519
>Matt_Canik: ?IR 15H RIn +10 379
#note He sits there for about three minutes before GIE, I'm furious at this point, seriously considering just getting out of my chair and leaving. 

I don't know what I could have done differently this game. Every play I made simmed tops (aside from challenging), but after the challenge I was already down 443-302 on a closed board. I think I can officially call this one unwinnable.
