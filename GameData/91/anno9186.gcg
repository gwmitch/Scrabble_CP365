#note Right spot, wrong word. BAH(t). 2nd again. 
>Mark_Fidler: DEIRV 10F VERID +28 60
#note I didn't like this word, but I thought there were 4 words in DEIRV and I could only think of three, so I figured it must be good. Bleh. (I really don't like to challenge)
>Matt_Canik: ADHMORS C5 HAM +23 120
#note Jeez, I'm just playing awful this game. (R)AMROD is 36, DASH(I) and ROSH(I) are also a lot. Bah.

>Matt_Canik: BCILOPR 1M COB +29 303
#note Aside from the D in the 13 row, there aren't many bingo lines here and the C is good for bingoing above all else. I decide to dump it for something better at parallels. 
>Mark_Fidler: ALS O8 .....ALS +51 312
>Mark_Fidler: ALS --  -51 261
>Matt_Canik: EEILLPR O8 .....ILE +51 354

#note narcose one spot over is 4 more. 
>Matt_Canik: AEILRRT N14 AR +10 384
#note Looking at the pool, there's a good chance he has another bingo. That can't happen if I want to win this game. 
>Mark_Fidler: OY C12 .OY +16 353
>Matt_Canik: EILNRST 1A .NLET +6 390
#note INERTIAE and INERTIAL 1A are still available in the bag, I don't see anything through that Y. 
>Mark_Fidler: AEILNRT B13 LAR +18 371
>Matt_Canik: EIRS F1 SIRE +12 402
#note I miscounted like three plays in this game, we end up with 419-368 somehow. Overall I feel like I played ok, but not stellarly like in some of my past games. I made mistakes (INTO over DINO, the phoney, and (QUANT)ILE over PERILLE(D)), in addition to not challenging verid (that's three phoneys I've allowed in 4 games, if you're counting). Bleh. At least I won.
