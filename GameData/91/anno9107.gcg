>Jim_Burlant: GGNOTVX 8G GOX +22 22
#note Debated between GOX or VOX.  As much as keeping the V sucks,  my personal prefefernce is that keeping 2 G's is even worse.  Q disagrees.
>Jan_Cardia: BIR 9H RIB +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: GHINRTV -HV +0 22
#note Sim agrees - right call to exchange.  Sim agrees, this particular exchange is best.
>Jan_Cardia: EFI 10F FIE +17 35
>Jim_Burlant: CGINRTY 10J YIN +29 51
#note Uh, yuck.  Not exactly what I had in mind when drawing 2 to GINRT.  This is best, as anything else gives up too many points on the scoreboard.  Q likes one other choice:  BY J9.  Not sure I like that - what if I don't draw an E or S?
>Jan_Cardia: AEEW 11C AWEE +19 54
>Jim_Burlant: CGLPRTV -GLPV +0 51
#note What do you do if you whiff on CLAPT?  CLAPT is definitely the play, though it only wins 43%.  Exchanging wins 40 and concedes 7 equity.  
>Jan_Cardia: AGIO L8 GO.IA +16 70
>Jim_Burlant: CEEHORT C6 OCHRE.TE +84 135
>Jim_Burlant: CEEHORT --  -84 51
#note What can I say?  Since her play of GONIA blocked my intended bingo of TROCHEE, the Cartoon Devil got over my shoulder and convinced me that this was legitimate.  Jan held and took a while before deciding to challenge.  The best play here is 12B CHORE or 12A COHERE.  Q says both plays are identically strong.  In any event, anything is certainly better than OCHREATE for 0.
>Jan_Cardia: AENV 12A VANE +34 104
>Jim_Burlant: CEEHORT A10 CO.ERT +33 84
#note I kept looking at making ANT backhooks and WET never occurred to me, so I thought she'd blocked my bingo.  I suck.
>Jan_Cardia: AIMQU 12F UMIAQ +23 127
>Jim_Burlant: EFHLORU 8L .ULF +24 108
#note Well, now that my brain has stopped farting, I start making decent plays again.  Either this or C9 FL(ANE)EUR are best, and both win 32$.
>Jan_Cardia: ?EEIPRS N7 S.EEPIeR +72 199
#note Best bingo for Jan is M3 PERIQUES.  Courtesy of my own bumbling I'm now down at 10% winning chances or thereabouts.
>Jim_Burlant: AEHORSZ C8 HAZ..S +38 146
#note I like this play a lot more than Quackle does.  I saw its choice, IZAR H12 and felt that this board would be dead very quickly if I put that down.  S is otherwise useless on this board, so I had no qualms with sacrificing it to both score 38 and open up more lines.
>Jan_Cardia: BIJ D7 JIB +23 222
>Jim_Burlant: DEEORST E2 TEREDOS +81 227
#note Q likes another choice I didn't look for by a slim amount:  TETRODES 15A 80.  Perhaps I have a fighting chance if I put that down.  This sowed the seeds of my demise.
>Jan_Cardia: ?CDIILT 5E .LICITeD +70 292
>Jim_Burlant: EENORUW M13 WOE +22 249
#note Now I start sacrificing equity to keep the board open;  the problem with Quackle's preferred choice of B9 WO is that, while it does score 31l it kills one  of the most promising lines on this board with TTT still unseen.  
>Jan_Cardia: ADDT 3B DAT.D +14 306
>Jim_Burlant: EMNORUY 4K YOU +22 271
#note This does well statically but gives up way too much on the scoreboard.  MONEY!
>Jan_Cardia: GLU H12 .GLU +15 321
>Jim_Burlant: EKMNORV 3J KERN +29 300
#note Throwing in the towel, as this seriously limits bingo opportunities.
>Jan_Cardia: NO B9 NO +25 346
#note Annotation ends at thios point - final score 340 - 401.  To say I STEE'd this one up is an insult to STEES everywhere.
