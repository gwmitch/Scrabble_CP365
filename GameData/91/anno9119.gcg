>Geoff: AFNOQSW 8G FAWN +20 20
#note Q likes exchanging a point or two better, keeping ANS or NOS. Yeah, OQS is wretched.
>Darrell: ?AEIMRV K6 MIsAVER +82 82
>Geoff: CIOQRST 7F QI +18 38
#note Close in my mind between QI and 13I QIS for 34. The duck likes QIS by 4.
>Darrell: DDEOS 13I DOSED +30 112
>Geoff: CEORSTT 9A COTTERS +68 106
>Darrell: IX 10B XI +52 164
#note I know it's Darrell, nope, nope, not going to get rattled, just keep playing...
>Geoff: ?ILOUUW L4 ULU +10 116
#note L4 ULU beats J4 ULU by a couple of points, despite scoring a point less. I do like the board after L4 a little better for me, but I'm not sure it's for the same reason Quackle favors L4 (which isn't clear from the short sim). M9 WOULD is about even with L4 ULU.
>Darrell: DEINNP 11C PINNED +23 187
>Geoff: ?INOOWZ A6 ZOI. +45 161
#note Ooh, didn't think of OZONIC. Thought of PALEOZOIC, ANTHOZOIC and SAPROZOIC for later use - the others are HELIOZOIC, PROTOZOIC and SPOROZOIC. 
>Darrell: ALLOT 5A ALLOT +26 213
>Geoff: ?AEMNOW M2 WOMANEd +85 246
#note Have a note here saying WOMANED/ADWOMEN#. Uh, ADWOMEN is ours, big guy. Glad that didn't cost me.
>Darrell: BEIOT 12A BOITE +32 245
>Geoff: AEHNORT 14D ANOTHER +71 317
>Darrell: EJT 4D JET +40 285
>Geoff: BDEGKNR 15A KERB +46 363
>Darrell: ARV 15I VAR +16 301
>Geoff: ADEGINU 10J U.EA +9 372
#note I wanted to keep ING for a shot at one of the two Ys for (VAR)YING. This also messed with the N column, though not that many bingos would fit there...keeping three consonants in this pool isn't best, though. 
>Darrell: AEFGGOY 7M .F +5 306
>Geoff: ADGILNP 8M .AP +17 389
#note Put Darrell on one S for sim purposes, though he likely has both of them. This still keeps my shot at VARYING alive if he can't bingo from the P, which seems difficult given the pool. DAP sims best on equity, though B4 G(L)AD wins slightly on win pct. for reasons unclear to me.
>Darrell: AEGIRSS 3E GASSIER +66 372
>Geoff: DGIILNY 15I ...YING +54 443
#note The Y saves my bacon. CUSHY in reply is 51 but not enough to catch me.
>Darrell: CEGHOUY H1 CU.HY +51 423
