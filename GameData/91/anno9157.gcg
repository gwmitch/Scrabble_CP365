#note SWIZ probably better
>Andrew_Fisher: ADIPRRT 3A DRAP +41 278
#note Sadly no U for the bingo. DRAP or DRIP are best here, but is it just a case of counting up which of A and I are more likely? I suffered from my choice
>Naween_Fernando: AEILRST 10F RETAILS +72 290
>Andrew_Fisher: ?IIIRTY -IIY +0 278
#note A few meagre scores available but I am convinced that changing is best

#note Ooh, there's also POSTRIOT
>Naween_Fernando: ABDEHRT 14J BR.TH +32 322
#note DRAWBAR B2 is a lovely, adventurous play. BATHED scores well from L1 but I think Naween is right to score in the south-east and make a couple of openings
>Andrew_Fisher: ?FIKNOU 15H UFO +22 374
#note I like my play for the next-move prospects; higher scores are KUFI in the same spot, or POUK/POUF 8L

>Andrew_Fisher: ENOQRWY 3I Q. +21 497
#note I failed to see QWERTY 12H here, but QI sims equally well (because of the Y retention for N6, etc)
