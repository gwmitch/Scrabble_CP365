>Richard_Spence: ELO 8H OLE +6 6
>Matt_Canik: AAEKNSY 7H YANK +22 22
#note I see ALKY, keeping AENS, but I don't like leaving OLEA/OLEO open for a 2x2, especially after he opens with a play like OLE. YANK sims best, and I play it here because a bingo ending in S opens up a 3x3 line for me. Yummy. 
>Richard_Spence: AEENSST L3 ENTASES +78 84
>Matt_Canik: AAEEGNS 9I AGE. +14 36
#note I look long and hard here, I chewed 8 minutes of clock on the first two turns. But this is a great play in my mind. Sims best, too. 
>Richard_Spence: M 9H M.... +16 100
#note Richard plays scared against me. Or maybe he just plays tight boards all the time. 
>Matt_Canik: AEIINSZ 5H SANI.IZE +84 120
#note Last time I gave him an E in a 3x3 line, he hit SPa(E)TZLE 3x3 212. Fingers crossed!
>Richard_Spence: ABIMOT H1 IAMB. +36 136
#note Initially set down TOMB(S). Given only those 6 tiles, I prefer BIOM(E) O1. 
>Matt_Canik: ACEOPRV O1 PROV. +42 162
#note Edges out CORVEE. 
>Richard_Spence: FO M2 OF +20 156
>Matt_Canik: ACENOOP G1 APO +17 179
#note Sims second to POO(N) J2. But what do I know about poon? I'm bingoboy!
>Richard_Spence: ORU K1 OUR +9 165
>Matt_Canik: CEFJNOX 8L .XON +33 212
#note EXEC, duh.

>Matt_Canik: EGIRRTW 6K R.T +12 275
#note Quackle wants me to play (JO)G holding EIRRTW, I'm guessing with the 5 unseen Es I have a good shot at TOWERIER N7. But I don't need to try and fish here, I need to hold my lead, keep the board closed, and get this game over with.

>Matt_Canik: BEGIRSW A11 WISER +36 311
#note BEWIG. Awful. 
>Richard_Spence: ?DEELNT 15A .ELENTeD +77 321
#note BEWIG doesn't give up any bingoes except r(O)NDELET N7. Good to know I almost blew this game. (R)oNDELET scores 3 more this turn. 
>Matt_Canik: ?BGILRV D12 VIB. +18 329
>Richard_Spence: AH 14F AH +15 336
>Matt_Canik: ?CGGLLR 13C G.LL +13 342
#note Quackle sims this the best. Although it empties the bag, it gives me the best possible combination of letters to work with. He's also down below 2 minutes on clock. 
>Richard_Spence: AIRTTUU O8 .UTRIA +7 343
#note Richard actually has a win here- TRI(TOM)A 3C 20. 
>Matt_Canik: ?CEEGIR 11I CRInGE. +18 360
#note Hell of a game, I tried to lose it for a little but I think GILL was a nice little play that won the game for me.
