>Geoff: AGLNOOU 8H LANUGO +18 18
#note Thought about 8D GUANO and (maybe not enough) LANUGO at 8G instead. GUANO is about even with 8H, and 8G LANUGO is 3 points better. I had a hunch it might be right to play the defensive placement there - should have listened to it.
>Nawapadol: FIX 9G FIX +44 44
>Geoff: ?AAEOOT 9K TOEA +13 31
#note Dang it, overlooked the FIX/T hook, despite taking a while on the position. Not sure I would have gotten to O(N)TO 20 keeping AAE? anyway. Bingo percentage after ONTO is slightly better than TOEA according to the sim, surprisingly. (That may assume more of an open board than will actually happen, though I don't think either play is really some huge tell.)
>Nawapadol: AERTW 7I WATER +43 87
>Geoff: ?ADEINO 10A cODEINA +66 97
#note ADONISE#...Put down DIOxANE first but decided I liked cODEINA better. It's fine.
>Nawapadol: LPY N5 PLY +22 109
>Geoff: ?DFGHNS E9 F.ND +16 113
#note Q likes 10M SH 30, then FID or DIF where I played. I can see the argument for keeping the N, sure, but surprised it's 5-6 points better to keep it. I thought about SH, but perhaps not enough. DFGN? didn't seem like what I wanted to play through.
>Nawapadol: DIKY A8 DI.KY +48 157
>Geoff: ?BGHINS 13C BaSHING +89 202
>Nawapadol: MV G12 V.M +8 165
>Geoff: EEEIOOR O1 OORIE +22 224
#note Whoa, boy. Nawapadol's VIM is a threat, and I've got this. Decided OORIE would help me more than trying to block the spot would. I ran the sim inferring an S for the opponent. OORIE still beats the best block, H13 NOO, by a good bit. Though he probably has a good leave with that S, too.
>Nawapadol: ACEGINS 15D CEASING +98 263
>Geoff: AEEEHJT B6 JEE +29 253
>Nawapadol: EPRU D6 RUPE. +15 278
>Geoff: AEHNOST 10N HO +26 279
#note 10:45 left on my clock now. I've been trying to be more deliberate and rush less, but I'm not always successful at that. Though this position was pretty straightforward.

>Geoff: AAENSTZ J5 AZ.. +33 312
>Nawapadol: VW 5I V.W +18 312
>Geoff: AAEINST 11I TAENIAS +72 384
>Nawapadol: EIQRU E2 QUIRE +30 342
>Geoff: BCEOOST 1A COOTS +39 423
#note Note: Nawapadol overdrew here, with one in the bag. I turned over LRT and threw back the T. Not sure whether it was correct or how much it mattered - he's got no place for MEDULLAR/MURALLED or anything else. Quackle likes (RE)C for 11 here; COOTS is second. I can't lose by now anyway.
>Nawapadol: ADLLMRU 12I ALMUD +33 375
#note Nice play...DAM(PLY), which I didn't see either, would have been even snazzier. ALMUD was misscored as 34.
