>Jim_Burlant: AAALMNW 8G MAW +16 16
#note Best play, which I didn't see, is LAWMAN 8D.  Not seeing that is one thing. Can someone please explain to me how I didn't see AWA?  This is terrible.
>Gregg_Speicher: BOUY 9D BUOY +24 24
>Jim_Burlant: AAILLNT 7I ALLIANT +65 81
#note Why play a real word when I can play a phony one? :-)  The legit bingo here is LANITAL.  I whiffed on it.  Best play is J6 LANITAL 70.
>Gregg_Speicher: GOOU O5 OU.GO +18 42
>Jim_Burlant: AISTTUZ L4 ZIT. +26 107
#note Thought long and hard about whether or not to take the pionts with ZITS.  What swayed me was that, with the rack killing U, UTA could really become a disaster and that keepng the S would help out.  Quackle says it's style preference as to which play is better - this sims within 2 points of ZITS and nothing beyond ZITS or ZITI is worth considering.
>Gregg_Speicher: GUV 6G GUV +16 58
>Jim_Burlant: ADIPSTU K5 PU.I +22 129
#note Another close call.  K5 TULADIS scores 38, but the sim prefers this by roughly 2-1/2 points.

#note Best, winning 94%.

#note Best bingo.
>Gregg_Speicher: AEEILRS A8 EARLIES. +77 214
>Jim_Burlant: BDMRRTV -BDMRV +0 298
#note The only play that seemed like it would have been worth putting down would have been a 5 at F11 , if one existed.  Since there was none, I didn't think it was worth it to play through this crap.   Q says eitther this play or M10 BIRD are the two best options, and at over 1100 2-ply iterations, BIRD and this play are still toggling back and forth for best win percentage honors.  THis play has the highest valuation of any choice.
>Gregg_Speicher: DFO 10C FO.D +23 237
>Jim_Burlant: ?CIOQRT F14 Q. +31 329
#note All 5-tile exchanges should go so well.  Also - shocking given the pool that I didn't draw at least 2 E's.   Where are the E's?
>Gregg_Speicher: BOX N2 BOX +48 285
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEIORT B2 COInTER +72 401
#note Not that he can win this game, but I wanted to make sure he had no comebacks at A1.  Q says I should just take the extra 8 points with B2 NOTICER.
