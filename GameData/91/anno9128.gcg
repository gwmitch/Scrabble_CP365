#note AIRBASE# too, I just learned.

#note I'm not good at seeing parallel plays with ST yet.  WAFT is the big play here, and it's probably worth taking the points despite the subpar leave.  WRIT is definitely better than all the other alternatives, though.
>Kwak#: EEIKNTV 10B KNIVE +34 56
#note Much like WIFE and WIVE in TWL, KNIFE and KNIVE# are both verbs in Collins.

>Dave: DENORTU H7 D.UTERON +60 189
#note Gives him a juicy spot, but it must be best.
>Kwak#: DGNPSWZ B2 P.Z +28 158
#note I am poz the Duck would have hit me with something hard if it had a vowel.
>Dave: AACFGOT I13 FAG +22 211
#note This is definitely the right play because it takes out the dangerous S spot and is not too far behind the other best plays in equity.
>Kwak#: DGNSUVW G11 WUD +25 183
#note DOF is a South African slang adjective meaning "stupid" and does not take an S.
>Dave: ACEILOT 4H ALOETIC +76 287
#note Giving him a huge spot at H1 by playing this on row 2 is not worth one extra point.
>Kwak#: DGHNSVY M3 D.NGHY +36 219
>Dave: EEMNOTX 8L M.XO +57 344
#note It's fun when I get to score with a # word I just learned!  Second highest scoring play was EXEEM# E1, a verb which is also spelled EXEME#.
>Kwak#: AEHNSUV O1 HAUSEN +41 260
#note Ah, wasn't expecting that to take an S.
>Dave: EEIILNT L8 .ELINITE +72 416
#note MENILITE# gets added to the list of three TWL anagrams for this rack.  It would have been a slightly better play for a sneaky reason.

#note This is a fine play in this situation, but if the endgame were closer and I had more Collins word knowledge, DOOB# E5 would be even better.
>Kwak#: AAGMOSS 7H .A.OG.A +34 382
#note Wow!  Phil Kretschman had told me about the front hook for MELINITE just the previous day, but I didn't think it would go down here.  I didn't know the main word.  Thanks for the lesson, Duck!
>Dave: ?EELNOU M12 NOEL +19 511
#note Best.  Blocks SIMS.
