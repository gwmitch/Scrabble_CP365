#note I'd played Bradley online several times before this, and I know that he's godawful on closed boards. Quackle wants me to fish either the F or the B (and I guess with 11 unseen Es, there's a decent chance I pull HENBITS or FISHNET or ABSINTHE), but I hate that. I like my play.

#note I really have no idea what this was all about. Bradley seems to get in a mode where he just plays the first thing he sees as soon as he sees it, perhaps in an attempt to time rush opponents? But time isn't a weakness for me.

#note I really don't know what I was thinking here. Against a player like Bradley on a board like this, I do my best to NEVER open up scoring lanes, to force them to score 12 and open the lane so I can pounce on it for 30 and kill the board again. I guess I just got overcautious. Whatever the rationale, this play sucks.

#note Shuts down the last good spot to score on this board. I won't win by much, but I'll win now.

>Matt_Canik: EEEGNNO M6 NO +8 300
#note Wow, BRASSIERE is valid. No clue. 
I don't really know why I played this. I just need to score points, I guess. I'm pretty sure he's going to hit a cheap J play with WOG next turn, and this stops it from being anything more than JO.

#note surprise

>Bradley_Robbins: IO N2 OI +10 290
#note Just keep the board closed long enough, eventually they'll blow it.

>Bradley_Robbins: DEEGIUW J2 WE +15 305
>Matt_Canik: AOR 1H ORA +15 360
#note I played really well at the beginning, had room to slip up at the end because I shut down the board. That's the beautiful thing about defense, even if you pull five vowels or six consonants your opponent can't score enough to catch up before you work your way out of it.
