#note Duck like F10 FIELD better, sets up the S, hides away the open E.

#note Duck likes it.  But it makes it into a defense heavy game now.

#note Duck likes 12A FOY.  There are 5 moves better than this exchange.  I just didn't like making an 18 point play that gave up a 30 point play if I'm going to keep IU or blow my S.
>Wayne: JN D12 J.N +20 75
#note evil play.
>me: ?GIPSTY 14A PYI. +20 100
#note Duck likes H4 TYPIC or H5 PYIC or exch. G!!!  Didn't know PISTY? was a great leave.  My play is less than 4 points back, but it feels like I'm giving away points.

>me: ?GLRSTU -GLU +0 100
#note 7C SU(Q).  Really?  Close behind is 11E (TI)LT.  Didn't like that option.  I thought exchanging would be for sure better.  The best exchange is exch. GLRTU.

#note Duck likes my bingo a little better than H6 RE(C)ANT.

>me: AEGOTVX L5 VOX +26 194
#note I have trouble with turns like these.  Overcooked my thought process and went with something about 7.5 points back of L3 GAVOT.

#note Bird likes sNOTTIER better.  Not significantly though.

>me: ACEEELO O8 .LAE +6 334
#note Row 3 doesn't look particularly threatening to me with the unseen tile pool, but bingos off the B could happen.  I block with BALE, but then spot BALEFIRE could happen, so BLAE it is.  Duck hates it.  C3 O(UN)CE is its pick.
>Wayne: AEGN A6 GANE. +27 296
>me: ACEEOOU H1 COOE. +27 361
#note COOEE is a bit scary.  FOLKSIER or something could sink me.  Champ player likes F4 UTA for the win percentage, keeping COOEE for after the bag is emptied.
