#note KIWI vs. MEW or MEWL, tough call.

#note Quackle likes IOLITE a couple of points better at J2.
>Conrad: ADEETT J3 TEATED +18 111
#note Nice six, wasn't 100% sure on it and might have challenged it in 10-point.

>Conrad: AEITW 8J .AWTIE +42 153
>Geoff: ?CEFOOP D4 FOP +27 120
#note And there's the first bingo whiff of the tourney, dang it. FOO(T)PaCE. I didn't play FOP at B12 or D12 because even with the blank, I didn't want to create a new S hook with four of them out and Conrad sure to have one. That's more conservative than I normally play, though. D12 FOP does better than the bingo, and my play only a point or two worse.

#note Correctly decided that UNPANELS# was Collins. This is the only TWL bingo.
>Conrad: AFIR D12 FAIR +31 235
>Geoff: AADLNOS 15D .ADON +18 294
#note Okay, some really weird sim results here. 1A DOBLA 27, in a short sim, is easily best, and 17 points (!) better than RADON. Okay, it scores 9 more. (R)ADON blocks a triple lane. In sim details, RADON is one point better on defense, but 8 better on offense, including 23% vs. 13% bingo chances. ALS vs. ANS as leaves...when comparing exchanges keeping ALS vs. ANS here, ANS wins by 6. I'd guess some of the equity diff comes from triple-triples which in reality wouldn't happen, since a human isn't as likely to ignore the spot. 
>Conrad: ENRS 14A RES.N +23 258
>Geoff: AGLRRSX L2 GRA. +10 304
#note Figured the X could wait; I wanted to kill row 1. Though 13K GALAX or 13M RAX do some lane-injuring too and score more. G(O)X 2B 22 sims best, about 4 ahead of GRAN. ALRRS to this pool looks nasty, though...
>Conrad: IQ G1 QI +15 273
>Geoff: ADLORSX A12 DO.R +21 325
#note Getting low on time again (2:05 at this point). Saw VERY, YIRR, YURT etc. on A column and decided I had to block it. With an X play to come I could probably withstand whatever happens with the Q hotspot. The sim doesn't like what I did; M13 LOX is on top in both equity and win pct. This is a part of the game I really struggle with sometimes. 
>Conrad: EGILRSV 2L .IV. +16 289
>Geoff: AEGLSUX K8 .SEXUAL +28 353
#note I'm on drugs. Though I suppose any play wins, and I didn't have time to check my tracking so I wanted to make sure I blocked the possibility of mistracking and allowing an out bingo.
