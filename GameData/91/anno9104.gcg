#note i didn't want to play EVILER and open up a bingo line on the bottom. also i didn't realize it at the time, but dave was very close to monster 111 point bingo starting at G3 (one off of REGAINS or something similar)

#note what a great play. it's not good, but there's no way i'm going to challenge a plausible looking wiegand play that's only 19 points. now he's got a bingo line where there wasn't one before.

#note i didn't take the threat of AXIS/AXES at J3 very seriously for some reason, which i could easily block with LUMP. i somehow decided this area was more threatening, which is completely stupid. a perfect example of why my spread always sucks.
