#note Carl's the kind of player who can really only score if you hand him the points on a platter. Knowing that, I want to kill this board, I am confident in my ability to beat him on a closed board. A(LEX)IA is cooler, but sims about 1% lower.

>Matt_Canik: ADEGORR 6I GO..R +8 231
#note On a board like this, he won't really be scoring more than like 10ppt. What I'm doing is holding my slim lead while preparing my rack to hit him with a bingo as soon as he opens it.

>Matt_Canik: EENORSY D11 OYER +34 298
#note Immediately after I made the play, I know it shoulda been YO/YID/OD (or YE). OYER sets up the soar spot and the s hook, I shouldn't open stuff up. 
>Carl_Davis: IV 13B VI.. +16 250
#note I guess he's got another I. 

>Matt_Canik: AEMNSUV 15A VAUS +33 331

#note Clearly, not this one!
Another well-played game by me, kept solid control of the board and stopped him from doing anything productive most of the game. I probably should have played MAIDENS, but that sets up a potential 5-overlap in a consonant-heavy pool. Idk. I still won, that's most important.
