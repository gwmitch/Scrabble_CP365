#note CLEFS is a very different but equally good way of playing it.

>Dave: ?AEIOOS C11 OO.E +13 158
#note With the case S and blank, I thought aggression was called for here, instead of taking the points with OSE 11D.  If only I had known what she was holding.
>Rebecca: ADIQ 15A QADI +60 235
>Dave: ?ADEFIS 11E FA +40 198
#note Clearly better than bingoing.
>Rebecca: HOT 13H THO +23 258
>Dave: ?DEINSU M5 SUEDINg +63 261
#note I was somewhat unlucky that I did not have any high scoring bingos.  I spent quite a bit of time looking on row 14, but nothing fits.  This is the best bingo, as all of the B column plays give too much back to her.

>Rebecca: BEIL 15G BILE +23 299
>Dave: EINPSTY 13M YIP +29 326
#note I don't think YE 14B is called for here, as I want to keep scoring enough that I can win even if I don't draw into a bingo.  My play also takes away a couple of good scoring spots from her.

>Rebecca: EILNORT B5 RETINOL +63 382
#note Rebecca misscored this as 69.  Neither of us caught the error.  This was very significant as I had no chance of catching her at the mistaken score, and it might have contributed to me not working as hard at this endgame as I should have.
>Dave: EGKNSTU A6 NUKES +53 400
#note Calculate, calculate, calculate!  I reasoned that the S wasn't going to do me much extra good on the next turn, so it was better to take the points with it now.  This is nonsense.  When you're down to the endgame, finding the right continuation is not about general principles; it's about concrete calculation.  Either NUKE or NUKES wins if I draw the A.  However, if I draw the E, NUKE wins and NUKES only ties.  Of course, I would have had to catch her scoring error to win in any of those lines.
>Rebecca: ACEEIJU C1 JUICE +30 412
#note Well, it turns out that with what was in the bag, I was a goner, scoring error or not.
