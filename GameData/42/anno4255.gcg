#note Stylistic choice? There are arguments for AFOOT, but I wouldn't play it (and I didn't).

#note Missed ANOPIA. Kinda tunnelled on the X for some reason, being stupid is usually a bad strategy. Wonder how this would've worked out if I had made the right play.
>whatnocone: ?AEISSY L1 mYAISES +86 174
#note Noah spelled it wrong. I read the play as mYIASES, which is good. I was so sure I read it as mYIASES, that it took 'til Quackling the game later that Quackle figured out Noah had spelled it wrong. I knew the correct spelling, but somehow thought that is what he played. Noah just spelled it wrong. I'm kind of at a loss for words. If I'd read it as mYAISES, I would've instachallenged, but I DIDN'T FREAKING READ IT THAT WAY. Now watch how it worked out.

#note Noah: Ugh. I was doing fine, later he played SATINET, and... I've never had to walk out of a scrabble game before this, but I spent a good while venting in the bathroom after this. Luckily, I was able to come back with a smile on my face.
