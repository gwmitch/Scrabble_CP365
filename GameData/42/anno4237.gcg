#note This could be the first time I've ever kept a W.  It just seemed to work well with the leave, and it guarded against the possibility of an all 1-pointer non-bingo rack.

#note And it also makes bingos score better.  27 out of 40 blanks, and I could still end up only a game over .500!

#note Racks like these are more tolerable with a lead.  When you're trying to catch up, they're deadly.  Have you ever noticed that?
