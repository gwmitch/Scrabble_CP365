>Jerry_Lerman: DEGILTY 8G EDGILY +30 30
#note He wasn't sure, but figured if it was challenged off and then I played an I, he would get GELIDITY.
>Noah: AANOOOU -AOOOU +0 0
>Jerry_Lerman: DHOW L4 HOWD. +30 60
>Noah: AEEENQT K3 QAT +33 33
>Jerry_Lerman: EINT M3 TINE +22 82
>Noah: AEEEINR I7 A.EE +7 40
#note Quackle prefers ALEE, I guess to not set up the X. It's favorite is EERIE N5, which is alright. I probably prefer ALEE to EERIE.
>Jerry_Lerman: DFU J10 FUD +28 110

>Noah: ?AFLMPR F11 PALM +22 178
#note Jerry pointed out to me after the game that I missed (REV)AMP. I also missed FARM O9. 
>Jerry_Lerman: AIRZ 14B ZIRA. +32 176
>Noah: ?AFLORV D7 FLAVORe. +78 256
#note I missed the (PING)O hook here, for FLAVOuR, FLAVORy, and FLAVORs.
>Jerry_Lerman: CEHKOR O10 CHOKER +55 231
#note Which costs me some points.
>Noah: AEMNORX J5 AX +30 286
#note Missing MOXA, and the PINGO hook again for AXONE.
>Jerry_Lerman: ABDS 15A BADS +53 284
#note He hits me again for the PINGO miss.
>Noah: EEMNOOR K11 MENO +23 309
#note Quackle likes REVERE by a bit. I guess since MOON plays next turn, and score is tough on this board.
>Jerry_Lerman: LOT H10 ...OLT +27 311
>Noah: ?EINORW C2 bROWNIE +78 387
#note I don't really agree with Quackle's 3% favorite of WO J14. Taking the points now seems better to me.

>Noah: BEEOOSU A1 SE.O +18 405
#note I thought of GOBOES, but wasn't sure of it, and didn't want it to cost me the game. I missed BOGUS though.
