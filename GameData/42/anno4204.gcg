>Matthew: ACFIPRU 8G PFUI +18 18
#note Quackle prefers FUCI. ACR is better than APR in superleaves, but I guess the U hotspot costs equity? (-1.0)
>Glenn_M.: DOV J6 VO.D +16 16
>Matthew: AACELNR G8 .ARLANCE +64 82

>Matthew: DHINORT 12G .NTHROID +76 158
#note This is sort of a crossed wire between ANTHOID and ANTHERID, except I was pretty sure it was phony when I played it. In hindsight, this was a bad time to try a phony, since Glenn probably needs to challenge an iffy-looking bingo at this point. But I got lucky and it stayed on.
>Glenn_M.: AEFS N10 FA.ES +34 86
>Matthew: AGIMNOP 5I MOPING +31 189
#note Ah, I didn't see O8 OGAM. But I liked MOPING for taking away the VOID hooks and blocking bingos down column O. This is probably why it leads in win%.
>Glenn_M.: EITY 14J YETI. +16 102
>Matthew: AKLNOVX 7H OX. +40 229
#note I kind of hated passing up KLAXON. Oh well.
>Glenn_M.: EGLOT N2 TOG.LE +20 122
>Matthew: AEKLNNV O7 NAVEL +33 262
#note This is basically tied with KELVIN, which I didn't know was good.
>Glenn_M.: AAH 11J AAH +26 148
>Matthew: DIJKNTU L4 J.NK +30 292
#note I wanted to shut down this lane, but JINK spends both my big tiles on one 30-point play. I can see why Quackle's choices of M7 KID and M1 JUT sim better: they save a big tile for next turn. (-4.8)
>Glenn_M.: IIM M3 MI.I +34 182
>Matthew: ADIRTUW O1 DAW +31 323
>Glenn_M.: BEE F9 BEE +17 199
>Matthew: AIIRSTU 9J .UI +4 327
#note I don't know URATIC and I missed 8L SURA and 13F UNAI. My play doesn't really bingo often enough. (-3.9)
>Glenn_M.: IOZ D12 ZOI. +30 229
>Matthew: AEINRST E4 RETINAS +72 399
>Glenn_M.: DER D3 RED +15 244
>Matthew: ?EEOQSU 8A QUEE. +45 444
#note 6B QUOTE, which I thought was blocked. Scores nearly as much and doesn't open as many lanes. (-0.9)
>Glenn_M.: W 13C W. +10 254
>Matthew: ?LOOSSY B4 jOYO.S +16 460
#note I dunno, I just made a play...
>Glenn_M.: ?EGRTTU A8 .UiTTER +18 272
#note Glenn miscounted the S's played.
