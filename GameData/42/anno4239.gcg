#note Tough decision, this flirts with winning the sim.  Thought is, I wanted another S hook, I wanted to save the Y for the HONKY spot.  YEW might be a bit better in the long run despite that.

#note I didn't want to kill the S hook I just created and hated parting with the Y.  I think that's why I played it here.

#note Happy accident.  LAMISTE(R) also barely fits.  One of those good looking racks with no 7s.  MEATIL(Y) also of note.
