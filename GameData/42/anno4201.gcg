>Michael_Bassett: BEGOOR 8D BOOGER +24 24
>Jason: FILOOUW 7H WOFUL +20 20
#note Or WOOF, 9B. Any equity loss is probably made up for by the challenge potential.
>Michael_Bassett: ?ADEPST 9H DEPArTS +72 96
#note Three double-doubles for 90. Bowman jokingly asked after the game if the blank was an N.
>Jason: FIIJORZ L2 FRIJO. +32 52
#note The stupidest thing about this loss? It was sandwiched between a 93-point win over Bowman and an 87-point win over Viebranz. Ah, Scrabble...
>Michael_Bassett: DOO 5J DO.O +24 120
>Jason: DEILNPZ 9C ZIP +32 84
#note I think I maybe played too fast. Duck likes ZIN(S) or ZIP(S); I don't. This is in the second tier with (A)DZ or (S)PLINE. I like SPLINED or SPINDLE here. (-3)
>Michael_Bassett: ABDE 10B BADE +35 155
#note This is 41 if I play ZIN(S).
>Jason: CDEEHLN 11D EDH +35 119
#note Didn't know CHE(F)ED. (-9)
>Michael_Bassett: ?AAEGSU 4D SAUsAGE +69 224
#note Would've been a sweet fit (and 14 more) two rows down.
>Jason: CELNOTV 12A VOLT +38 157
#note Concerned, but not panicking yet. Only a bingo down and two S's out.
>Michael_Bassett: EIL A12 .ILE +21 245
>Jason: CEIINNX 5C NIX +40 197
>Michael_Bassett: ACEN 6B CANE +27 272
>Jason: CEINRWY N9 .CREWY +40 237
#note Missed WI(F)EY. Damn fives. (-4)
>Michael_Bassett: AQST N2 QATS +39 311
#note Where is that panic button? Let's dust off the acronym. TSAHTMIAO!
>Jason: INNTUVY O1 YIN +31 268
#note Maybe VIN(E)Y* at 12K? I'd just seen him challenge LORINER game before, though ... I didn't know whether to phony or not. Plus, look at how I'm scoring. I never thought to phony ... I was scoring fine with real words!
>Michael_Bassett: EH O12 HE +23 334
#note Another play originally scored by tripling the H instead of doubling it. Home-board advantage...
>Jason: ANRTTUV H1 NAV.R +24 292
#note OK, so I've lost <16 equity so far and I'm down 66 (I think it's 69). What's wrong with this picture? 0-for-2 on getting him to challenge goofy fives. VAT at 6G, which I saw, is slightly preferred. NRTU's not a bad leave with AAEEEIIII out. (A)VAUNT leads valuation. (-7)
>Michael_Bassett: GINO 2D GONI. +8 342
#note OK, if he draws three or four vowels (possible given the pool), maybe I can still outrun him?
>Jason: IMMRTTU K7 .M.MI +18 310
#note Took a long time, but never saw a play I liked. 0-for-3 on getting him to take the challenge bait (and Chuck Armstrong challenged when Knappster played it in Battle Creek in March!). I agree with Q's top two picks: MUT(ED) and (A)TRIUM, K9. Saw the first (why didn't I play it?), not the second. Again, too lured into the "maybe he'll challenge, maybe I can outrun him" mode. (-20, to MUTT, 12F, which is stupid) 
>Michael_Bassett: AL O12 ..AL +26 368
#note Precisely why hopes of outrunning are stupid.
>Jason: ENRTTTU J3 T.. +4 314
#note Going for the S for ENTRUST at 12F. Figured he wouldn't block that. PUT at J9 leads in valuation. Doesn't look like anything wins under perfect play from him. (-30)
>Michael_Bassett: AEEIRSU 1A SERA +19 387
>Jason: EINRTTU J9 .UTTER +20 334
#note PUT instead is four better. But this won $10 for Best Summer Word and my spread at this point was meaningless. Take that, Duck! :P
>Michael_Bassett: EIKU 14A .IKE +16 403
>Jason: IN 15C IN +12 346
#note And that, boys and girls, is how you lose to a sub-1000 player despite losing <16 equity through eight turns.
>Jason:  (U) +2 348
