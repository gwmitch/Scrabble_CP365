>Jason: ALOQTTY 8G QAT +24 24
#note "An easy decision," I commented as I plopped this down quickly.
>Heather_Steffy: BFI 9F FIB +25 25
>Jason: ?DLOOTY 10H YOD +19 43
#note Considered ODYL in this spot. Duck prefers that, OLD or OLDY. (-3)
>Heather_Steffy: AENOT 11D ATONE +19 44
#note I believe this play may have earned an eyebrow-arch.
>Jason: ?EELOPT 7I EELPOuT +63 106
#note Gah! I wanted to play a newly learned bingo this weekend and missed my chance here: TOEPL(A)tE. Scores seven more and doesn't open the triple; probably my losing play. In the recount, Heather said: "And you played this strange word I've never seen before but wasn't going to challenge." (-12)
>Heather_Steffy: AHLO O4 LOA.H +27 71
>Jason: ADMNTUV 12B VUM +24 130
#note Less concerned about the front hook given that four of the eight O's have been played. Sims well clear of the field.
>Heather_Steffy: GIINORT 6C RIOTING +64 135
#note Whew. Bullet dodged. She didn't know the anagram (and, given her later plays, thinks she forgot about the VUM hook).
>Jason: AADDNNT 13C NADA +19 149
#note It's way too late in the game to have ?SSSS unseen with her pulling seven. Got to get me some of that. Sims best.
>Heather_Steffy: AEILZ C1 LAZIE. +30 165
#note "Ugh," I think. "Can't you have an unbalanced rack? You know, like the one I'm looking at."
>Jason: DFGNNST 2B F.NG +16 165
#note Maybe I should've thought this through more. This barely blocks row 1 plays. (Somehow FANGS here sims better ... I know that there's a decent chance the S will come back to me, but huh?) F(I)ND or F(O)ND leaves the superior GNST leave. But this worked out nicely.
>Heather_Steffy: EIW 1A WI.E +32 197
>Jason: DGIOSTY K1 STODGI.Y +76 241
#note "OK," I think after I pull a decent, balanced post-bingo rack. "The worst is over now, I've weathered the storm. Now we take control..."
>Heather_Steffy: ?AOPRRS 14F SPARROw +66 263
#note "oh, crap." (Yeah, column A bingos score 87. And I wonder why she didn't play it at 12H for 79. This was the play that switched the result ... scored as 64 in the game, corrected to 66 in the recount.)
>Jason: CDEERTW 1K .CREW +39 280
#note Losing play No. 2. Overthought it. Saw WEED, but felt, even with five E's out, she couldn't hit the spot well enough and blocking up top was more urgent. Nope, genius. WEED's the clear play. Looks so simple now. (-9)
>Heather_Steffy: BEEEEER 15H BEER +36 299
#note Heather's exact rack, revealed to me during the recount. She played the R to stop 15L plays, which I don't consider dangerous anyway, esp. since she has five of the six unplayed E's. (Notice she has bubkis if I play WEED.)
>Jason: DEJNTUU 5E JUTE +46 326
#note The 11-10 C-V ratio, plus the desire to play off to get some of the OSSX unseen (three E's out; I didn't know she had them all, thought one might come back), necessitates playing this and not JUT. Duck agrees.
>Heather_Steffy: EX 2M EX +38 337
#note Grrr...! Her scores starting with turn 4: 64, 30, 32, 64/66, 36, 38. Normally a 1200s player will take his/her foot off the gas at some point. I just needed one turn in the 20s and I would've felt better/been safe/probably would've won. But she never let up.
>Jason: DHIKLNU 15C HUNK +19 345
#note This is probably the spot for a phony, given the (too much) respect Heather gives me. Problem was, by the time I remembered who I was playing and thought to phony, I'd taken a good five minutes and had sighed/shaken my head way too much that HULK(EN)* for 54 would've been transparent. Plus, given the circumstance, she probably would've challenged. Probably took like 10 minutes here. I like the Duck's idea of the counter-intuitive LIND(EN) here ... would like to think I'd have played it if I'd seen it. Also considered KIN(D) at 4H, HUN or HID at K10. They're the rest of Duck's top five here. Felt like I had to play off at least four ... need to give myself every chance to hit some of the OSS left. (-6)
>Heather_Steffy: EEISV 12H SIEVE +29 366
#note As Heather was playing this, I overdrew, perhaps subconsciously wanting to give myself as many chances as possible to draw an S or O (and had stupidly co-mingled). Of my CDILMNSU (I drew CMNSU), she looked at CIM and decided to give herself the M.
>Jason: CDILNSU 3I CL.UD +30 375
#note Best. I saw her six tiles and thought this game might be stealable if she didn't know MOIRA/O(VUM).
>Heather_Steffy: AAIMOR 10C AMIR +26 392
#note She has three wins: MOIRA (think she said she didn't know it, blanked on the VUM hook anyway), AIR(SCREW) and this. So, yeah. The "other" two are really hard to see. Great board vision from Heather here.
>Jason: INS M10 INS +12 387
#note If I'd known she had 392 and not 390, I'd have played INS/(LOATH)S* to try to tie. Or, better yet, I(D)S at 4J hoping she misses O(C)A/A(IDS). But I thought this won by one. Damn. So disheartening to think I'd stolen this one and to have it snatched back in the recount.
>Jason:  (AO) +4 391
