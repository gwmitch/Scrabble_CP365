>Carl: AAADIOR -AAO +0 0
#note AROID 8H sims behind the worthier exchanges. In the post-mortem, Dave lamented that the D would have given him a spiffy bingo. Exch AAIO sims a little better.
>Dave_J: AILLMOV 8D VILLA +24 24
>Carl: ADEINRS H8 .RANEIDS +80 80
#note Lucky draw.
>Dave_J: DIMOWXY E4 MYXO.D +38 62
>Carl: ?ADGLRT 11B DARTLi.G +68 148
#note I preferred the more defensive placement seeing as I was taking a fairly decisve lead.
>Dave_J: EIIOPTW 4C WI.P +22 84
#note WIPE D1 is best.
>Carl: ABEOSWY 12A YOWE +40 188
>Dave_J: EINORTT 15H .NOTTIER +77 161
#note Karma for my draw to ARANEIDS.
>Carl: ABCIISU 14H .UB +24 212
#note A big miss. SUBACID 14B wins the sim decisively.
>Dave_J: CFNRTUZ A12 .UTZ +48 209
>Carl: ACEIIIS 6D I.IA +13 225
>Dave_J: ACFLNNR 5G FRANC +25 234
#note Either this or FAWN C10. With all those Es unseen, ACLNR is a fine leave.
>Carl: BCEIIOS K5 .ICISBEO +78 303
>Dave_J: AIKLNPS N8 SKIPLAN. +82 316
#note The good doctor isn't going to let me win that easily.
>Carl: AANNOUV 13C AVO +30 333
#note I spent a long time on this play, and it does win the sim. None of the options are very palatable.
>Dave_J: EGGHOST L1 HOGGS +39 355
#note No place for the bingo. HOGGS is much bolder than GOT O5, the sim winner.
>Carl: AEMNNUU 13L UN.U +8 341
#note A dreadful draw. Either here or the 3F placement.
>Dave_J: EEOORRT O3 TORERO +27 382
>Carl: AADEEMN N1 ANADEM +47 388
#note It's scary to empty the bag with what's unseen, especially keeping an E with 5 more unseen. But the points justify it.
>Dave_J: ?EEEFJQ H1 QuEE. +42 424
#note We both found the best sequence, but it wasn't particularly involved.
