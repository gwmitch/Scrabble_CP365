>Evans: AAEEINR 8G AE +4 4
#note Meh. Quackle seems to think trading AE is a point better than playing it.
>Kate: CDOUWYZ 7E DOZY +53 53
#note I like COZY, keeping the D -- especially with the DYE hook possibility.
>Evans: AEILNRS 9A NAILERS +72 76
#note Thought about ISLANDER, felt like living dangerously.
>Kate: CDOQRUW A5 CROW. +30 83
#note Looks right. QU- could do fun stuff on this board...
>Evans: EIILMOX B9 .XILE +28 104
#note Missing OXIM and COMIX, both of which keep cleaner leaves... this play kinda sucks.
>Kate: ?DQRSUU C13 SUQ +28 111
#note Yep, looks about right...
>Evans: EIMORTV E1 VOMITE. +26 130
#note Cool position. VIM 6D scores and balances quite nicely (27, EORT), but I fear that on this board I might have trouble getting a bingo down. I opted to open things up instead. I like this play, especially when both blanks are unseen and I can dig into the bag -- also it looks a tad better defensively than MOTIVED in the same spot.
>Kate: ?DEGORU 15A RO.UE +45 156
#note Bingos that Kate correctly passed up 'cuz she's smart like that: ROUGHED, TRUDGEON, DROGUES, OUTRAGED. OK, so you could actually make a case for ROUGHED since it scores 70 at 6H. But with the board a little more open than it was two turns ago, I think it's worth it to keep the blank and bingo later. Dead heat in the sim.
>Evans: AHLNRRT 11B .NTHRAL +20 150
#note Yeah, ALTHORN is better. Not sure how I missed that. HARLOT and RHINAL in the upper-right corner also look better...
>Kate: ?ADGINU 4E .GUANIDs +70 226
#note DAUTING and DAUBING at 12G score a tad more.
>Evans: AADNRTW 1E .AWARD +39 189
#note Close call between this and VANWARD. If I had known VANWARD, I'd probably have played it.
>Kate: ?BEEMNO 2D M.B +23 249
#note Ooh, these are hard bingos. Kate has GOMBEEN 12G, BODEMENT K2, and ENTOMBED 5C (!!!).
>Evans: DGINOPT 15A .....TING +57 246
#note yay!
>Kate: ?EENOTT K4 .ETONaTE +82 331
#note yuck.
>Evans: ADEIOPT J8 OPIATED +77 323
#note yay!
>Kate: IJKLOOV 8J ..LOOK +33 364
#note Grrr... Kate is mean and she phonies me. As far as valid plays go, OVOLI 2J is really cool -- it keeps a JK leave and opens the possibility of a 94-point JAKE play next turn.
>Evans: BCEGHPS 6D P.H +29 352
#note This is where I fail to consider the synergy of the CEHPS leave, instead getting greedy and taking more points. BEG in the same spot is probably the best play here.
>Kate: AAEIIJV 13G JIV. +26 390
#note There are tons of consonants in the pool (10:5 ratio unseen to her), so taking the points and keeping AAEI is a good idea. Little does she know what's actually in that bag...
>Evans: BCEFGIS D8 F.I.E +24 376
#note I have the opposite problem -- tons of consonants on my rack but tons of vowels unseen. This play makes perfect sense from my vantage point... but again, the bag has some surprises in store for us both.
>Kate: AAEIRSU O6 UA.ARI +10 400
#note I'm having trouble parsing what Quackle's trying to tell me as I solve this pre-endgame. There are five plays that win 100 percent if the time, apparently -- AIM 3C, AI 14E, UNAI I3, AI 6H, AI 3H and AA 14E. I'm not sure what to make of this. I guess it's okay to empty the bag, since my rack is clunky enough that she can go out first anyway, but what's wrong with UAKARI? It seems to be the easiest way to go out soon, since it keeps ES and only draws 2, and what's the worst I can do for a comeback? BYES/UAKARIS seems like the worst-case scenario, and even that's not going to beat her. UAKARI seems fine to me.
>Evans: BCFGNSY 3C GY. +25 401
#note SYNC N11 is one point better -- it leaves two spots to play off the F and the B next turn. Or I can take FOB N7 first (that's the best F-B play), and then play SYNC next turn. That's also worth one extra point. In any event, I'm not winning this game.
>Kate: EEES M8 .E +3 403
#note Cool blocking play! This is actually best, since it keeps JIVES/SEE to score a ton when she goes out next turn.
>Evans: BCFNS 13A F..S +16 417
#note Or FIB, or FUB. They all purge 19 points of spread... whatever.
>Kate: EES K13 SEE +21 424
>Kate:  (BCN) +14 438
