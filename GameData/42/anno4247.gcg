>Chuck_Armstrong: ACIOTXY 8H TOXIC +34 34
#note Probably preferable to OXY. There were three of us there at that point, so it was Jeff Fiszbein's turn to watch.
>Jason: EIKLMVW K5 KEV.L +24 24
#note Duck likes VIEW, 7F. It's kinda close. Considered it.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?AINTTY 8H .....ITY +60 94
#note Chuck didn't think I'd go for ANTi(TOXIC)ITY*. Jeff Fiszbein then went to look up all the TOXICITY extensions (there are seven).
>Jason: ACEIMOW 9E MIAOW +26 50
#note BTW, the TOXICITY extensions are OTO-, CYTO-, NEURO-, PHOTO-, PHYTO-, HEPATO- and NEPHRO-. (Jeff knew six of the seven. Damn pharmacists...)
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?AGINRT O1 GyNIATR. +86 180
>Jason: CDEOPRT F6 DEP.CTOR +73 123
#note Gotta keep the C's from Chuck...
>Chuck_Armstrong: EFNNORU E1 FENURON +75 255
#note As Chuck put down NURON, I expected LINURON or MONURON. When FENURON came down, I held. Jeff (who had just been looking at the pesticide list ... he studies oddly, in case you haven't noticed) entered the room a couple seconds later and said: "Ooh, FENURON, I just saw that one!" Laughing, I said: "I accept." Said Chuck, also laughing: "Way to go, Jeff! You might've cost me a challenge!" Said Jeff: "Oh, he wasn't going to challenge." (Hey, I reserve the right to not be intimidated!)
>Jason: AINNORZ 1E .RIZ +48 171
#note Missed ZONAR(y). Almost as bad as a bingo miss.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ABDEHUW G5 WAB +23 278
#note Jeff commented on the BUW combo ... Chuck joked that he could fish off one tile for BUTTHEAD. Judging by his next play, too, this had to be his rack.
>Jason: ADGINNO 13C ADO.NING +74 245
#note Jeff thought this was too ballsy. I agree, but I'm behind. DONATING gives less back and makes the board more open for bingos, though. I dunno. They sim closely. If I assume Chuck has HUED, DONATING probably wins sim. But as you see, this blocked a bingo, so it worked out.
>Chuck_Armstrong: DEHLSSU H11 SH.ED +39 317
#note Chuck lamented TOS* not being good, preventing SLUSHED at 10H (Jeff knew at the time, me after the game). (T)HUDLESS* was the closest this to a bingo Chuck saw ... yeah, there's nothing there.
>Jason: EEEHIPR H4 PEH +24 269
#note Probably a bad play into a vowel-heavy pool, but I need to bank on luck; let's hope he has the vowels and I duck them all. Q likes HEE(D), D10. So do I, in hindsight.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AELMSUV M7 M.SVALUE +84 401
>Jason: AAEEIRR 2H AERIE +18 287
#note Ah yes, the "you've hung with this legend long enough, but know that you are not winning this game" sequence. A la my game with Edley in NYC. I know it too well...
>Chuck_Armstrong: EGOY 2B YOG.E +26 427
>Jason: ADEIRTU B2 .AUD +8 295
#note I should've -D hooked MISVALUE. No idea why I didn't. Another bad error.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AOU 11D AU.O. +10 437
>Jason: EINRSST A5 INSERTS +74 369
#note Jeff looked at my scoresheet after this play. "Hey, you've almost caught up!" he said. "Yeah, but the problem is there's only six in the bag," I said. "That's not your only problem," Chuck said. (Ruh-roh.)
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?AEEFLL 15A FELLAtE. +86 523
#note I see what Chuck meant. Final tally: 19 plays (seven bingos), 940 points, average a tick under 50 per play, even with my two big errors. Watch out for this guy in Dayton, peeps. He knows a weird word or two. :)
>Chuck_Armstrong:  (BIJOQT) +48 571
