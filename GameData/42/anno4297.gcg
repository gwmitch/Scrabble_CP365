>Alex_Fiszbein: DEEGHIV 8D VEGIE +26 26
#note Alex played HIVED, then picked it up to play this, allowing me to know his whole rack. Was surprised he'd play for six fewer to keep DH instead of EG, but it's only two points behind staticly.
>Jason: AEIQRTU 7G QAT +46 46
#note Annoyed that I didn't get any of the letters to bingo through, I miss the 64-point double-double. (-21)
>Alex_Fiszbein: IWZ 6H WIZ +43 69
>Jason: ?EHIMRU E2 RHEUMI.s +74 120
#note RHEUMIER, but no RHEUMIES*. Duck prefers the placement by three points over E6, given Alex's DH leave. I'm glad, given what happens next.
>Alex_Fiszbein: ADEHINS D8 .ANISHED +85 154
#note At E6, I force him to find DANISHES or SHANDIES.
>Jason: EEGNOSY 15D .OGEY +30 150
#note Didn't know ERYNGOES. Ugh. This is turning into a comedy of errors.
>Alex_Fiszbein: EJO H12 JOE. +22 176
>Jason: ?AEENOS 3C EN.AlOES +72 222
#note Only one playable through the H. AEON at C11 is intriguing. This sims best by a few points, though.
>Alex_Fiszbein: EIMPR 4H PRIME +35 211
>Jason: CFLNNUU 11B CU.F +18 240
#note Ooh, UNFU(R)L at 2A! Yikes, three 20+ errors (this one taking my win chances from 2/3 to 1/2) in five turns.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AEILNST 13G T.ENAILS +70 281
#note Yeah, he played off fives and had ENTAILS. That definitely disappointed me.
>Jason: BDLNNSU L11 BL.ND +20 260
#note I don't like Duck's pick of BUND, but then again, maybe I was too focused on getting bingo no. 3 down. (-4)
>Alex_Fiszbein: GIOTU J9 OUTI.G +13 294
>Jason: BDINSTU 6C DU.B +15 275
#note Fitting, since I missed BUNDIST and DUSTBIN. Almost a "50% error". (-54)
>Alex_Fiszbein: AALX 5K AXAL +39 333
>Jason: DINNOST 15L .INT +15 290
#note I took a long time here ... did not see anything close to palatable. Maybe should've gone with Duck's NOD at 2A. (-7)
>Alex_Fiszbein: ARV M2 VAR. +24 357
>Jason: DNORSTT H1 TR.. +18 308
#note Didn't know the O hook to PRIMER. Either way, it's looking grim.
>Alex_Fiszbein: ACKR B11 .RACK +26 383
>Jason: DLNOPST 2C DO.P +28 336
#note CP really likes POD at 2A ... gives me about a 20% chance, it says. (-16)
>Alex_Fiszbein: FOOR 1A ROOF +47 430
>Jason: ELNOSTW 8J TOWELS +47 383
#note ST(E)W at 4C is seven better.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AEIY 7L AYE +26 456
>Jason: N M7 ..N +7 390
#note Frustrating loss. I'm not sure whether I'm better off knowing I'm the one to blame for it.
>Jason:  (I) +2 392
