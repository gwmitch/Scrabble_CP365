>Steve_Krieger: ?EIMNPS H3 IMPENdS +76 76
#note Steve chuckled looking at his opening rack. "Who am I playing?" he asked and put this down. Call me pwned.
>Jason: AADEEIP I4 AIDE +20 20
#note Duck likes IDEA, I2. Debated between the two. Can't remember why I chose this one. (-1)
>Steve_Krieger: AK G3 KA +27 103
>Jason: AABEFHP J5 AH +33 53
#note Did I forget the -E hook to NE? Only explanation I can find for not playing HEAP. (-4)
>Steve_Krieger: EJLRU K1 JUREL +36 139
>Jason: ABEEEFP 9D BEEF. +14 67
#note Wanted to start over and open. Duck likes P(R)EFAB, which I didn't know. (-3)
>Steve_Krieger: ADIQ 10B QAID +41 180
>Jason: AEGLPRU 1K .ULEP +45 112
#note Or JUGAL.
>Steve_Krieger: INOV 8A VINO +30 210
>Jason: AGNOORY C10 .GONY +18 130
#note Knew I was probably losing equity with this play, but I just didn't like YO at 2F. I wanted turnover and open-age. Maybe accomplish it with O(R)ANGY at 3J instead? Sims likes YO, but I still don't like it. (-7)
>Steve_Krieger: MOTT 12B M.TTO +14 224
#note My comeback begins.
>Jason: ABEIORZ 2E AZO +39 169
#note Yeah, now I close the -S hook because I don't have one. It all makes sense to me, even though Quackle probably thinks I'm on crack. Sims best.
>Steve_Krieger: GITW 3B TWIG +19 243
#note "Starting to slip away from me," Steve said, which I found a little odd.
>Jason: BEINRSW 1A BREWS +46 215
#note OK, claimed momentum.
>Steve_Krieger: AEEINTV 13F ENATIVE +64 307
>Steve_Krieger: AEEINTV --  -64 243
#note Steve saw the real one shortly after. One of those "not-buts" where the brain didn't quite get to the "not X, but Y" part in time. Been there.
>Jason: CDEHIIN 13F INCH +16 231
#note So much for HIED or H(Y)ENIC. Got to assume Steve will find the real one. But, in addition to momentum, I know the ?SSX is all available. Sims better than INCH or IN at 11E, in part because Steve has no good play through the C.
>Steve_Krieger: AEEINTV 4A VIE +17 260
>Jason: DEIORUY H11 DE.OY +36 267
#note What's the name of the game? Turnover! Trying my best to will power tiles out of the bag, Edley-style. Duck likes DICEY. (-1)
>Steve_Krieger: NOO B12 .OON +24 284
#note OO draw on a three-tile pick. Maybe the worm has turned...
>Jason: EINRSUX 2N XI +40 307
#note "At this point, I thought the game was yours," Steve said in the post-mortem. "Yeah, so did I," I responded.
>Steve_Krieger: ADE D3 .DEA +26 310
>Jason: ENRRSTU 4K .R +4 311
#note Part of me wanted to stay on the turnover train, but I saw sevens (OLD PIANOS BECOME RIGHT) with every draw but F or U. Almost played RUT at F4 before remembering RAMA* was the phony I played on Lisa Odom at Arden. Duck prefers TRU(E)S or RUN(E)S at F6 by a decent margin. Maybe it's right. I really didn't know how to play this. (-10)
>Steve_Krieger: AEGORST M4 STORAGE +64 374
#note Naturally, he puts down GAROTES at M3 and picks it up to put down a play blocking my bingo. Oy.
>Jason: CENRSTU 7L C.U +5 316
#note Tried to find a win even if Steve pulled the blank, couldn't. CP says (R)U(TI)N wins almost half the time. That's hard to fathom. It doesn't win after my AA draw; I can show that. (-21)
>Steve_Krieger: ?FILRTU N10 FRUIT +45 419
>Jason: AAENRST O8 NATES +29 345
#note One worse than F5 plays like ENAT(E)S.
>Steve_Krieger: ?LL 11H .uLL +8 427
#note I think Steve could tell how frustrated I was and tried to make me feel better. "You definitely deserved to win more than me," he said. But, as often happens in Scrabble, "deserve's got nothing to do with it."
>Steve_Krieger:  (AR) +4 431
