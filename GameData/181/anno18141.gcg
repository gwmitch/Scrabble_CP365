#note Not thinking well here. FAINER should lead to a less volatile board in the future, which I want against Kolton, while having similar equity.

>Noah: EFNNOTV F6 F..VENT +23 47
#note Ugh, looked briefly for plays hooking V(EX) but didn't think of NEVE, which sets up my F nicely and is more defesive than this.

#note ROVE might be better to set up D(ROVE).

#note Didn't really consider it, but with a huge lead and Kolton playing MM and scale, AUxETIC is definitely an option. I'm not sure which play I would make now -- what about you?

>Noah: AEEIORU D1 OURIE +15 309
#note Very aggressive -- should definitely consider (L)OUIE and A(D)O(Z)E here. ADOZE blocks and scores better than anything else here. The leave isn't that great, but it's better than usual because of the vowel-light pool. LOUIE, on the other hand, blocks the L, which might not be that easy to block later, while opening a weak lane that is easier to block, all the while keeping a solid leave. Reducing variance and not playing OURIE seems right here, but I'm not sure between the two other plays.

>Noah: ?BDEORW M7 BOWeRED +100 494
#note The best think I could see to take out 3x3s was GOWD, and I was afraid that would lose a couple games like this does, and it's not nearly as good on spread which is very important in this last round of the tournament. RaWBO(N)ED wins 100%, but is a little worse on spread. I think this might actually be better, just because every point of spread is great here, and the losing chances after BOWeRED are tiny.
