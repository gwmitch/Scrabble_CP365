#player1 Mack_ Mack 
#player2 Joey_M. Joey M.
>Mack_: BEEITVY 8E BEVY +24 24
#note Chose this placement since the Y is harder to bingo to than the E. Quackle agrees in a short sim.
>Joey_M.: ?DEIORU E6 tU.EROID +70 70
>Mack_: EEFIIRT D1 FEIRIE +27 51
#note Also considered D4 FIE to go for a bingo since I am down. I ultimately chose this since it scores more and goes for the esses and remaining blank more. The two plays sim virtually equally.
>Joey_M.: ABFS 1A BAF.S +39 109
>Mack_: HMNRTVZ 3C M.RTH +28 79
#note I figured this placement of MIRTH kept open more lanes, which is desirable since I am losing. The two placements sim within half a percent of each other, along with 12D VIM, which I really don't understand at all.
>Joey_M.: AEEEIST 10A EATE.IES +62 171
>Mack_: DKNOTVZ A6 ZONK.D +60 139
>Joey_M.: AQT D12 QAT +49 220
>Mack_: IOTTUUV C13 TUI +16 155
#note I really had no idea what to do here. I missed the stylish (QI)VIUT, which definitely looks best here. I was debating between TUI and exchanging, and ultimately decided the 16 points was just worth it. I should probably have traded though, given that I am in an 80-point deficit.
>Joey_M.: ?DLNORS 11G RONDeLS +68 288
>Mack_: AOOTUVW 2G AVOW +23 178
#note At this point nothing even wins 1% of the time. This looks about as good as it will get for this turn.
>Joey_M.: AX 12G AX +38 326
>Mack_: GLORTUW M4 LUGWORT. +67 245
#note If I want any shot whatsoever at winning, I pretty much have to try this. I figured there was a good chance I could slip it by Joey, since LUGWORM, LUNGWORM, and LUNGWORT are good but no LUGWORT*.
>Joey_M.: AMN 8L M.AN +27 353
>Mack_: EGHLNOO F5 OH +26 271
#note This looks fine, but matters are still extremely bleak -- 1.3% to win in a short sim.
>Joey_M.: AEJP L1 JAPE +46 399
>Mack_: EEGLNOR J8 GOL.ENER +64 335
>Joey_M.: AGIIN 15H AI.ING +24 423
>Mack_: EEIILOT 1L .OLE +33 368
#note I thought about fishing for ELECTION and NONELITE, but that seems pointless as Joey will just block. I thus opted to play for spread with JOLE.
>Joey_M.: ACDNPSY N12 DAPS +22 445
>Mack_: CEIITU O7 I.CITE +13 381
#note The best endgame, as it forces Joey to take the lower scoring out of I1 CONY instead of 13L CYAN.
>Joey_M.: CNY I1 C.NY +10 455
>Joey_M.:  (U) +2 457
