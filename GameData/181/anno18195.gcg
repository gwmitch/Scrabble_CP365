>Evan: HOPQ 8G QOPH +36 36
#note First game of Vancouver 2014 and the first of my 9 straight wins to start it off. Prepare for some epic luckbox
>Chris: ?BILRTT H1 LIBReTT. +80 80
#note Told you to prepare hehe
>Evan: AEEKNT 3H .ETAKEN +28 64
>Chris: EEGHMOV L1 HO.E +30 110
#note This is the highest scoring option, but I didn't like it at the time as it keeps an ugly leave. 4D HOVER and N1 VENOM keep better leaves and MOKE in the same spot is also simming better (EGHV > EGMV), but I don't mind this for a lack of a better option.
>Evan: LRU 1L .URL +21 85
>Chris: ?AAGMOV K2 G.MA +21 131
#note This doesn't lead to the quickest bingo, but I like it since it scores the best and takes out the most scoring spots and the 2x2 lane. It's best in a short sim.
>Evan: AEIRU 9C AUREI +19 104
#note My luck came mostly from my opponents having rack like this versus me drawing spectacularly during the winning streak.
>Chris: ?ALMORV 8A OVA +20 151
#note I have no idea what I was thinking here - tilt from not finding a bingo after looking for a while, I guess...
>Evan: DEEOZ E7 ZE.OED +32 136
#note I kept looking to hit REZEROED after he played this
>Chris: ?ALMNRY A7 N.RMALlY +63 214
#note RANDoMLY B12 is 78
>Evan: DORU D11 DOUR +19 155
#note Strongly suspected that this was an A setup
>Chris: EEEFIOU F11 FEU +17 231
#note This, FETE J1, and a bunch of exchanges sim close here. I wanted to score a bit and at least prepare to block DOURA since i couldn't immediately.
>Evan: EILSVW K8 SWIVEL +43 198
#note Unless he kept an A here, I was pretty surprised to see this come down...
>Chris: EEIJNOX L12 XI +38 269
#note JETON F6 and especially JOINER C4 look better than XI because they shut down lanes at the top and leave the X to score with next turn. I was paranoid about the SWIVELS hook, but that isn't the easiest lane to hit anyway.
>Evan: CEGINRT 10H REC.TING +69 267
#note GENTRICE A5 gives less powerful snapbacks and is likely better despite not being as aggressive. 35% to win for that vs 30.7% for RECITING.
>Chris: EEIJNOT O5 JEEIN. +42 311
#note I played this in about a second. I saw what I missed about 3 seconds later. There are no words
>Evan: AFT N6 FAT +31 298
>Chris: DINOST 14D .OD +20 331
#note Don't have my last tile here. I was still worried about DOURA, so I decided to set up an S hook there instead since I at least had one.
>Evan: AY B10 YA +30 328
>Chris: DINOSST 15F SOD +21 352
#note Given that there was still an S out, i elected to block the spot (finally lol) this sims best.
>Evan: BOW -BOW +0 328
#note He exchanged at some point, since i have more turns, although my scoresheet is really messed up near the end so idk
>Chris: AAINNST 14H ANTS +22 374
#note VAN K11 fishes for bingoes and scores just 3 less, which improves both my win % and average spread over ANTS, but I think I was low on time
>Evan: BIOPW M13 BOW +26 354
>Chris: ACGIINS F4 INIA +17 391
>Evan: EIP 6H .IP +11 365
>Chris: CGS -  +0 391
#note He ended up with GESC and I got the 14 extra points. Apologies for the messed up order in the endgame hehe.. I did win but super sloppy after the first like 4 turns
>Evan: CEGS 5A GESC +7 372
#note Final score 405-365
>Evan:  (CGS) +12 384
