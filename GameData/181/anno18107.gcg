>Josh: ACINSTX D7 AX.NIC +46 86
#note X(E)NIC also looks good, not sure why I didn't play it.
>Emanuel: AE 10D .AE +19 52
>Josh: ADINRST C7 TA. +19 105
#note Oh dear

>Emanuel: ADIQ 5F QAID +32 186
>Josh: INPRSTT 11C T.P +20 179
#note I should play TIPS. Maybe even 6E PIT over this. I liked my leave too much and didn't realize QAID had blocked E1 as a lane.

>Josh: INPRRST A1 ....R +10 214
#note Should I burn my S this turn too? PIRNS seems like an OK idea...
>Emanuel: COSY K5 YO +16 236
>Josh: INOPRST L1 PINTO +25 239
#note I played this quickly hoping he would have to think hard about his next play. He had much less time than I did. In any case I should probably just drop the P at 7H. J9 OP looks good too.
>Emanuel: ?CORSTT 2H COTT.eRS +72 308
#note He was unsure of this so it took him a while to lay down. He's down to maybe 6 minutes at this point.
>Josh: AKLMNRS K5 ..LK +14 253
#note Probably not the right play in hindsight but I needed to play quickly so as to give him no time to think.
>Emanuel: AABEGNU O1 U.E +9 317
#note 1K A(P)NE was missed. Actual rack. He first laid down (S)UBA and took it off.
>Josh: ?ALMNRS L8 ALMNeRS +75 328
#note Lucky lucky draw here. This is what I needed. He's down to 4 minutes and counting.
>Emanuel: AAABGNU K11 ABA +19 336
#note First laid down GUA(R)ANA, which I would have held and probably released, then this.
>Josh: AEEFLNT 13I FL..E +24 352
#note M11 ELF looks good here. I don't need to bingo to win. But I'm time pressuring him, so I missed it. I would see ELF if I was giving myself time to think I hope.
>Emanuel: AGINU 10L .U +4 340
#note I had a partial AGN leave and since he played this rather quickly I imagined he had an I at least.
>Josh: ABEENTW M5 WEB +20 372
#note Now I needed to think, unfortunately. I should have seen WEB M5 and played it quickly. 
>Emanuel: ADEGINR 14C GRADINE +68 408
#note I had to laugh out loud at this familiar word. N4 DERAIGN is the right play. It's 88 points but a hard find.
>Josh: AEGHINT 15E GETA +29 401
#note But it turns out this worked out in his favor cause I had GAHNITE where he played GRADINE. I had enough time to solve this endgame but I didn't take it when I saw a sure win. 3I HAI(N)T is the best play.
>Emanuel: LOUV 11J V.. +6 414
#note -14 to H1 O(C)UL(I) or N6 LO
>Josh: HIN N6 HIN +31 432
>Josh:  (LOU) +6 438
