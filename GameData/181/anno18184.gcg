>Nigel_Richards: ?EFRUVV 5E V.V +18 86
>Victor_Chua: ADELOOW 7H OWL +15 93
#note 9B WOO is the best option i think. OWL gives a bad leave
>Nigel_Richards: ?DEFORU J6 F.UORiDE +71 157
>Victor_Chua: ADEEEOY D8 .EYED +26 119
#note 12G DEADEYE or D8 KAYOED/D7 OKAYED are much better then keyed.

DEADEYE wont block knitting though
>Nigel_Richards: GIINNTT 4B TIN +21 178
#note The magic fingers return! But knitting was blocked.
>Victor_Chua: AAEHINO C10 OHIA +27 146
>Nigel_Richards: DGINOOT B4 .OOTING +25 203
#note Quackle prefers DOF, keeping the nice leave, to TOOTING, but i have learned over time that the yolo approach is oftentimes better (Although maybe this is a bit TOO yolo.. LOOK AT WHAT IT OPENS UP! THE X AND Z ARE UNSEEN)
>Victor_Chua: ?ACEINO 12H CO.EINAs +76 222
#note Nigel magically knows Victor has a bingo on his rack and thus played tooting without fear!
>Nigel_Richards: DEEINRS 14H RESINED +84 287
#note MAGIC FINGERS FTW!!!
>Victor_Chua: BIORSTU H12 .U.B +24 246
#note BURRITOS was missed here
>Nigel_Richards: AAEEEGO A7 AGE +25 312
>Victor_Chua: IINORST O5 IRONIST. +71 317
>Nigel_Richards: ABEELOT N5 BOLETE +30 342
>Nigel_Richards: AAEGJMW (challenge) +5 347
#note Nigel probably played BOLETE over LOBATE just hoping for a challenge. And it did indeed happen.

Really shouldnt be challenging Nigel's moves in such a close game
>Victor_Chua: EFLPRUX E11 PELF +38 355
#note I think PELF may be better then 15L ULEX as it does keep the X for future scoring
>Nigel_Richards: AAEGJMW I9 JA +36 383
>Victor_Chua: CEIRUXZ 2G CRUX +36 391
#note Victor pretty much saw the opportunity to play CRUX and possibly follow up with a strong Z play
>Nigel_Richards: AEGMPTW B12 WEPT +28 411
#note Unfortunately for Victor, the +5 challenge cost him the game. Nigel calculated that he would win no matter what Victor did.
