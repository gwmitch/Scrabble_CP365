>Ricky_Purnomo: ?DHNORY 8D HYDRO +32 32
>Nigel_Richards: ABEEGQX E7 B.AGEE +24 24
#note Nigel : "Hmmm well Bhagee seems like the best move here"
Nigel plays down B-AGEE, says 24 and announces score.
After pressing clock,
Nigel : "Oh.... wait... what did I just play.."
Nigel : "OMG.. BYAGEE!! What on earth is THAT?"
Nigel : "Ah well, Ricky didnt challenge it anyway HAHA"

But yeah seriously, byagee is a phony.
>Ricky_Purnomo: ??BCNNT 12D B.NT +12 44
>Nigel_Richards: AEELQUX 10B QUA. +34 58
>Ricky_Purnomo: ??CILNO 13G INCLOse +75 119
#note Ooh Quackle prefers to play H11 Colin keeping 2 blanks! Might not be bad actually, but most ppl would just take the bingo.
>Nigel_Richards: EELNOWX 14K WOXEN +44 102
>Ricky_Purnomo: JLNNOTV 15H JOLT +39 158
>Nigel_Richards: AEELMOO O12 ME.O +27 129
#note I would opt for mono over meno but thats just me. Or atleast i said that until i realzed that there were just 2 Os left.
>Ricky_Purnomo: EFNNSUV F4 UNFE. +21 179
>Nigel_Richards: ACEEHLO 4D LO.CHE +30 159
>Ricky_Purnomo: ANPRSSV 13C VAS +29 208
>Ricky_Purnomo: ANPRSSV --  -29 179
#note Ricky : "Hmm seems like i should play VAS/BYAGEES here. If Nigel played Byagee, it must be valid!"

Nigel : "Nope"

Plenty of good options exist here like VARS/LOUCHER or VESPAS/HYDROS
>Nigel_Richards: AEGILST I2 EL.GIAST +75 234
>Ricky_Purnomo: ANPRSSV 2F PAR.V +24 203
>Nigel_Richards: AGITTUY 12K TIT +26 260
#note I would have preferred YU over TIT seeing the Z in the bag but again thats just me
>Ricky_Purnomo: FNORSSZ 1G ZO +50 253
#note Speak of the devil
>Nigel_Richards: AGIITUY 13A YAGI +20 280
#note Quite a difficult spot but keeping TUI is not really that favourable. Maybe 7H yautia or 5H aguti perhaps?
Quackle actually favors yuga over yagi. There is also the option of playing guy/buy as well. I'm not really sure what the best option is.
>Ricky_Purnomo: DDEFNRS A12 F.RD +45 298
#note Unfortunately for Nigel, yagi lead to a disastrous fyrd from Ricky. This is why playing guy or yautia may have been a little bit better.
>Nigel_Richards: EEIRTUU D3 U.U +3 283
#note I really dont know why Nigel played ulu. Most ppl including me would just slam down etui/pareve here. Maybe he was going for one of the 3 esses in the bag (and he does have a good leave to complement that i guess) but then again he only gets to draw 2 tiles and is scoring virtually nothing. I would think this cost Nigel the game.
>Ricky_Purnomo: DEIINRS J2 .IRID +37 335
#note I did not know Ricky's exact rack here but if it was indeed this particular rack, he missed snidier/insdier(Probably the rack is wrong as he would not have missed the bingo here). Playing virid was still enough to get the job done regardless.
>Nigel_Richards: EEIKMRT K5 TEEK +28 311
>Ricky_Purnomo: EEINRSS L4 ESERINS +85 420
>Ricky_Purnomo: EEINRSS --  -85 335
#note Come on Ricky, what is thaaatttt?
>Nigel_Richards: ADIMNRS L11 M...S +20 331
#note Nigel was forced to play L11 misos to block Ricky's bingo and misos is quite inferior compared to 8K kinda. Maybe this was Ricky's master plan.
>Ricky_Purnomo: EEINRSS F10 SE. +24 359
>Nigel_Richards: AADEINR L6 ANI +18 349
#note playing 14A rained at this point would have been better i think. L6 ani really isnt doing much anything
>Ricky_Purnomo: AEINRSV 8K ..VA +11 370
#note Gotta admit, its fun to be able to do that
>Nigel_Richards: ADEIORW 9N AW +7 356
#note Nigel really did not have a choice here
