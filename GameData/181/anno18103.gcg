>Tim_Michaels: ?LMNOOT 8D MOONLiT +72 72
#note Not really my 'style', but undeniably one of the most exciting games I've played!
>Siddharth_Murali: AEFHINY 7C FAY +22 22
#note A suboptimal play simming top 10.  Mostly just leave tunnel vision as I didn't even see leaving FIN as an option. And yeah that scores 33.
>Tim_Michaels: AEX 7H AXE +38 110
>Siddharth_Murali: AEHILNR K1 HERNIAL +81 103
>Tim_Michaels: BEGOY B6 BOGEY +35 145
>Siddharth_Murali: ACIOPRT A9 PAROTIC +95 198
#note ATROPHIC  for 98 was the other bingo. I missed it, and I certainly would normally play it, but as Tim said he wouldn't have challenged ATROPHIC, this works out better. Two largish errors so far.
>Tim_Michaels: DEE -  +0 145
>Siddharth_Murali: AEEGIJP 6J J.G +53 251
#note Overestimated the defense difference between JAG and JAPE here. I thought the defense difference would be more than the difference in leave (AEEIP vs. AEIG), but the defense difference is only 3 points, and as this board is already so volatile, I probably have to play JAPE. Hard to fathom!

>Siddharth_Murali: AEEIOPW J1 AWEE +37 288
>Tim_Michaels: ADEEIOT 6A O.E +10 172
#note Actual rack, I think.

>Tim_Michaels: IIKSSVW --  -32 290
#note Actual rack
>Siddharth_Murali: BNNPSTU 11H BUNN +16 352
#note Hard to imagine what better to do with his rack knowledge (at the time I knew he had IIKSSW, because he first laid down KIWIS and then switched to WISK*)
>Tim_Michaels: IIKSSVW 5C KIWIS +34 324
>Siddharth_Murali: IIPRRST 13H SPIRIT +27 379
#note (A)IRSTRIP. DAMN. Anyhow, I figured I might go for the blank here since I'm almost positive he doesn't have it.
>Tim_Michaels: ADEESTV L12 V.ED +20 344
#note Actual rack.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?CGIMNR 15C .MeRCING +95 474
#note This, like AIRSTRIP wasn't that easy of a find, but I got rewarded for making the wrong move last turn!
>Tim_Michaels: AEF -  +0 344
>Siddharth_Murali: AAHNOTU 12K O.A +11 485
#note Figured I'll block now and score later.
>Tim_Michaels: AAEFIST 15L .EAF +24 368
>Siddharth_Murali: HNORTU 4D HOT +29 514
#note HOR(AH)
>Tim_Michaels: AIST 3C SAT +18 386
#note He was extremely low on time, I would think he would normally find his outs.
>Siddharth_Murali: NRU 11M RUN +6 520
>Siddharth_Murali:  (I) +2 522
#note This could have gone either way, and missing AIRSTRIP is bad, but I undeservedly got the blank next turn and was able to seal the deal.
