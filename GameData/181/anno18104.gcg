>Emanuel: AENRRW 8D WARREN +26 26
>Josh: AEFILRS J2 FAILERS +80 80
#note Yet again off to a blazing start as he lets a confidence-building phony go. I saw FILAREES. I didn't think he would think to challenge FAILERS
>Emanuel: BBDEIRU 5E REBUI.D +40 66
#note actual rack, he laid down B(L)UEBIRD but it didn't fit and he was unhappy. DRIBB(L)E is 48.
>Josh: ?AAOOUV 7B AVO +15 95
#note Exchange?
>Emanuel: ?ABCEIS L4 ASCrIBE +83 149
>Josh: ?ACEOPU 4A COUPE +26 121
#note Here I missed P(REBUILD). 2J (F)ACEUP is good too
>Emanuel: HHOO A1 HOO.H +39 188
>Josh: ?ANPRWZ 8L .ZAR +39 160
#note I noticed kANZ(U) afterwards. It looks OK. I didn't want to whore equity and play Z(A)P for 34 at B6, and for some reason I decided it was better to take the points with (I)ZAR than it was to just play off the Z for 31, which I decided after my play was ridiculous.

>Emanuel: DILM 11I MILD +26 234
>Josh: ?ILNPTU 12D UNPLaIT +72 248
#note I didn't remember if UNSPLIT were valid. It's 2 more. This was held
>Emanuel: AEIQRTU O1 QUARTIE. +104 338
#note I held this and tried to convince myself it wasn't good for a good 4 minutes.
>Josh: EGGLOYY B6 G.YLY +24 272
#note I can fish for GEOLOGY or something. I shouldn't play this cause it blocks a lot of stuff. I wasn't thinking straight. 10B EGGY is good cause it sets up my L. I missed that placement. 
>Emanuel: KNO N6 KO.N +36 374
>Josh: EFGIMNO 10J FE. +30 302
#note hoping to get lucky with an M play on column A.
>Emanuel: O 8A O. +15 389
>Josh: EEGIMNO F10 MO.ING +19 321
#note I had to play this
>Emanuel: ADEGIST 15F .AG +15 404
>Josh: DEEEOTV M10 DOVE +32 353
>Josh: DEEEOTV --  -32 321
#note that's the last time I confuse MILDEW with MILDO*. I could have won if I played (GAG)E.
>Emanuel: A 9L .A. +18 422
>Josh: DEEEOTV 15F ...E +6 327
>Emanuel: ADEINST 1A .ANDIEST +92 514
>Josh: DEEEOTV 14I DEVOTEE +79 406
#note Had I played GAGE instead of phonying, he would have still played ZA/BAN (he said so himself), and I might have made the right draw and then drew the X for a ton of points. But I gave up on myself.
