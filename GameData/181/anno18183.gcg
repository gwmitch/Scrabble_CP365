>Nigel_Richards: AEIIIMR 9F IMARI +29 29
>Shim_Yen_Nee: ??NOQRZ J8 Q.N +14 52
#note Should have just burned a blank to play J7 QUIZ. Exposing the Q by playing QIN is not really that safe
>Nigel_Richards: CEHIRUU 8J .UICHE +63 92
>Shim_Yen_Nee: ??BORTZ O1 ROBoTiZ. +101 153
#note Methinks Yen nee was baiting the beard to play something with the Q so that she should get the triple spot all for herself.
>Nigel_Richards: CDKRRUV M5 CRU.K +19 111
>Shim_Yen_Nee: AAEENST N5 AE +13 166
#note The magic fingers have transferred from Nigel to Yen Nee apparently (Check http://www.cross-tables.com/annotated.php?u=18179 and http://www.cross-tables.com/annotated.php?u=18172 to know what i'm talking about lol). However, K6 NAUSEATE was missed
>Nigel_Richards: DILRSVW 5I WILD... +26 137
#note I was sort of expecting Nigel to play VRILS/XIS because a bingo from Yen Nee was impending but it doesnt really leave Nigel with much options i think. Not really sure though. Blocking would have a decent play.

WILDCAT was beautiful though i must say
>Shim_Yen_Nee: AENSSTY 11D STAYNES +83 249
#note VRILS would have stopped this bingo easy mode.
>Nigel_Richards: BIINRSV 2J VIBRI. +38 175
>Shim_Yen_Nee: AEFINPT 6J FA +28 277
#note 7G FAP is the ideal play i think. 6I EF is fine too.
>Nigel_Richards: DNORRST 4G TROD +18 193
>Shim_Yen_Nee: EEILNPT 3F PIET +20 297
#note Apparently Yen Nee was lost in a dark cave without her penlite.
>Nigel_Richards: ENNORSV N8 .OVEN +25 218
#note Nigel remarked here that the only way he could win was if Yen Nee tried to play something with HOVENS*. Methinks Yen Nee was simply just letting Nigel off easy by not playing penlite.
>Shim_Yen_Nee: DELLNUY O12 YELL +42 339
#note O11 DYNEL, O12 YULE or O12 YELD are slightly better options here.
>Nigel_Richards: EEGNORS 5A NEGROES +69 287
>Shim_Yen_Nee: DFIMNPU B2 UNF.D +26 365
#note FUMED may have been better then UNFED. Then again Nigel could very easily just slot something weird through the N at A5 and score 200+ points like a boss. UNFED puts a wrench in that plan.
