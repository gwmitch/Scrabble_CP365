#note Quackle likes VEXT a lot better, but I felt this was reasonable since I am quite likely to draw into something like CULEX or CALIX next turn.

>Mack_: ?ELOOUV M1 OUtLOVE +75 211
#note While VODOU doesn't give back O1, it does give back N and S hooks which are comparably dangerous, so bingoing now seems fine.

>Mack_: AEEISTY 2A YEA. +24 269
#note Though it gives back A1, the nine extra points over YEAN or seven over LYCEA (which I missed) seemed worth it. Quackle concurs.
>Seth: GIR A1 G.RI +27 287
>Mack_: ?EHINST O1 .ITcHENS +92 361
#note The only bingo from O1.

>Mack_: AAEFNOU 9C FOE +13 402
#note At this point, Seth's best shot at winning is bingoing and catching me with the J and/or the Q, so I figured I should minimize his bingo chances as much as possible. This blocks the B and E columns, while giving back only the F. Quackle hates this play and wants me to play N6 EAU, but I think I'd be better off reducing Seth's bingoes with FOE.

>Seth: EILOQRS 8B QI +16 358
#note Actual rack. Seth has no other way to unload the Q, and mentioned after the game that he was considering QI and OUtLOVES/DOWNTIMES in hope that he would draw the U for 14E LIQUORED and I wouldn't see it. Seth wasn't aware of it during the game, but QI can actually win with one and only one two tile draw: LT. This draw will yield both STROLLED and ROSTELLUM, and with AAEOUJN I can neither outscore him nor block both (4s from I10 give back TOLLERS). Though it is only a 1/36 chance, it is still something and definitely the right play, as Seth's chances of drawing the U and my missing LIQUORED seem worse than that.
