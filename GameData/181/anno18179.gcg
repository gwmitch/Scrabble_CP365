>Nigel_Richards: BCEGGSS -BGG +0 0
>Ricky_Purnomo: AEHIRTZ 8D ZITHER +56 56
#note Interesting to note that Zaire would have not given Nigel the T for consents but of course Zither is just the better play.
>Nigel_Richards: CENNOSS F2 CONSEN.S +68 68
>Ricky_Purnomo: AAAARTT 7I ATAATA +11 67
#note 7E ANATA would have been much better then ATAATA
>Nigel_Richards: ?LMPTTU I1 MULTiP..T +64 132
#note Beautiful
>Ricky_Purnomo: CGNRUWY N6 G.WCY +26 93
#note 1G CWM and L3 RUNWAY seem like stronger options then gawcy but at the same time, the ataata spot is a bit too open to leave untouched i think
>Nigel_Richards: IKLOUVV K3 VULV. +22 154
>Ricky_Purnomo: DENORSU O1 ENDUROS +87 180
>Nigel_Richards: EIKLNOO 1G KI.ONO +39 193
>Ricky_Purnomo: ABEEIOY M10 BAYE +25 205
#note Leaving EIO on the rack doesnt really seem like a good idea when so many vowels are left. D8 Zoaea seems strong and although the leave of BIY seems clunky, the BY hook and the MULTIPARTY hook are both available for scoring next turn
>Nigel_Richards: EEEEFLR D4 FREE.E +36 229
#note First 4 As for Ricky and now 4 Es for Nigel lol. But Nigel atleast gets to dump them for 30+ pts
>Ricky_Purnomo: DEFIIIO 2A DEIFI. +24 229
#note Kinda what might happen when you leave EIO..
Still able to nicely dump with deific though
>Nigel_Richards: EILLMRT E1 L.MIER +35 264
#note Quite a nice find by Nigel. Scores may be even before this but Nigel has the momentum in this game. Momentum could have swung Ricky's way earlier if he did not play BAYE
>Ricky_Purnomo: ADHIINW N1 WAI +24 253
#note Quackle's choice is L11 HAW which is actually better i think. Only large tiles left are the P,B and J (lol PB&J) so Nigel may not be able to score all that much there. 14J WHID is also a decent option with probably the best leave. I might just go yolo with HAW here and try to seize back momentum
>Nigel_Richards: AILOOPT 1A OOP +30 294
#note After this Nigel gets to go ahead by over 40 pts. Ricky's racks are not really developing much either so Nigel is in a strong position
>Ricky_Purnomo: DDHINRU 2H D.H +31 284
#note With this rack you pretty much have to play DUH and hope to get an E to try and bingo. Doing anything else gives you virtually no chance to seize back the momentum of the match.
>Nigel_Richards: AIILOQT -QAILOIT +0 294
#note Remember how Nigel has the momentum at this point?
Well.. because of that he gets the opportunity to do what he did which i think is much much better then all the stupid choices generated by Quackle.

Ricky's racks arent really that strong from Nigel's point of view but it may still contain a bingo. Either way he most likely does not have the blank from the way he is playing. The tiles in the bag also look mighty good now. So why not just take 7 of those nice tiles? If Ricky bingos, you will probably be able to respond quite easily with the tiles that u pick up but you wont be able to with the current state of your rack. And thats pretty much why.
>Ricky_Purnomo: DGIJNRU 12J JUR. +28 312
#note Unfortunately Ricky picked up the J or else he would be able to bingo,

I think JURY/JUDY would be a good play here keeping the ing. Either that or play JIRD, forcing Nigel to expose something with the bingo that he is surely about to play and try to draw dcently enough to score at the triple zone. The X is still avaiable for picking so JIRD would have been nice.
>Nigel_Richards: ?AABEOR 13D AEROBiA +68 362
#note Aerobia blocks everything lol
More or less the win is almost sealed for Nigel now.
JIRD may have given Ricky a fighting chance, forcing Nigel to play an awkward bingo (J9 AEROBAT or AEROBIA).
>Ricky_Purnomo: DGILNOX J9 OX +27 339
#note Going for the ENGILDS to win the game
>Nigel_Richards: AGINQST 10B QIS +51 413
#note Sadly for Ricky the S is here. The game would have been different if Nigel whiffed the S.
>Ricky_Purnomo: DEGIILN 14H ENGILD +43 382
#note Unplayable ELIDING. Nigel would have blocked the bingo spot if he did not have the S BUT he might be in danger of getting stranded with the Q.

14J Gilden is much better then engild
>Nigel_Richards: AEGNT 15D AGENT +36 449
#note 15H GNAT scores 49 points lolol
agent leads to the same ending spread either way
>Nigel_Richards:  (I) +2 451
