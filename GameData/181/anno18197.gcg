>Chris_W: AHW 8G HAW +18 18
#note Last time I played Chris in a tourney was round 1 in SF. Here I draw him in an early round again. I'm hoping I can luckbox him and George Macaulay because then I was slated to face the 4 bottom seeds after lunch.
>Chris_T: AAEELOS 7G ALOE +20 20
#note Holding an S, i preferred ALOE to OLEA here. This also avoids giving up the Z-bomb (or X-bomb if I play it below).
>Chris_W: IO 9F OI +10 28
>Chris_T: AAEEGPS 6J PEAG +23 43
#note Tough move here. I considered PEAGE 10B to block the X spot if that's what Chris was setting up, and also PEAGE J6 to set up the S. Decided not to risk J6 after Chris's fish, and went for the more aggressive choice. I might play 10B if i had a do-over though - I do think he has the X sometimes after OI and it doesn't give up a huge amount of equity. 
>Chris_W: AAENORR -AA +0 28
#note Exch 2. So, he doesn't have the X and he's likely going to bingo next turn.
>Chris_T: AEKMSTX 10D KEX +55 98
#note Actually, I drew it. Did I mention I was running good during my streak?
>Chris_W: ADENO 11D ANODE +32 60
>Chris_T: AEMSTUU 12A MAUT +32 130
>Chris_W: ADENSTT N3 ATTENDS +70 130
#note 13D looks a bit safer, but he is still down a tempo, so this might still be better in the interest of volatility.
>Chris_T: ACEFQSU M1 CAFE +30 160
#note Really interesting position here. I have QUADS K8 and SACQUE 13C for 48 if i want them, but I decided to hold SUQ because of the huge likelihood of a 70+ point Q play next turn at 10B or H12. The sim agrees with me decisively. I decided on CAFE versus FADE  K8 to draw the maximum number of tiles for my Q plays and bait him away from blocking them if I draw only one. I love these types of positions :)
>Chris_W: ABMY H11 .MBAY +45 175
#note Blocking one of the spots! Do I still have my coveted Q play?
>Chris_T: IOQSSSU B10 QU.SS +68 228
#note The answer is yes, although I saw the 3 s's and slapped down QUASS when QUASI was obviously better. Oh well, it's the thought that counts, right? :)
>Chris_W: ERY L4 YE.R +26 201
#note This board is still very open, and this does nothing to close it. Therefore, the game is still very much up for grabs here.
>Chris_T: DINOOSU O1 NODI +33 261
>Chris_W: AZ 8M A.Z +39 240
#note At least the board looks a bit more closed now..
>Chris_T: EOOPRSU A12 .EOU +22 283
>Chris_W: IVV 2J VIV. +18 258
#note There goes the C! :)
>Chris_T: ?IOPRSW 5J OW. +27 310
#note Missed the sick BOWSPRIt H13 here! I knida knew the word but thought it was BOWSPIRIT* lol. I decided to open the second easy lane instead of just dropping the W beacuse I was worried that if Chris bingoes at the bottom after i drop the W, i might not have a place to respond, and then I'm in trouble. I like my choice despite what happened next hehe
>Chris_W: BEHILRT 4D BLITHER +88 346
#note I felt like a blithering idiot for choosing OWE lolz
>Chris_T: ?IPRRST 14G P.RTIeRS +72 382
#note AIRSTRIP M8 scores 1 more but leaves open freak bingo lanes. This seems best.
>Chris_W: CGNU E3 C.UNG +16 362
#note CUING F2 is 2 more and opens an (unlikely) lane through the C at F2, so it must be better than this using the same letters
>Chris_T: ?FIIORT 12H .OTIF +20 402
#note Blocks the last line and sims best.
>Chris_W: GIN H1 NIG. +24 386
>Chris_T: ?DEIJNR 1E DJI.N +13 415
#note I didn't trust my tracking here; wanted to play JINN B6 but was worried about the N at H1 being used for a miracle bingo so I blocked and bled spread as usual lolz
>Chris_W: EEILLOR 11K OILER +19 405
#note -3 to LORIES I9 because it blocks m(OI)RE, which I missed
>Chris_T: ?ER 13M EaR +9 424
#note -9 to m(OI)RE e9
>Chris_T:  (EL) +4 428
#note Finally a game worthy of my 9-0 start, despite some mistakes. This was a really fun one :)
