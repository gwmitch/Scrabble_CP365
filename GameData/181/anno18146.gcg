#note Now it's game 16 out of 19 in our makeshift tournament. Here is my record so far so you can see how ridiculously strong psychology is in this game.

LWLLLWWWWWWLLLL

So I'm 7-8, and I have to win 3 out of 4. This is a whole nother day, so I'm no longer on a winning or losing streak, and neither is Emanuel. Let's see how things pan out. It's my turn to go first, but I wanted you to read this before the game started for contextual purposes.
>Josh: AACINRS H3 ACRASIN +74 74
#note ACRASIN SARCINA ARNICAS and CARINAS were my choices. I chose this because the vowel it puts next to a double letter wasn't a threat. It can be pluralized though, so it doesn't look like this board is going to turn out very defensively if I play ACRASIN. Other options that score 74 are CARINAS and ARNICAS. CARINAS takes an O on top of it for OCARINAS, and I think Emanuel would spot that, and also gives him a lot of overlapping scoring capacity, which, even though it reduces bingo lanes, scores too much to be worth leaving open if given the choice, in my opinion. ARNICAS, on the other hand, also encourages overlaps on the bottom two letters, which is good with me since it would take out the prime 8 lane in a jiffy, but still, a bingo ending in S would suck. It also yields an immediate 7 lane that is easier to hit than the other two 74-point options. I think I prefer ACRASIN still upon further analysis, but not by much. The simulation agrees with me. But maybe I should sacrifice 4 points for better defense? I don't mind an open board against Emanuel but I prefer a closed one if I can help it. Although not if I have a first-turn bingo. Hmm...
>Emanuel: JSTU 10F JUST +37 37
#note Oh, also, I forgot to mention that he might have challenged an unfamiliar ACRASIN, which he was close to doing.
>Josh: EEENOPT 11C NETOP +27 101
#note 4C POTEN(C)E looks much better than this. I missed it.
>Emanuel: ?DEEFRU 5E FER.UlED +94 131
>Josh: BEEEINV -  +0 101
#note I have never bothered to look at the definition of FERULES/FERULED/FERULING, obviously, cause in that case I would know that that is only a different spelling of this word. I hoped he was confused and that my experience would turn out to be sufficient
>Emanuel: OY 12F YO +23 154
>Josh: BEEEINV H12 BENE +38 139
#note Not sure why I didn't play BEEN; discourages overlaps.
>Emanuel: AZ 10B ZA +33 187
>Josh: AEIOTUV 4C UVEA +21 160
#note The day before I would have played UVEATIO(N)*. Perhaps I should play AVOI(D) for 20 at L1 to threaten for next turn, but I really don't like that much. I like that this limited scoring opportunities for Emanuel while keeping a leave that might bingo if I'm lucky. 9C VAU does that as well. 4A VITAE scores, but OU is really unattractive here. I don't know how to determine what I should have played otherwise. I think this is right.
>Emanuel: GGOU D7 GOUG. +21 208
>Josh: ACILMOT 3H .TOMICAL +76 236
#note Now that he blocked COMITIAL I don't have the choice of playing something that I'm 100% sure of, but this word, despite me never having seen it played, seemed very likely valid.
>Emanuel: EHINORT -  +0 208

>Emanuel: DWX N2 W.D +27 323
>Josh: EGIMOQS 6N Q. +31 465
#note Here I wanted to block something, but maybe I should just score with 12B QIS. It seems marginal. 13L MOG was also under consideration
>Emanuel: FIX 3A FIX +44 367
>Josh: BEGIMOS A1 BE.OG +36 501
>Emanuel: HO 2J HO +30 397
>Josh: IIIMNSS 1H NIM +23 524
#note No reason to keep the S for more than a few points difference here, NIMS looks better.
>Emanuel: IKR 12B KIR +33 430
>Josh: ?DIISST 13A DIS +22 546
#note Find the only bingo available! Hint, I didn't know it.
>Emanuel: ALLTVY B12 ..VA +22 452
>Josh: ?AEIRST 9H .ItRATES +73 619
>Josh: ?AEIRST --  -73 546
#note I took my time here, since I was pretty sure there were a couple of 9s that played at M7. I couldn't find one though, and saw that this scored more. I didn't know the 9s that played, SpARTEI(NE) and ESTuARI(NE)
>Emanuel: AELLTY 10F ....LY +18 470
#note oh, PELORIANS* -_-

YELL(OW) is the play he wanted. But he couldn't see it cause he didn't draw the E in the bag. He thought it was empty.
>Josh: ?AEIRST 7D .RAS.IEsT +61 607
#note Still the two 9s... I played pretty terribly this game, all things considered. Not a 600 game I'm proud of.
>Josh:  (AELT) +8 615
