>Mack_: ?AHIOPR 8C mORPHIA +74 74
#note Surprisingly, this is the only 7 in the rack.
>Robin: AIMOU 9I MIAOU +18 18
>Mack_: EGINPSW N9 SPEWING +96 170
>Robin: GU F8 .UG +10 28
>Mack_: AEGKLOO M12 OKA +33 203
#note This scores well, keeps a balanced leave, and blocks the G, so looks best.
>Robin: ?NORSTT K4 cONTR.ST +78 106
>Mack_: AEGLLOO 7G ALLO. +21 224
#note Rejected cOLOG due to my large lead, and felt the extra 8 points made this better than LAGOON. Quackle agrees in a short sim.
>Robin: VW D7 V.W +9 115
>Mack_: CEGJNOX 12L J.. +26 250
#note While I hate playing off a single tile especially when I want to end the game more quickly, there really are no other respectable choices here.
>Robin: DEF 10H DEF. +35 150
>Robin: DEF --  -35 115
>Mack_: CEEGNOX 10H GEN. +17 267
#note I liked this play over O10 EX in order to prevent Robin from playing FEDS. I also saw the setup of ENOKI, but felt Robin was too likely to go there especially knowing that she retained an F.
>Robin: EEEE -EEEE +0 115
>Mack_: CEIOUXY 6E OXY +38 305
#note O14 YO is the other option worth considering here. I figured I'd go with OXY in order to block the O in CONTRAST, and Quackle has the two plays neck and neck.
>Robin: AETZ 5C ZETA +39 154
>Mack_: CEEIIRU 4F REI +14 319
#note I'm definitely not playing 4K cURIE here. There really isn't much here, this looks fine.
>Robin: EEEE -EEEE +0 154
>Mack_: ACEEILU C3 LE. +24 343
#note Chose this over LAZE so as not to give back the hooks.
>Robin: BDET H1 DEB.T +24 178
>Mack_: ACCEIOU 1F CA.UCEI +13 356
>Robin: EEINSTV 14G VENETI..S +64 242

>Mack_: EFFLOQT 15H FET +37 393
>Robin: ABM B2 BAM +20 262
>Mack_: DFLOQRS 4B ..D +18 411
#note Blocking the A column, which I figured Robin was setting up.
