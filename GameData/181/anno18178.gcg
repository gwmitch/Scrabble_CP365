#note Not much else here. 5F BENE is another option that sims about evenly with BEIGE.
>Marlon: ADPV 8A PAV.D +33 105
>Mack_: AEEENOS E8 .ONEE +12 58
#note I also considered AKEE, but I like this play since I am down. Quackle concurs in a short sim.
>Marlon: IQ I3 QI +27 132
>Mack_: AEMNOSS 12C AN.MOSES +72 130
#note MANNOSES, which I also saw, is available, but this is better.
>Marlon: EFI 11I FIE +19 151
>Mack_: ACILTXY 10J CYLIX +55 185
#note Was about to lay down 13G XI, but thankfully noticed this before settling for the inferior play.

>Marlon: EEGI K3 .EIGE +16 193
>Mack_: AEIORRW 13C WO +22 239
#note Also considered E3 WORT and M9 WIRIER, but I wanted to keep a more balanced vowel to consonant ratio. This looks fine.
>Marlon: AAH 14B AAH +24 217
>Mack_: ?AEIRRT M7 RET.ARIi +68 307
#note This definitely looks best, as it doesn't give back an S hook and only leaves Marlon one floater to bingo through.
>Marlon: IRSU 8K SI.UR +27 244
>Mack_: CFHRTUV 2L TURF +18 325
#note I figured this was best to block the R, but 14J FRUIT scores 12 more and is definitely worth strongly considering. After FRUIT, though, I will definitely be in trouble if Marlon bingoes to the R since I will be even on a closed board with a bad leave. Should Marlon bingo after TURF, though, it will be through the I and likely yield big counterplays for me. The I is also significantly harder to hit than the R, and if Marlon can't bingo this turn I have the C and V, both of which will be extremely effective in blocking the I.

#note Didn't want to empty the bag with SCOUTH in case I somehow picked up the J and the Z and Marlon bingoed out through the N in DONEE.
