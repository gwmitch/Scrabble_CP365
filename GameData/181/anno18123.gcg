>Noah: AINORST 8G RATIONS +66 66
#note Unsure of what to play where here. Board seemed about the same amount of open after each play so I decided to make a play that didn't open bonus squares. Of those plays, AROINTS 8B is undesirable because of the hard to block S at H8 and RATIONS 8G seemed easier to parallel and subsequently block the board after than AROINTS 8H. Of course, this is a play of very small margins.
>Ken_Clark: EINNTTU G5 NUT.IENT +60 60
>Noah: BEIIIOU -BIIIOU +0 66
#note Looked for a bit, and only saw OBI. That puts me in a poor position to take advantage of this extremely open board, so exchanging seemed better. I was curious what Quackle would like. It agrees with my play, tying it with exchange seven.
>Ken_Clark: AFLOOST F10 FOAL +32 92
#note Actual rack -- Ken said he should've played LOOFA here but only saw it a bit later.
>Noah: AEIINOY E11 YEA +29 95
#note IINO is not great, but it's much better than EIIU, so this seemed clearly worth it. I didn't actually think of YONI, which is pretty interesting here. Quackle thinks AEIN doesn't quite make the cut. I also overscored this by 2, and it wasn't caught by Ken.

>Noah: DEIILRV 15B LIVERI.D +66 181
#note There's also LIVERIED 15E, but the L lane doesn't seem like a huge deal, especially at this score.
>Ken_Clark: ?CEHOPT J6 CH.POTlE +72 204
>Noah: AELLORS L4 LO +10 191
#note SOLAR seemed like the only other good play here, but I liked going for the bingo and hopefully taking the lead rather than keeping a weaker leave and probably playing a game of trading medium scores for a while. Didn't notice SALOL 14J. I don't think I actually thought this position through carefully enough, though. I *think* I still like this, as it doesn't give back the cheap scoring spots that SALOL/SOLAR do (I think this makes a blunder more likely), while keeping a leave that is great here, but it's a big sacrifice. Thoughts?

>Noah: AAAIJQW -AAIJQW +0 299
#note The Q is awful here, and I'm not about to play one of the QATs either, so exchange it is. Seemed like A or AJ or nothing would be the best keeps. I suppose I could also keep W or AW or even AJW. Sim thinks pitching all or all but A are very close for highest average next turn.

>Noah: AAACEEX N9 EX +30 364
#note This was a tough position. My biggest priority here is avoiding the Q, as the player who gets it here is in very bad shape. I felt this was so important that it overrode any sort of leave concerns I might have, making it better than various plays that don't keep such weird leaves.

>Ken_Clark: ?MRRR 12L R.aM +16 415
#note Remember that I overscored YEA by two! This is important here, as with the overscore, Ken can only win with R(E)M, but without it, he can win with several plays. As it turns out, he made none of them.
