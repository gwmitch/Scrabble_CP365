#note PAKEHA is what I meant.  dang.  PHREAKED plays in two places, and that was the play.

#note I had DEJECTA written down, but missed the 13H spot somehow.  No matter. ACETT felt bingo prone.

#note Duck says exch. IIIY.  Get rid of them all.  It probably makes the tile bag a terrible place for Adam.

#note Not bingoing here is correct. Adam just played one.  I can infer he has a blank, and a very bingo prone rack.  If I bingo, he counterbingos and wins most of the time.  So starts the game of chicken.

#note Quackle says 13L NIT has a 58 win percent.  I'm leary because I know Adam's got a prime rack.  I think this is okay.
>Adam: IN 13M IN +10 328
#note Adam plays two, forcing me to bingo first. My only hope is if he draws something unsightly he can't bingo with.

#note I'll give Adam a break for missing MArTYRE(D) L1.  He had 6 seconds, and finished with exactly 0:00.
