#player1 Josh Josh
#player2 Emanuel Emanuel
>Josh: AEEHTYZ 8E HAZY +38 38
#note What placement do you prefer? And yes, I played horizontally! I guess the risk of a 2x2 is too great to revert to this placement, but board shape matters from the start! ;)
>Emanuel: COOP E4 POOC. +24 24
>Josh: EEEOOST G6 OO.E +15 53
>Emanuel: ?GILOPR F2 GRIP +19 43
#note GLOPPIER was missed, this was his rack. D1 PIROG is also better than GRIP I would say.
>Josh: EEIMSTT E4 .....IEST +32 85
#note EMPTIEST blocked. I thought of playing TEM(PI) but this was such a good score and it blocked a lot of scoring plays forming OOZED or OOZES. But it's phony. Emanuel held.
>Emanuel: IX F10 XI +52 95
#note accepted cause of this
>Josh: AEELMTV H1 VELATE +32 117
#note this was held too
>Emanuel: BILO G11 BIO +11 106
#note (A)BOIL first, then switched to this
>Josh: ?EEGMNS 14A MaNEGES +78 195
#note I wanted to minimize what Emanuel could do after this play. So that's why I didn't play SEEMING (BIOGS plays) or M(O)NGEESE (so many floaters). This seemed to put the right of the board on non-bingo lockdown, which was really great. But I hsould have played GENOMES or GERMENS, and I'm not sure why I didn't think to. 
>Emanuel: ?EILMNR 5H .ERMINaL +68 174
#note 15A MIEN seems strong. 2F (G)R(E)ENMaIL is sick!
>Josh: AADDILSU -  +0 195
#note overdrew here, this happened before his play
>Emanuel: ADU -D +0 174
#note AUD were chosen by Emanuel, he put the D back, which seems right
>Josh: AADILSU A12 DU.A +27 222
>Emanuel: QSUW N2 SQU.W +48 222
>Josh: AIILNRS 3N .I +11 233
#note IL(EX) is probably the best play as it sets up my case S very nicely. I missed it completely. I was spending a lot of time with these almost-bingo racks.
>Emanuel: AFGINY O5 .AYING +35 257
>Emanuel: AFGINY --  -35 222
#note whew!
>Josh: AIKLNRS 10D K.. +14 247
#note SQUAWK! Who would think of putting a K on SQUAW?! Wow! This was a messup notwithstanding missing SQUAWK cause I meant to play K(I) to set up a lane for my S. 
>Emanuel: AFGINY K5 .AGNIFY +32 254
>Josh: AILNRSW 2B WRAN.L. +22 269
#note D12 AN(E)W looks good. 7I WI(G)ANS is the "I'm done fishing" play. 4E (PI)L(A)W is good. I saw non of these. 10K (F)LAW too, jeez.
>Emanuel: EO J9 OE +13 267
>Josh: AEISTUV D12 UV.A +20 289
>Emanuel: AEHN 1A HAEN +34 301
>Josh: EIJOSTT F13 J.T +19 308
#note Maybe I7 JO(G) instead?
>Emanuel: ADEEINR 3A DEAN +25 326
#note  DEReal rack. Difficult choice to make. (L)AND or (L)ANDER look alright, and so does DEAN or DARE. Maybe even (L)EADIER. Quackle of course wants Emanuel to fish with B1 (AW)E, forgetting that I too am very close to a bingo (?)
>Josh: AEIORST M5 .OTARIES +65 373
>Emanuel: BCEIORR B7 CORBIE +19 345
#note 22 off the best play, ROB(E) at I2. 
>Josh: DDFLTTU 2J TUFT. +10 383
#note I spent so long finding the best endgame play and it's always so embarrassing to look back and see that I missed something like TU(R)F. This is 8 back and would be the best play if TURF didn't ruin it for me.
>Emanuel: R 10I R.. +6 351
>Emanuel:  (DDL) +10 361
