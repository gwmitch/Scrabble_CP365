>Josh: EIINOST H8 INOSITE +66 66
#note There, I did it in a real game
>Emanuel: CEFILST 12B FELSIT.C +76 76
>Josh: CIIIORV 14D CIVI. +18 84
#note Maybe C9 VIR(E)O is a better play than this. But the two I's are really unattractive. Another option is 9C VIRIO(N), which I didn't see, and C8 VOIC(E)R, which I considered as well. 
>Emanuel: ADN 13A DAN +17 93
>Josh: AEINOPR 9H .O +3 87
#note Damn, he blocked PINAFORE. Here I should definitely play APNOEI(C) I6 and rush for SSX??. I looked really hard for 8s here and I didn't check what PANIER bingos with, even though I knew it was a bunch. CDEFGHKLMNPST. 14A ON bingos just as much as dropping the O, and other options come close as well. Not worth it
>Emanuel: OX 14A OX +47 140
>Josh: AEINPRR A13 ..R +12 99
#note Didn't hit it this time, figures. I was less than 50% to bingo
>Emanuel: ADDEMNS J3 MADDENS +68 208
#note J4 DEMANDS
>Josh: AEINPRR 7J .R +2 101
#note Amazingly I6 APN(O)EI(C) is available again. I'm now stuck in this fishing loop when I had scoring options available, such as 3G PER(M)IAN
>Emanuel: OOR 5H OR.O +10 218
>Josh: AAEINPR 3F PEAR.AIN +78 179
#note whew!
>Emanuel: ORTY 4L TORY +28 246
>Josh: ??EGIPU 15H sUPEInG +98 277
>Josh: ??EGIPU --  -98 179
#note I thought for sure either SUPEING* or SPUEING* were valid. I wrote both down and SUPEING* made more sense for some reason. SPUEING# is Collins and Emanuel may not have challenged that one, but this cast doubt in his mind as to the validity of INOSITES, one of the awesome things about my play of INOSITE. I should have just taken the 2x2
>Emanuel: FOZ O1 FOZ. +57 303
>Josh: ??EGIPU E5 GroUPIE. +86 265
>Emanuel: GM 8D M.G +9 312
#note Damn, he drew the S.
>Josh: EIIJLLT 5C JI. +11 276
>Emanuel: ABBDELS L6 DABBLES +83 395
#note So yeah he was now unsure of INOSITES, otherwise SLABBED for 119 is obvious.
>Josh: EILLNQY D4 Q. +22 298
#note I need to play YELL or YILL and hope for QU(A)H(O)G
>Emanuel: N G14 .N +2 397
#note blocking an inexistent S hook that he was unsure of when no more esses are available
>Josh: EILLNTY G2 L.Y +6 304
#note Hoping for the G. I can still play YELL or YILL and my chances are similar. This induces more mistakes though
>Emanuel: AHU 2D HAU. +15 412
>Josh: EILNTTW 1A WITE +30 334
#note Gotta take the spot and open a lane
>Emanuel: A K2 A. +2 414
#note still rightly scared of the G I don't have
>Josh: ALNOTTV M12 OVAL +16 350
#note I looked forever trying to find a double fish or a ruse setup, and I only came up with (W)EEKLONG, which I couldn't even fish for. I didn't think (W)ATERAGE was a word but I couldn't fish for that either. I missed (W)ATERLOG and some other possibilities. I should play 11K V(E)NT to fish for (W)ATERLOG, and just OVA over OVAL to set up my case L. (B)OLT/(B)LOT 8L are the standard plays here that may work once in a while too.
>Emanuel: EU 14L E.U +6 420
#note unsure what this was about
>Josh: EKNTTUW 8L .UNK +30 380
>Emanuel: AEEEGHR N6 HA.GER +20 440
#note -12 to 1G GHEE
>Josh: ETTW 11C WE.T +17 397
>Emanuel: EE C5 .EE +11 451
#note O6 EE(K), he thought it may be Collins
>Emanuel:  (T) +2 453
#note -10 for time trouble, so final score 397-443.
