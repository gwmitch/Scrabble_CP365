#note I completely any 5s on my rack. I3 PUTTI is obvious. 
>Emanuel: AEIORST E7 .OASTIER +66 82
>Josh: EHOPPTT 8A PHOT. +33 43
#note I would have liked to have kept the H for TURBITH but I couldn't really. Here I considered D13 PHOT, PHOT(O) and14B THO(R)P. THO(R)P didn't accomplish much and scored less well than PHOT or PHOTO, and PHOT, despite scoring a bit more, closed down a lot of the board, which I didn't want. So PHOT(O) it is
>Emanuel: AGKU 6I KAGU +21 103
>Josh: AENPRTU 8J TREPAN +30 73
#note Really the only thing good about this play is that it ended a game that I felt I had already lost a bit quicker. There is really no good reason to break this rack up over a few points. D11 UP or D12 PRAU are much better than this
>Emanuel: AABLQ L4 AQ.A. +28 131
#note first laid down QABALA and then saw this

>Josh: ?EFHLOO B10 HOO.E +38 204
#note I believe that the F was my last tile. I'm not sure though. I missed a bingo I didn't know. This is phony and was held for a while
>Emanuel: DEIL 15A IDLE +31 253
#note I felt like I was in a dream after this play and had no control over my actions. I knew HOOVE was phony. So I instachallenged a word extending it even though I knew HOOVED was valid.
>Josh: ?FLNSSW -  +0 204
#note And watch what I thought was my first mistake cause me to believe that fate tempted me to hit the clock and challenge. That I had two choices, challenge and lose or not challenge and win, and that the latter was impossible for me to attain. I was really, really out of it.
>Emanuel: ACDILMN N7 M.NDALIC +84 337
#note The reason I thought fate was controlling me
>Josh: ?FLNSSW -  +0 204
#note gotta challenge. I'd never seen it. Had I let HOOVED go, I would have blocked this
