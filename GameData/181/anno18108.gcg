#note This is probably his rack, makes much more sense than any of his possible other racks, given his next play.
>Siddharth_Murali: DEIMNOO J4 MOO. +8 35
#note This is the equity play, but gives too much back. Some sort of small exchange appears to be best.

#note Actual partial rack.

>David_Gibson: ACDINT L4 AND +24 190
#note He said he drew TIC after playing TIC, so actual partial rack.

#note Bad, bad, bad. At the time I wanted to blick the right side of the board and hinging the game on the ZAS hook, but really FLYER accomplishes only a little less than this in that regard, while scoring much more and keeping a better leave.

#note Yay, the highest scoring bingo scores only 66! Should just play FLIRTERS though- Interestingly enough, FLIRTERS is the only bingo with a significant defensive advantage over the others, but I just didn't find it at the time.

#note This was a horrible play that probably cost me the game. I should be fishing because I'll never be able to outrun David here. Noah Walton suggests MUN/NU at f13.
>David_Gibson: EEW 4A WE.E +22 410
#note He told me he passed up 10 points with the same tiles.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EGLNUU L12 G.UE +20 407
#note No wins, missed PITIERS and also missed UNGLUE which is actually better than blocking. Needless to say, I had chances to win this game and did not get the job done.
