#note Actual rack. 
>Mack_: AGIIIJW 7E JAW +26 26
#note Despite the hideous leave, 26 points seemed like just enough to play through. JAW ranks better statically, but the sim wants me to exchange everything by about 3%. I chose this placement for JAW in case Matt picked up OX.

>Mack_: EGIIILT 4G GI.LIE +16 42
#note This looks best here -- it scores decently and dumps two Is.

#note Saw the other bingo, NICETIES, and the double double INJECTS for 64, but this is clearly best.

#note This play definitely looked wrong, and Quackle confirms my suspicion. C7 VOW sims 6% better. Being down a little, I wanted to keep the board open, but this looks a little too reckless.

#note Very tough call here. I considered REFINER, PAYER, PANFRY, and D8 FRYER. I figured my best chance of losing was if Matt bingoes, as I will be up about 40 my next turn. The -ER lane on row 3 is definitely the easiest to hit, as Matt is unlikely to draw an 8 through the W or a 9 through PA. While this gives back the R in the B column, it is hard to hit since the R must be in the 3rd spot, and a bingo there often gives back big counterplays. Somehow I overlooked FERNIER, which is slightly better to avoid slotting the R. The plays are all close, with FRYER winning the most often and REFINER about 3% back.
>Matt: FNRY O5 ..NFRY +42 307
#note Amusingly, Matt makes one of the plays I was considering making myself last turn.
>Mack_: AAEOSUY 2B AYE +26 329
#note I figured this had to be best since it scores, unloads a few vowels, and keeps the U should I get the Q. But I missed a sick play here that is clearly best and wins 5% more often. Can you find it? (Answer on next page)
>Matt: AADEISZ 1A ZED +49 356
#note (The sick play from last turn was 11E YAS(HM)A(C) for 34.)

This was Matt's actual rack. N10 AZIDE/AZIDES are the other options worth considering here. AZIDES sims best, probably because it blocks the N19 spot which I can score very easily with if I have the B. This does score more and keep an S for plays like 13C QIS should Matt draw the Q, though. As it turns out, either play would have lost, but deciding which play is optimal is definitely an interesting question.
