#note Game 7 begins as new hope arises
>Josh: AIIIORZ -AIIIOR +0 0
#note I never want to exchange the Z. Here I felt the Z was better than the R cause the board is already shaping up to be pretty closed so bingos matter less and scoring more. The sim wants to keep ARZ or AIRZ, which I don't quite understand. I think it's important to try and find tiles that can score on this board by exchanging many. Emanuel is likely to exchange anyway after a play like UH I would think. I also don't want to play anything here cause I like the board how it is. I'll let him make the first move.
>Emanuel: AAAAA -AAAAA +0 10
>Josh: ADHORUZ G7 UH +15 15
#note I think it's good to play short here and leave Emanuel with little to no scoring options. I hold one of the case D's and I'm setting up ADZ. I don't want to play ADZ/DUH because it sets up an E I don't have and keeps a meh leave. This is simming best, which I didn't expect, but even if it didn't sim best I would stand by it.
>Emanuel: E I7 E. +6 16
>Josh: ADNORSZ 6F ADZ +22 37
>Emanuel: IW H4 WI. +19 35
#note I was scared of ERSAT(Z) here after his E(H) play but he doesn't need to be really strong to play E(H), just relatively strong, so I think ADZ is still the right play. What else is there anyway?
>Josh: ILNOORS J1 ROSINOL +63 100
#note Now I'm genuinely scared though, after what happened last game...
>Emanuel: EU 1J .UE +4 39
#note whew. I didn't immediately see any 3x3s that play through RUE but I was looking a bit all game.
>Josh: ABEKMNO 5D KOB +22 122
#note Damn K6 EMBANK is an OK option although it yields an easy 7 lane. I didn't know it. I think this is fine though all things considered.
>Emanuel: EJR D2 JER. +30 69
>Josh: AEIMNNT K7 MANNITE +73 195
>Emanuel: ADEITUV 11F AUDIT.VE +62 131
#note I was pretty sure this took an S but not entirely sure, which isn't a good thing. I held it too just to make sure it wasn't made up.
>Josh: AAERTTY L11 .ARY +26 221
#note I felt like I should start playing some defense. I didn't want to give him stuff to play through with TEARY 10B or fish with 10E AY. 
>Emanuel: GINW 8K .WING +39 170
>Josh: ABEITTY 10B BATTY +37 258
#note of note: 13H YTT(ER)BIA. I know that usually AE is better than IE but there were more A's unseen to BATTY looked better than BITTY. I also considered playing BATT(ER)Y 13G, which yields immediate threats but Emanuel doesn't have much time to capitalize on them. But after AWING opening up some more stuff I didn't want to add another easy comeback route.
>Emanuel: OOPR H11 .ROOP +27 197
>Josh: EFIIINP D10 .IPI +12 270
#note 9C FIE looks good and I missed it. I was focused on balancing my rack and blocking stuff. I also thought I held the last I as well as there being no U's left (tracking mistake) and so QI or XI were not problems to be accounted for, and QUA or XU neither. Since there is an I left I think I should play 9C FIE. D10 (T)IEPIN was also a miss.

>Josh: EEFINOQ C13 QI +44 314
#note Welp...
>Emanuel: ACENRST 15A CAST +33 290
#note Real rack. He was unable to find CENT(I)AR(E)S M4 or the even more sick C(I)ST(E)RNAE. That would have won it for him
>Josh: AEEFGNO 9M FE. +21 335
#note Blocking stuff but actually not everything there. (IF)I(E)D words are still available. I still only have seen CONG(RUE)NT through (RUE) so I'm not worried. A lot of E's unseen so FE(E) over FO(E)
>Emanuel: EV M11 .VE +24 314
>Josh: AEGLNOX L1 .XOGEN +28 363
#note I inexplicably missed some better plays here. I'll let you find them.
>Emanuel: CM C9 C.M +14 328
#note I don't think this will ever be the right play. He needs to keep the B open and also keep his C for CON(J)____ words and CONG(RUE)NT, no matter if he doesn't have the blank.
>Josh: ADEFLLS N2 FALL +31 394
#note This loses only to SER(J)EaNT. Other stuff that blocks SERJEANT may be outscored.
>Emanuel: ELNORRS 8A LOSER +26 354
#note -5 to 14K S(Y)REN
