#note And this.
>Chris_Lipe: EUY 6K .UEY +24 47
>Winter: AABFOPR 7M FAB +26 66
#note I finally make a good play.
>Chris_Lipe: AJU O7 .AJU +39 86
#note And get burnt.
>Winter: AIIOPRR E3 PIRO.I +18 84
#note Another good play.
>Chris_Lipe: NTW 6D W.NT +22 108
>Winter: AIKNORT D1 KNOT +34 118
#note I saw (WO)K, but on this board what good is the bingo leave without an ess? I'd have to play off the P, or M, and that's a lot harder for me.

>Chris_Lipe: CELORST 11I COLTERS +82 190
#note Ugh.
>Winter: ABEIRTW C7 .IBRATE +30 148
#note Don't want to play WAR(K)--need to keep the board dynamic, and also need to draw a blank. If Lipe draws them, I lose--period.
>Chris_Lipe: DX 8B D.X. +41 231
#note Also those tiles.

#note Finally, I catch a break.
>Winter: AILORTV 1A VOL. +33 215
>Chris_Lipe: AELZ 12K LAZE +49 286
#note Well, that didn't last long.
>Winter: AIOORTY 2B YO. +24 239
#note TOPIARY would have been nice for points and turnover and opening up a spot
>Chris_Lipe: ?EILNNS 13E LINdENS +62 348
#note Goddammit.
>Winter: AEIORST 3C T..I +18 257
#note And I actually had seen the bingo, OTARIES, that would have caught me up. I didn't know it before Albany, but I missed it a few days ago and learned it. But there's word knowledge and then there's just blind luck.

And then there' missing stuff like REZERO.

>Chris_Lipe: CHIU 2F HUIC +30 378
>Winter: AEEGORS 1F GOA +27 284
#note I'm going to lose, but I can at least keep it close by drawing the H and bingoing.
>Chris_Lipe: ?EEHINO 3I HErOINE +87 465
#note Oh, nevermind.
>Winter: DEEGNRS 4J RENS +17 301
#note Spent a lot of time to make the wrong play here.
