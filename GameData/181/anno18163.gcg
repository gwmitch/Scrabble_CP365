>Yong_Jian_Rong: DEEFMRU 8D FUMED +30 30
>Nigel_Richards: DEIJLTX D8 .JELD +32 32
#note Using the X instead of the J seems to be a better option here with tix or exit being recommended by Quackle. I would have porbably played tix although fjeld does not give Jian Rong a chance to score by hooking ex.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: AEEIRUU 11D .IEU +8 38
#note Uraei would have been nice here
>Nigel_Richards: EIPRTTX 9G XI +37 69
#note Nigel did not play exit which is the stronger option here, getting rid of the clunky extra T and scoring 7 more, also restricting the ex hook. I suppose Nigel just wanted to ensure the PER to stay on his rack for next turn
>Yong_Jian_Rong: ?AEELRU 13A LEAsURE +80 118
>Nigel_Richards: EEGPRTT 8A PER..... +48 117
#note Nice! I feel like just playing exit would have netted another E evenutally anyway though but eh what do i know haha
>Yong_Jian_Rong: ?AAIOQZ B10 ZOA.A +68 186
>Nigel_Richards: EGHNTTT 15A TETH +48 165
>Yong_Jian_Rong: ?DILNOQ 7E NOD +25 211
>Nigel_Richards: EGNOSTV 10H GOV +20 185
>Yong_Jian_Rong: ?AILNOQ -Q +0 211
#note Unfortunately Jian Rong missed Aquilon here, although Nigel would have responded with enterons. Jian Rong would still be in a favourable position though i would think, being able to score by drawing either an I or S (hopefully)
>Nigel_Richards: EENORST 14F ESTRONE +67 252
#note Mssing aquilon may have just cost Jian Rong the game as nigel seizes the momentum with estrone.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: ?AILNOT M8 TALIONs +71 282
#note Anviltop is quite a nice word haha. Might have been better then talions but not really significant
>Nigel_Richards: BBNNQRS 10D .BB +27 279
#note Beautfiul rack
>Yong_Jian_Rong: ACISTWY 12L C.WY +32 314
>Nigel_Richards: EINNQRS L7 QIN +18 297
#note Slowly developing that bingo. 
>Yong_Jian_Rong: ACIINST B1 ANTICIS. +74 388
>Nigel_Richards: AEINRSS 3A S.AINERS +68 365
#note I would have opted for sarnies/arsines here but i guess Nigel wanted to set up a score with that triple spot perhaps?
>Yong_Jian_Rong: EGGLOOT O8 OLOG. +27 415
#note Geology would have been strong here
>Nigel_Richards: AFHIIMY A1 FI.H +68 433
#note More or less sealing up the game here. Geology may just have allowed Jian Rong to win though, as it would give him 2 extra tiles which could lead to the important K.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: AEGOPTW H1 WA.P +36 451
>Nigel_Richards: ADEIMVY 5E DAVY +35 468
>Yong_Jian_Rong: EGORRTU 4H .URGER +18 469
#note Jian Rong could opt for 4D tor, blocking Nigel's kam, and play out with purge next turn. He still loses by 1 though
>Nigel_Richards: AEIKM 2D KAM +33 501
>Yong_Jian_Rong: OT 15G TO +15 484
