#note H1 climates and 4A amuck are also options, albeit a bit worse

#note An odd play considering Hubert could have nicely played nicely, leaving an S.

#note 9L AX keeps a better leave. K4 EXIT scores more and doesnt expose the X to the triple but the Z is unseen

#note Hubert's house must not have a panoramic view...

Granted though, panorama is quite hard to spot.

Apparently Hubert's rack is also an anagram of amarant and maranta (Relax, alll unplayable)

But honestly, i think AGA is a better play then naga. The leave seems a bit better but i'm not sure.

>Hubert_Wee: ?AGMORT 13A MOG +31 277
#note 13E angstrom, 13A morgan, O5 tomogram are the best options here aside from mog.
>Nigel_Richards: AEEINOV 12K OVINE +22 310
#note Interesting to note that the 4D spot has been unclaimed up to now. Nigel probably might be thinking of sticking the W there at some point.
>Hubert_Wee: ?AINRRT O2 ANTeRI.R +58 335
#note O7 Rotiferan may have come down from Nigel if he had this rack
>Nigel_Richards: AEHNPTW A8 ANTHE. +36 346
#note Nigel does manage to draw the W and anthem allows him to keep the W for later.
>Hubert_Wee: DEIOORU 13M OU +10 345
#note Hubert missed the second blank with this draw and unfortunately drew a weak rack instead.

Although ou may not have been the best play. The best play i think is Quackle's suggestion of F2 ouija.

Ou may have been to block a possible zones or zings etc but then again, if Nigel had the Z, Hubert loses regardless (The Z can still score at 2N).
Ouija does not block the n BUT it does block the 4D scoring spot. This would put nigel at a bad spot AND give hubert the Z which will guarantee him the win.

Probably Hubert's only chance to win was drawing the Z,W or ? and he should have gone for that by playing atleast 3 tiles, emptying the bag. That's my thoughts.
