>Nigel_Richards: AEIOOST A11 OO +6 63
#note Dropping oo looks like Quackle's preferred option too. I would probably drop ooi(by exchanging i guess) but playing oo does close off that high scoring spot. Must be my paranoia always drawing poorly off dumps like this that make me think aest is a better leave then aeist although probably its not

#note An important point in the game.
Judging by Nigel's last play of pug, his rack is not that strong. At the very least it should be lacking an S.

Quackle's suggestions here are either to play J8 rav, or J8 riva opening up the wither hook.
15M rav is also an option as the HE hook and also a potential -ing pick will also be available.
4F Vizard is an interesting but risky option.
Victor's play of rider is a decent option but i feel as though the leave of VA does not leave that many immediate options for next turn. Although it does prevent Nigel from using the triple spot down there.
RAV/WITHER might just be the best option in the long run, leaving all the options open.
Victor still does have the momentum after rider though.

>Victor_Gwee: AEEHIPV 12I HEVEA +28 347
#note I feel as though hevea disposes too many Es. Probably 10H hive or 10H have is better? Quackle still rates hevea as a good option in any case.
>Nigel_Richards: EEIKNVW O8 EWKIN. +45 342
>Nigel_Richards: DEISTUV (challenge) +5 347
#note Nigel draws the 2 last Es and has the option to score with ewking, which i assume he was planning last turn when he played munt.
>Victor_Gwee: CILNPRS 6G CL.P +14 361
#note Here is where the momentum of the game shifts away from Victor. At this point i think the right thing to do is to try and outmuscle Nigel rather then trying to go for that last ditch bingo. In this case scoring high with 10F SCRIP or 10B JARPS seems stronger then dumping CLIP hoping for a bingo
>Nigel_Richards: DEISTUV J8 DIV +28 375
#note The bingos possible for Victor at this point are
FRONDAGE, ORGANDIE, DIAGNOSE, FARINOSE, ORGANISE, DISGORGE AND GYRODYNE through the E at 12M

and plenty of words that can hook the E at N8. So i can see Victor's reasoning behing fishing with clip but he does need to draw the right tiles and there is no guarantee of that.
>Victor_Gwee: AFGINRS F8 ..F +17 378
#note Close but no cigar. Could still score big with B6 fra or 4H zarfs but he does go for the bingo instead
>Nigel_Richards: DESTUYY K3 YESTY +31 406
#note Victor would have won by picking up the O for either signora or organise. But he picked up the G instead.

With Victor's only bingos being either signora or organise at this point, Nigel could have opted to play 9M yew to block both options. Victor might be able to outscore Nigel and win after that however. (If Nigel plays Yew, Victor should be able to win by playing anying with clips. Nigel has B3 STUDY for 32 but Victor has 10M ARK for 18 to win). So Nigel probably realized that and took the risk of Victor having SIGNORA.
