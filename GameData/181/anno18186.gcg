>Jason: EEEEE -EEEEE +0 0
>Mack_: CENPRVY H8 NERVY +30 30
#note While CREPY makes it harder for Jason to bingo, The leave after NERVY is so much better that NERVY is the superior play.
>Jason: AXZ I7 ZAX +56 56
>Mack_: CENOPTY 12B POTENC. +28 58
#note CONVEY was clearly out of the question, and I chickened out of TYPEY, so this seemed like the best play. Quackle actually likes this over TYPEY by a small margin, but I prefer TYPEY I think to keep a better leave and avoid putting the E in the 2*2 lane.
>Jason: EOPR 13C PORE +26 82
>Mack_: ABEEHUY G6 YEAH +35 93
>Jason: ADENW 14D DAWEN +38 120
>Mack_: ABEIKUU 15H AUK +27 120
>Jason: ACEFIL H1 FACILE +41 161
>Mack_: ABEEIUV J4 UVEA +20 140
#note This placement of UVEA over F4 looks better since I retain the B for the F6 hotspot.
>Jason: DEIO 11H .IDEO +18 179
>Mack_: BBEGIIO F2 BOGIE +24 164
#note This is better than GIB since it maintains a more balanced leave.
>Jason: ?EIMORT 1H .OReTIME +89 268
>Mack_: BGIRSST 15A BIGS +30 194
>Jason: JLW L10 J.WL +28 296
>Mack_: NNRSTTT -NNTTT +0 194
#note I'm not positive what I had here, but I know I had 7 consonants that were all one pointers and I kept RS.
>Jason: NU 2N UN +14 310
>Mack_: EOQRRSU L1 .ORQUERS +86 280
>Jason: AEST M11 SEAT +27 337
>Mack_: ?ADHIMT 8L .HIM +27 307
#note I also considered plays at E3, but felt my best shot at catching Jason was bingoing. Since none of the E3 plays left me a hook and would allow Jason to score and block at the same time, I elected to play SHIM to open the M.
>Jason: GIRT N12 TRIG +23 360
>Mack_: ?ADDIIT B10 DI. +10 317
#note Now I definitely have to bingo, so this looks best.
>Jason: FL 11A F.L +11 371
>Mack_: ?ADINOT A8 NAI. +24 341
#note No bingo plays here. 
>Jason: ALNOST O14 NO +18 389
>Mack_: ?DOT 5B TOnD. +10 351
#note I went over 2 minutes looking for a bingo a turn back, so the final score was 389-339.
>Mack_:  (ALST) +8 359
