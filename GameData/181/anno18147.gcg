#note A lot is going my way this game
>Emanuel: OTW 10B WOT +30 106
#note At the time I failed to realize this was setting up an S. 
>Josh: AAEHIIT J6 AI +14 229
#note Blocking my AAH play, but I should play it at 9A because of S(WOT). I also considered G7 AHI, but why not keep the H and score almost as much? I'll make it up, and I don't have to open another 7 lane, despite the high probability that if Emanuel has a bingo this turn it could likely hook D(UH). He doesn't necessarily have an S after WOT but I probably shouldn't risk it and go with AAH.
>Emanuel: DIIN 13J NIDI +17 123
>Josh: ADEHIIT L8 DAH +31 260
#note It seemed right to score as much as possible here and block scoring spots. HI(ED) doesn't accomplish as much as DAH; (I)XORA/(I)XTLE/(I)ZARS still play, but it keeps a much better leave for this board. A good play I didn't see was F6 HEADI(ES)T, which races for SS? and other good stuff while not giving much too much back and minimizing the number of moves Emanuel has left to come back from. There are some other options that I dion't really like cause they open the board much more. I think I should have played HI(ED) in hindsight. 
>Emanuel: AIQSU A6 QUAIS +49 172
>Josh: EEIILOT H10 ...OIL +24 284
#note Ah, I missed TELOI at B2. That looks like a good play. Between (REC)ITE and (REC)OIL, EILO is significantly better than EEIT, but exposing LE is also significantly better than exposing TE. B3 IOLITE has decency to it as well. 
>Emanuel: EGILRU B1 REGULI +31 203
>Josh: EEIOPRT 1A P.ERIOT +30 314
#note Shame PORTIERE didn't play. I didn't actually know the word was valid in English. I considered that T(R)OPE had better equity than P(R)ERIOT, but I was overwhelmed by the turnover and the superior rack balance. I'm giving him a great X spot, it's silly. I made as though I was unsure of the word though.
>Emanuel: EEFT -  +0 203
#note But he wouldn't have challenged if he had the X-bomb
>Josh: DDEFNPR 4A F.NDED +30 344
#note Perhaps he would have challenged F(Op)PED too. That takes out a prime scoring spot, but this seems better because of the leave, the turnover and the lanes it blocks.
>Emanuel: EEFT 12A FEET +36 239
>Josh: KMNPRVZ E3 Z.RK +34 378
#note Weird, K(E)MP and P(E)RV sim about equally to this.
