>Siddharth_Murali: EJLOORS H11 OLEOS +29 51
#note Really like this play... why try and bingo when you can limit him to 29 next turn instead of 47 and furthermore likely draw an A next turn?
>Eric_Harshbarger: BEIV 15D VIBE. +14 88
>Siddharth_Murali: AEGIJNR G11 RAJ +44 95
>Eric_Harshbarger: ABFIL 9H F.BIAL +17 105
#note Yup I let this crazy phony go- he did have FIBROMA and FALBALA available though.
>Siddharth_Murali: EEFGINU K6 FEU.NG +20 115
#note Not too pleased with NEIF, but I guess I need to play it.
>Eric_Harshbarger: IIII -IIII +0 105
>Siddharth_Murali: DEEINRT J5 TED +16 131
#note I knew I was giving up a lot of points next turn by not playing just ED, but I wanted to work towards a controlled board. I missed UTERI and JETTIED though, both of which I like (-10)

>Siddharth_Murali: AEOORTT O4 TROO. +8 217
#note Thoughts? I saw TEAROOM but I thought taking points wasn't a huge deal because I would have to block the P later on anyway.
>Eric_Harshbarger: AGK 1L .KAG +27 180
#note I think he said he had both blanks on this turn, not 100% sure.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEELRTU M1 .ALE +24 241
>Eric_Harshbarger: PTY 3F TYP. +13 193
>Siddharth_Murali: AEORTUY G3 .OUR +7 248
#note Wanted to block all bingoes and save the 28 points for next turn (or possibly DENY plays). Eschewing it now really doesn't hurt. We really don't have the tools to determine if this kind of play is 'best', but he does only bingo 0.3% next turn.
>Eric_Harshbarger: X N1 .X +38 231
>Siddharth_Murali: ACDDETY N5 AY +28 276
#note This cuts a lot of score compared to YALD, presumably because of W plays.
>Eric_Harshbarger: ??EHI 6D HEI. +9 240
#note First played HI, then switched to HEIR.
>Siddharth_Murali: CDDETVW 5C DEW +29 305
#note VETCH actually gives up a lot of bingos (15%) as opposed to this (2%). I figure as long as I draw just one vowel I should be in good shape.
>Eric_Harshbarger: ??CIINU 2C UNCI +12 252
#note This was his actual rack. Post-game, we couldn't think of any alternatives, but on the drive back home, CUIF somehow popped into my head. I really like that play.
>Siddharth_Murali: CDEITUV 1F DEV +25 330
#note And I draw 3 vowels like a boss :)
>Eric_Harshbarger: ??EILNR 13G ...LINER +30 282
#note Actual rack. He said 'this is crazy' when making this play. However, he had REHEELING 94 and WELTERING 70! Holy smokes.

>Eric_Harshbarger: ??NRS 13G ........S +22 338
>Siddharth_Murali: I L12 I. +4 377
#note Crazy game, REHEELING was an awfully tough find, but even after 94, he would have only won 40% of the time, so I shouldn't be so hard on myself. That being said, I'm not sure what I could have done to erase that opportunity, so I'll just move forward. I do have to work on focusing and cutting down on stupid errors like TED though.
