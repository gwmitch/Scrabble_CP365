#note Maybe a false move - while it is often good to get rid of the Q as soon as possible, it doesn't look best here. TEF E3 is pretty nice, offering the prospect of QI/TI with four I's still unseen. The bold GONEF E1 is not unreasonable. But there are few moves which satisfactorily address the opening on row 14, the most dangerous. I suppose GONEF 13B might have been worth a shot.

>Andrew: EFGGNOT 15E FOEN +37 370
#note Sucked in by the score here - FOEN is not as good as GOAF or FEAT H12. So maybe I lost one game by playing GOAF, and another by not playing GOAF.
