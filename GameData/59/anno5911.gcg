#note despite the junk leftover, I'll take the points thanks.
>George_Latis: JO 6F JO +33 57
>Matthew_Larocque: BIIILPU H6 B..L +18 52
#note This however, was a bad move.

>George_Latis: IISW 10E IWIS +22 106
>Matthew_Larocque: EGOOOSU 9D GOO +11 63
#note You can see where this game is headed - and that usually works out badly for me. 50+ point lead on a cramped board is pretty significant. Will I succumb to it?
>George_Latis: IIIII -IIIII +0 106
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEOSU 9J .OUE +5 68
#note Missed the odea play. Mainly, I just wanted to dump some vowels and open the board up somewhat.
>George_Latis: NNOU 8L NOUN +20 126
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDEENS L8 ..DE +5 73
#note Rouen? I'll have to remember that. I wasn't ready to plop down my s yet on job. That spot would come in handy later. Nuance/nuanced would have been nice.
>George_Latis: ISV 12J VIS +24 150
#note Free points for him and more blockage.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEHNSU K11 H.C +26 99
#note I banked on him not knowing that hic can't be s-hooked.
>George_Latis: AIKN 8A KINA +31 181

#note Here goes...
>George_Latis: IQ 7B QI +26 207
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENRTW H12 WA.T +33 211
#note Don't even know short k words so...
>George_Latis: EZ G13 Z.E +45 252
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABEENR O6 BA.NEREd +60 271
#note Should have taken the 59 point route, harder to make a counter play on the upper TLS
>George_Latis: DEF N10 FED +33 285
>Matthew_Larocque: ALLOOOU -OOOULLA +0 271
#note Some decent stuff still in the bag - ugly letters on an ugly board won't win the game.
>George_Latis: PRT E12 TR.P +6 291
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACDESY 12A CADE. +22 293
#note These k bingos are killing me!
>George_Latis: EINPT A10 PE.TIN +30 321
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AFISTY B14 FA +22 315
>George_Latis: IILLOOU -IILLOOU +0 321
#note I'm not sure what he had, but he changed all 7, so it must have been bad. I assume he was also after the last s and last blank. I didn't intend to reveal I had them just yet.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IISTTY C10 TI.Y +16 331
>George_Latis: ILLLOOU -OOLLLIU +0 321
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IMORST 6F ...S +23 354
#note I felt good at this point. He had no choice but to open up, and get an unlike bingo. I almost blundered it away as you'll see, but my clock was quickly running out of time by this point, as was his.
>George_Latis: GR C5 GR.. +5 326
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IMORTU 6L TOM. +14 368
>George_Latis: G M5 G. +3 329
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILORU 4J AURaL +11 379
#note I knew there had to be a bingo, but rarely would I visualize the blank as an X. Regardless, this was a pretty wimpy play, I didn't even bother to put my a in the optimal place.
>George_Latis: ADELLOR 3E ORDEAL +12 341
>Matthew_Larocque: IO 4D OI +6 385
#note 11 points is obviously more than 6, but I was already at -42 seconds. He was at -1:51 though, heh.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (L) +2 387
#note Adjusted score: 321-377
