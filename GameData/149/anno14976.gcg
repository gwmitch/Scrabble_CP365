#note hmm, didn't spot TANGOING here. not a huge miss, not sure why I didn't think of it though. Playing HOG makes my next turn much less volatile (90% bingo)

#note well, I wish he'd chickened out. I block my own lane on column K but at this point creating another 3x3 looked like as good a chance as any. even if I play BIDE and bingo next turn it's hard to see how the second bingo will come down.
