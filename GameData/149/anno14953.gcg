>JD: IMOPRTX I13 MO +20 217
#note chickened out on proximo. the beginning of a series of complacent moves that would almost wind up costing me the game.
>Luise: EIJKNSU 5B JUNKIES. +96 236
>JD: EIPRSTX F4 P.X +28 245
#note interesting that XI sims better. lots of vowels remaining to balance EPRST, and XI is also more defensive while leaving me the nice lane on row K to bingo from that she likely can't hit.

#note not seeing UNPEN here until after I hit my clock almost wound up costing me the game, CEN much more flexible than NN
>Luise: DHIS J11 DISH +39 336
>JD: GIINNOV K8 VINO +20 405
#note I have to do this, but after next turn when she plays from the V things will be hard
>Luise: DEOT 8K .OTED +30 366
>JD: GGIIINO 7L GIN +13 418
#note touch choice between GIEING and my play of GIN, looks like GIEING blocks more bingoes even though it now loses to any out-bingo. I'm not going to outrun her if she bingoes anyway. she only bingoes 6% of the time with random racks versus ~4% after GIEING.
>Luise: BEIORU 1J .UREBI +27 393
>JD: CEGIIOT 8A IC.. +18 436
#note if I think she finds NAPERY I need to block by playing at 8A, but otherwise I should play COG or COTE. I didn't even see the possibility of NAPERY anyway.
>Luise: ANRY 15J YARN +20 413
#note made a hash out of this one, lucky not to lose.
