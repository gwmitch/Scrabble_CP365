#note even though on static JUROR is 10 points ahead, JOLTER catches up because it keeps the case R and there are so many Es left. JUROR or JUREL win the sim by a point, however...

#note couldn't figure out what to do, saw both HALLOW and WUD which sim better. HALLOW actually looks really good, I was reluctant to play it because it doesn't hit that many bingoes (bingo percentage same as WUD/DEW) but the ones I do hit are more points (RESIDUE and a bunch of the 3-pointers)

#note just kronen guarantees that he can't bingo (caveated and divagate are the only two) but I played it safe.
