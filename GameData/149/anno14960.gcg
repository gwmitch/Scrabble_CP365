#note or just QI?  crazy how close they sim together with 36 pts of difference

>cesar: ABCILQS D9 QI +15 257
#note i thought of FLUB too. 13J QIS sims best (-2.5)

>cesar: ABCELSW 7F WAB +23 280
#note this and WEBCAM sim pretty close and they both seem kind of reckless. what should i actually play? WAB is defensively better and i have an S.

>cesar: CEGLMRS 5C MERCS +24 304
#note now this is a tough one, what do i play here? i wanted to take out some lanes. i was too worried about the double-double, but it needs more specificity than the bottom lane, which is probably still more dangerous. this was a tough move. i guess the obvious play is 14G GERM but if someone can show me how to sim a range of racks for him.. (-6.5)

>cesar: EGILOTU 6B GUL +14 318
#note i saw gomuti and nope, not with the X out. this, however, is a very ugly move that doesn't accomplish anything. i have to play GOMUTI. he could have XI but i'll keep a much more workable rack, and have a higher chance at the case S. the chances of him having XI from the random draw are about 19%; AXE at 14L are 15%; fairly low enough to not worry obsessively about it and keep trying to score and do equity. however, it's very hard for me to not see this as blowing a game and thus doing something dumb like GUL makes me think i can salvage it instead of the obvious play. GUL is really bad and nonsensical. (-12.5)
>mike: AEX 14L AXE +36 322
>cesar: EEEIOOT F14 OE +13 331
#note i forgot about LOOIE (i remember seeing it) and somehow passed up D14 OE (which i also saw). not one of my better moments. i'm at my most unfocused when i feel like i've just blown a game. however, after this game i remembered what kenji had said about poisonous thinking during games (thinking you have nothing to worry about and can relax is just as bad as giving up). (-6.5) with that said, i'm not that likely to draw more vowels.
>mike: ADT 4B TAD +21 343
#note another reason why GUL was rotten
>cesar: EEIIOTY 6G .OTI +11 342
#note 14H EYE actually seems ok here. championship player likes it vastly over my play. i think the main reason is that i am giving him a vowel to play through and also not scoring enough. 
>mike: CINNRSV J3 VIN.C +10 353
>cesar: EEEIVY 3J .IVE +20 362
#note i was extremely lucky that he only had one vowel. nevi is better because i get an out next turn. (-4)
