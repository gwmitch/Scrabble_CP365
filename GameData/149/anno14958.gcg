>Quackle: DEEKOSX 8G KEX +28 28
#note I haven't had a chance to get used to the new program, so no competing analyses here. This is mostly just a fun game without a ton of decision-making anyway.
>Bill: CDIIMNO G1 DOMINIC. +73 73
>Quackle: ?CDEOSZ 5E Zi.CODES +126 154
#note DOCKIZES# (to convert to dock use... yeah, really) is one of the other two available bingos. If we were playing TWL, the only bingo would be the cool ZYDECOS.
>Bill: AAIOOOW H1 AWA +36 109
#note As always, thank you to Quackle for the splendid post-bingo draws.
>Quackle: DORSTTY 4K DOTTY +33 187
>Bill: ?AINOOO 7I OOgONIA +68 177
#note Wow, stunning turnaround from AAIOOOW. Not even best - ZOONOMIA#.
>Quackle: AEIRRSU O1 AIR. +21 208

>Quackle: ELMPRSU 9A LUMPERS +84 292
>Bill: AGIINPT A8 P.AITING +158 371
#note Another all vowel leave turns into a bingo.
>Quackle: EEEEHNY I1 HEY +38 330
>Bill: FLNSTTW E8 W.FT +20 391
#note Quackle's twisted way of atoning for drawing me AAIOOOW before.
>Quackle: EEEELNR 3L LEE. +17 347
>Bill: ABELNST 13A .NSTABLE +72 463
#note SEMBLANT# for four more.
>Quackle: EEFNRRT H12 F.ER +33 380
>Bill: ABGGHQU N6 Q.. +32 495
#note This move is certainly worthy of analysis (though win % is a moot point). I decided to just cash in the Q since it didn't seem like any great Q with a U plays were materializing on this board. To be honest, I didn't see (and didn't really look for) the two plays Quackle likes best, F4 GIB and 2M GHI, but I still like the idea of dumping the Q for 32 and trying to clean up the rack next turn, rather than probably having to play it for fewer points next turn and still maybe having a junky rack.

>Bill: AABGIOS 9I OBIA +22 549
#note Trying to go for a bingo seems pretty pointless here, so I just tried to keep a decent rack. Missed Quackle's choice of IGAPO#, which is definitely better because it allows for _ABS plays under OD/NU/QIN.
>Quackle: EELRRTV 2F V...R +21 452
>Bill: AEGIIOS D7 GA.IES. +35 584
#note Best. Nice to find this to conclude an entertaining game.
