#note ugly rack, he laid down vibrant first. Cesar: BABA I5 sims about the same wih this. i think VIBE was an ok move.

>JD: IIMOQSZ 7I Z. +42 168
#note should've played qis this turn, I'm never going to draw a better Q play but my Z play can improve. I was hoping to get zamia down
>Ceasar: ?CEEINR M8 ENtERIC +78 154
#note i figured i needed to get kind of lucky here but this is really kind of ridiculous. gENERIC is a better play that i missed. (-1)
>JD: AIIMOQS 13B QIS +34 202
#note maqui sims a little better, figured it was the first S but having the S is a big deal for row 15
>Ceasar: ADDELLO L4 ALLOD +21 175
#note this sims almost identically with LOADED but i'm not sure this is right anymore. LOADED scores 4 more points and makes the board more open, a little bit, ALLOD actually is not that helpful. i wanted to keep the DE.
>JD: AHIIMOY 14A HI +32 234
#note OHIA at M3 wins the sim by a lot, I have a good chance of scoring a bunch on column N next turn and I get further into the bag with many good tiles unseen. HI is weak.
>Ceasar: ADEMORS 15G RADOMES +92 267
#note lucky
>JD: AIIMOUY 14H MAYO +41 275
#note eww
>Ceasar: DIRTUVW M2 WUD +17 284
>JD: AIINNRU 10D .AIN +17 292
#note UNIT is the play I was looking for. why couldn't I find it?
>Ceasar: IKRTTVX I7 ..X +27 311
#note my other choice was 6D TIKI. it's better; i'm simply not going to score enough after ZAX with that leve. i worry too much about him having the S, or even something like 9H OP. G4 VIRTU doesn't score enough but it's still better than ZAX. it's also important here to start racing to the blank or Ss. (-6)
>JD: FINPRUU F6 FI. +31 323
>Ceasar: IIKRTTV 5H KIT +14 325
#note this is almost a zugzwang play. i debated for a long time between this, KIWI and TWIT. KIT sims 4 pts better than anything else, but is it actually better? i'm already down so even if i'm opening something big for him i feel like i have to take a chance.
>JD: HNPRRUU 10J UH +18 341
#note RUTH to flip over an extra tile and fork the board in case he hits the K? I like that much better
>Ceasar: CEEIRTV H1 TRIC. +42 367
#note good draw, but quackle thinks i win more often after 2J VIEWER because TRICK allows a significantly higher bingo chance for him. (-3%)
>JD: GNPPRRU 3E URP.NG +13 354
#note need to draw the blank to have a hope
>Ceasar: EEEGSTV N1 VET +24 391
#note maybe i should play vegete. hopefully i'll draw at least one vowel and he can't bingo. he might score a lot on column N but i think i'll still win a lot of the time? also VETS is a lot better than my play. i was actually worried he'd do something like DEY if i played off my S but i'm giving him another lane rather than shut the only bingo lane, but i'm only up by 13. and then i started worrying about JO N2 with him having the other 2 Os or whatever, and i had like 50 seconds on my clock. scrabble is hard.
>JD: ALNOOPR 1C PRONO.AL +61 415
>JD: ALNOOPR --  -61 354
#note he was really low on time, so I was hoping for a scenario where he tried to play through and went over, or maybe that he would give me a spot for polaron or something crazy. I don't mind this try, but the best legitimate path to victory that quackle comes up with is fishing the O and trying to draw the blank, which gives me ALPHORN or PLASTRON if I hit it. Even then, he can still block if he's clever enough by playing YOWES at 2K. It's also very interesting to see where I should fish - instead of HO for 15, fishing LO at 6L for 2 gives me a shot at stealing the game if I draw the S or the blank (ASP at bottom-left while also blocking JEE at N6). Complicated! Incidentally, PRONOTAL# is good in CSW, as is PORTOLAN#.
>Ceasar: ?EEGJSS 1E JES. +11 402
#note the rest of this is just equity bleeding, i ran out of time and freaked out
>JD: ALNOOPR O2 NAP +17 371
#note best play is WALLOP at 6J if he spots ESPY, I was just trying to block STOGEY for the easy out.
>Ceasar: ?EGOSY 8L ..YS +24 426
#note espy obviously
