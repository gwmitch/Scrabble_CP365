>Matthew_Larocque: EEINOOU -EIOOU +0 0
#note Keeping EIN sims about equal which I didn't expect.
>Brian_Guilbault: AEEOZ 8D ZOEAE +48 48
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENRTT 9E ENTREAT +68 68
#note Totally forgot RATTEEN was a word too. This bingo scores best and sims best.
>Brian_Guilbault: BDLO 10J BOLD +25 73
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIIRTV L10 .IVID +18 86
#note Used up too much time on this play, something like 5 minutes - I finally see (L)IVID after all that. Thankfully it finishes well ahead of anything else.
>Brian_Guilbault: KLOO H4 LOOK.. +11 84
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEORTT M13 DOT +17 103
#note Saw the 7 immediately and realised it wasn't going to play. Did not know TERATO(I)D, my eights are still pretty bad.
>Brian_Guilbault: AEEGINR M3 REGAINE. +74 158
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHPRTT L4 PATH +36 139
#note TERAPH is a cool alternative, but I think RET is worth the 4 point drop.
>Brian_Guilbault: QU 5J QU.. +28 186
>Matthew_Larocque: AAERSTW N5 SWEAT +55 194
#note This is probably my favourite play of the tournament, it just fit so perfectly. The really good thing is the lack of As in the bag, making this much lower risk than SWEAR.
>Brian_Guilbault: MNU K13 MUN +15 201
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEJRVY J12 RAJ +61 255
#note That seriously happened. I almost wanted to apologize to Brian.
>Brian_Guilbault: ?PY O8 YaP +41 242
#note Brian commented that he HAD to play something to take it out. So it was reasonable to guess that the other blank was still in the bag.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEUUVY -EEUUVY +0 255
#note Of course, regardless of what was in the bag, there's no way to play through this disaster.
>Brian_Guilbault: CEINOR 12D CORNIE. +20 262
#note Interesting, Brian going for blind turnover here. It's very unlikely that anymore bingos will be played - will come down to the heavy scoring tiles and that huge JUDO hotspot.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEFIMO 15H MOA. +29 284
#note FOEMA(N)! I didn't know it. Something really peculiar that comes up a lot - whenever I learn a new word, it will often show up somewhere such as in a newspaper or some type of online article soon after I learn it. It's like my brain is more likely to remember a word if I see it in Scrabble first.
>Brian_Guilbault: AFLTY 4D FLAT.Y +24 286
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFIIVW N11 VIEs +44 328
#note With 3 esses unseen, I felt like I had to crunch down here. And I don't foresee the blank doing much else anyways. 3A WIVE still wins the sim by far, with VIEs around 5th/6th.
>Brian_Guilbault: OX 5E OX +31 317
>Matthew_Larocque: EFIILRW 6E WE +25 353
#note I'm starting to run out of time, and I notice that this sets up RIF next turn so I just slap it down. 
>Brian_Guilbault: AH 11E HA +22 339
>Matthew_Larocque: FIILNRS 3C RIF +27 380
>Brian_Guilbault: BDU 3I BUD +19 358
#note Brian comments that it's not looking good for him. It doesn't help that the esses are completely weak on this board.
>Matthew_Larocque: IIILNSS J5 .I +13 393
#note Sets up S(K)IS next turn while leaving a letter in the bag... although I'm not sure that it will matter much because neither of us can go out quickly. 11E (HA)IL finishes best via simulation, while champ favours 7G S(K)I.
>Brian_Guilbault: CGS H11 C.G +6 364
>Matthew_Larocque: IILNNSS 7H .IS +20 413
#note I randomly change my mind and keep the second S, because I think it's better to play S(AT)I next turn. Obviously if I had time to do the math, I'd realise that this is vastly inferior.... just take 26 points and next turn I can play NIL for 12.
>Brian_Guilbault: EEGRSU 2A SEER +16 380
>Matthew_Larocque: ILNNS 2J NIL +12 425
#note Now I play NIL, realising that keeping the S didn't add any benefit..... except I didn't even come close to seeing the newly available INS for 20!
>Brian_Guilbault: GU G2 GU. +5 385
>Brian_Guilbault:  (NS) +4 389
#note I wasn't quite able to get my NIL play down in time to avoid the -10. I'm still practicing my quick tile laying skills haha.
