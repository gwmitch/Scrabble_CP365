#note I went into the tank on this turn. I think D11 JO does a few good things. It limits gigantic 4+ tile plays down the A column to the triple. It keeps about as decent of a leave as I can get with this rack. It scores OK. I did JOB to keep the TAXON scoring possibility alive, but that's worth nowhere near 7 points (and maybe worth nothing at all, since I'm only drawing two tiles to a rack that isn't likely to play words hooking TAXON anyway).

#note Quackle likes cashing the S hook now, but I don't think it's too bad to wait one more turn.

#note Decent pool to keep 1C/3V. Also thought about DAB and DIB in the same spot. I liked how DAK forced RI- bingos from 14H instead of allowing both RI- and RE- bingos like DAB, but for whatever reason DIB allowing neither of those didn't occur to me.

#note One of the worst wins, but at least it wins and I even added numbers together to ensure that it did, which constitutes progress. For some reason C-sticking didn't occur to me.
