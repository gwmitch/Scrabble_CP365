>Winter: EEFKOOU 9G KEEF +29 29
#note OOU is not that bad a leave, if I draw an N or a T, and I decide the points (underscored as 25) are worth it.
>Rich_Moyer: ENRSW L4 WRENS +26 38
>Winter: IIINOOU -IIIOOU +0 29
#note Nope. Cannot play thru this. Not gonna happen.
>Rich_Moyer: EGIV 5H GIVE. +18 56
>Winter: AABDHIN H1 AHIN. +30 59
#note Ah, bad mistake with serious consequences. Too focused on ING.
>Rich_Moyer: EX G2 EX +39 95
#note I pay dearly.
>Winter: ABDDLTT 1F BL.T +16 75
>Rich_Moyer: CGNO 3E CO..NG +17 112
>Winter: AADDIOT 7F DATO +16 91
#note Another mistake.
>Rich_Moyer: EMM 6E MEM +18 130
>Winter: AADITUY 10B YAUTIA +25 116
#note Fervently wishing that excellent tiles will finally come out of the bag after this turnover, when what I should have been doing was noticing the 39-point underlapping play.
>Rich_Moyer: EJPRY C9 J.PERY +52 182
#note And again, my suboptimal play benefits Rich.
>Winter: DEFNRUV 11G FUNDER +30 146
#note One more time--can I draw a few killer tiles, a bingo before the board closes up?

Wrong question, of course. The correct question is--what is the best play, and for the third time this game, I missed it.
>Rich_Moyer: HU 5D UH +24 206
>Winter: AIIINUV -IIIUV +0 146
#note If I had left ERV, I could not have drawn this dreck.
>Rich_Moyer: ATZ 12B Z.TA +26 232
>Winter: ADLNOQR B12 .OA +36 182
#note Wow. Missing a ridiculous number of plays this game, though in this case, I'm sure Rich had the ess.
>Rich_Moyer: ACG L10 C.AG +14 246
>Winter: DLLNQRR -DLLQR +0 182
#note So the question becomes, if you can feel it in your gut that Rich has the ess, do you still play TRANQ (of course, I'd have had to see it).

Quackle would.
>Rich_Moyer: EST 13J TE.S +10 256
#note Nice to have Es and esses to spare is EXACTLY the WRONG way to think about the game.
>Winter: IINNORR 4A IRON +14 196
>Rich_Moyer: DEIW B2 WI.ED +26 282
>Winter: ILNORUV 6K L.V +8 204
#note Keep trying, never give up, although the game doesn't really look winnable because of that spot for the Q. If there was a chance that Rich could get Q stuck, a low scoring bingo along that bottom line might win it.
>Rich_Moyer: AIIL N3 ILIA +15 297
>Winter: ?ILNORU 14E LINUROn +65 269
#note Too little, too late.
