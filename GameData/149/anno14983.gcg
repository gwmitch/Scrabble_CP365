#note I have no idea what to do here, the best try I could see was trying to fish for BAPTIZED/R/S. 12/253 shot at it. however, something I didn't think of is trying to keep the AM and fish for ADVENTURISM! I could just play ZIT this turn. he will most likely still outscore me, but if he plays for low scores trying to block maybe I have a half chance...

#note didn't spot BENEFIT at 15I, but I don't see if that really gives me a chance. I liked my play because it gives me a shot at PARTIZAN which might actually win me the game, or TOPAZINE I guess. but cesar can block anyway.
