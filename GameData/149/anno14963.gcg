#note I like this better than AGENCY for defensive purposes.
>cesar: ?ADEJOS J6 JO. +27 27
>rafi: EEFNRSW K7 F.WER +27 57
#note Considered WAFER but didn't think of FEW underlapping CAGEY. I like how FEW keeps things closed and threatens a bingo with my S hook while saving the R to improve my ENS leave.
>cesar: ?ADEEHS 10E HAErED.S +67 94
#note i spent WAY too long on this play, missed ADHErERS too, but didn't even consider not bingoing. i don't actually need to bingo here. J10 HE catches me up and i get another shot at a big triple bingo. (-12.5)
>rafi: CINNSTT 11D TINT +22 79
>cesar: ABBOTUZ 9E ABBOT +40 134
#note hehe, rafi told me he was astonished after this play. it was kind of spelled out for me though. Rafi: CESAR IS AMAZING Cesar: lol
>rafi: CDENNSX -III +0 79
#note This play was brutal for me. I originally put down WEND, but couldn't bring myself to play it as Cesar can react appropriately and block my S hook. WEND is simming best on 4-ply, but Quackle doesn't have Cesar's knowledge that I'm probably setting up an S.
>cesar: DEILOUZ -DUO +0 134
#note :/ how did i not even see DUI? DUO is probably ok too. although i just hated giving him a higher-scoring lane. i actually don't know if those are right, but exchanging has to be wrong. so does WED. do i just do DUI here and suck it up? really, i have no clue what's right. also DEIZ > EILZ. (-11)

>rafi: DEOOOPY 5C .OOPY +22 167
>cesar: AGIILTU L3 GUILT. +26 199
#note i think i overdrew here and he threw something decent in. lucky i still have a good move. el pato likes agility a little better though.
>rafi: DENOOWX B6 WO. +29 196
>cesar: AACDIIM A3 MICA +15 214
#note this is a poor move. first off, if i want to block a big score here i can do A3 AMIA for a better leave. however A6 ADZ is actually prety good. the awesome play here though is 3J MAGI. (-7)
>rafi: DENORTX 6L .OX +26 222
>cesar: ADINRTU 3E ANTIDRU. +63 277
#note that was lucky
>rafi: DEINQRT 5K Q. +22 244
#note Well there's my I...
>cesar: EIINOVV 4F ION +18 295
#note jesus, vomica!! (-14.5) i'm so bad at closed boards, i'm leaking equity everywhere.
>rafi: DEIINRT N6 .I +9 253
#note Only 4 tiles in addition to the blank can play after the I, so there's a decent chance this spot is unblockable, and some blocks might allow for overlap bingoes. I guess INDEX is another option.
>cesar: ?EIKPVV -KVV +0 295
#note quackle didn't find the best move by far here, sKIVE. shoots up to the top by win% once we put it in. i was way too low on time here after messing around with the haeredes rack, abbot, duolize and mica.. i need to get faster at hard decisions. that's why i like more open boards. decisions are easier. so here, where sKIVE is obvious, all i saw was junk, i thought of sKIP for a fraction of a second but said nah, i'll bingo back...
>rafi: ADEINRT O7 TRAINED +79 332
>cesar: ?EIOPRS 13H PRISOnE. +72 367
#note i really really wanted to play PORES here, but thought it too unlikely that he was going to have KINS on his rack (indeed it's 0.6% of the time). i wouldn't have had to worry about it if i'd found SPhEROID though. i still got a good chance to win.
>rafi: EIKLNSV N10 KIN.S +58 390
#note cesar: as unlucky as that is, if i'd found vomica or sKIVE this would be a different game
>cesar: AAELLMR 2H LA +8 375
#note what? many-ply says i have a 67% chance of winning after 12L MANE? bollocks. H1 MAIN is 56%, also bollocks? :/ also, i ran out of time. (-40%)
>rafi: EFHLUVV J12 V.VE +18 408
#note VIVE can lose if I draw an L! Once I made sure there were no bingoes in the pool, I played this pretty fast because Cesar was under a minute.
>cesar: AEELMRU 15E RELUM. +24 399
#note -3 relume
>rafi: AFHLU 14E AH +28 436
#note HALF/HAD
>cesar: AE B2 AE +8 407
#note Cesar had 0:00 showing before he played this, and managed to get it down without going over... but the E was upside down. -10 for overtime :) Cesar: I kept complaining about this game at dinner. I would have been 8-0 most likely if i'd found skive!
