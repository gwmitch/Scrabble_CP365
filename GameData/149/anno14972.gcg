#note Lucky to open with a bingo in such an important game.

>Rafi: AHINNOV J4 NOH +32 106
>Cesar: ADEMTUY J10 YAUD +32 80
>Rafi: AEEEINV 7C VENAE +18 124
#note Wasn't sure what to do here. Some other plays that Quackle came up with are EVA(D)E, NIEVE(S), EVE(S), (D)EVA, and EN(D)IVE. Thought about EAVES but for some reason was concered about the hooks. Looking at it now, EAVES also does a nice job closing the board if Cesar doesn't have a great rack and I beat him to YAUDS. Saving the N with EI is also a plus. EAVES wins the sim.

>Rafi: ?EEIORV 1B VO.ERInE +86 210
>Cesar: AACEIRS B1 .AC +16 174
#note nooooo!! i missed a cesar bingo. i spent a very long time on this rack looking through the T, the R, the E--N (almost caesarian), the D, that by the time i gave up on it i only had given the V a cursory look. why do i suck :( also PIA is a better leave.
>Rafi: EFGOORZ 2H ORZO +36 246
#note Would have played ZOO to set up for REIF or REEF next turn, but after I fish I think I'm better off blocking the second best lane.
>Cesar: AEEIRSU 3B .U.E +12 186
#note maybe cutie
>Rafi: BEFGJPT L4 EFT +27 273
>Cesar: AACEIRS C6 A.ARICES +82 268
#note Originally scored as 86, which would make a difference later. Cesar: LOL. i'm not missing it twice
>Rafi: BGJPRST 10B J.B +28 301
#note GPRST hits more bingoes than BPRST.
>Cesar: DEIMOSU A3 SODIUM +37 305
#note MEDUSOID, but 1K DUOMI is also better than SODIUM. (by a lot) -21934393289239892349
>Rafi: EGLPRST E9 GELT +23 324
>Cesar: AAEHLNR 1K HALER +32 337
>Rafi: APRSTXY 3K PRY +31 355
#note I was happy with my play, setting up AX for next turn, but if I do it backwards with AX first, I score an additional 8 points! I might need to take care of the YAUDS spot first though. Missed PYX, which is another good option.
>Cesar: ABEINOW L10 WON +25 362
#note i saw WOE in the same spot but considering the bag i felt like WON was better. only 4 vowels to draw. i had a faint worry that he had kept the X with PRY. quackle likes B12 BOW best, and i think i would have played that if i was thinking better. (-0.5) L10 WOE/B12 BOW sim almost identically
>Rafi: ?AKSTWX 2M AX +42 397
#note Felt super confident after drawing the blank despite not having a vowel. How is Cesar going to beat me without an S for YAUDS and with the Q unseen?
>Cesar: ABEGINT O1 .EBATING +96 458
#note NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
>Rafi: ?KQSTTW N6 Qi +62 459
#note Oh whew, this means that if I lose I just have to not lose by 120ish next game to win the tourney.
>Cesar: IILO B12 OIL +10 468
#note I recounted the game during Cesar's turn and noticed the 4-point AVARICES error with Cesar down to only 3 minutes! Cesar: i have like three thousand 100% wins here. I saw all of them. I didn't see TSK though.
>Rafi: KSTTW 15A TSK +25 484
>Cesar: I I8 .I +5 473
#note An amazing way to wrap up an amazing tourney. Cesar: luckily, I'm a fairly well-balanced individual, or I'd let this game haunt me forever. There is no sleep now, only TSKS.
>Cesar:  (TW) +10 483
