#note I keep forgetting that this is not a word. The thought certainly passed through my mind though

#note Alright fine, I'll exchange! Kept the X as it scores 36 with every vowel at 3G

#note Didn't want to play BLESS as he would probably block off (KINO)S. I guess I should probablt play BLEST here, which I passed up for some reason.
>Will_Robertson: AHVY 2K H.AVY +28 342
>Kevin_Bowerman: ENOSSTT 1A .ONTESTS +83 367
#note Was extremely close to playing TESTONS here, but I couldn't remember whether or not STETSON had an anagram. Luckily, I took the time, and played the word I knew for sure.
>Will_Robertson: IQ B9 QI +20 362
>Kevin_Bowerman: AAEJOTU 14D .AJ +26 393
#note Should probably play A(Y)E here, as he is very likely to have a good play there, and to score well while dropping some vowels. Champ says A(Y)E wins 4/8 endgames, while this only wins 3/8 endgames.
>Will_Robertson: ADHIMPR O1 R.AH +42 404
>Will_Robertson: ADHIMPR --  -42 362
#note Huge break here. H(Y)DRA(E) and 9H DRAM are the only winning plays, and definitely are not easy to see.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AAEOTU O1 A.E +18 411
#note OAT turns out 13 points better than this, as it threatens EAU to go out.
>Will_Robertson: ADHIMPR 9I DAH +22 384
>Kevin_Bowerman: AOTU 15F OUT +18 429
#note Should play A(B) first (-3).
