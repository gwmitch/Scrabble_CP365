>Siddharth_Murali: Q I7 Q. +21 21
#note He played this in about 2 seconds.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AELRSSX 9E LAXES +36 50
#note What to do here? LAX for 22 sims best, but isn't too far ahead of this. X(I) also sims well, which severely limits his options for next turn, and leaves the board in great shape for a bingo of my own. Is this a missed opportunity?

>Kevin_Bowerman: DJORTTT F6 JOR.. +30 305
#note Almost played (MA)JOR here, but whenever I see that word, I immediately see its anagram. What luck that this was available for even more!
>Siddharth_Murali: ?DELOS H11 .OLE +8 160
#note He said he had every hook for this, except for one D.
>Kevin_Bowerman: DNNTTTY H11 ....D +27 332
#note And that D was sitting on my rack. This sims best, despite the terrible leave, and telegraphing to him that I don't have a single vowel.

>Kevin_Bowerman: NNTTTY 14G T.NTY +10 342
#note Can't quite make out my last tile here. It was one of AEHI. Scored as 9
>Siddharth_Murali: ?DSUU 13G U.U +11 199
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEHINOT H4 HIE +22 364
#note Sims well. If I add in the inference of DS? (which I got the D/S from (V)OLE and the blank from all of his last few plays.) then it sims a tiny bit better.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?DEIPRS C2 DIaPERS +74 273
>Kevin_Bowerman: ACEHNOT 15K ANCHO +38 402
#note I like this word a lot, and it has some challenged potential too. I definitely need to block this spot, as AZINE here could bring things a lot closer. Sims best
>Siddharth_Murali: ABIN -  +0 273
#note Challenged.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEEOTUZ B1 ZOA +32 434
#note Completely whiffed on ZETA. He could almost have had the chance to play (Z)IBELINE if I had! That word was played on at least 3 other occassions in division 2 this year.
>Siddharth_Murali: ABIN 12D NIB +24 297
>Kevin_Bowerman: EEELTUW D1 WELT +31 465
#note (a)WEE (-4)
>Siddharth_Murali: AAEFN I3 FA +14 311
#note (W)AE sets up an unblockable FAN to go out next turn! That's a really cool sequence.
>Kevin_Bowerman: EEU 6L .EU +8 473
>Siddharth_Murali: AEN 9L .ANE +7 318
#note He scored 7 somewhere. I played pretty well for my standards this game, but didn't have too many very hard decisions.
>Siddharth_Murali:  (E) +2 320
