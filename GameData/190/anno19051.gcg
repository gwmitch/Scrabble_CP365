>Jeff_Cook: AIPRT 8H ATRIP +20 20
>Kevin_Bowerman: AIMOORV L8 .AVIOR +22 22
#note Liked this more than VA(R)OOM. Sim has them about even, giving the edge to this.
>Jeff_Cook: CGLOTT 11G GLOTT.C +20 40
#note Nice play. I can't remember whether or not I held here, but I certainly was not sure that this was a word.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?DIMMNO 9F MOMI +17 39
#note MIDMON(T)h is very tough to spot. Did not know MIN(I)M
>Jeff_Cook: ISX 14J XIS +38 78
#note Scored as 39.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?ADEJNY 10D JAY +36 75
>Jeff_Cook: ABEU 15G BEAU +27 105
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?DDEEEN J1 DEfENDE. +65 140
#note I somehow was not sure on either NEEDlED or EmENDED. NEEDlED is better than this, but EmENDED give up R(EmENDED). This sims second.
>Jeff_Cook: EILOO 1J .OOLIE +24 129
>Kevin_Bowerman: INNRRRS D10 .INN +22 162
#note Should probably just exchange here, but was scared of the J for some reason. Exchanging down to INRS sims best. Not a huge error.
>Jeff_Cook: ?EGGPSU 4E PUGGr.ES +76 205
#note Nice play, only bingo. I held and released this.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ACERRRS H1 CRA. +21 183
#note What to do here? This sims best, but (P)ARR is another good option that I missed. Mainly just considered this and (E)RR, and decided this had to be better.
>Jeff_Cook: BKU 13B BU.K +20 225
>Kevin_Bowerman: EEHORRS 5C HOE +20 203
#note Massive error, but I simply did not know RE(D)HORSE. I also missed SE(N)HOR, which scores 39 keeping ER. Blowing a huge amount of win% on this play alone.
>Jeff_Cook: EIV 6B VIE +21 246
>Kevin_Bowerman: AERRSWZ 14F ZA +35 238
#note Sims best, but WA(U)R, (I)ZAR and W(HI)Z are also great options.
>Jeff_Cook: ELST 14A LETS +30 276
>Kevin_Bowerman: ENORRSW 3B REWON +23 261
#note Missed (f)ROWN. This isn't that great of an option, but I needed to keep scoring.
>Jeff_Cook: AHRT 2L RATH +27 303
#note Very bad news for me now. (f)ROWN would have helped a bunch here.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ANORSWY 15A OY +29 290
#note Blowing a bunch more win% here, 2A ROWAN would help a lot here. 
>Jeff_Cook: DFU 13G FUD +25 328
>Kevin_Bowerman: AINQRSW 11C Q.S +28 318
#note (R)AW, fishing for QIN[D/T]ARS seems to be my only possible way to win here, although he can just block.
>Jeff_Cook: EEFILNT 6F LINE. +8 336
#note I actually would have hit QINDARS in this particular situation, but of course he would have just blocked it
>Kevin_Bowerman: AADINRW 9A WARD +23 341
#note Best.
>Jeff_Cook: EFT 13K T.EF +16 352
#note Plain and simple, I did not deserve to win this game based on how I play. Props to Jeff on a well deserved win!
>Jeff_Cook:  (AIN) +6 358
