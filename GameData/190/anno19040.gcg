>Kevin_Bowerman: BEEIKOZ 7I BIZ +27 27
#note Wasn't really sure what do do here. Sim likes K(Y)E, which looks pretty good. This is not.
>Tasha_Asberry: IRT K4 RIT. +26 40
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?EEKNOU J2 KUE +19 46
#note Somehow missed KUNE. Not off to a good start.
>Tasha_Asberry: DEX 9H DEX +24 64
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?EFJLNO L1 JOLE +44 90
#note JEON is a bit better. Rushing things too much.
>Tasha_Asberry: III -III +0 64
#note Exchange 3
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?FGNRUV G5 VUG. +11 101
#note Didn't even consider FUG(U)! The two options sim almost evenly.
>Tasha_Asberry: ADE 1L .ADE +36 100
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?AEFNRT L7 ENgRAFT +85 186
#note Nice draw.
>Tasha_Asberry: EINORW N1 .OWNIER +26 126
#note (K)N(O)WER is sick!
>Kevin_Bowerman: AENPRTU O5 TREPAN +30 216
#note Whoops, ENTRAP. (U)NAP(T) is also really nice, and sims best
>Tasha_Asberry: FILOSS 14J FOSSIL +44 170
#note Turns out I probably could have played (U)NAP(T) last turn and she wouldn't have been able to take the triple, as this play means she probably does not have an E (FLOSSIE or FLOSSIE(R))
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEIMPUY 15E PYEMIA +44 260
#note Another 6 tile play leaving a U! However, this time it is correct.
>Tasha_Asberry: BI F14 B. +13 183
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?DGHSUU N9 HUG +18 278
#note Spent a very long time here. This sims best, so I'd say that it was time well spent.
>Tasha_Asberry: DEIINRT 10B NITRIDE +66 249
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?ADNOSU D6 OUtS.AND +66 344
#note She challenged immediately here, thinking it was only STANDOUT. This is not a good play, as SqUAD(R)ON, ADjOU(R)NS, pANDOU(R)S and cANDOU(R)S are all available as 2x2's, as well as many other higher scoring bingos.
>Tasha_Asberry: AHO -  +0 249
#note Challenged.
>Kevin_Bowerman: CCELNST 6B CL.T +12 356
#note No clue how I came to this decision. I think I wanted to block her lanes, which this does fairly well, but CE(L)L is a lot better. I can't know for sure that she does not have a bingo after OUtS(T)AND, as she challenged almost immediately.
>Tasha_Asberry: AHO O12 HA.O +33 282
>Kevin_Bowerman: CENOQSW F9 Q. +11 367
#note Quackle says to keep the Q here, and play WON(t)/NOW(t)
>Tasha_Asberry: AIM K10 AMI +25 307
>Kevin_Bowerman: CENOSTW C4 OW. +6 373
#note Quackle thinks that fishing the W with W(ERE) or W(IT) is a little better, but I don't see how. This is 3rd on many ply, and one of the few plays with a supposedly 100% winning chance. Happy I saw this option. This also blocks the only possible bingo that she could have, OVER(C)LEA(N). That would have been heartbreaking to see come down, as I did not notice it over the board.
>Tasha_Asberry: AEILORV 13C I.EAL +22 329
#note Right idea to block CA(N)TEENS, but she did not see that and said she thought she was blocking CE(N)TANES* in case it was a word. O(I)LIER is 50(!!!) points better, as she is V stuck after this.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ACEENST 3B SCAN +30 403
#note -10000 to V sticking her. Whoops.
>Tasha_Asberry: ORV D2 V.R +16 345
>Kevin_Bowerman: EET 2D .EE +10 413
#note (B)EE is 2 points better. Not my best endgame.
>Tasha_Asberry: O 3L .O. +12 357
>Tasha_Asberry:  (T) +2 359
