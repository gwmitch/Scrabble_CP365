#note After all my word knowledge mistakes, I was starting to doubt myself on fives, thus passing up MURRA.  On the plus side, I somehow scored this as 14 and Greg didn't notice.

>Charles_Reinke: DIILOTV L1 VI.ID +26 202
#note It was close between this and C9 VI(V)ID; in the end, I disliked making the B10 hotspot even hotter with VIVID.  I should have seen L1 VI(R)OID.

>Charles_Reinke: CDENNST 1H .ED +20 267
#note Even with all the vowels in the pool, the leave of CNNST is not worth scoring just 20 points for.  With two blanks out, I had to make a decision whether I wanted to open up the board with something like 13C SCEND; I opted not to.  E9 NE(W)T looks best.

>Charles_Reinke: CEENNOT A6 CENTO +25 322
#note Demonstrating further how bad I am at evaluating ways to get back into the game on a closed board.  Greg will probably play through the X next turn, and if he doesn't already have a blank, he will be very careful about not opening up bingo lines.  L11 X(E)NON takes away his immediate scoring spot and opens up some juicy lines for me.  With Greg likely in possession of at least one blank, thinks don't look good for me no matter what I play.
>Greg_Heidler: I L11 .I +18 350
>Charles_Reinke: AADEENU E8 UN +22 344
#note Awful play which leaves me with almost no chance to win, as I will almost never bingo with this leave.  It does get me close in score, but with so few viable scoring opportunities on the board, it's very unlikely that I will be able to outscore Greg.  The correct play is E8 UNA(W)ED, a word I don't know but would have really come in handy here (I saw it but couldn't risk a phony).  Given the scoring errors earlier, my scoresheet reads 346-348 here.
>Greg_Heidler: EN 12B ..NE +17 367
>Charles_Reinke: AADEEHO E11 ..D +7 351
#note Having mistracked, I think the pool is ABEGLR?? instead of AEGLRS??.  So, if there's a blank in the bag, Greg won't be bingoing.  Sound reasoning, but ultimately meaningless; the reality of the situation is that Greg will always bingo out, so I should just take the points.  A funny, yet appropriate, end to a wildly misplayed game.
>Greg_Heidler: ??AEGLS 13H GLAsSEs +74 441

#note Final score: 353-459.  Mood after the game: blissful ignorance of the magnitude of my blunders.
