>Puneet_Sharma: AEGIRTW 8G GAW +14 14
#note Probably just play WAG for the hook
>Brad: CV H7 V.C +8 8
>Puneet_Sharma: AEEEIRT 9G I.E +17 31
#note Best.
>Brad: OZ 10F ZO +35 43
>Puneet_Sharma: AEEMRTT E8 MEAT +24 55
#note Best.
>Brad: EEIIRST 7H .ERITIES +70 113
>Puneet_Sharma: DEERTTU D3 UTTERED +76 131
#note Hmm, TRUSTEED.
>Brad: AABCIOP 2B COPAIBA +91 204
#note Great play by Brad.
>Puneet_Sharma: EFHIILU 1H HUI +33 164
#note Best; setting up the F for a big play.
>Brad: INOOR O4 ORI.ON +21 225
>Puneet_Sharma: EEFGILR K4 FIL.GREE +98 262
#note Well, the F setup was not needed on this turn!
>Brad: EY J10 YE +28 253
#note Brad mentioned he had a bingo which could have changed the flow of the game at this juncture. 
>Puneet_Sharma: ?AENNOO 3F OON +17 279
#note Missed ENTOzOAN @ 5B and 4B
>Brad: ?ADISTU 12B oUTSAID +75 328
#note Brad could have played this underneath YE and FILIGREE
>Puneet_Sharma: ?ABEEIN 5B BE.AINEs +68 347
#note Best
>Brad: NX C1 N.X +38 366
>Puneet_Sharma: AKOPRSY N6 K.Y +41 388
#note I saw POKY @ L1 but chose to play this; probably not the right thing to do. Didn't see POKEY at N4 which is the best play as per Quackle.
>Brad: EHRSW 12K SHREW +43 409
>Puneet_Sharma: AAFOPRS O12 .ARP +27 415
#note Keeping the F for later; did not want to setup the A or the O on M2 for a big J play to the triple. 
>Brad: DLN 6C L.ND +20 429
>Puneet_Sharma: AEFOSTU 2J FOUET +45 460
>Puneet_Sharma: ADGQS (challenge) +5 465
#note Quackle kicks FOUAT better than FOUET, infact, it likes FOU more than FOUET. I don't like FOUAT for the same reason as earlier, didn't want to setup a play on row 1. Got the 5 points challeng as well. 
>Brad: JLLMNOV C11 V.LN +14 443
>Puneet_Sharma: ADGQS L1 S.Q +13 478
#note Didn't see an end in 2 turns if played QUA. 

Also, seems like there was an extra E unless i mistracked the tiles.
>Brad: AJLMO N10 JO. +26 469
>Puneet_Sharma: ADG M11 D.AG +15 493
>Puneet_Sharma:  (ALM) +10 503
#note Got lucky with some timely plays!
