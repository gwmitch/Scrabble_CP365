#note Spent forever, but did find the highest-scoring bingo.  4C DIAlECT is probably better for defensive reasons.

#note Misadded Sal's score here as 202, which was never corrected.

#note Another play which I took ages to make; however, this time around, I seriously screw up.  With five E's and five I's in the bag, I thought I could draw into 8A SENSORI(A) from my leave of NORSS.  13I MONS is best by far; it scores and opens up an S hook for me.
>Sal_Piro: III -III +0 280
>Charles_Reinke: EENORSS N5 .ONE +17 387
#note In the same vain as last turn, I can do 13I EONS to set up another S spot.

#note 8A MO(T) is best.  I didn't play it because I wasn't 100% that there wasn't an eight through an M with the pool of EIIILOORVW.  I did successfully find all the possible sevens in the pool and made this play knowing that I wasn't setting anything up for Sal.
