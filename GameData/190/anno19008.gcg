>Joshua_Sokol: BDDQSTU -BDD +0 0
#note From the get-go things were interesting in this underdog vs overdog showdown at the Scrabble chokefest in Buffalo! Many options look close. The only option that scores more than 0 is SUQ. It's quite defensive, and if my opponent does not have an I, I'm alright despite my leave. Unfortunately he doesn't have an I less than half of the time. 

Exch BDDT is a tad safer but it doesn't score enough next turns or bingo enough to be worth doing over exch BDD, in my opinion.

exch BBDQU is very close to this as well because ST bingos more often and is a bit safer, but the scoring potential of QUST seems to override that.
