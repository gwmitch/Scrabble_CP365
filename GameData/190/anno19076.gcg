>Joshua_Sokol: AIINNYZ H4 ZAYIN +54 54
#note Josh: I actually completely missed ZINNIA, not that it's a better play...
>Charles_Reinke: AAAEESW I4 AWA +27 27
>Joshua_Sokol: ?INNRRX J2 NIX +31 85
#note I only saw NIX or G7 XI here. I much preferred the leave after NIX and felt like J4 was just as, if not more, dangerous than G7, so there was no real benefit to playing XI. I missed, on the other hand, the interesting prospect of playing 5G R(AW)IN for 16, which makes sure I don't get stuck playing for 10 points next turn, but also gives me an easy 28-point fishing option if that spot stays open. It's interesting, cause I do want the board to be open for my blank to be useful. I still like my albeit standard play best.
>Charles_Reinke: ADEEOSV 5H ..ED +27 54
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CGNNRR 5F GN.... +11 96
#note I felt I still had good bingo potential next turn and that this made sure there were a minimum of options for Charles that didn't open something nice up for me. 
>Charles_Reinke: AELORSV 4H ...ES +45 99
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CHHNRR 7F CH. +12 108
#note Same train of thought as last move. I hoped he didn't have another S, which isn't something to necessarily infer from his last play, although it seems more likely than average.
>Charles_Reinke: AELNORV F7 .LOVER +19 118
#note This might be too aggressive, but I was tired of making tiny plays.  2J (N)OVEL is a slight improvement.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EHMNRR E11 HERN +26 134
#note I keep forcing myself to make plays that would be much much better if I had an S, but I only have a blank. I didn't want to play HERM because of HERMA. It's very likely he has an A at this point, and besides, I prefer MR? to NR? if it's a close game, since even though it's less bingoey, it gets me out of many situations where NR? would mess up my scoring prospects as a leave. I was also confused cause I was getting vibes that Charles had an S but other vibes that he really didn't.
>Charles_Reinke: AACEEGN G12 ACE +11 129
#note I just had CARAGEEN blocked, and I spent 10 minutes to come up with this (which I underscored by 1).  I didn't really like this play but there aren't many better options.  14B AGE(N)E is one I didn't see.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEEMMR 2D MEMBRa.E +69 203
#note I kept on thinking I had REREMEMBER* until he played ACE. I don't think I would have tried it though, since I thought that probably only REMEMBERER is good, and I've checked before. But it's a 10, not a 9. I felt the volatility of this play matched the volatility of Charles' last play well, so that I could keep scoring with my lead. Also, I didn't know COMEMBER, but I don't really like playing that even though it's more points due to everything it opens for swift bingo comebacks.
>Charles_Reinke: ADEGNOY 1A YOGA +32 161
#note Question: is 43 points too many to pass up?  Answer: yes.  1A DOGEY.  At least I save the D for ACE(D)...
>Joshua_Sokol: DIIOOSU 15F ODIOUS +28 231
#note I think I have to play this and take away the big spot.
>Charles_Reinke: ADENPTT 1K ADEPT +32 193
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIJLPS 9C JAL.PS +44 275
#note Scored as 42.

Josh: I felt I should just score a lot and close some stuff rather than play 3B JAIL for leave purposes. I stand by it though I understand the thought process behind JAIL.
>Charles_Reinke: EFINSTT 3C FIT +19 212
#note 11E (HE)FT keeps a superior EINST leave.  Even with five unseen I's, it's less likely to go awry than ENST.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIKRUU K11 KURU. +18 293
#note hello other blank... I think I saw 4A KIER but I felt this had so many more superior traits, blocking the most likely lane, keeping a much better leave, etc., but again, I understand the rationale behind KIER or even C9 JUKU. Some people are better at playing offense in this position, whereas I think defense is the best route to take, especially since the more turns that pass that Charles cannot bingo, the more frustrated he is likely to get and this will affect his play. This position is still a very interesting and clear fork in the road between scoring and running away with the lead vs. keeping the board open and keeping the best leave possible to counter offense with offense vs. playing bingo defense and being able to respond to the most comeback options.
>Charles_Reinke: DEGNSTV 12J G.V +14 226
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIIOQU 14A QUOI. +28 321
#note With this play now I sense an imminent bingo, so I decide to play something that both allows me to bingo back a good amount of the time, or, in the scenarios where this is not possible, have a guaranteed 33 points. That's if he bingos. If he doesn't, well I might have something up my sleeve for those scenarios as well. It's not ideal to hand Charles a guaranteed 40 points a large majority of the time, but the benefits are so heavy for my own sake.
>Charles_Reinke: DEFNRST 4B FED +33 259
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EILOTW 15A IT +41 362
#note I missed something I vaguely remember, can you find it? 
>Charles_Reinke: INRRSTT D8 R.NTS +26 285
#note No more fishing.  The best I could do is dump the R and hope for one of AAEEEOOO.

Josh: although Charles should probably play TR(A)ITS given the sheer volume of vowels left in the pool, which include two more I's.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEILOW 3L OWE +14 376
#note I felt I should block the P and the T and set up something for myself now that the last S is gone. But I should probably just score with B5 EWE or 2A OW and make sure nothing freakish occurs.
>Charles_Reinke: BIIORTT B4 .IB +14 299
#note Why would i give him a sweet new bingo lane?  Is it because I, deep down, WANT to lose by a lot, thus garnering sympathy from my fellow Scrabble player?  Probably.

Josh: Well, this play did indeed mess my preendgame up a lot, and made me make my typical huge mistake in a game I was playing pretty well... So it was the right play :)
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEILLN A6 ALIEN +19 395
#note And there it is, missing 2 really high prob 7s and another less high probber that I chickened out of. Congrats to me. There wasn't even anything playable for Charles and I just got so paranoid and messed everything up...
>Charles_Reinke: EIOORTT L9 TRI.ET +19 318
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AL N1 .L.At +12 407
#note I had no time left here, -4 to 1G aAL.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (OO) +4 411
#note Charles - Final: 409-317.  My only bingoless game of the tournament.

Josh - Don't fool yourselves into believing I deserved this win!
