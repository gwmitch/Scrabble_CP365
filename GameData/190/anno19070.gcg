>Charles_Reinke: EEGIINU --  -20 81
#note DIEING, GIEING, HIEING, PIEING, TIEING, no VIEING.  Kudos to Brian for being confident enough to challenge a 20-point play that looks reasonable (to me at least).
>Brian_Galebach: AAB E10 BAA +17 95
>Charles_Reinke: EEGIINU I5 ....ING +21 102
#note L3 GENIE, which was also the play last turn.  This scores the second-highest of my available plays, but EEIU is nauseating.

>Charles_Reinke: BEEIOSU 11I .IBE +14 116
#note I should just go for points with L2 BOUSE, since the S isn't especially useful on this board.  A number of other plays are better than this as well, but I was totally stumped by this position.

#note Oops.  N6 SO(U)RNeSS.  Not only does that score a lot of points (duh), but it also blocks Brian's best bingos.
>Brian_Galebach: ?ADEENR O1 ADhEREN. +77 324
>Charles_Reinke: ?NORRSS 5B SORN.R +12 271
#note I need another bingo line - otherwise Brian will just block row 14.

#note Final: 388-410.  I played exceptionally poorly for most of the game and was rewarded for my incompetence with a W.
