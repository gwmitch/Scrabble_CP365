>Bernard_Gotlieb: AORRW H7 ROW +12 12
#note Both of us are 6-0 going into this game. He told me after the game that he should have played ARROW here.
>Kevin_Bowerman: BCEEFKS 6F FECK +30 30
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEIRU G9 AUREI +13 25
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?BELPST 5D PLEB +25 55
#note EP(I)BLaST is available, didn't know it. This and BLE(E)P are alternating as best choice in the sim, although I think I like BLE(E)P a bit more.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AI 7H .IA +11 36
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?CEIOST 11E CO.dITES +86 141
#note One of the many 2x2s available.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EIL D3 LI.E +12 48
>Kevin_Bowerman: AAEGINT 3C A.GINATE +72 213
#note I used my mind powers to make him give me that L
>Bernard_Gotlieb: BDEIS 2J BIDES +38 86
>Kevin_Bowerman: JLNNNTU 13F J.NN +12 225
#note Though about this, UL(A)N, JUN, and NUN. Sim likes JUN 2A
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AGMNO 14B MANGO +31 117
>Kevin_Bowerman: ALNOTUY 15F YOU +31 256
#note LAYOUT plays for 41 at 8J. YULAN looks good here, although I did not spot it.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AETZ 15A ZETA +51 168
>Kevin_Bowerman: AIILNNT 1K LININ +28 284
#note ANILIN has a very nice fit at 4G
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?DEEIPS L5 DISPEr.E +76 244
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEGORTV 8L .ROG +21 305
#note Should definitely play VEG at 13A here. Sim and Champ both seem to really like 13K GROVE here, but there's no way I'm doing that.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: HOY 2F HOY +37 281
>Kevin_Bowerman: AAEETTV 13A VET +23 328
#note Not playing ETA here.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: OW 4H WO +24 305
>Kevin_Bowerman: AAELRTX K4 RAX +35 363
#note I tacked on the R because I had mistracked, and thought there were 3 left. This still jumps to the top of the sim.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: FHO 2A FOH +23 328
>Kevin_Bowerman: AAELRTU N7 L.UR +6 369
#note This doesn't sim too badly, which sort of suprises me. ETA sims best, but I was paranoid of QU(O)D for some reason, even though I saw the multitude of places to play SUQ. I liked keeping ETA in reserve, with it being so hard to block.

#note Did not see QAD(I)

#note D(U)E(T) is a beautiful play (-4).
