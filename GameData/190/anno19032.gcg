#note I spent a while here, and settled on this play. Not very good at all. I somehow managed to miss FEH for 30, which would have made this a much easier play.
>George_Asaka: Q 7F Q. +22 156
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEHIJLW 11K HAJ +38 101
#note There weren't too many I's left, so I opted not to tack it on. Sim agrees.
>George_Asaka: INO 13H ION +11 167
>Kevin_Bowerman: EEIILUW N10 WILE +29 130
#note Not the draw I was hoping for. Sim likes this, and then (F)U(T)ILE.
>George_Asaka: ?AAINRY 4H .AIRYmAN +74 241
#note I held this for a while, but ultimately decided it had to be a word.

>Kevin_Bowerman: ?DIMOPU 14L MUD +30 210
#note UPDO is an improvement. So is PUD
>George_Asaka: ANV 15K VAN +14 285
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?IOPSSX H7 S.X +31 241
#note Sim likes (BIZE)S. So do I, but I didn't see it. 13L OP(E)S is a great fit.
>George_Asaka: ELNPU 1D PLUN.E +12 297
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?EIOPSY 14B YIPS +28 269
#note Did not know POESY. Can't blame myself too much for that one, but I should have considered (O)Y more seriously. Don't know why I didn't like it so much, I guess I didn't pay too much attention to what it kept.
>George_Asaka: BGO 13A GOB +25 322
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?AEEORT 2C OE +6 275
#note Huge mistake missing both pE(R)ORATE and OvE(R)RATE. A(E)ROmETE(R) and (P)ORTErA(G)E are also available. This is very bad.
>George_Asaka: ANRT 3C RANT +17 339
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?AEHORT J2 TH.OuREA +62 337
#note Wow, I was sure I was missing something that scored more here. Maybe I should play HOER/HOAR at 4A. Champ and sim both adore HAT, and dislike this a lot.
>George_Asaka: DFLOSTT 11C FL.T. +10 349
>Kevin_Bowerman: CEENUVW 4A EVEN +31 368
#note Very low on time, I make a bad play. WEEN is 6 points better.
