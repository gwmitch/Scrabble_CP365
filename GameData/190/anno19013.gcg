#note Finally! The last game of the day! I need a nap. 
>Joey_Krafchick: AHI I7 AHI +35 35
>Matt_Canik: DDELNRY -DDELNRY +0 38
#note Q prefers (ZA)NY by a lot. I didn't see any of my tiles doing anything on this board so I justdecided to grab some new stuff. Maybe I can pull an S, which will give me an advantage. 
>Joey_Krafchick: Y 8G Y.. +9 44
#note Interesting... he's bingo prone?
>Matt_Canik: EEELNRS 9G E..LE +19 57
#note I think I need to make this play though
>Joey_Krafchick: AGIMQRU K2 QUAGMIR. +90 134
#note Joey: "I can't believe that happened". 
>Matt_Canik: DEGNRST L9 DREG +26 83
#note Initially set down STR(A)NGED* and then was like "no that's not a word". Good call me!
>Joey_Krafchick: OVW 11I WOV. +20 154
>Matt_Canik: CFLNSTV 4J C.LF +18 101
#note Joey now knows that I held NST. I drew FLCV, so he still knows I'm holding NST. I went from one of the worst 4-tile draws I could have imagined...
>Joey_Krafchick: EIW M2 WI.E +20 174
>Matt_Canik: EEINSTV 12C TENSIVE +83 184
#note ...to one of the best 3-tile draws I can imagine!
>Joey_Krafchick: IIMO E9 IMI.O +14 188
>Matt_Canik: AEJKLPT D7 JAKE +26 210
#note hurts the board really badly, which is something I want against Joey I think. If he pulls a bingo it's scoring 63 points and giving me a TWS to work with
>Joey_Krafchick: ?AFINOT N5 FAcTION +68 256
>Matt_Canik: EGLOPTU O1 GLOUT +27 237
#note Whoa, PUTLOG
>Joey_Krafchick: INY H12 .INY +30 286

>Joey_Krafchick: AET F6 TEA +29 338
>Matt_Canik: ADENRST 14J TANRE. +20 325
#note NIB then TEA implies to me that he was pretty bingo prone the last two turns... I think my best shot to win this game is to score a lot, hope joey has one-pointers or makes a low-scoring fish, and I outrun him. 
>Joey_Krafchick: ?BDOPSU 15E DOP. +10 348
#note Joey's actual rack. would like to hear his reasoning here...
>Matt_Canik: DLNORST 3A TROL.NDS +72 397
#note I think I have to bingo here. Right?
>Joey_Krafchick: ?BERSSU B2 B.UShERS +68 416
#note BUTTRESS. Joey misses a 3x3 on his last rack against me for the 2nd time in 4 games.
