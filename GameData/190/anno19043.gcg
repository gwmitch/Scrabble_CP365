#note Sims best, although MOA is another good option. I always find it hard to sacrifice so many points on these sorts of plays. Scored as 36.

#note Didn't know VALG(O)ID at the time, which is clearly best. I think I played this over GAV(O)T to open a better lane, and to keep GI for row 15. After 2000 iterations, GAV(O)T is beating this by a tiny bit.

#note He seemed mad that I was able to hit that spot, possibly putting him on edge? I put him on an I after this play, which turned out correct. However, B(i)Z is a lot better that this, I just whiffed on it.

#note Champ says (HE)NS. I was really scared of row 1 for some reason. This isn't that good of a play.
>John_Merlau: AENRTTU -  +0 338
#note There was not a win for him with this on the board, so he challenged.
