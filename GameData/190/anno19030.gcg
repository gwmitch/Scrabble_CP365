>Gunther_Jacobi: ADNNO 8D DONNA +16 16
>Kevin_Bowerman: ACINOTW 7C COW +19 19
#note Plays burning OW sim above this, but turnover was a big theme for me at this tourney.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AA 7G AA +8 24
>Kevin_Bowerman: AGINPTY 9E PAY +32 51
#note The board is very hard to play on after this, which I usually prefer. This is also just a lot better in valuation than any other play.
>Gunther_Jacobi: II -II +0 24
>Kevin_Bowerman: BGINTTV -BGTV +0 51
#note Did not want to play through here at all. I knew keeping the G here too would probably be better, but I wanted a little more turnover. Quackle brings up the neat suggestions of exchanging V/TV for bingos with B(AA).
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABEEINT 6H BETAINE +68 92
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEIINTU J3 UIN.AITE +60 111
#note Lucky to have this available.
>Gunther_Jacobi: HMSU 10C MUSH +40 132
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?EHKNTW 4H WH.TEN +32 143
#note Debated between this and TH(I)NK for awhile, but opted for the turnover, and to not give points from the K. Q also likes W(I)NK, which I wasn't a huge fan of.
>Gunther_Jacobi: GOR H1 GRO. +24 156
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?DKNOQT C10 .ONK +20 163
#note I should probably just exchange, this is a very bad board to have no vowels on.
>Gunther_Jacobi: CEIORU 2B COURIE. +22 178
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?DILOQT D1 Q.OD +48 211
>Gunther_Jacobi: AFFY 3L YAFF +35 213
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?BILTTX O1 LI.T +24 235
#note Didn't see (O)BIT, which I would have played, but this beats it by a fair amount in the sim.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEILMSS O6 SLIME +31 244
#note Told me his rack afterwards. He says he did not know SAMIELS, but missed SEISMAL. He spent a very long time on this turn
>Kevin_Bowerman: ??BOTXZ N10 BOrTZ +52 287
#note Big break here. I would have spent a lot of time on this turn on the pre - SLIME board
>Gunther_Jacobi: AELPRST 5A PLASTER +83 327
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?DEIJRX 12A JI.XED +58 345
#note Sims best. I admittedly missed EX(P)IReD here, but this and JI(N)X destroy that in a sim.
>Gunther_Jacobi: EER A12 .EER +33 360
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?ELRUVV A5 .ERV +27 372
#note Champ says L(E)V wins the most, at about 60%. This wins about 57%
>Gunther_Jacobi: DGGIIOR 12J GRIG.I +16 376
#note Correct. Nice play.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?AELSUV 15A .EVALUeS +83 455
#note Also correct. But much easier.
>Kevin_Bowerman:  (DO) +6 461
