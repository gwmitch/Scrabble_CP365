>Richard_Spence: EEHSSUU -ESUU +0 0
#note A poor exchange. Keeping EHSS is better.
>Scott_Garner: IPTY 8G PITY +18 18
>Richard_Spence: EEGHMRS 7H HEM +24 24
#note Best play. I was one off from M(Y)NHEERS which would've been cool.
>Scott_Garner: KOW 6F WOK +28 46
>Richard_Spence: EEFGJRS K4 JEFE +37 61
#note Lol, played JEFE in first two rounds.
>Scott_Garner: AIL 4K .AIL +22 68
>Richard_Spence: EGHIPRS O1 PHIS +43 104
#note I initially throw down HIPS, then change it to PHIS mostly since the vowel was next to the DWS. Unfortunately I paid a stiff price.
>Scott_Garner: EINTZ 2J ZENIT. +76 144
#note Ouch...
>Richard_Spence: DEGLORU 5E GOD +18 122
#note Best play

>Richard_Spence: ABDFLNY 15A B.ANDY +39 268
#note I wasn't 100% sure on DRABLY, which would've been the best play.

>Richard_Spence: ACEILNV D1 VI.L +22 328
#note I didn't see any 7's (there are none). Opening up the board might've been a better choice, but there isn't really a way to do that without closing other spots or sacrificing spread.
>Scott_Garner: ACDDORU H1 DAU. +21 416
>Richard_Spence: ACCENOT J7 ..C +10 338
#note Hoping to hit a bingo on row 13 or 14, but fat chance.
>Scott_Garner: DGOORRR D11 ..R +6 422
>Richard_Spence: ACEGNOT 13A A.E.T +18 356
#note Unfortunately, COGNATE/COAGENT don't play so I sort of give up. I didn't play OY since he's guaranteed to block. I see TOROIDS/DISROOT but not STRIDOR. Wow. Ultimately I should've played COY.
>Scott_Garner: DIORRST 12F STRIDOR +75 497
>Scott_Garner:  (CGNOO) +16 513
#note Not sure if this game was winnable, but I could've easily reduced the spread. Oh well. 0-2 -389 is not the best way to start Nationals.
