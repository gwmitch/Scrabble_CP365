#note Another game in which I was a complete emotional wreck. This game is of tremendous importance, because if I win, I would be 6-9, putting me in the position where winning my final game of the day wouldn't put me in such a bad spot. (Okay, I guess I can just make up a reason why EVERY game is so important). Also, I have never beaten Dave in many tries, so this was especially tense.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?QRSUWY 8D QUeRY +52 52
#note A big error to start. I only saw SUQ and QUeRY as options, so I thought this play was worth it. Then, after the game, I asked David Gibson what he would do with this opening rack, and he said 'WRY?', and I was like, 'D'oh'. But yeah, I often like to ask Gibson about opening rack plays because....
He seems to bingo within the first 3 turns every game! In our 9 tries, he bingoed on the 1st/2nd turn 7 times, and the 3rd twice. But it doesn't end there folks.
I was sitting right next to him during this game (and two more), and the first time he bingoed both on the 1st/2nd turn, next game on the 1st turn, and next game on the 2nd!
Oh, and I was speaking to Tim Bottroff after the games ended. He played Gibson 3 times during this tourney (exclusive of the 3 games I watched), and Gibson bingoed on the 1st turn once, and the 2nd turn twice. Absolutely sick.
>David_Leifer: ALORRSU D5 ROR.UALS +84 84
#note This is clearly the worst case scenario as a result of my play. I told David Gibson what happened as a result of me not playing his WRY suggestion, and he was in absolute shock. LOL
>Siddharth_Murali: BIOOSUW E10 WOO +23 75
>David_Leifer: AEHZ C2 HAZE +34 118
#note Interesting that Dave played this over the higher scoring and more defensive placement on the other side.
>Siddharth_Murali: BEIKMSU 8A MIS..... +63 138
#note Way better than any of my legitimate options. It isn't terribly implausible either. Basically I figured that Dave always kicks my butt every time we play and I really need to make a move on getting some sort of lead, which is obviously horrible reasoning. He held, but I was fortunate that he didn't challenge.
>David_Leifer: ?DIMOOS 13E DOMInOS +70 188
#note 7F looks way better. This is actually a significant error by Dave, but maybe he just whiffed the spot.
>Siddharth_Murali: BEEKRTU H12 K.BE +45 183
>David_Leifer: AEEN 12G A.ENE +18 206
#note Dave spent a long time on this play, probably because he was torn between dumping some vowels for score and not giving back an easy S lane. He knew there was only one S in the pool though,so he took this calculated risk.
>Siddharth_Murali: DEORSTU L6 REDOUTS +90 273
#note I strategically drew the case S! When I started to lay this down, Dave said 'Oh no, oh no, oh no, there was only 1 ess left'. And then he seemed discouraged to the point where he went, 'You're going to win anyway, so I'll challenge'
>David_Leifer: AEGITU -  +0 206
>Siddharth_Murali: CDLOPTW K4 PLOW +25 298
#note Grrrrrr missed HAZEL/PLOW for like 2344587 more equity. Very, very frustrating. I'm capable of making good plays, but I make plays like these when I'm super stressed out. Sometimes I wonder if next year I'll still be a bottom 1700 player, because plays like these leave me hopeless.

>Siddharth_Murali: ACDTTTV 15D VATT.D +14 312
>David_Leifer: AEJN L1 JANE +54 286
#note After he made this play, I became an absolute nervous wreck. Could I possibly choke this one too?
>Siddharth_Murali: ACEFGNT 2B C.ANGE +32 344
#note Please don't ask why the hell I missed AWEE this turn. Geesh, it's absolutely embarrassing. I'm assuming if I was 9-6 at this point instead of 6-9 I'd play FAG in a heartbeat. This is like a 13 point mistake, and it's mainly my emotional instability to blame.
>David_Leifer: HIT 1G HIT +23 309
>Siddharth_Murali: FLTXY 6J F...Y +27 371
#note Disn't write down my full rack here. Of course, even without this FLAWY is miles better than FORTY. Instead, I let Dave get right back in the game with an amazing chance to win. Again, I'm capable of making plays like FLAWY and defending a lead, but when I'm doing this badly in a tournament (similar to Albany), I completely lose my mojo.
>David_Leifer: AEGIINR A8 .IGRAINE +86 395
#note Well deserved. Now he takes a sizable lead and now I feel like a total idiot.
>Siddharth_Murali: ADIILNX 3G XI +38 409
#note Fortunately I have this play available.
>David_Leifer: BERV F6 BR.VE +25 420
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEFILN 6A FID. +28 437
#note Before this play, I have 19 monutes left, and Dave only has something like 6. This is because after the 5th turn, we realized that the clock never reset (in other words, we were hitting our clocks w/o even seeing the time!). So we both agreed to set it back to 25 after 5 turns. Nevertheless, I spent most of my thinking time on his clock, and I have plenty of time to muster up a good sequence. 
I spent 8 minutes here, and this IS the best play (woohoo!) winning with 5 out of 8 possible draws. I'm pretty happy to say that I got this 1-in-the bag/8 possibility scenario correct.
>David_Leifer: EILNOPT 11J OP. +23 443
#note There is one, and only one winning play here, and it only wins by one- can you find it?
>Siddharth_Murali: ACELN H6 AC.L +9 446
#note I spent another 7 minutes on this play, ensuring that I don't screw it up. This is one of 5 winning plays, with the others winning by 1, 4, 5, and 9. I should have found the better plays with so much time remaining but I saw that this got the job done, so I went for it.
>David_Leifer: EILNT 14K TILE +14 457
>Siddharth_Murali: EN B14 EN +10 456
#note Whew.
I played horribly, but fortunately got bailed out and didn't have to add this game to the L column.
