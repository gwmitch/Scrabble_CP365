>Richard_Johnson: AEIMNOU 8D MIAOU +20 20
#note Club game.  This was Richard's actual rack.  
>Jim_Burlant: IKLNNOV E7 V.OLIN +18 18
#note Not much else to do with this; it's this word, either here or at E4, and this option doesn't generate vowel placement issues.  It's best.
>Richard_Johnson: CEIRW 12C WI.CER +24 44
>Jim_Burlant: HIIKNTT 9H THINK +18 36
#note Not really sure what to do with this amd the kibbitzer confirms my options are all so-so.  I considered WHIT/WITH C12 and couldn't wrap my arms around slotting the triple while keeping the K.  I saw RINK H12 and didn't think the HITT leave was that good.  I saw this, saw that it cleaned out the clunk and gave nothing back at O8, so I put this down.  Best is apparently a play I never considered:  C9 NITWIT for 20.  
>Richard_Johnson: BCEHL 11G BELCH +30 74
>Jim_Burlant: AGILNST M7 LASTING +84 120
#note STALING/SALTING M9 score 82 but slot the triple.  This scores 84 and is safer.  'Nuff said.  67% to win.
>Richard_Johnson: DEFNOU L2 FONDUE +22 96
>Jim_Burlant: EEFIISW 2J WI.ES +38 158
#note The only other play I considered was 5H WIFED 24 and I didn't think that it was worth gving up 14 points on the scoreboard to keep the S.  2F FIFES is just as good in Quackle's eyes  71.7% to win.
>Richard_Johnson: APX 1M PAX +42 138
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: EEFIOVY C9 VIE.Y +36 194
#note Best.  Next best play is WIFEY J2 22, and that wins 5% less often than this.
>Richard_Johnson: EP 8M .PE +15 153
>Jim_Burlant: ADEFGOS 3I DEF.G +46 240
#note Initially saw FADO 1G then looked for the better play.  Once I saw FOG, I realized DEFOG would score huge.  Q agrees - this is best.  Burning the S with DEFOGS for 51 wins 1% less often and sims 3 points down.
>Richard_Johnson: AEINRRT 1E TRAINER +83 236
>Jim_Burlant: AORSTTT O5 ATT.STOR +59 299
#note TESTATOR also plays at O7, but it's way too dangerous considering the unseen S.  This is best - still in the driver's seat at 80% to win.
>Richard_Johnson: BMO B13 MOB +21 257
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIOO 15A O.OE +21 320
#note Geez...that is NOT the draw I was looking for, that's for sure.  21 tiles are unseen, and there are two consonants for every vowel.  As ugly as this is, I don't think there's a need to exchange.  Championship Player and the sim disagree with each other.  The sim thinks OBIA 15A is best, followed by exchange 7,  followed by this.  According to the sim, OBIA wins 65.5%, exchange 7 64.44, and this 64.3, with this trailing OBIA by not quite 2 points.  Championship Player says exchanging 6 keeping an I is best, winning 62.1%, and that this is the runner up, winning 61.4 at a huge equity deficit.  Tough call.
>Richard_Johnson: ADEZ 14D DAZE +37 294
>Jim_Burlant: AADEINQ 15F AND +25 345
#note His play of DAZE was the game changer, and I took a LONG time here.  I was figuring to shut down rows 4 and 5 with QAID 5I (or QADI 5J).  But, now that he's opened row 15 I thought the main priority was stopping easy 7's like ARGUERS and forcing him to find an 8 (granted, the D is pretty easy for him to hit).  Given that this choice took away row 15 and left me with any number of Q plays, I felt the Q had to wait.  The sim and Championship Player completely disaagree.   Championship Player says I should have played NAIAD 15G 20 to give myself as many chances as I can to draw a U or blank.  That wins 56%, and this doesn't even cross its kibbitzer's radar.  The sim says I should just cash the q  on row 2 with QADI for 30.  Not sure what I'd do if  I had this turn to do again.  We replayed 4 or 5 different iterations of this sequence post-mortem, and the consolation:  given how the end racks panned out, anything I did here was moot and no matter how I sliced it I kept losing close end games.
>Richard_Johnson: ??ORSUU 5E UnSOURe. +78 372
#note And my defense does me in.  He told me post-mortem that the only reason he found this was that my play of AND had blocked the RaUcOUS bingo he was going to put down'; had I left row 15 alone he'd have played for 70 instead of 78.  Regardless, this is an absoltuely terrific find by Richard:  a pair of U's and two blanks in the same rack.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIJQR 13H AJAR +22 367
#note While the first priority was to block the LEGGY out, the better play would have been HAJ K11 to set up an unblockable QI 14J on the next turn.  That said, no matter how I sliced it, this end game wasn't winnable and the final spread was going to be close.
