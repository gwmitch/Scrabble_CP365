#note Quackle says to burn the blank with PeRCH. Those types of moves are so hard for me to make, but 42 points blocking (ZIN)?, keeping RT seems great here. The cameras were filiming/taking pictures of this game, and having them see a 42 point play early in the game burning the blank would be amazing.

#note Wasn't 100% on WA(M)US for some reason, and I thought it was a bit riskier than it actually is. Not a huge error, but every play counts.
