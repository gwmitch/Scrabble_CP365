#note Challenging a valid five is a good way to start the game.

#note Missing (Z)OUK and a bunch of other good plays is pretty bad too.

#note I passed up FORINT because I valued the OR leave over a leave of just an A.  However, the A is useful for plays making (Z), so I'm not sure.

#note Bingoing seems unlikely on this board.  I did just open up column C a little bit, which is why this was chosen over 6D V(A)C, but the D and the V are not synergistic.

#note Maddy's play made me extremely paranoid, as it should.  Since I was so focused on playing in column N or O, I totally overlooked 2B D(ET)OX, which allows me to outrun any bingo.  Both these plays win nearly always.

#note Well, I seriously misplayed the start of the game, but nobody ever said there was justice in Scrabble (or, if somebody ever did say such a thing, they were wrong).
