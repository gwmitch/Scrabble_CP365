#note Wasn't sure enough on FUNKER, so I played this.
>Robb_Griffith: AAOPRRT 5G PRORATA +74 223
#note Yeah, I really thought this was no good, but didn't want ZO(N)ED to get denied. Should still challenge, as I have FEZ as a backup.

#note Might as well try for some extra spread here, as he can't block all of my bingos next turn. I would like to think that I would have played ESc(A)PEES if I had seen it during this turn.

#note Quackle likes YAGI, but I liked blocking these lanes, and leaving a 37 point play for next turn.
