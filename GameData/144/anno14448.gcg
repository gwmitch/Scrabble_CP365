>Matt_Canik: BEJPQRS E7 J.BER +28 28
#note I gave a lot of thought to exchanging, but decided to run with points because this board as it stands doesn't like bingos. Q's got em neck and neck.
>Jim_Burlant: HO F8 .OH +31 61
>Matt_Canik: EILPQSV 12A VEILS +39 67
#note I felt like QIS had a shitty leave and offered really cheap big comebacks. Q puts QIS 4 points ahead of this.

#note Toss the P back because I don't see it doing anything for me on this board. 
>Jim_Burlant: AACDGIL H6 GA. +7 167

>Matt_Canik: AEEFRRU C9 FE +20 129
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEIIL 7H .ECIDIAL +63 230
#note Wait did he really just do that?
>Matt_Canik: AEEMRRU O4 MAU.ER +33 162
>Jim_Burlant: AEHSSUX 6K SAX +24 254
#note He set down HUE N2 first, then played this. That telegraphed another S to me, and he confirmed that after the game. 
>Matt_Canik: BEIPRTT 5I TIP +20 182
#note "of course... the P..."
>Jim_Burlant: EGHOSU J7 .OUGH +15 269

#note Yikes. HERTZ.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AENNSU 4D dUENNAS +68 337
#note Well now I lose. 
>Matt_Canik: AGORTVZ K11 AZO +34 234
#note Only two As unseen in a lot of tiles, so I'm not that scared of a stack here, and this opens stuff for some desperation plays. 
>Jim_Burlant: AOR L11 OAR +36 373
#note Oh yeah of course he has it
>Matt_Canik: EGKRTTV M12 GET +27 261

#note Yeah this'll get blocked, it's just frustrated desperation
>Jim_Burlant: ENTV 2F VENT +22 433
>Matt_Canik: ?ELRSTT 10L RETS +19 290
#note Thinking about fishing for (DE)RELICTS here, but then I decide to just try to score 300.
