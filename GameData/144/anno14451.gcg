>Jack: AGHQTXY J4 TAX +53 77
#note I considered HY(R)AX because of how volatile TAX (or AX) is. Opponent scores about 45 on average when I play AX or TAX and about 38 when I play HY(R)AX. TAX/AX seem like the easy plays... does anyone think HYRAX is better?

>Jack: AGHNQRY E7 Q. +11 88
#note I think this was Quackle's least favorite turn of mine... it's kinda far down in Champ's or Sim's rankings, about 5% back. It likes GHA(R)RY (by a lot) and then HAY(I)NG, and HYR(AX). I do like gharry -- it goes through 5 tiles, scores well, gives back very little, and kills a lot of lanes. This could be a pretty big mistake.

>Jack: AAGHNRY F4 HAY +32 120
#note I've been simming and asking champ player and AYAH F3, RAYAH, AYAH H12, YAH, and HAY are all up there. I think for the most part though, HAY is not quite as good as the rest since I don't have any of the hooks where as AYAH and YAH I do. I'm not walking away from this analysis feeling like I know which play was the right one, though. Any opinions?
>Dan: ABLRV 10F V.RBAL +21 139
>Jack: ADEFGNR E3 DEF +31 151
#note Champ player likes GANEF best followed by DEF but Sim doesn't like GANEF. DEF is right, right? 

Side note: can someone explain to me the difference between sim and champ (how they analyze plays) because they often are very different, especially toward the end of the game.
>Dan: AEIIINT 12D INI.IATE +68 207
>Jack: AAGNRST 3K .AG +22 173
#note Champ likes SNAG/STAG, but like last turn, sim very much disagrees with that. Sim has JAG +2%. I like that it opens a lane with my S and has a superb leave (especially with all those E's out). JAG is the best play right?

>Jack: ?AANOYZ D4 YA +35 279
#note Agaaaaaiin,  champ player likes taking those points with ZOEAe/s/l, but sim disagrees and likes YA by 1%. I keep siding with the sim. Should I take the points? It would stop the next play from happening.. (Opponent bingo% after YA = .12 but after ZOEA. it's .002. Wow!) Thoughts? 
>Dan: ?DEGMNO 14H MONG.rED +76 359
#note Q likes 14F significantly more than 14H. Interesting. 
>Jack: ?ANNOUZ 15G ZONA +55 334
#note I didn't consider playing anything else... other than I really liked the aesthetic fit of ZON(E) 13I.  
>Dan: EMO O12 MO.E +30 389
>Jack: ?DNORTU 3B TUR. +16 350
#note Champ likes this by 8%. Wow! Sim likes UDON 13C and (A)T L3 for .5% over TUR(D). Where does sim expect me to bingo after those though? Is there something I'm missing? 
>Dan: ENSW L1 WE.NS +36 425
>Jack: ?DEFGNO 13A FEOD +19 369
#note I was tempted to fish for one of the 3 I's or the 1 R for FORE(W)ING, but... yeah. I need another lane since bingoing through the W is hard and blocking the T is pretty easy. Champ likes FEOD best by .7%. Sim likes GOWNED a lot, which I saw but passed up quickly. FEOD is pretty much nowhere to be seen in Sim's list. This turn is huge though and I think the right play can allow me to win. With 3 I's still I didn't mind keeping NG? although any ING bingoes won't be playable through my FEOD lane. Maybe it's important to keep the E with only one E left? I knew I needed to open a lane though? Good Scrabble players: help.
>Dan: IIIOPRS 1L .OPS +27 452
#note Looks like (T)ORII is pretty darn good. 
>Jack: ?CEGLNU A13 .UG +21 390
#note CaN(F)UL, ENGUL(F), CaGE(F)UL, etc.... I didn't find anything good here because I went a minute over looking for a bingo and then went in rush mode trying not to go over another one.
