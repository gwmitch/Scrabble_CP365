#note Here's where I spaz and blow my chance at a win. Low of time, I just couldn't focus enough to find my winning lines of play and decided to hope my opponent would screw up and allow a random phony. Stupid. None of my available plays win very often, but they give me a chance. Don't even feel like talking about this one. What an awful game from me!
