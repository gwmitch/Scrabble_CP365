#note Shit. Huge miss.

#note Pay double for this mistake.
>Winter: ?EHLNRS F1 EH +27 248
#note Hate to give up the E, but scoring kept the momentum, and there's still plenty in the bag.

>Winter: ?ACELSV 15E VELA +35 343
#note Saw VALSE, but that leaves me C?, and limited scoring opportunities. The way I saw the math VELA for 35 + a shot at 19 by hooking KNIT, or 18 off the D. I could not have seen his play, because I don't know it.

>Winter: ?CES 5D CEd.S +21 364
#note Damn, so close. I don't usually lose games in which I have both blanks, and I really bolloxed this one.

Wait... what's that you say? I really won the game? Well, no, because on turn 8, BIO, I added up 157 and 19 and wrote 186, and even though I was verying the scores, Evan kept reporting back the wrong score.

I really need to stop making these scoring mistakes, and I wish that my goddamn opponents wouldn't make the exact same scoring mistakes in the exact same place as me!!!

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!
