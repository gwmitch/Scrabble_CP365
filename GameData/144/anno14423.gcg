>Amalan_Iyengar: ?BGHNRU 7E HUB +21 21
#note BURG is best, thn BURGH, then HUB. I guess quackle likes the setup with BURG, and BURGH just scores a lot, and they both keep the board a lot more open for a bingo next turn

#note This is justan wul play. I litearaly mised everything. lEUCEMIA is the only bingo, and then CERIUM and UREMIC.Didn't relay know either of those, and thn AECIUM. Didn't realize that from AECIA. MOUE is next. That's obviously WAY better than ME.

>Amalan_Iyengar: ?CCEEIU 11F CU.E +6 246
#note so EUTECTIC is the bingo. Thi play is waaaaaay down on quackle, but it's the only one that really does a good job lcosin the board. UREI here I thinkis the best play I new, as all the other lays above CURE opened the board a lot.

#note SILICONE is best, EXCISION is next
>Andy: APX N4 PAX +39 193
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAFNORT B2 FA +21 339
#note so again, quackle has FA way down. FACTOR here is best, but then it has a lot of plays that either open th board for him to bingo, or they  leave important lanes open. AFAR is next, but that opens the triple lane, and then FAN, which leaves all the lanes open. CAFTAN is decent, and FANO opens the baord still. I'm not sure here. I'm not playing my best here.

>Amalan_Iyengar: ADGNORT 4A AR.O +20 359
