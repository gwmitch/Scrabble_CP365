#note Nice and defensive start. Q likes this.
>Darrell_Day: R H7 R.. +5 19
#note I take this to be a fish, probably with a P.
>Matt_Canik: AEEGIJS 7H .AJ +17 40
#note ...so since I think he's fishing, I really liked this play. He needs the right ending to hit 10A, and that strings a bunch of letters out for me to use. I also thought about JAGS 10E to really hurt his chances of binging...
>Darrell_Day: ABIPQUY K5 QUAY +43 62
#note And then he plays this? The fuck?

He said on R(OM) he had BIPQRUY and did that in case he drew an E for PIQUE/PROM. Threw me for a loop, that's for sure

#note Told me this was the full rack later.
>Matt_Canik: ?AEEOOR 7M ..E +3 214
#note Darrell seems too proud of his last play to not have an S. I'm assuming he has one here and trying to dirsupt. If I draw a consonant, I have a good chance at bingoing next turn I think.

#note Course I see STRIVED/CAROTENES, but I'm so certain ALANE takes an S that I play this for the defense. I was SHOCKED to see this come off, and deserve to lose this game for it.

#note ...of course, just because I DESERVE to lose doesn't mean I can't get ridiculously lucky and win anyway.
