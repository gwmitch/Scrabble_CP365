#note What a lovely position. The sim says to play F9 TENOUR, but I don't want to open an S hook since Adam's had 6 draws to get one. Then there's D6 UTERI. BRUT sims third. I just preferred blocking the easiest scoring and bingoing lanes, knowing Adam will likely have to open a spot for me to play. Strange reasoning, but Adam surely has a well-banaced rack by now.

#note This felt really difficult. I couldn't figure out just how important defence and turnover were. All of the plays score ~30, so the equity is all basically the same. But everything else is completely different with regards to board development. I ended up prioritizing plays that turned over lots of tiles. And keeping the Z felt like a safe bet. Tons of plays sim close. This is 3 points back from 4C RAZED. I have to admit, I would never have played that. Too defensive? Really tough position, IMO.

#note Debated this or QIS. They sim about the same. I liked that this gave me more options next turn than just praying for an ING bingo.
