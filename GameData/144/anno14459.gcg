#note Just to be a dick, I block everything. He shows me his rack is RAILING, then says "I'm just going to sign this now" and signs the results slip. For the rest of the game, I just play as fast as I can so he can leave. I think I missed a Q-stick because I didn't track.

#note FUCK. 

Jim quit keeping both of our scores, and I misread my 4 as a 9, so I gave him 396 on the results slip. 

And I ended the tournament at -15 spread. Un-fucking-believable.
