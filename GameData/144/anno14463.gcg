#note Missed EYELID. Would like to keep the Y for AUDITORY, but nothing worth playing does that.

#note Weird position. Thought about L7 ADMIRAL. It could be the play here because it's too easy to score with row 12 parallel plays after CALAMI/CAMAIL - OVA, OKA, OCA, ORA all fit in there nicely for strong scores.
>Debbie: KRU B2 KUR. +16 270
#note Lucky nothing fit in that spot.
>Will: DEEPRSV 12J EVE +29 319
#note 4 consonants are worrisome, but keeping the V with REP was a little scary too and I get more points.
>Debbie: AJR 11A AJ.R +26 296
>Will: DNOPRSV 3A D.P +12 331
#note Okay, probably not a good play, but I thought DUP was okay to score a couple points, keep my vowel, and retain the V for blocks. Definitely thought about just cashing my S now K5 PONDS or PRODS - PONDS makes an easy scoring spot and PRODS keeps the slightly clunkier NV. Did not see/consider the sim winner, 14F PORNS.
>Debbie: AOTT 14F TO.TA +17 313
>Will: CNORSVY M9 COY +22 353
#note Have to play longer here to gun for more vowels. CONY probably the safest way to do it, though CORNY sims best.
>Debbie: E A3 .E. +10 323
>Will: GNRSTVW -GNVW +0 353
#note I think NST is better here to keep the nice block of N(OVA) in reserve.
>Debbie: INOR 15D IRON. +13 336
>Will: AIORSTT K5 TROIS +18 371
#note L10 TREMOR is a cool play, keeping two vowels would've been nice. Just didn't want to lose to WHINGES/VENINES/ENGINES.
>Debbie: EEINNSW 10M .N +4 340
>Will: AGHTVW 6J W.ATH +27 398
#note Less than a minute left at this point. I think I lose to slow play here, though WRATH beats NEWIES which is all I had time to figure out.
