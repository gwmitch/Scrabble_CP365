>Joshua_Sokol: BDETUXZ H7 ZEBU +30 30
#note Alright, I've never played Cecilia, so let's see what happens. Supposedly I'm supposed to put the Z on H6 here...
>Cecilia_Le: AIQSU 11E QUASI +44 44
>Joshua_Sokol: DGNOTXY 12I DOXY +33 63
>Cecilia_Le: ETV K10 VE.T +28 72
>Joshua_Sokol: FGLNTW F9 FL.NG +11 74
#note I don't remember my full rack here, but FLUNG was definitely wrong. I thought it was more defensive than FLEW or WEFT.
>Cecilia_Le: EJLOU E5 JOULE +29 101
>Joshua_Sokol: ABCISTW 12B CABI. +29 103
#note This seems best.
>Cecilia_Le: AADT I6 DATA +26 127
>Joshua_Sokol: NNORSTW F4 TOWN +39 142
#note Would anyone play OWN?
>Cecilia_Le: ALLRV C8 LARV.L +20 147
>Joshua_Sokol: AFNRRSS 7H ..RF +16 158
#note This is looking pretty good. I have 2 of the 3 S's left in the bag, so I do like this play a lot, although it does open a nice triple spot. My leave is just so good though.
>Cecilia_Le: IMPRS L4 PRISM +41 188
#note Ugh, that's unfortunate.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAINRSS 8L .ANS +18 176
#note Blocked (T)SARINAS. A(M)INS is much stronger here. A(M)AIN also sims well. Mans is a whole 7% down...
>Cecilia_Le: NN 6L .NN +5 193
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIKRRS D12 .IRK +17 193
#note KI G3 sims bestl, but I didn't like keeping two R's and opening up that monster spot.
>Cecilia_Le: DEINP 15A PIN.ED +39 232
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEIRS 8A CE. +15 208
#note ERICAS sims best. CEL isn't too too far behind. I honestly thought I had blocked a bingo.
>Cecilia_Le: ??EGHIO B1 GOEtHIt. +74 306
#note She said she saw (N)EIGHbOr and E(S)OpHaGI as well, chose this one. The only other playable bingos are through the two N's on lane N... :P
Quackle actually prefers not bingoing here. GIE G3 sims best.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIIRS M3 AI +8 216
#note My best moves here win barely 3% of the time.
>Cecilia_Le: AAH A1 AHA +34 340
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEGIRS G3 GIE +18 234
#note Here I go full dumbass and talk myself out of SEDGIER and partially block one of my lanes instead. Actually, GIE is the only play that wins more than 1% of the time, strangely enough. SEDGIER is a big 0.
>Cecilia_Le: OOT 9M TOO +11 351
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIRSTU J12 .UD +10 244
#note (O)UT is best, (O)UD is nowhere to be found.
>Cecilia_Le: EEOORWY 6I .E +9 360
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIRSTT 15H TESTIER +79 323
#note Yay.
>Cecilia_Le: EMOORWY 2K WORMY +29 389
