>Matthew_Larocque: AEGJOUZ 8D GAUZE +34 34
#note I thought about JUG for the ZOA setup, but decided that it wouldn't work out much of the time. She also might try *GAUZED.
>Wendy_McGrath: ELW E6 WE.L +7 7
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEJLOT I3 JOLTED +40 74
#note It doesn't sim much higher than other valid plays, so it was somewhat of an unnecessary risk.
>Wendy_McGrath: AEEG F3 AGEE +14 21
>Matthew_Larocque: AINNOOP 4A POOIN. +24 98
#note I didn't even see the nice ONION overlap, or know the word PANINO. I know POOING!
>Wendy_McGrath: EIIX A4 .IXIE +42 63
>Matthew_Larocque: ACFMNOT B2 CO.F +23 121
#note F(O)OTMAN.
>Wendy_McGrath: NSU 9A SUN +19 82
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEMNTU 3I .AMBE +32 153
#note Wendy seems to have at least one more S, but I'm not going to not play (J)AMBE because of that. Sim results have 10B plays with the M slightly better if I assume the S, though.
>Wendy_McGrath: LPT B8 T.P +13 95
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANNTUV J2 V.N +16 169
#note I feel pretty good at this point with that blank draw.
>Wendy_McGrath: IIII -IIII +0 95
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEINTU L1 Ur.ANITE +72 241
#note Forgot the D hook on JAMBE - AUdIENT plays for 82.
>Wendy_McGrath: CRRS 1K C.RRS +21 116
#note She told me later this was her only s - she was frustrated with no vowels.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGORRR 8L .RGO +15 256
#note Trying to maximize the difficulty in getting a bingo down, so I rejected FROG/FRAG. They both have simiilar win %, but I still like to maximize my spread regardless.
>Wendy_McGrath: AHNT H7 N.ATH +10 126
>Matthew_Larocque: AFIORRV N6 VI.OR +19 275
#note Missed (H)AVIOR, although my play doesn't give her much for scoring.
>Wendy_McGrath: ENT 11H .ENT +14 140
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEFORS H4 FA +21 296
#note I might get another bingo down if she opens. Missed the D hook again.
>Wendy_McGrath: IQ K6 QI +24 164
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEORSS N1 .ES +23 319
#note Holy poop - (NEATH)ERDS! And that D hook would have been nice once again.
>Wendy_McGrath: OW 10H .WO +17 181
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEHORS J10 ..O +3 322
#note This is pretty moronic when I have plays that score well and keep great letters haha, but I also know she'll have a really hard time blocking it. Still, she's gotta open eventually, I should just keep scoring in the meantime.
>Wendy_McGrath: ADTY 12I T.ADY +26 207
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEHRS 13C HAnDERS +82 404
#note I was about to play HERAlDS but then switched to the first bingo I saw that scored 82. Not a good choice with the easy hotspot I created, but I had this bingo challenged recently so who knows *shrugs*.
>Wendy_McGrath: ADEIKLR 12A DRAKE +42 249
#note She's better off to play EH so I can't play AHI.
>Matthew_Larocque: BIILMUY 14B MIB +29 433
>Wendy_McGrath: IL 15A LI +10 259
>Wendy_McGrath:  (ILUY) +14 273
#note She somehow ended with 264, and I lost 10 points to end with 423. I was really happy to finish 7-7, although that still hurt my rating quite a bit. Maybe I will eventually learn when a turn is not worth wasting time on.
