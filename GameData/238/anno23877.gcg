#note this is also the worst play in history. I literally have no idea what I was doing or why I did it but I remember spending like 10 minutes staring at the board before I just made a word

#note CAR seemed like the right play except it walled me in, so I just sort of made up a 5 letter word that opened the board better....
>Andy_Gardner: IQ 5B QI +16 277
>Matt_Canik: AEENRSZ 13K ..ZE +26 223
#note I've got a hook, let's see if he does too? ZE(I)N also looks pretty solid here, but I liked setting up hooks he may not know and threatening 90 point bingos instead of 75 point bingos
>Andy_Gardner: EERT O12 TREE +29 306
>Andy_Gardner: EERT --  -29 277
#note woohoo!
>Matt_Canik: AEGNRSU O8 GENUAS +38 261
#note GENUA is already the plural of GENU, so GENUAS* is phoney. At this point I elect to outrun. TREE came out fast, so I don't think he has a blank.

>Matt_Canik: ABGMNRV J10 V.G +15 276
#note I wanted to hold the B for BAA at 2D. BA(L)M is 30 though... and exchanging 7 draws me blanks a lot (but also UUWY a lot). Hmm...
