#note TEGS doesn't even bingo that much less according to Quackle, but I didn't want to narrow my options to one spot, and -IEST bingos would fit on row 10 with OPT.

#note I admit I  as frustrated at this point. It felt like a bad beat to have to wait till turn 6 to bingo with seemingly solid chances each turn and then have to close the board, which has several good S hooks but with all the esses spent.
