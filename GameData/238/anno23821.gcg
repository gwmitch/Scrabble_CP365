>Will: ?AAADIX 8C ADAXIAl +82 82
>Scott: ABIOSTU I5 BAI.OUTS +61 61
>Will: BFIKLUW 7C KIF +34 116
#note Couldn't pick between KIF and KULFIS, but I think KULFIS is better to block the S and two of the double-doubles and also not keeping UW.
>Scott: CEIJU 12D JUICE. +32 93
>Will: BILORUW J4 BOW +33 149

>Will: EGMNOST L3 G.MSTONE +62 335
>Scott: Q F14 Q. +31 255
>Will: GIORRTV 6B VOG +27 362
#note Truly amazing 3-turn sequence about to go down after this. I thought about GROVE to undouble the Rs with 3 to come, but figured the extra points from VOG and blocking the R were worth it.
>Scott: OTY 9A TOY +25 280
>Will: IRRRRTT -IRRRRTT +0 362
#note Seriously considered TIT for 9 holding RRRR but that leads to disaster scenarios much more often than just exchanging now does. I exchanged seven just to get as many cracks at S? as I could, even if he's likelier to have them after TOY.
>Scott: ?AEELOU 3B ALEUrO.E +68 348
#note Scott can't use the spot and plays his only bingo...
>Will: ADELRST A8 S.ARTLED +140 502
#note And I get this on an exchange 7.
>Scott: DMOY 8K M.ODY +33 381
>Will: AEILRRT O1 LITERAR. +86 588
#note Sure, why not
>Scott: HIPRRTV 14K PITH +25 406
>Will: E B9 .E +8 596
#note I'm all for a good blowout win but it was hard to feel good about this one...I was mostly just bewildered.
>Will:  (RRV) +12 608
