#note Placys on row 10 for 81
>Steve: CEHJMPX N13 HEP +27 135
#note holding the x and hoping to draw an I for MIX in the I column, or XI in the O column. Probably best to just play EX now at i6, or HEX at 10G.

>Steve: CJLMOVX L13 MOC +22 157
>Lloyd: AEINORT 15E ANORETI. +80 220

>Steve: ??EFRUU I1 FUR +11 298
>Lloyd: IS 1H I.S +18 341
#note Lloyd said he played the S to avoid 9L bingos. I thought, wrongly, that he had the case S.
>Steve: ??DEKUY 11K YU.K +26 324
#note Chose this over DUCKY and KEY (g1). But I overlooked the best play g1 DYKE, which Q says is 74 percent to win! Next is KEY, which comes in at 59 percent, after a 3k sim.
>Lloyd: BDEIRRT 5I D...R +6 347
>Steve: ??DEEEO 12J OE +9 333
#note 09 DOsE according to Q, gives the best chance to win, at 50 percent. My play simply doesn't give me a chance, because it doesn't score enuf.

>Steve: ??DEEY 4D DEr.Y +28 361
#note DwEE(B)Y is a little better, but isn't enough.
