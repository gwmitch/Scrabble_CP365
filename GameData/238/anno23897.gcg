>Mike: ABDDGOT H7 GOD +10 10
#note ISC game, taken from 7/14/16. The endgame of this is absolutely insane, hence the uploading. Neither of us played it perfectly since we both were very low on time, but the possibilities are very broad, but require nearly perfect play to find the sequences. Here, I still can't find ADBOT.
>Avery: ?AACEOS 9A CASElOA. +62 62
#note About 15 seconds after playing this, Mike mentions missing CAEOMAS (ROSACEA also for 70)
>Mike: AABBDOT A6 BOB.AT +36 46
>Avery: EILQRVZ B5 QI +19 81
#note Not a bad idea to get rid of the Q, but CP says D8 VEILER. Screw you Quackle
>Mike: ADIJOSU 12A SOJU +38 84
#note Quackle says to just take SAJOU - I lose about 2.5% win chances here after a long sim
>Avery: EEILRVZ C2 LEVI +25 106
>Avery: EEILRVZ --  -25 81
#note A mistake here, even without the phoney. EVILLER as a 2x2 is best. JEEZ is just stupid, but maybe F6 ZERO? VLEI plays here, and is ranked 5th by static.
>Mike: AADEIPT 5B .ADI +28 112
#note When I specify what Mike's exact rack is, this is best by about 5%, but I would never have inferred the right leave after VLEI.
>Avery: EEILRVZ C12 .IVE +28 109
#note ZERO probably still the right choice
>Mike: AAEOPTW 10E AWE +30 142
#note CP says to leave the E off, but I don't mind the closed board here.
>Avery: ELLNRYZ 4C NELLY +26 135
#note C4 LAZY for static... I really hope people don't rely on solely static's choices and then wonder why Quackle suggests it. Learn about valuation and how the number is made - this is a much better play.
>Mike: AEOPTTT C3 A..TTO. +21 163
#note The day I played this game and the day before it, I had this same rack probably 5 times
>Avery: EFKNRUZ 15A KE.F +45 180
>Mike: EEGLOPT D2 GL..E +15 178
#note CP agrees
>Avery: INORRUZ B8 R.N +14 194
#note Well this threw me for a loop - IORUZ is not at all what I inferred here. Not sure exactly what he was going for, other than blocking B10 from the X (or anything else for that matter) - CP says to just take VIZOR or do I5 RUIN, which I noticed while looking at this before asking CP.
>Mike: EIOPRTU 14B O.ERTIP +37 215
#note Is PU(LA)O even worth considering? I saw it, but 37 is too much to pass here I think.
>Avery: IORRTUZ 15G TIZ +50 244
>Mike: IINSUUX -IUUX +0 215
>Avery: IORRRUV -IRRUV +0 244
#note He kept OR based on his next rack
>Mike: EEFINSS F2 FI.S +30 245
>Avery: EHNNORU 7E RUN. +6 250
#note Not sure what his rationale was here - but CP likes E7 UH(LA)N by about 5%. Hyper defense mode I guess
>Mike: AAEEINS E1 AI +9 254
#note I was kind of upset at AGENESIA getting blocked, but I like this since it forces him to be the one to open stuff up
>Avery: EHILNNO 11E HE +26 276
>Mike: AEEEMNS 8H .E +2 256
#note CP agrees
>Avery: AILNNOP B1 NAP +15 291
#note Not a bad idea to set up the O spot at A3, but he is in trouble. CP agrees here
>Mike: AEEMNSW 8A ...W +22 278
#note CP agrees
>Avery: ILMNOOU A1 ONO +23 314
>Mike: AEEIMNS J2 MEANIES +70 348
>Avery: ?ILMRUV 3J .RUV +14 328
#note Surprised to not see VELUM here - maybe focused on getting rid of an R since there's two left, but I'd still take it
>Mike: DDGRRUY 5H DU.GY +20 368
#note I figured DRUDGERY wouldn't go down, but I had about 3 minutes left to play this and figure out the endgame. I knew EXCLAIM was likely if I played on column N, so I kind of panicked and played this. CP puts this at 86.11% to win, only about 2.5% above everything else. But his rack would have won with precise play...
>Avery: ?CEILMX L2 M. +4 332
#note Quackle lists two wins here, but only  L5 YLEM (which I noticed, since it sets up OXIC, but I did not think about what he would do if I blocked i... he still wins with a crazy sequence) works. I4 MUX or LUX tie.



So if he does YLEM, I will likely block with EDH. But I am stuck with RR after that! If he slow plays me with SOJUs, he will win since I'm forced to do GIFT. After that, he has two options - L2 XU or even N7 HI. But he has to be careful about his ordering - HI cannot be followed immediately by CHI since I will go out with CHIRR and win! He must do CHI last - the order of the first two does not matter. He will win 388-385 with that sequence!



But he is not confined to SOJUs. Amazingly, 2K Ma for 4 points wins too! It sets up MAX (which I can't block obviously), and the endgame follows a similar pattern to before, making sure he doesn't give me CHIRR. He will win 385-387 after that.


Lastly, 8N aX wins as well, since it sets up C(HA)I.If I play HART, he will play CHART and win. If for some reason he played 6M LI after that, it's literally his only LOSING play. If I do GIFT like normal, he must do CHAI to win. He will win 385-386.




But wait! Mack and I analyzed after the game, and we found another play that wins. The quiet 7J EM is a killer, and sets up EXILIC, which I cannot block! And he will win 383-387. Mack noticed first that EM blocks every single possible play that uses an R (I have no way to use either of them!), and I followed with the EXILIC opportunity.




MUX and LUX will tie if I respond with L2 DUTY, and he will go out with sLICE or MEsIC on column N.



Crazy stuff! A very informative endgame. Mike's plan was clever still, but not good enough.
>Mike: DHRRT I4 D.H +15 383
#note I had only 29 seconds left after this play - this wins, and so does GIFT.
>Avery: ?CEILX 1K CaLIX +43 375
#note M1 LEV and this are tied as the best endgame, since CALIX is then unblockable. Playing 2L MET will give him more points for it, but I will win 393-391 after that. XERIC or XENIC are 1 point worse.
>Mike: RRT 2D ...T +8 391
#note My only win
>Avery: E M1 .E. +10 385
#note Great game to Mike!
>Avery:  (RR) +4 389
