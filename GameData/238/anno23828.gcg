#note Pivotal play here. It was rough that I couldn't make a two tile play at 10E that opened two lanes. I looked at them all - MEG/GEM, G10 MATT, PEG. Quackle suggests the amusing F1 IMPI - easy to see the neanderthal logic of it but the game situation didn't really call for such aggression. To me it came down to MATT vs STIRP. Of course the leave looks far stronger after MATT, but aside from the new lane created, where will I play? Lloyd's going to address the opening however he can. After STIRP I have a few more points in hand and now there's two areas of the board where I can potentially play something. I dunno. I like my choice much better than Quackle.

#note Here I make a pretty amazing screwup. I didn't track some play or other and thought there were more tiles in the bag. Probably a little frustration coming into play, but I still have enough winning chances with a good play that throwing it away is totally inexcusable. HYP is just better than PHONY anyway. CP likes FOY, which must be the best way to bingo in a heavy way with RATH or from 1H starting with the S.
