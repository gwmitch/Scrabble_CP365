>Matt_Canik: ACDEEIO E4 IODA.E +14 83
#note I figured with an opponent whose biggest weakness (in my opinion) is controlling a board, I think this helps me open things (especially when he insta-plays at D1 a lot)
>Joey_the_K!: ITZ D2 ZIT +28 138
#note Why not at F2? He actually set it there first and moved it over...

#note I like the opportunity for scores holding LPY here well more than LLR after PORGY

>Matt_Canik: GHLMPSY F7 H.MPY +30 192
#note How can you not play HEMPY after BLAZED and JOINT? Teehee. Sims about evenly with GLYPHS.

#note UNSEW/VOXELS is clearly right here

#note UNS(E)W is so good here. I think Joey is well within bingo range.

#note Joey tries the stick route, but he actually has a sneaky win here: UTA or ETA 14L forces me to play the Q and then he can go out. 
>Matt_Canik: AAEOQS 14N AA +19 379
#note A happy medium between dinking and dunking and playing long. If I dink just one tile, Joey outruns with AU(G)UrED as an outplay, but if he wants to play short I have enough firepower with ZITS, WO, etc to outrun those games.
