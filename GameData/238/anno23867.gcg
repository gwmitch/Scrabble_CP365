>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIORY 11E YOD +27 43
#note both bingo-seeking plays, E10 OY and 11E YOD, are risky in that they do horribly with two-vowel draws. I chose YOD because the 11 extra points seemed to negate the risk a bit more, and allowed me to underlap, dump vowels and open the board if I got a bad draw. YO 11E looks better than OY because it keeps more of the board open, but that's misleading, since a bingo to the S opens the board well enough. Only issue is if the S is blocked, in which case I might be able to bingo at 10I, or open another lane.
>Norma_Lovett: AEILRTT 10I TERTIAL +64 155
#note H1 LITERAT(OR)! 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEIOOR O3 AEROfOI. +74 117
#note I might have hit a 3x3 had I played OY instead! OVARIOLE also works, and might make more sense long-term, as I'm still fighting to remain within striking distance. Both plays allow 50-60 point plays with a J or a Z, so AEROFOIL looks a bit better, the J hurting less than the Z. But there are more J plays than Z plays that overlap. Once again the results did not favour me in this case, but it could have gone either way.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACIQTY 12D QAT +35 152
#note interesting decision between 12D QAT, F6 QA(T), J6 QI(S) and M9 Q(I). I preferred what this accomplished board-shape wise.
>Norma_Lovett: AMNUU L8 AU.UMN +18 224
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACCIMY N1 CYMA +28 180
#note missed 13I CYA(N)IC, which is unfortunate. My first obvious mistake this game. 
>Norma_Lovett: EEILNOR J1 ELOINER. +62 286
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CGINPS 13C GIPS +40 220
#note and once again the results orientation came crashing down on me. I may very well have had a 3x3 with ESPMNG?? or whatever else I drew.

Against this opponent, it seemed better to score and hope she doesn't, and bingo next turn to pull slightly ahead, but I'm down quite a lot, and she might have challenged PACINGS.
>Norma_Lovett: BDLN 1H BL.ND +30 316
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CENSVW H11 SWiVE +50 270
#note this on the other hand wasn't that great. I felt that I had to burn my blank so that I can maintain myself within striking distance.
>Norma_Lovett: EGIITX 5E EXITI.G +60 376
#note Well, there went that plan!
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEHINS 4B CHINESE +92 362
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEHINS --  -92 270
#note I was going to play INCHES at 4B to set up a volatile hook, which seemed to be my only way back in the game. But then I convinced myself this was valid and that I would get a free turn. Sigh... Maybe I can still win with just 4C ECHE. Anything can happen. She can phony, mess up somehow. Perhaps she will let SECHE or DECHE go or something.

#note welp... there goes that
>Joshua_Sokol: EFKNPSU 4C KEF +29 331
#note should fish for SPUNKIE probably. Champ likes P(O)UF 3I for the equity.
>Norma_Lovett: ADFIIOR 2F FRAI. +22 479
#note Second only to 2D RADII.
>Joshua_Sokol: BLNPSUZ N9 B.PS +12 343
#note blocking MODI and NODI, hoping she misses (D)IDO (just kidding I missed DIDO too...
>Norma_Lovett: DIO G4 D.. +4 483
#note blocking ZIN, missing my better Z play, which I thought might happen. Mouhahaha!
>Joshua_Sokol: LNUZ 12H .UZ +15 358
>Norma_Lovett: IO C2 OI. +14 497
#note And that is how I lost such a well-played game! Tough stuff, but I could have improved my chances if I had taken different routes! The result of this game was very thought-provoking, and I think I am a better player now because of it.
