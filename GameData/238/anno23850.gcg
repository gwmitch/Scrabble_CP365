>Bnjy: ACEHT L3 TEACH. +28 62
>Bnjy: ACEHT --  -28 34
>Mack: AEGLRSW L4 RAWL. +22 33
#note Quackle likes 7L AWL even after specifying Bnjy's partial rack but that gives him 6K THAE which mostly blocks my S hook, so I'm fine with RAWLY
>Bnjy: AAH K4 AHA +29 63
>Mack: ADEGNOS M3 SEGNO +33 66
#note 3L DAG is simming ahead by a little, but I think Bnjy is too likely to have an O or S to justify it.
>Bnjy: ACELOTU H5 OUT.LACE +63 126
>Mack: ADNNOTT 11H .ANNOT +16 82
#note Definitely not playing something with OUTPLACED, I need to preserve that hook to bingo... I think this is fine

>Mack: INPRTUZ F4 UNZIP. +37 254
#note Quackle likes 11C PUTZ, but I'll almost definitely need to draw the other blank given what he has so I like UNZIPS to maximize my shots at it
>Bnjy: ?EILOTX 8A L.X +45 280
>Mack: DDJRTTU 11C JUT +34 288
#note 4B OUTJUT is cool, but this is probably better. I need every point I can get and there are plenty of vowels left.
>Bnjy: IO C3 OI +16 296
>Mack: ADDGRT 10G G.D +11 299
#note Didn't write down my seventh tile, but it was definitely a consonant. This is probably as good as anything
>Bnjy: BEET A11 T.EBE +30 326
>Mack: ADIRSTU 10L TAU +13 312
#note If I don't open something up I'll lose for sure snce he has at least one blank, so I've got to try something
