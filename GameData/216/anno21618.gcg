#note Beautiful find. 
>Reid: ?CCFLSU F3 CU.F +17 43
#note I remember thinking how close I was to FLOCCULES or CALCTUFTS and I ended up missing #1 FLOCCUS at 9B (65.18%). FLOC at J3 is #2 (58.52%). I considered FUCI at F2 (57.53%) for #3. My play is #4 (57.19%). Sigh! Another missed bingo.
>Robert_Kahn: AH 6H .AH +30 78
>Reid: ?ACLORS L4 eSCAROL +81 124
#note Loads of bingos here and I chose to pick an invalid one. OSCULAR and ESCOLAR are top two (64.92, 64.34)%. OCULARS at 9B is #3 (60.28%). Robert might have won the game here, instead he just held. If valid, my play would have been #3. 
>Robert_Kahn: QT 7K Q.T +13 91
>Reid: ABENPTX M2 PAX +32 156
#note PATEN at M9 is #1 (75.00%). BOX at 9K is #3 (73.61%). My play is #2 (73.85%). I disagree with Quackle here, but it's a minor mistake at most.

>Reid: BEEEINT N1 BENE +31 187
>Reid: BEEEINT --  -31 156
#note BEE at N1, 11J or 11K are top 3 (69.37, 69.35, 68.82)%. I forgot the blank was an E and not an A. Another huge mistake. 
>Robert_Kahn: ILZ 10J ZI.L +33 161
>Reid: BEEEINT N1 BEE +20 176
#note #1 play. No one says the second time is a charm. 
>Robert_Kahn: EN O1 EN +23 184
>Reid: AEEINOT 11J ANE +30 206
#note My play is #2 (49.22%). ATE is #1 (51.54%). FOE at E5 is #3 (49.2%). I agree with Quackle, but this is a minor mistake at most.

#note #1 play.
>Robert_Kahn: IJNO 10B JOIN +35 233
>Reid: ADKMMOU 3C AMU.K +36 316
#note DOUM at 8A is #1 (91.15%). My play is #2 (90.10%). DUMKA at 8B is #3 (89.03%). I agree with Quackle here because #1 could prevent Robert from using the spot. I thought my play at the time was a surefire #1. This is a small mistake. 
>Robert_Kahn: AT F8 A.T +19 252

#note #1 play. Looks like I made the right choice last turn after all.

>Reid: ?DEGINU N8 .U +2 358
#note I was bemoaning the fact that Robert blocked my bingo and I missed another bingo SUEDING at 14J (100.00%) that would have sealed the deal. VENDU at 13I is #2 (99.75%). GUV at 13G is tied for #2. DUO at B6 is #3 (99.71%). My plays is #14 based on valuations of all plays, but it is not in top 15 for 5 min champ. Huge mistake here. 
>Robert_Kahn: ABHIST 12D HABIT.S +38 308
>Reid: ?DDEGIN 13C DINED +34 392
#note DIG or GID at 13C are top two (98.17, 97.77)%. My play is #3 (97.60%).

>Reid: ?GIOSWW 14I SOWInG +29 421
#note WOO at B6 is #1. WO at L1 is #2. OW at 7A is #3. I guess Quackle wants to me to try to bingo out. I just decided to take the points. I should have played SWIG at 12L. My play is #53 based on valuations of all plays.

#note #1 play. 
>Reid:  (TERRE) +10 451
#note Two missed bingos. A unintentional phoney. A careless play. 11 (or 10 if you don't count the phoney) of my 14 plays are in the top 4. This could have been an even bigger blowout. I'm lucky I got both blanks this game. Overall, I give myself and F.
