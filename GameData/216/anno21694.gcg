#note I should probably do 9I GUV. NV isn't great synergy and DGNE has a decent chance to bingo on this board. I was very nervous about how easily Jason could kill the board after GUV. A four-letter word underlapping HAR, or a five through the R, for example, would block almost all bingos. The sim still thinks I'm overthinking this.

#note Not a fan of killing the SKIN hook, but Jason will probably do it very soon anyways. I need these points.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADNSTVW B10 DAV.T +26 118
#note Now it seems necessary to fork the board a bit. LARYNX makes bingoing tough

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADFGNSW M3 WAF. +20 138
#note I was going to burn the S with FAWNS, but knowledge of another S on Jason's rack means that there is at most one S left in the bag. So I was nervous about spending mine. WAFT is not very promising, but at least it maintains hope of an ING bingo.This is a significant and clear mistake, though. Since a bingo through the I still leaves me way behind. I need to take points for FAWNS now, so that my future bingo actually gets me back in the game. Big error.

#note There's the huge break I needed. Maybe not deserved after the questionable WAFT.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BCEIIOT 8L OBIT +26 260
#note I will need to bingo again. This opens things up a little. EXOTIC is the other option. I can possibly catch up without a bingo if Jason has nothing through the C.

#note Punished. He had SMEARIER anyway though.

#note My thinking was that it would be necessary to score well, or else my bingo on row 1 could be outrun. But this is not true. There is a Q in the bag, so Jason will either be forces to score poorly to dump it, or eat it as deadwood. So I should not worry so much about scoring. 11D GUIDE is simming better because it blocks QUA and gives me more turnover for a shot at NNRRSTT, which I need to draw desperately.
