>Josh: AANORTX H8 AX +18 18
#note Tough turn. I went with the easy play, but it may be correct to play longer with AXON or TAXON even.
>Jason: AANQT G6 QANAT +28 28
>Josh: AENOPRT I7 OPERANT +78 96
>Jason: CEELOSU J3 COULEES +80 108

>Jason: EGHIIIJ --  -78 108
>Josh: IIMNOOT 12G MO.ITION +72 197
#note tilt challenged.
>Jason: EGHIIIJ -  +0 108
>Josh: GIIKORR 13F GIR. +13 210
#note Wasn't quite sure what I could really accomplish here. I felt like I should start shutting the board down. 
>Jason: ACEITUV 4J .UTVIE +20 128
#note I was surprised he didn't play VI(N)CA, which was what I was trying to prevent, as I didn't have an S. In any case I can still block the opening if he does that. 
>Josh: FIKLORW O1 FIL.WORK +212 422
>Josh: FIKLORW --  -212 210
#note Instead my instinct told me to go for it! But alas, FILEWORK* is invalid, and my hope of 212 points vs Jason was crushed.
>Jason: ACEGU N10 CA.GUE +30 158
>Josh: FIKLORW 15J FOWL.R +48 258
#note But I still had LIF(E)WORK! That seemed so implausible....... BLEW IT! Also, FOLKI(E)R

>Jason: AZ M11 Z.A +41 356
>Josh: EEJNRTW B6 JEWE. +32 407
#note I thought this was my best shot, but Quackle finds a fantastic play that puts Jason in a large bind. M6 (A)W to set up a 63-point play next turn! That seems to win the game for me more often.
>Jason: BEELORU A7 ROB +36 392
#note That blank was just the icing on the cake that was delivered to me on the night I went 4-1 against a player that is unquestionably better than me. 
>Josh: ?DGNRT 5I G.N +12 419
#note But wow, so close! I almost lost this one... -19 to TRoG C4
>Jason: EELU C8 LE. +16 408
>Josh: ?DRT 6B .iRD +11 430
#note -6 to 11H D(A)Te. We were tired ;)
