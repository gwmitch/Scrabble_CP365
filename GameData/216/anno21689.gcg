#note I also considered SHH to hold onto a vowel. But DHRS is about as strong a vowelless leave as you could ask for. One vowel drawn would be fine.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DHINRRS K4 DIR..N +22 49
#note This is a phony. It's really only a few pts better than the best valid play BEHINDS, so it possibly wasn't worth the risk. It gave me some valuable info if I end up needing to phony again later, though.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: HILMRSW 1F WHIMS +46 95
#note I debated this or WHIRLS. In the end, I decided to take the extra points. But look! WHIRLS sets up my M! I didn't see that. WHIMS is still just fine.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EELNNOR D8 NEROL +17 308
#note I had a really hard time with this turn. GETS was a difficult play to read. I decided she probably kept three one-point tiles including an S (with the blank still in the bag). But with four tiles turned over, I was still very worried about easy points from 8A, especially from the Z. I decided this play kept the board less volatile for non-bingo scoring plays, especially if I think she'll overlook the NEROLI hook (and I was kind of hoping that would be the case.) Quackle is not a fan of my choice. 8A LEONE blocks the TWS, makes it tough to play sevens, and scores 18. I'm still not sure what I like best. I know my choice didn't work too well.
>Betty_Cornelison: ?EISTVV 13A VoTIVES +82 371
#note Ouch. I slunk in my chair a bit when this came down to block my 103-pt bingo. Hopefully she still would've found VIVIDEST if I hadn't given her the spot for this.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABCENOZ B8 CABEZ.N +50 358
#note Quackle says this play is 16% to win. But it's higher than that if there's a chance Betty does not see the E hook. I think this play gives me a great chance if I can get that crucial E.
>Betty_Cornelison: AU A13 .AU +20 391
#note Betty wisely blocks.
