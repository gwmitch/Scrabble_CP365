>Josh: AEILOOW H4 WOOLIE +26 26
>Jason: UX I9 XU +34 34
>Josh: AACOUWZ 6D WAZO. +37 63
#note Thought he was likely weak enough after XU that the more dangerous WAZO(O) was worth the 3 extra points. I may be wrong here.
>Jason: EFU 7G F.U +20 54
>Josh: ACCNSTU E6 .CCUSANT +74 137
#note Couldn't find a semblance of long term defense in any of the two placements. Guess we'll have quite the open board this game. Time to put on my equity gloves. At least I have a comfortable head start, as this was challenged.
>Jason: AGI -  +0 54
>Josh: AEEGIIT 12C GE.II +12 149
#note If I thought he might be bingo-prone after FLU, I lost that consideration after he challenged, as Jason makes very logical challenges. I guess this is sort of giving up on defending the board long-term. The left side can always be opened with a play through the C at 8E, and everything else is wide open. If I really want, I can play IG(N)ITE for 4 more, but my leave is that much better with the T, and I am not giving him any bailouts to the junk he has probably drawn. The E at H12 does that. If I really really want, I can play GIE/FLUE and at least attempt to control the board. Perhaps against a player that might mistakenly let the board die on them. Jason is not that player.
>Jason: AGI C10 GI.A +12 66
>Josh: AEEIPTT J10 PETTI +25 174
#note I missed a good play in APIE(C)E. That's really a low-risk opening of the left side at this point, although the TT leave is very annoying. I think it's right though, despite it all. I didn't want to play J10 PIETA, cause Jason just got rid of some junk and might be sitting on something. I didn't want to play PETITE or PATTIE, since my lead is now large enough that him getting back into the game has begun to be less and less of an issue unless he can score 100 points or more in one turn. I couldn't convince myself 100% that PATTIE was valid. That must be the play at J2. I didn't realize that this play was counterproductive in that it opened a 2x2 lane with any bingo ending in ST or O-something. But hey, it doesn't take an S! Yay for defense?!
>Jason: ?DEEIOS K6 EpISODE +77 143
#note or the new (W)EbISODE to blow the board open. Jason couldn't pull the trigger on (W)EIRDOES here.
>Josh: ?ABEEMT 14F BEAM.EsT +67 241
#note Ugh, BEdMATE. I figured I was missing something in ABDEEMT, but I was unfamiliar with the alphagram, and I knew BETAMED* was a common enough attempt at a word that it was probably phony. This is a huge swing.
>Jason: OPRSY 15D PROSY +60 203
>Josh: DDEIRRV 8J D.VIDE +45 286
#note I might want to play G9 DER(I)V(ES) here. It's so much more balanced.
>Jason: IQ 7M QI +45 248
>Josh: ABHNNRR 8A BRAN.H +42 328
#note huge bailout. I am still outrunning a lot of stuff!
>Jason: ALO D3 ALO. +14 262
>Josh: ALNNORT G9 RAT.N.. +20 348
#note I first saw (W)ANTON and thought that was my best way to score, but this is even better. There were a lot of openings and I figured my best shot here would be to outrun. But I might not be ahead by enough, as Jason still has myriad ways to score well while keeping things open. Maybe I need to chow down on the B and the R in BRANCH this turn? There is on productive way to do that, though, and I am committing myself to losing if he bingos elsewhere.
>Jason: AKV 3C K.VA +22 284
#note Jason finds a way to keep the board pulsating and alive until its last breaths in a few turns. This is why I could not afford to make low-scoring and one-track-minded blocks last turn. If I have 335 points here with one-pointers, I am losing to most of his bingos.
>Josh: EILNNOU J2 UNION +13 361
#note This is the most I can score, but this blocks the W and the line Jason just created while making another much safer floater to play through. I can still probably outrun most things, as the pool is favorable to scoring for me and disfavorable to post-bingo endgames for Jason.
>Jason: DER 4H .E.RD +18 302
>Josh: AEGLMOR M3 MOG +22 383
#note This play did all I could hope for here. It left one in the bag, scored, left me balanced for the endgame, etc. But I should play this at F2. I had tracked correctly. I think I just thought this scored more, but it scores the same and sets me up for next turn. MOL at F2 looks like the best option here that leaves one in the bag. Anyways, this doesn't outscore ETHYLENE or BLETHERS, so I think I needed to look harder, which I realized after the game. If I had looked instead of autopiloting, I might have found (B)EGLAMOR.....
>Jason: EHLR 15L HERL +43 345
>Josh: AEFLRTY 2F FRY +30 413
#note -20 to 6N FA and worse than many other creative plays. FA sets up ELYTR(A) to go out and Jason cannot do a thing about it unless he play WEIRDOS, in which case I can just start the endgame anew and find my best out in two. Sick! N1 FLY also sets up TRE(F)A.
>Jason: EJNS M12 JE.. +22 367
>Josh: AELT B4 LATE. +7 420
#note Somehow missing (B)LEAT for one more. I didn't really know BLATE though.
>Josh:  (NS) +4 424
#note I need to hone my endgame and counterintuitive thinking skills. If I think counterintuitively instead of very robotically in the pre-endgame, I will find killer bingos instead of not look for them at all.
