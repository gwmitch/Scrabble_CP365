#note This game has a bizarre start. We had to pause the game and switch to a new tile set after I realized these ones were slightly transparent. I was able to read Avery's rack from behind! Fortunately he bingoed, so I didn't gain any knowledge that affected the game.

#note Yuck! Big miss!. I completely whiffed on FUGIO, which is clearly better than taking 0.

#note Normally I would find this play too volatile. But Avery almost certainly kept five 1-pointers. And if he's forced to bingo, this spot will be all mine next turn.

#note I let myself get really low on time this game and Avery was playing quick, so moves like this were played pretty swiftly. I can almost certainly do better with semi-knowledge of his rack. I really just want to outrun the bingo he's going to get eventually.

#note This error is Avery's reward for rushing me. I make this play quickly before realizing I did in fact have one of the hook letters for LEA. Not a good moment for me.

#note OGEE is the play, but I was being cheeky leaving the BEDADS* hook open. Avery wasn't falling for it, though.
