#note I played this too quickly and didn't consider UNPEN in the same spot. They are close, but I think I prefer my play. I always look to score when I'm ahead.

#note Mistake. I saw DUNNER, but then remember that DUNS/DUNNING is good... so maybe DUN isn't an adjective after all? It's both. But not worth the risk for a slight improvement, I decided. But I also missed the other high-scoring play 4J URB. UNBURNT isn't terrible, but it's a clear mistake when I'm unsure of words and missing underlap plays! At least I'm getting some crucial turnover. I think a few people would greatly disapprove of opening the board while ahead, however.

#note Passing up HERTZ because it seemed like a 2x2 down the K column was the easiest way to lose. He can also 2x2 through the U though. Also I'm setting up a huge ZEDS/ZEDA hook, but I'm hoping to cash that next turn.

#note I spent too much time earlier in this game! Fortunately it didn't matter that I wasted a bunch of spread missing plays this turn. H11 AIYEE and K5 ZEDOARY are both big improvements.
