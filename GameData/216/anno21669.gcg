>Evans_Clinchy: AEFJMRT 8G RAMJET +32 32
#note Open long or short here? A Quackle sim gives the nod to JAM - it's 8 points less now, but Jean is likely to score 6 points more on average after RAMJET than JAM, and I get 5 points less on my next turn. My choice is a volatile one - keeping just the F, I'm vulnerable to a whole lot of potential 6-tile draws, good and bad. JAM is certainly safer.
>Jean_McArthur: AW J8 .AW +21 21
>Evans_Clinchy: FFINNUY I6 FU.Y +26 58
#note This appears best - the 26 points is tough to beat. There are a couple of other interesting choices, though - YUAN 9H would keep the board nice and tight while retaining the double F's for scoring, and NIFF 7K is fun since it sets up the NIFFY hook.
>Jean_McArthur: EEP H4 PEE +13 34
>Evans_Clinchy: EFHINNU J3 ENUF +32 90
#note Just the play I need here - unloading some awkward tiles and scoring nicely. This also blocks up the board a little bit. If Jean's angling for a bonus that hooks E(PEE), that's now somewhat tougher to fit.
>Jean_McArthur: ADEIRST M2 TARDIES +84 118
>Evans_Clinchy: AHIMNNT K3 NAH +26 116
#note The choice is between this and MIHA L1 for 9 points more. The difference in score is pretty significant, but I decided the NNT leave was just too risky. If I draw more consonants, I could be in real trouble next turn.
>Jean_McArthur: GOO G3 GOO +12 130
>Evans_Clinchy: EIMNOTY K8 .YOT +28 144
#note This is beginning to devolve into a boxy-shaped board without much in the way of available lines for a bonus. For instance, here I have OMNEITY/OMNIETY, but no spot. The objective with EYOT is to score well, keep a balanced rack and dig into the bag for game-changing blanks and S's.
>Jean_McArthur: AGGI L10 GIGA +21 151
>Evans_Clinchy: EIMNNOZ 13I ZON.E +48 192
#note A no-brainer play, scoring enough to temporarily put me back in control of the game.
>Jean_McArthur: HO 14I OH +37 188
>Evans_Clinchy: IIKMNPT 15J MINK +19 211
#note A difficult spot for me - Jean's opening of line 15 comes at a tough time, as I've got an awkward rack including no tiles that hook ZO. I basically have to block this area, as it's the most dangerous on the board by far. MINK feels pretty much forced to me.
>Jean_McArthur: AAB 12G ABA +20 208
>Evans_Clinchy: CIIPRTT F10 PIC +21 232
#note Between the dangerous unseen tile pool (both blanks, a balanced ratio of good consonants/vowels) and Jean's short plays, I have every reason to believe she's closer to a bonus than I am. My main objective is to block, and PIC does that decently - Quackle estimates Jean's chance at a bonus next turn is only 26 percent. PIC also scores well and keeps an IRTT leave that might mature into something with a good draw.
>Jean_McArthur: ?EIILNR 13A LINgIER +75 283
>Evans_Clinchy: EIIORTT E8 RIOT +16 248
#note After her bonus and my pick of all 1-pointers, I'm in trouble. If this were a closer game, my impulse would be to block the triple with a play like TORTILE, but down by 51, I want to open lines rather than close them. RIOT keeps a palatable EIT leave and gives me some more real estate to work with.
>Jean_McArthur: DELLO A10 LOL.ED +24 307
>Evans_Clinchy: DEIINTW C8 INTWI.ED +63 311
#note RIOT ended up working perfectly - she was forced to block the L that I left open, and that meant the N that I needed for INTWINED stayed available.
>Jean_McArthur: VVX -VVX +0 307
>Evans_Clinchy: AABELSU H14 BA +20 331
#note This is really tough. First I need to decide - how will this game be won? I'm ahead by 4 points - should I simply score and hope to outrun the rest of the way? Or do I think this game will come down to whoever gets that last bonus down? The remaining tile pool is awkward now - there's still a blank unseen, but the other 15 tiles are only 4 vowels and 11 consonants, including the Q, X and both V's. I could block with a play like BEAU B6, but I decided against it. Didn't seem necessary given her low bonus chances. I figured BA was a safe play - scores a decent 20, and keeps a vowel-heavy leave because of the consonant-heavy bag I'm drawing into. The U is also insurance against a potential Q draw.
>Jean_McArthur: TX 6L T.X +26 333
>Evans_Clinchy: AEELSUV B6 VALE +19 350
#note Another tough position, as I need to prevent bonuses in the top-left corner of the board but I'm also concerned with outscoring Jean in the endgame. VALE felt right to me - it's strong defensively against both bonuses and intermediate scoring plays. This, to me, seemed wiser than something like UVAE in the same spot, which seemed to invite easy 20-something-point comebacks while also scoring less for myself. VALE does open up a potential bonus for Jean if she has a 7-letter word ending in A or E, but how likely is that? The pool contains 8 consonants and 3 vowels - if she has any bonus at all, the odds say it's likely to end with an S. VALE blocks any such play.
>Jean_McArthur: ?CDERUV D2 DeCURVE +81 414
#note ...but sometimes, the odds are wrong. Jean had DECURVE ready to go down!
>Evans_Clinchy: EQRSSSU 3A QUE.R +26 376
#note This is my best endgame, and it leaves me with a rack of SSS and only SSS - I had never seen this precise rack before!
>Jean_McArthur: O N5 O. +12 426
#note A tough game, well played by Jean. I did my best to control the board and give myself a chance, but she got me in the end.
>Jean_McArthur:  (SSS) +6 432
