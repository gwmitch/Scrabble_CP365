>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AGIIIKS 3C .IKI +13 137
#note I decide it isn't a good idea to kill the board with SIKA/SAKI and QUOTERS. But 14D SIGIL is a miss. That is probably worth playing over WIKI.
>Trey_Wright: ?GIORRV 2F GROVIeR +73 210
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEFGIS J8 SAFE +30 167
#note I didn't record this rack. It must have been something like this, but if it was, this was a really awful play. I remember being really frustrated after spending lots of time on WIKI and giving him a spot for GROVIER. I definitely deserve to be in this hole early on.

#note Against most other players, I would have tried 14C VIED out of desperation. Trey knows a lot of words, though

#note Ending Day 1 with a mediocre 4-3 record and way too many mistakes. Thankfully I smartened up a bit on Days 2 and 3. Hopefully this was just nerves.
