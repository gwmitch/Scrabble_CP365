>cesar: AEISTUV D6 SU.ATIVE +74 96
>cesar: AEISTUV --  -74 22
#note i just went for it. i could probably come up with more plausible phonies, but this is what happens when you're 1-4 in a 21-game tournament.
>mark_miller: CRW F6 CR.W +15 15
>cesar: AEISTUV H8 .UV +6 28
#note i'm playing very much on tilt this game; it's the only game i played on tilt the whole tournament. i don't like doing this and i will try to never again. later in the game i started realizing i should stop it. LUV came down super quick but -U has a lot going for it. -2
>mark_miller: BE 7C BE +10 25
>cesar: AEGIIST E8 .AGI +15 43
#note of course, missed vestigia because i'm playing terribly. all i was praying for is to not be 1-5 basically. -28
>mark_miller: DEIKS 11H SKIED +27 52
>cesar: AEEEIST L11 .EE +8 51
#note surely i'll hit something. speed playing causes me to miss EIDE. -2.5
>mark_miller: AOZ B5 AZO +37 89
>cesar: AEEISTU I11 .UE +8 59
#note now that i've committed to this fishing expedition there's nothing to stop it. of course, i need to stop being so results-oriented. it's hard to describe the feeling of helplessness/panic/blah here to non-scrabblers, but i really did not want to be 1-5 :(

>cesar: AEINRST A7 RETSINA +80 139
#note i felt like i picked the worst bingo, but maybe not. i was trying to not give up points on the parallel. however, this takes an S.
>mark_miller: ?GIINNS 14A SIGNINg +76 191
>cesar: GHINPSU D12 HU.G +20 159
#note he blocked GUNSHIP for 90! back to playing weird moves, surely i could figure out that HUP at M13 scores 6 more and it keeps a better leave!! -7
>mark_miller: FOX C3 FOX +36 227
>cesar: ACINOPS D2 CAP +27 186
#note chickened out on the new word CAPONISE, even though I remember playing it in a Collins game once. hopefully my playing doesn't get worse. -34.5
>mark_miller: Q J10 Q. +31 258
>cesar: INNOPST C11 PON. +23 209
#note 14J PITON is definitely superior, setting up my case S, and scoring. I have a higher bingo % with PONG though. -5.5

>cesar: ?DEINST I3 kINDEST +72 281
#note this was an unexpected draw honestly, and one i was very happy to see, although my chances of winning are still quite low. at this point i told myself to try as hard as i could to win the game.. if i could come back from the stupid steaming (i could tell i was steaming) i vowed to try as hard as possible in every subsequent game.

#note i don't think OFAY is better. why do i want to give him perfect endgame knowledge? i suppose i should worry about getting rid of an extra vowel, though. i've gotten super lucky to be in this position, i was in the single digit win % at some point.

#note After this win I went for a quick walk and vowed to not waste it. I was going to remain focused until game 31! (with some exceptions caused by my lack of word knowledge and general dumbness)
