>Josh: AAEINOQ 8G QI +22 22
#note not sure this was my rack. Something ugly where QI is just enough points to be the right play.
>Jason: ARVX H5 VAR.X +15 15
>Josh: ABEENOO 5E ABO.E +20 42
>Jason: GHIJSTT G4 J.T +12 27
#note This is his rack. Tough decision here, but I think I would go with J2 JIGS. I think he either missed it or didn't know ABOVES.
>Josh: AEEIKNO 4I OAKEN +20 62
#note Given Jason has a lot of consonants, this play was made better. He also seemed bingo prone, so blocking the only 7 lane was a priority. This was the correct play if my inference was correct. It sort of was. Otherwise definitely NI(X)E for 25.
>Jason: GHIRST 4A RIGHT +22 49
#note Jason missed GRITH and GIRTH
>Josh: BEIOORW A1 BOR.OW +33 95
>Jason: EHILRSS L3 R.LISHES +65 114
>Josh: DEEEINW A1 ......ED +42 137
#note This was tough. How likely is Jason to have BORROWER, BORROWED or BORROWING? I felt like it was close to 50% or more, which I could have calculated. It's around that much, but he'll only use the spot about 30% of the time, as other plays still may be better than the point-grabbing. Therefore I should have worried as much about it and played W(H)INE or W(H)EEN.
>Jason: ADIM K4 .AMI +30 144
#note He said he had a D, not an E though.
>Josh: AEEINRW 8L .EWN +30 167
#note OK, I really hope that this will have been the last time I confuse WIENER/WEINER/WIENIE. I thought WIENIE could be spelled both ways, and WIENER could not. Aargh! B2 WE(I)NER is by far my best play here. Blegh
>Jason: DEIMSTU K9 TEDIUMS +74 218
#note Jason had the right inference here, which was that I had one-pointers and that I wasn't too strong, so he made the inferent play instead of the safer one. Well, I am lucky.
>Josh: ?AEIPRT 15H PRI.TAnE +140 307
#note I looked for words doubling the P, but I didn't know CRISPATE, I believe. Damn. Another big mistake, but I'm just too lucky for it to matter.
>Jason: APZ 14M ZAP +45 263
>Josh: ACILLOY M11 COL.. +32 339
#note Here I was just playing fast and leaving myself with scoring tiles.
>Jason: ?EEGGNU 11D UNpEGGE. +70 333
#note almost tried BEGRUNGE, which I would have challenged.
>Josh: AILLTYY J10 Y.T +30 369
>Jason: FOU 14F FOU +18 351
>Josh: ACIILRY 13C RACILY +40 409
>Jason: NO 6E NO.. +15 366
#note held on RACILY forever.
>Josh: ADIISTU 15A AUDITS +30 439
#note Apparently I have wins? I figured I couldn't outrun, and couldn't block everything, so I needed to hold my breath. He made a very fishy play, so I knew I was more in trouble than the pool had me think. Anyways, I don't understand why Quackle thinks I can outrun everything with C12 I(R)ID or O7 U(N)AI.
>Jason: ADEELNV B6 ELAND +24 390
>Josh: EFINO 9F FI. +26 465
#note C2 FOGIE is 2 points better. Missed it. 
>Jason: EV 3L .EV +16 406
>Jason:  (ENO) +6 412
