>Reid: EEJLORY H7 JOY +26 26
#note JOEY at 8E or 8F takes the top two (57.71%, 56.64%). My play is #3 (56.41%). Small mistake here. I considered JOEY but didn't want to give up the double letter. 
>Alan_Kait: ISX 10F XIS +40 40
>Reid: BEEILRU 11C LIEU +17 43
#note JUBILE at 7H is #1 (46.52%). BLUE at 11C is #3 (45.75%). My play is #2 (45.87%). I like my play better here for the positioning.
>Alan_Kait: DHN D10 H.ND +16 56
>Reid: AEEEIRU 13C A.IEU +14 57
#note #1 play.
>Alan_Kait: F F13 .F +13 69
>Reid: ADEEIOR I7 ODE +25 82
#note OE is #1 (47.12%). ODA is #3 (46.4%). My play is #2 (46.33%). I considered #1 and it's more my style, but I went for the points here. This is a minor mistake at most. 
>Alan_Kait: EINRTT 15D RETINT +27 96
>Reid: AAEIORV J9 AVO +20 102
#note #1 play. 
>Alan_Kait: GIV J5 VIG +20 116
>Reid: AAEHIRY K11 HAIRY +32 134
#note AYE at 14B is a missed beauty at #1 (49.74%). YAH and HIYA are next two (49.68, 48.81)%. My play is #5 (48.13%). This is a small mistake, but I agree with Quackle here. 
>Alan_Kait: AEMT L11 MATE +28 144
>Reid: AELNNRZ 14B ZA +24 158
#note The inscrutable LINN at 6I is #1 (45.52%). RITZ at 13J is #2 (44.76%). ZA at J13 is #3 (44.19%). My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. My play is #12 based on valuations of all plays. All I can guess is that Quackle really doesn't want me to use the A here. I considered RITZ and should have taken it. I don't like #2 at all. 
>Alan_Kait: CO C9 CO. +13 157
>Reid: AELNNRW 5J .AW +18 176
#note WREN at 14J is #1 (50.11%). I think this is a silly play even though it balances best. WRITE at 13J is #2 (48.91%). NAVEL at 5H is #3 (46.61%). I don't like the leave for #3. #2 is fine. I think Quackle is saying that its time to open the board. My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. My play is #16 based on valuations of all plays. I really wanted the W out of my rack. The double N are driving me nuts too. 
>Alan_Kait: EPRT L4 T.ERP +26 183
>Reid: EEGLNNR 14J G..EN +20 196
#note ENJOYS at H5 and REENJOYS at H3 are top two (40.68, 40.00)%. This is Quackle screaming for someone to open the board. My play is #3 (39.60%). This is a minor mistake at most. I agree w/ #1. My play is risky. If Alan bingos on the triple, this play could likely cost me the game. I hate games like this. 
>Alan_Kait: ADW 15M DAW +26 209
#note Alan likely does not have an ess. 
>Reid: AEELNRS M6 LEAN +15 211
#note #1 from last turn remains (48.74%). My play is #2 (46.30%). LA at 15A is#3 (46.11%). This is a minor mistake, if at all, and, in hindsight, gives me the edge later. #1 is safe. I open the board again. 
>Alan_Kait: GKNU N3 GUNK +36 245
#note Alan takes the easy points and gives me the hook finally.
>Reid: ACELORS O5 ESCOLAR +87 298
#note #1 play. The board is now locked up and Alan has to open in order to win. 
>Alan_Kait: BEL N10 BEL +23 268
>Reid: ?DEINOQ 10B D.. +11 309
#note QI is #1 at O2 (81.50%). I keep forgetting GI is valid. This is a huge mistake. OPA at 8K is #2 (80.53%). Exchanging DIOQ is #3 (80.17%). My play is #8 (76.42%). I didn't want to open the board here. In hindsight, ignoring the silly mistake, I should have exchanged my Q. 
>Alan_Kait: IR K3 RI. +5 273
#note Alan finally opens. 
>Reid: ?EINOQT -Q +0 309
#note QI at O2 is still #1 (90.58%). ON at K8 is #2 (82.25%). Exchanging ENOQT is #3 (80.92%). Missing QI is a huge mistake again. I was thinking that if Alan bingos to the R he would open the board and I should be able to bingo with my rack. My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. My play is #11 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Alan_Kait: FOR O1 FRO +21 294
>Reid: ?EINOPT 3D POiNTIE. +61 370
#note Quackle has some interesting choices. PIC at 9A is #1 (79.93%). INCEPTOR is #2 (77.60%). PE at M2 is #3 (76.00%). I think Quackle believes that my play is likely to give Alan a bingo out and this is the reason that it is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. I didn't see INCEPTOR. It's also possible that Quackle is estimating that Alan has the Q and my play would give him then easy 60+ point retort. My play is #3 based on valuations of all plays. I like #2 best. 
>Alan_Kait: ?BIMOSU H1 MO.S +21 315
#note Alan does not have a bingo. MOI at 2F, OSMIUM at 2D, and MOUSY at 2F are top 3. Alan does not block my easy Q play. 
>Reid: EQST F2 Q. +30 400
#note QIS is #1. My play is #2. TE at M2 is #3. 
>Alan_Kait: ?BIU 15A Ba +19 334
#note PUBIS or PUBIC at D3 and IMBUE at 1G give Alan the out. I saw IMBUE and expected him to go out. I guess he went for points. BA at 2J scores more. 
>Reid: EST D3 .EST +12 412
#note TES at 4C is #1. SEPT is #2. My play is tied with several others for #3. 
>Reid:  (IU) +4 416
#note No missed bingos. 10 of my 16 plays were in the top 3. 12 of 16 in the top 8. Missing the QI GI play was a big mistake. Missing INCEPTOR might have cost me the game. Overall, I give myself a B-/C+ this game.
