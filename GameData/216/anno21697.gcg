#note Not a great turn. I failed to spot POSHLY, which keeps a better leave. And I decided I was not certain that UNEQUAL took the S. So I didn't do SYNTH there. SHY is ok, but the leave will be punishing.

#note I thought this would be good for killing the easiest bingo spot and keeping workable tiles. But the leave is far worse on this board than I thought. I should just do INKJ(ET), which was my first instinct. A neat play I didn't see was 3C TAJINE. Keeping KN is a lot more promising than keeping the J. 6-pt error in the sim :-/

#note I strongly considered MAxIXE, but decided that wouldn't be enough to win. I'm going to need a bingo. So cash the X and hope to hit one soon.

#note What a tough position. Do I need to bingo? Not necessarily. I can play something like BEIGY or BEGEM and hope to draw some of FW? and outrun Kolton in the endgame. The important thing to remember is that Kolton would need to sacrifice quite a lot of poins to block row 15, so I do not necessarily need to open another line. If I do K12 GIB, for example, I score well enough that Kolton needs to worry about points. So I can threaten the bingo and the endgame points. In the end, I decided to go all in on the bingo. This could be wrong, but it was a tough one to solve at the time. In hindsight, I maybe could have just done 15L SEMI to take a small lead and leave 2 in the bag for the pre-endgame. .
