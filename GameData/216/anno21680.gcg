>Josh: DGLLOPY H8 GODLY +28 28
#note Hmm, I guess I could play PODGY and double my L's, but that seems silly compared to scoring 2 or 4 less and keeping a much more dynamic leave.
>Bernard: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 0
>Josh: EEHILOP I7 HOPE +29 57
#note I thought PIEHOLE fit at I4, and I laid it down only to notice OL*. I then laid this down automatically, but G9 HOE for 5 less is probably better, as it gives less back and leaves me with more flexibility.
>Bernard: EFU J10 FEU +29 29
>Josh: EEIILMV K9 VIM +32 89
#note K8 VEIL does surprisingly well here, as it blocks parallels at J6, and keeps a better leave, especially for the parallel-heavy board we have here. I didn't consider the play long enough.
>Bernard: EENP G6 NEEP +24 53
>Josh: CEEILUW J6 WE +18 107
#note EW, ugly draw that I had coming to me by keeping inflexible stuff for the past couple of turns. I considered WE, EWE in a whole bunch of places (missed EEW in those places, which doesn't make a big difference). I also considered L11 ECU briefly, but I just didn't see the point of keeping a W on my rack here, even if it's a tad more balanced than CEILU. Apparently my scoring chances and bingo chances aren't terribly bad after ECU. Given the extra standard deviation of holding three vowels and two iffy consonants, I think it's a better idea to play ECU for 15, although it forks the board in a way I hate unless I'm down a bunch. By now I'm actually also seeing the value in playing L11 EEW. It's a wholly different play than ECU is, as it defends the whole bottom of the board decently. Overlaps are indeed a problem though, which is why I might discount EEW in my thought process. But if Bernard doesn't hit there next turn, I can go right ahead and play something down hooking (EME)U some of the time, and block the bottom of the board in a definite way. Anyways, I autopiloted equity again, 4 turns in a row now. Boring Josh.
>Bernard: AEEIMRT K1 MEATIER +79 132
#note Deserved. Bernard missed that this played in the safer spot of 5H for 5 fewer points. He would have played it there if I saw it, but only because he is afraid of 3x3s, which he shouldn't be. I would take the five fewer points because of all of the floaters this placement gives my opponent, and all of the points they can score with what I have opened.
>Josh: CEIKLLU 4H CUL.LIKE +86 193
#note Was unsure that this was valid, but I needed to play it. Held briefly, and released on the basis that if this isn't a word, it should be. :)
>Bernard: AHIIIO G12 OHIA +16 148
#note Bernard said he held two I's here, as well as a consonant. Here is where things become a bit crazy. Hang tight.
>Josh: AIIQRTZ 1K .IRZA +51 244
#note Whoa. Too many options. I had a very hard time computing and analyzing this position. At first I was going to play ZIRA(M) for 48 instead of (M)IRZA, sacrificing 3 points to set up a probable QAT next turn at 2F for 45. Then he played OHIA. That gave me a few new options. I could drop my Q for 31, guaranteeing myself at least 38 points next turn with ZIT at F10 and hopefully also ZIRA(M) or (M)IRZA. QI also interferes with the huge spot Bernard just opened. I could also play Q(A)T there and hope for MIRZA or ZIRAM as well but throw my backup tile away, the T. That better interferes with the A, but this is marginal. It also scores 5 more, which is less marginal. I also considered F10 QAT this turn, but that leaves poorly and doesn't take any of the juicy spots on the board. Not the right play. Then there's ZIRA(M) and (M)IRZA. ZIRA(M) seemed like a waste, as I already had QAT/TOY at F10 next turn with an A draw, and I would like to get rid of that E in CULTLIKE anyway. So MIRZA seemed better. I didn't want to leave myself with the Q on principle and because it's just not flexble, no matter if I have a guaranteed 30 points or not. What if Bernard does something even crazier than OHIA (tough but possible)... I'm probably stuck keeping the Q again. But all in all, 51 points, great scoring control and a guaranteed decent Q play leaving relatively well seemed worth it. I made my play within 3 minutes, but that was a lot of thinking, finally!
>Bernard: IX F5 XI +15 163
#note What did I say about insane?! I already knew that Bernard had the belief that he can't beat me unless he gets very lucky and draws well, so this wasn't that surprising, but still! He must have at least another I, but he doesn't have an E, O or A to re-overlap his own play! So I deduced that he had the blank here. Still, I have no idea if this is a good play, since he forgot his full rack. He did indeed have an I and a blank, and wanted to create another big spot to counteract that A on the bottom of the board. This was a very strategical play that I loved to see Bernard make. He knows how to strategize!
>Josh: AEINQTT 15D QAN.T +72 316
#note I forgot to mention it last turn, but I had a farfetched hope of drawing into a 72-point play this turn with my Q, either with QUE(A)N or with QAN(A)T. Lucky me. The game is well under control, I think, but I'm bracing for impact here...
>Bernard: ?ACDIRT E2 CARoTID +87 250
#note He probably has to play TRIADiC in the same spot here. It's 3 more points and forks the board a bit better. Inevitably something can be played to the C at 8A. Actually though, this creates a new 7 lane, so nevermind that. But I was very very close to challenging this, cause I thought we were likely to be confusing this word with CAROTIN and PAROTID. Well, it's a normal word I didn't know, what else is new. I should look at an anatomy book someday. Good thing I didn't challenge. Bernard has around a one in 20 shot at winning at this point, and if I challenge, I might increase that fivefold.
>Josh: AEISTUV F10 VATU +26 342
#note I hated not being able to really block anything here. I should probably just play for points with H1 EVI(C)TS. But my leave here is just way too flexible to give it up for AU, probably. There's a lot of stuff left that can really mess up my rack.
>Bernard: ?GNNSTT O3 N.TTiNGS +74 324
#note He's up to a 1/5 shot to win!
>Josh: EEEIORS L7 OE +10 352
#note Here I had to decide between OE somewhere, and EERIE somewhere. EERIE didn't seem to score nearly enough to justify blowing up my rack, and the score was close enough that I thought I should open up a new lane, especially given the pool. I couldn't see anything that scored more than 18, but I spotted OE at L11 forming EMO. That didn't seem to make sense to play, but since I had just seen EMO, I should have looked to find other plays forming that hook I had until then missed. Then I would have seen a much, much better play, L10 SOIREE! This was a pivotal miss.
>Bernard: ABDILRS M8 RIBALDS +74 398
#note Because of this bongo!!!
>Josh: EEGIRRS D7 GERRIES +75 427
#note Now my only hope seems to be a phony. Maybe I can win some of the time if I play 8A GREE(D). Anyways, I thought this might very well fly. It did.
>Bernard: AJW 8A JAW.. +48 446
#note Bernard lets it go cause he sees this play winning the game fairly often. Good decision.
>Josh: ADNOOOU N1 .OU. +36 463
#note I have no wins. But Bernard hasn't tracked, so I'm hoping to catch him off guard here.
>Bernard: BEFNOSY 14J BOS.Y +32 478
#note Bernard keeps his cool and makes the correct play! Not knowing he is winning the game, but still.
>Josh: ADNOO 9A ODO. +24 487
>Bernard: EFN M3 F.NE +26 504
#note Congratulations to Bernard for an awe-filled comeback! One of the best I've ever seen...
>Bernard:  (AN) +4 508
