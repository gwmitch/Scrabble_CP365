>Jason: EEJKLOQ 8E JOKE +30 30
#note OK, where to put it? I'm glad Championship Player agreed with this spot, even though it let Winter score and clean up his rack coming back.
>Winter: ELOU E8 .OULE +24 24
#note I'm sitting next to Kelly and Kevin ... Kelly asked where I stood, and I said I didn't know; I was trying to insulate myself. "You're in eighth place," Kelly said. "You're not playing for anything." I laughed and said if I could get myself to believe it, it'd be best for me. "In fact, you're doing so bad you're not even getting the home game," Kevin said. "How quickly it turns!" I said. "An hour ago Stocky was making a tableau about me, now I don't even get the home game!" Then Winter sat down. And a cold snap hits the table.
>Jason: EEFILQR 10B FIQ.E +27 57
>Winter: ?AEIORS I5 ScORIAE +74 98
#note Winter put IAE at I12, then picked it up, then played OvARIES at I2, then experimented with some stuff hooking the R to JOKE instead of the S ... finally decided on this. Meanwhile, I'm thinking: 1) Just pick one, if you want a tell from me you ain't getting it and 2) Quit sighing; I'd kill for that rack right now. Then he scored it as 76 ... four points I'd gain in a recount. He later wrote that he "misjudged the position of ERASIOn," which scores 77 at 13B.
>Jason: EHLNORT H10 THRONE +37 94
#note Again, correctly blowing up the rack when Q says to. I definitely made some strides, made improvements, stuff to build on. Although here, Championship Player says you can throw a blanket over the top 15 choices.
>Winter: CFITY B10 .IFTY +28 126
#note Slight mistake, but he noted he had C(I)TIFY at C9.
>Jason: AELRSTU 5B SALUTER. +66 160
#note Luckbox draw. Unfortunately, this tournament had too few of those. Championship Player likes (N)EUTRALS a little better.
>Winter: ADI D10 .ADI +36 162
>Jason: IIILNRT 6A LIRI +14 174
>Winter: AEMZ H1 MAZE. +51 213
>Jason: ABINNTW I13 WAN +23 197
#note Overthought it ... just should've played WAB at G13.
>Winter: UV A6 .UV +18 231
>Jason: BGINPST D4 B..P +16 213
>Winter: CDENOPR J12 CEP +30 261
#note Missing ENDOC(A)RP.
>Jason: AGINOST 10H ..G +8 221
#note Gah! ANTIS(M)OG! That, MELTONS, LUTENIST vs. Kid Fiszbein at MM in a game I lost by three ... these 3K-4K prob bingos are KILLING me lately! And I should have at least looked at them by now!
>Winter: DGNR 2F GR.ND +15 276
>Jason: AEINOST K4 ATONIES +69 290
>Winter: DEMOW L4 MOWED +48 324
#note Ouch.
>Jason: ?CGNSTX -CGX +0 290
#note Knew I really needed to make a good play, so naturally I took a lot of time and messed up anyway. I can solder on with C(O)X(E)S or G(O)X(E)S at F7. Q also likes quite a few exchanges ahead of this.
>Winter: AH G12 AH +25 349
>Jason: ?DNRSTY G4 D.Y +10 300
#note Q likes (c)R(OW)DY; only play with a .400+ win percentage. This is fifth ... maybe should've played the 11th-best play of (D)RY at J2, given what happens next.
>Winter: BEIN M3 BINE +26 375
>Jason: ?LNRSTU C9 L. +3 303
#note Q likes (C)UR at 12J ... gives me a 60+% shot.
>Winter: CEIOTX A14 OX +32 407
#note Said he passed on EXOTIC at 1J ... if so, that's stupid. He goes up 123 here (127 according to our scores) and there's no chance for me ... it's a guaranteed win even after the worst-case scenario of (C)ARViNGS for 101 and out. He needs spread, but how do you pass up what you have to know is a guaranteed win?
>Jason: ?NRSTUV I1 U. +6 309
#note Second to T(U)I at 13B. Winter was stunned I made this play: "How can you do that with no vowels unseen?" he asked. Quite irked, I said "They weren't unseen to me! A or E for SERVANT, I for STRIVEN ... that's half the deck! And there's no place to play the V by itself!" Thanks to Q for proving me right.
>Winter: AACEIOT 6F A. +11 418
>Jason: ?GNRSTV N2 VaRS +25 334
#note Naturally, I pull a G. I bingo with 24 in the bag (24!) and for the rest of the game I pull one vowel: a U. And then I make a 45-point mistake: V(I)T(AL) sets up a guaranteed out, including S(HOWE)RiNG.
>Winter: ACEIOT F5 ..C. +6 424
#note CA(NAP)E sets up (ID)IOT and the out in two.
>Jason: GNT F10 .T +5 339
>Winter: AEIOT A11 AE +11 435
#note "I haven't double-blanked anybody this tournament," Winter said. "Well, I've only done it once," I said. "Once more than me," he said as he walked off. 13 in 15 games here, 13/15 in New York, 4/7 in Ortonville, 16/20 in Pontiac, 9/14 at the Madness, 16/20 in Chicago. 71 blanks in 91 games post-BAT. I so could've won this whine-fest if given more time...
>Jason: GN B5 ..N +5 344
#note "That was a roughly even draw," he said. Yeah, 'cause in most even draws I'm going to lose by 117 or thereabouts. I lost (although I made mistakes that could've changed things) by 117; it's a tough sell from where I sit that this was anything close to an even draw. God, this loss hurt.
>Winter: IOT 8K ..IOT +18 453
