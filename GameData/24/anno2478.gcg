#note After letting this phony go, I deserve to lose the tournament; and indeed, it's the play that cost me the tournament. Now, it's not that I let it go, it's that I tried to cram the thought-making process into the five seconds he took to count it and ultimately thought "He's Paul Epstein and I'm not." Never mind that he's 26 points below me in rating. If I challenge it off and play through the E to go up almost 100, who knows how different it is? Didn't even hold. Bad, bad, bad. That's what will stick with me from this tournament ... and hopefully I'll learn my lesson. The silver lining: At least it's not as bad as when I let him get away with a phony 149-point trip-trip and a phony three. In the same game.
>Jason: CDINORU L4 CURDIN. +24 122
#note Maybe it's not good to go turnover here, since we've already burned through ?SSX. Or maybe that's a hindsight thing since I would draw AADIOO to go with my O.
>Paul_Epstein: ADEGNRR 12J GRAND. +16 129
#note Chuck pointed out he missed GRANDE(U)R. Speedy says he missed GNARRED. After VEILLESS*, he said he considered trying GARDNER(S)*.
>Jason: AADIOOO -AADIOOO +0 122
#note Missed ODA at 7G.

>Jason: EIMNOOU 8A MOO +19 162
#note Missed the star plays OMINOU(S) and U(D)O at 7K.
>Paul_Epstein: ADO 9A ADO +17 228

>Paul_Epstein: AIORT 10A RATIO +23 251

#note Ooh, how'd I miss I(O)NIZE? D'oh!
>Paul_Epstein: EGHRU 13A HUGER +32 283
>Jason: AAEIIQR B12 Q.A +24 232
#note A big equity hit, but a good chance he doesn't have the case I or either Y and will find it hard to block. Championship Player likes QUAI, but it's close.
>Paul_Epstein: AH A13 .AH +29 312
>Jason: AEIILNR 15A .ILI +21 253
#note (H)ILA's obviously better, but I wasn't sure on it being good.
>Paul_Epstein: OP F5 OP. +30 342
>Jason: ACENORS F3 CO... +9 262
#note Maybe this is the time to be daring and play (D)OC. I feared the K, though. Q likes that, and a bunch of others, better than this.
>Paul_Epstein: AITV 3B VATI. +20 362
>Jason: ADENRSW N12 .AW +14 276
#note I don't know if this is right or not. Maybe play it straight, drop the W at 12D, W(E)D, etc.
>Paul_Epstein: KUYY 12D Y.UKY +48 410
>Jason: DEENRSW -  +0 276
#note Obligated, esp. since there's no spread to worry about. Nice play by Paul.
>Paul_Epstein: AAEEFLT 14K FLA. +10 420
#note Both of us played "interesting" endgames. Paul must've mis-remembered the SENDER anamonic ... thought there could've been a bingo to block. SENDER doesn't take the W. Then he forgot DAWT. Needless to say, Q hates this play.
>Jason: DEENRSW H11 W.NDS +36 312
#note Best.
>Paul_Epstein: AEET 15K EAT +14 434
>Jason: EER B2 E.ER +14 326
#note 1-2 and just hoping to bring it back to respectable after lunch.
