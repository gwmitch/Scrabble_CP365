#note I like this play given Phil's exchange last turn. SUNDOG 10H might be better, but I didn't know it. I felt vindicated when he said his rack was LINTERS after the exchange.

#note This was Phil's rack...Q likes EL H1 best, though that's partly Quackle assuming I'll open things up for Phi's bingo rack.

#note Both Championship Player and simulation seem to favor FIG B13, a counterintuitive play that looks very good upon analysis. There isn't anything Phil can do with the TWS after it, it blocks off the MAUVES hook, and I keep a strong leave.

#note Champ. Player's favorite is USE 11C, with a win% of 90.3%, and this play doesn't even show up on its choices. It rises right near the top upon many-ply simulation, though I think that's really unreliable. Anyway, my feeling was that I was giving myself a 40% chance to draw a T and win the game outright with DETAINEE 13B. I didn't really consider just playing the E with USE, though I did think about ED E11. Any suggestions? I find that pre-endgame play is one of my weakest points.

>Sam: ADEEINX 2B DEX +26 378
#note This wins 100% of the time, though DEX D13 is Champ's top pick. 
>Phil_Wertheimer: EEMSTTW 1A WE +18 362
#note Phil's best option would be to block my outs with TET D13 or MET D13.
