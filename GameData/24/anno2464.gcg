>Pete: ENOORUX 8G ROUX +22 22
#note Duck likes OXO by 1.4 pts.  I was torn between the two, but my Uphobia won out.  Duck prefers placing it one over, but I prefered the U at the DLSs rather than the O.
>Dallas_Johnson: ADEEMOT -  +0 0
#note Challenged.  
>Pete: DEIIINO H7 I.DIN +6 28
#note After the fantastic DIII draw, I was torn.  I considered exchanging,but played off.  Duck of course wants to take the points with IODINE 9J, but I'm not quite that suicidal... I still don't know what the right play is. 
>Dallas_Johnson: GO J6 GO. +15 15
>Pete: EILOSTT 12C LITOTES +74 102
#note easy bingo.  both anagrams play at two spots, all work out essentially the same.
>Dallas_Johnson: AILMNRV -  +0 15
#note challenged.  

>Pete: ABEGINT C6 TANGIB.E +78 180
#note best of two playable. took me a minute to remember that BLEATING has an anagram.
>Dallas_Johnson: DEEMOT D3 DEMOTE +27 42
>Pete: DEFNRSV 10B F.VER +21 201
#note FED E4 is .1 ahead in equity, despite scoring 10 more points.  I liked getting rid of the extra clunky tile, particularly with a big early lead, and no vowels in the leave.   
>Dallas_Johnson: EJNO K4 JEON +27 69
>Pete: CDHNRSW E9 N.W. +14 215
#note Tied for best with WENT in the same place.  No good plays out there.  For some reason, I knew almost instinctively that I shouldn't exchange out of here.  I saw the potential of the CDHRS leave, and hoped to get lucky.
>Dallas_Johnson: EW 4K .EW +26 95
>Pete: ACDHNRY 3L HAY +33 248
#note embarrasing miss.  HANDY 13I wins by 12.7.  I even played HAY in the wrong place, and created an unnecessary opening.  
>Dallas_Johnson: OZ 8A ZO.. +39 134
>Pete: CDEEORS L6 RECODES +83 331
#note best.  I saw the cooler NECROSED, but took the points.
>Dallas_Johnson: QSTU 11J QU.ST +28 162
>Pete: ADEILOR N6 IDOLA.ER +63 394
#note Only bingo.  I was sure that I was missing something, but apparently not.
>Dallas_Johnson: APR O8 PAR +31 193
>Pete: ?AAAAEN 2N AA +14 408
#note best.  beats my other option, exchange AAAA, by 8.
>Dallas_Johnson: FILMY 1K FILMY +65 258
#note very nice play.
>Pete: ??AAENR 2E sANtERA +64 472
#note Didn't now TANGIBLES, so I missed the star play ARSENAL.  Missed a bunch of easy eights, because I'm useless with 2 blanks.
>Dallas_Johnson: CKU 5D .UCK +24 282
>Pete: ABELNSU 14H UNBALES +100 572
#note this and its anagram (which I blanked on) were the only bingoes. I was unsure of UNBALES, but I figured it was worth a shot.  Just sick, sick tiles.
>Dallas_Johnson: GHIIPTV 15F PHT +30 312
#note missing PITH
>Pete: I G5 .I +6 578
