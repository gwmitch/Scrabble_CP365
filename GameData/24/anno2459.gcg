#note Can I get a round of applause?
>Jeremy_Hildrebrand: IQ 7M QI +42 42
>Matthew: EEEIORY K6 EY.IE +8 74
#note I had a hard time this this rack, and my choice doesn't sim very well. I figured that there was already a big S spot in column O, so EYRIE wasn't especially dangerous. I should have gone with my first choice of 7G EYE. It simmed best.
>Jeremy_Hildrebrand: ACDDEG L1 CADGED +31 73
>Matthew: AAENORV 1L .AVE +27 101
#note Jeez. I remember asking myself "What's VERANDA + O?" but I missed the top play 3G VERAN(D)A. But I dunno, I still like my play best. The leave is promising and I shut down the line.
>Jeremy_Hildrebrand: FJU N4 FUJ. +30 103
>Matthew: ANNORRT L10 NOR +8 109
#note Another fishing rack. But Q prefers moves with higher turnover. I guess a leave that doesn't contain E or S is really not worth taking a small score for. NONART in the same spot sims best... but opening a triple lane for 16 points? Honestly, I still like NOR. But someone can enlighten me, because NOR sims poorly.

#note Take a minute to look at this position I now face. It's an interesting one. There are several OK plays and one star play. Try to find it before clicking on.
>Matthew: EGITUVZ 6J Z.. +33 225
#note This was a tough rack. Notice I'm one letter off of like every word that ends in Z. A fish for a big 60+ point Z play is considerable. But I was eager to get the lead back and was not keen on getting the spot blocked entirely. 13I VEGIE is the star play that I wish I had seen. 30 points while not spending the Z, and keeping UTZ for shots at FUTZ, LUTZ, YUTZ, PUTZ. I had assumed the best play kept GEZ for a shot at GEEZ. Kudos if you spotted VEGIE.
>Jeremy_Hildrebrand: EFTW M11 WEFT +27 234
>Matthew: EGHITUV 9D VUGH +24 249
#note Not bad, but 14A VUGH is better. I turned it down because it felt like he would just come back with a 30+ point word through the V. Thinking about it now, a V in that spot is likely only dangerous is he holds an E. If he doesn't, he likely has to leave that open. And look, I have a good leave to score there next turn if he leaves it open. But alas, I made 9D VUGH.
>Jeremy_Hildrebrand: BEILLOS 2B LOBELI.S +74 308
>Matthew: ADEIOTW D8 A.OWED +28 277
#note Not a good a play at all. All the best moves are parallels along row 3... WADI being best. I was wishing to keep bingo lines open, but really AVOWED clogs up lanes more than WADI.
>Jeremy_Hildrebrand: COX 3A COX +44 352
>Matthew: AIIOTTU -OUTI +0 277
#note Another lousy play. OUT(W)AIT is clearly best. I kept an I because I had delusions of an -I(N)I(ZED) bingo.
>Jeremy_Hildrebrand: KOOST O7 STOOK +39 391
>Matthew: ?AGILRT 12A InT.GRAL +60 337
#note LIGATURe is the star bingo. Ah, I usually see plays like that, but I just wasn't looking this time. Hard to focus after blowing my early lead like that. I saw TRAWLING but I was only 8000% sure and I wanted to be 9000% sure.
