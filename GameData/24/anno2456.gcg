>Matthew: BFLMNNR -BFLMN +0 0
#note I have no clue how I made the NINTH best play here. "Better" plays according to Q: Ex. BFLNR, Ex. BFLN, Ex. BFLNN, Ex. BFNNR, Ex. BFLMNR, Ex. BFLMNN, Ex. BFMNN, Ex. BFLNNR. So LM is a better leave than NR? I don't understand Q on this one.

>Matthew: EGINNRT I6 RENTING +68 68
>Ross_Brown: AIRT H12 AIRT +19 35
>Matthew: ACDGLST F4 GLAD +19 87
#note This is the best play in a tricky position. And no, there are no good -ING plays under OPE.
>Ross_Brown: BFLU G9 FLUB +19 54
>Matthew: CORSTXZ J12 SOX +33 120
#note Spent a lot of time on this rack. It looks like a nice rack, but there is actually NOTHING to do with the Z or X and NO way to give yourself a nice leave. It actually did take me a full 4 minutes to spot SOX (the only play over 19 points) and I'm glad I did, because it is best by far. I'm glad to see two plays I felt stupid for considering - 11F XU and Ex. CXZ - did sim in the top ten. It took me so long to see SOX because I was too hung up on keeping the S. Look, I stop overvaluing leave, and I make the right move.

>Ross_Brown: EEEEEEE -EEEEEEE +0 82
>Matthew: AACOQRV 15F QA. +12 200
#note Again, there are no scoring options here. Highest is 21 for C6 AVO. So I don't feel bad taking 12 to unload the Q and block a lane. Q likes AVO, ARVO, and AVA at C6 and also 10C VOCAL. I can't justify keeping the Q and opening up a lane for 7's for just 7 more points. QAT sims 5th.
>Ross_Brown: BDE J5 BED +21 103
>Matthew: ACEORRV 4H CRAVER +35 235
#note Just CRAVE sims a bit better. I was going for CRAVER because it takes fewer hooks. A defensive-minded play but I can see how CRAVE is better.
>Ross_Brown: ??CEIIS N4 sIlICES +70 173
>Matthew: ADEHNOO M9 DAHOON +31 266
#note SILICES did look funny, but there were just so many reasons not to challenge. DAHOON was pretty good, but HONDA in the same spot is the winner. Also didn't see K1 HOO(V)ED which is very nice. DAHOON is third. 
>Ross_Brown: FPU 12L P.UF +26 199
>Matthew: AEILMMU O12 .UME +27 293
#note K2 MAVIE sims a little better. I prefer my play.
>Ross_Brown: ITY K2 TI.Y +34 233
>Matthew: AEILMTV M2 VI.L +16 309
#note I thought this was one of the trickiest racks of the game, but it wasn't really. I just completely misplayed it. H1 EVI(C)T is obvious and I feel stupid for missing it. Fortunately, my only big mistake of the game.
>Ross_Brown: AEGNNSU 2B .UNNAGES +61 294
>Matthew: ADEEKMT 1F KAME +53 362
#note Got the perfect rack to snap back. Crisis instantly averted.
>Ross_Brown: JOW L8 JOW +31 325
>Matthew: DEIORTW K13 WIT +20 382
#note Blah. 8A TRIODE. This was, surprisingly, the first opportunity I had all game to hit that spot at row 8. It's stayed open all game. But I missed it. D'oh.
>Ross_Brown: ASY C4 .YAS +24 349
>Matthew: DELOR D7 OLDER +9 391
#note For the record, Q prefers to be a douche here and not go out... maximizing spread by letting oppo deal with his shit endgame rack for one more turn.
