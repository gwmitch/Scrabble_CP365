>David_Jones: EGI 8G GIE +8 8
>Matthew: EHITUYZ 7I YUTZ +29 29
#note Best.
>David_Jones: DF J6 F.D +21 29
>Matthew: EHIIQSY -HIIQY +0 29
#note Not the worst rack in the world, but a very unpromising board. Q does like SI(Z)Y best, but the next 9 best plays are exchanges.
>David_Jones: AV K5 VA. +17 46
>Matthew: ACESTTT I7 ..TT +8 37
#note Here's where the fishing starts. But so far so good, (YE)TT sims best.
>David_Jones: ILRSV 11E VIRLS +24 70
>Matthew: ACCESTT F10 T.C +7 44
#note Ugh! Did I just draw CT? Q likes 8L ACTS best as I am once again too hung up on keeping my S. But T(I)C is a clear second. These two fishes were good plays, so far.
>David_Jones: ABEIKLR 13C BALKIER +90 160
>Matthew: ACEIOST G8 .O +4 48
#note Another unhelpful draw and the board now had no bingo lanes. (G)O is a frustration play. (Z)OECIA is the start play that I just did not see. Also, there are some nice parallels on row 14... COATIS and IOTAS. Second best move is another fish: 8L AI.
>David_Jones: BMO 14B MOB +22 182
>Matthew: ACEIIST 15A AI +10 58
#note Another frustration play. I didn't even see the obviously better spot for AI at 8L. 8L AI actually sims best this turn. Q likes fishing a lot of these turns, I'm just getting annoyed and can't get the letters I need to make a word.

>Matthew: AHHIJSS 12B HAJ +55 181
#note A ray of hope! This move gives me a 2.7% win.
>David_Jones: ADNOR 15G RADON +35 323
>Matthew: AADINSS 8L AIDS +30 211
#note Best. I need to hit a bingo off of this draw to stay alive.
>David_Jones: AWW F4 WAW. +18 341
>Matthew: AAENOOS -AOO +0 211
#note ... no bingo. The exchange doesn't sim too well, but nothing is <1% win at this point.
>David_Jones: EFY G3 FEY +23 364
>Matthew: ADEENOS D2 ENDOS.EA +70 281
#note Don't know ADENOSES, but I'm glad I hit something. Kind of wish I blocked that spot, though...
