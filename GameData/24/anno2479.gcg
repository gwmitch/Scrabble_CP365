#note Tim had been 2-1 against other lower-rated players for the first three rounds. I offered him free challenges "since I'm the second-highest-rated player in Michigan" (I made sure Knappster heard me), but he declined. I tell you, it probably won't last much longer, so I'm milking it for all it's worth and then some! Winter might've phonied 10 times this game, but I made sure not to abuse the privilege and didn't play any uncommon word.

#note Both of his last two plays I was impressed with ... showed good board vision.
>Jason: EINNRRW 13C NEW +25 354
>Tim_Beaupre: BCOY N3 COBY +32 248
#note Letting an unrated phony the second-highest rated player in Michigan, on a four no less ... not the high point of my career. For his part, he was sure it was good.
>Jason: BDILNRR 14G B.RD +11 365
#note I almost emptied, but given the pool I figured I'd have a good chance for something at 2E. Didn't see that I could play the same tiles at C2 for five more.

#note Tim has a cool star play here: OTITI(C).
>Jason: AEILNRS 1B .RENAILS +77 442
#note I seriously felt bad drawing ??SSSJZ on a newbie to win by 190, esp. in a tournament without spread. But he took it like a man.
