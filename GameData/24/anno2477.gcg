>Jason: ABEENTT E7 B.ATEN +16 16
#note I hate these racks with no good options. Opted for turnover. Fat lot of good it did me... BE(T)TA, which I considered and is Speedy's pick, is almost certainly better.
>Carol_Ravichandran: EILNORS D9 NEROLIS +76 84
>Jason: DEEETTU 15D .UEDE +18 34
#note Knew I could play the word Cesar missed against Robin P-D, but couldn't remember what it was. (S)UTTEE.

#note Hopefully Chuck doesn't see this...
>Jason: EMOTTVW 14F MOW +32 66

>Carol_Ravichandran: FGR K11 FR.G +16 209
>Jason: AEELSTZ 4J LAZE +35 142
#note Funny ... as soon as I punched in the rack I saw TEAZLES. Why couldn't I have done that over the board?!?!

#note Need vowels?
>Jason: AEHIOST 12I HO.A +24 166
>Carol_Ravichandran: ADQSU 15K SQUAD +84 317
#note The "Raftery." Yeah, ASU was a good pick into that DQxx leave.
>Jason: EEIILST N1 LEI +19 185
#note I asked if, since spread doesn't matter, I could "pull a Cree" and resign. I was told that would be frowned upon.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ADN O1 AND +30 347
>Jason: AEIISTU -AIU +0 185

>Carol_Ravichandran: INOY 5D YONI. +22 369
>Jason: EIIOPST 14N PI +19 204
#note Hated closing a lane, but what else?

>Jason: EIORSTU 9H .ITREOUS +62 266
#note Normally would've at least been held, she said, but under the circumstances she wasn't going to question it.
>Carol_Ravichandran: AEIKLST O5 TALK. +27 441
#note Missing LA(R)KIEST and STA(R)LIKE.
>Jason: BDEFGRT 3A DEBT +30 296
#note Saw FE at N6, correctly deduced this was better. Missed EF at N5. D'oh! It's two better than this.
>Carol_Ravichandran: EIMS 7J SEMI +14 455
#note 1-1 and know I probably need to win out to win Bomerica. But at least the bagging's out of the way.
