>Mason_Shambach: OOOOO -OOOOO +0 0
#note Mason said he threw back four O's.
>Jason: BLOSTTY 8D BLOTTY +28 28
#note Q likes doubling the Y by a tick. (shrugs)
>Mason_Shambach: EH 9C HE +13 13
#note Somehow he got 14, as did I recounting it. Hmph.
>Jason: AEIRSUU -IUU +0 28
#note Debated between keeping AERS and EIRS.
>Mason_Shambach: GINTT D8 ..TTING +20 33
>Jason: AELLPRS C12 PEAL +23 51
#note Mistake 1: Knowing I'd pick wrongly between AERS and EIRS, which I did since I'd have SPILLER. Mistake 2: Not thinking SPALLER was good. Mistake 3: Not thinking BETTINGS was good. Mistake 4: Missing PER(I)LLAS. Let's move on.
>Mason_Shambach: I C9 .I +7 40
>Jason: AJLRRRS E5 JAR. +22 73
#note Was going to play Speedy's pick of J(AG)RA until that fish.
>Mason_Shambach: D 14B D.. +10 50
>Jason: EELRRSU 6B URE. +6 79
#note Not as bad a play as I'd originally thought. Not missing bingos and it takes his best spot.
>Mason_Shambach: AGINNST 7I ANTINGS +66 116
>Jason: EELORSW O4 WOR.E +36 115
>Mason_Shambach: F 10B F.. +14 130
#note Oh, not this again ... in hindsight, though, I don't think his leaves were good. After the game, he said he should've exchanged earlier. Might've been fighting through consonant-itis.
>Jason: EEELOSS 6I SEE +17 132
#note Pretty good, considering I missed OLE(O) or OLEO(S) at F5. On this board, the S isn't exactly a great tile anyway. (See? I'm learning!)
>Mason_Shambach: DD L6 D.D +12 142
>Jason: ELOORSZ N2 ZOO +29 161
#note Oops. Whiffed on ZERO at F2. Saw ZOO right away and never looked harder. Only 2.2 points behind ZEROS at 2 behind ZERO, though.
>Mason_Shambach: CI K6 ..IC +9 151
>Jason: EEELRST 12C ..E +5 166
#note Grr ... missed RESE(T)TLE.
>Mason_Shambach: DIPRU F10 PUR +17 168
#note Picked up PU(T)RID. Speedy sees DIUR(ETIC). Said he couldn't remember if PURI was good.
>Jason: EELRRST K5 R....LE +36 202
#note What I should've done last turn. Probably my only cool play of the day.
>Mason_Shambach: AGI 3K AGI. +10 178
>Jason: ?EMORST 12H MOiSTER +82 284
#note Finally putting this game away.
>Mason_Shambach: HU 13H UH +22 200
>Jason: AAAFIMO O1 FA +26 310
#note Missed FO(R)AM and MA(R)IA. Stupid fives...
>Mason_Shambach: ADQ B5 Q.AD +14 214
>Jason: AABIMOW A7 MAW +37 347
>Mason_Shambach: IN 5E .IN +10 224
>Jason: ABIOOOV C3 VAI. +25 372
#note Gotta love the leave. Surprised Speedy agrees.
>Mason_Shambach: X 4C .X +18 242
>Jason: BEIOOOY 14I OBOE +18 390
>Mason_Shambach: ?ACELNU 2E UNCLEAn +63 305
>Jason: EIIKOVY N10 VI.EO +32 422
#note Gah! Missed KY(R)IE, a 21-point mistake! I'd like to think I'd have seen it if spread mattered, but I probably wouldn't have. Besides, I really wanted to work on my endgame here ... play as good as I could in all seven.
>Mason_Shambach: NS 4B S.. +25 330
#note Mason's a notoriously bad tracker ... after I made my play he said he knew he should've gone out in one, but he didn't know what I had. Plus, he had no time.
>Jason: IKY H1 I.K +21 443
#note D'oh! K(E)Y at M11! Apparently my brain went on one of its patented "Yay, we won!"-then-sleep modes.
>Mason_Shambach: N M12 .N +8 338
#note (ZOO)N, but like I said, he had :04 left. Sloppy game, but I'll take 1-0 any day.
>Mason_Shambach:  (Y) +8 346
