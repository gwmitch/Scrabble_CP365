>Panupol: ILOOP 8D POLIO +20 20
>Carl: AIIIMOS F5 AIO.I +7 7
#note MILIA is better, even if the leave is considerably worse. The tighter board and 8 extra points compensate.
>Panupol: ATU E4 UTA +12 32
>Carl: EEHIMST H7 H.MESITE +64 71
#note This was an agonizing decision. Panupol had spent a long time playing UTA, which annoying blocked HEMPIEST and the better spot for HOMESITE. You just know he has an S or a blank. Three out of four experts said they would play the bingo here. Pakorn dissented, saying that you really have to think about HEM D2. I did that. And then I played the bingo instead. Roll end credits.
>Panupol: ?AELZ 15D ZEALs +108 140
#note He passed up a bingo to play this, judiciously I'm sure.
>Carl: DLNRRUW -DLNRUW +0 71
#note Too flustered to find RUNDLE E10. DURN D1 also sims well.
>Panupol: DEX G10 DEX +25 165
>Carl: AABEIOR I1 AEROBIA +67 138
#note Oh well, at least the exchange paid off.
>Panupol: DEMNN 1H M.NNED +30 195
>Carl: DHNOPRU 4H H.UND +26 164
>Panupol: GOT J6 TOG +16 211
>Carl: AAEGOPR 11E PR..AGE +40 204
#note Not goin' down without a fight!
>Panupol: BEF 14F FE.B +32 243
>Carl: AEOSTVW 12B WOVE +24 228
#note Dumb. GAVOTS 8J. Again I mistakenly unburden myself of garbage at the expense of too many points.
>Panupol: EKNR L9 KERN +27 270
>Carl: AGQSTUV M7 QUA +30 258
#note Is this really 17 points worse than GAVOT C9 or SUQ M11? Yeah, the leave after QUA is junk, but I don't want to shut down the board. The sim is being harsh, but I probably just don't understand this goofy game.
>Panupol: IORS M11 SORI +22 292
>Carl: GILSTTV C11 V.LT +14 272
#note And yet, here I am doing exactly what I swore not to do last turn. And it sims best. Thing is, SORI telegraphs the other S, and I could give him a dangerous lane if I make GIT or GITS N6.
>Panupol: AIR B12 .AIR +20 312
>Carl: DGIINST N6 GITS +29 301
#note And yet, here I am doing exactly what I vowed not to do last turn. Only, this time I failed to spot DINT, which is clearly better. Just because GITS was a good play last turn doesn't mean it still is.
>Panupol: JO 7C JO +21 333
>Carl: CDFILNW 14K FL.C +18 319
>Panupol: ?CERT O11 CREsT +30 363
#note For someone who didn't get any bingos, he sure is cleaning up.
>Carl: DINNSWY D1 WYNN +32 351
#note Yay! I didn't muck up the endgame.
>Panupol: AEUY I9 YE. +25 388
