>Sue: AEILOSX 8G LOX +20 20
#note 8C OXALIS -11.9 equity.  AEIS leave is too vowel heavy.  Just OX is 9.5 points better.
>Jeremy: ?ORTTUW H8 .UTWROTe +83 83
#note -0.6 points.  OUTTOWeR is slightly better iI think because E is a common bingo tile.  R is a bit better in a triple lane.
>Sue: ACEEISZ 10F ZE.A +33 53
#note best
>Jeremy: DIIINOO F10 .OOID +19 102
#note best
>Sue: ABCEHIS 12D CH.I. +20 73
#note -33.2 equity.  15A BACHES.  Also 15A CEIBAS was pretty good.
>Jeremy: EIIMNPT I13 PI +16 118
#note Blocked my own PIMIENT(O). 11H (W)IMP -1.2 equity
>Sue: AABERSV 15A BRAVES +61 134
#note 15A BRAVAS -1.3 equity.
>Jeremy: EIKMNNT 11H .INK +24 142
#note best
>Sue: ACELMPT B10 CAMPE. +36 170
#note best because of defense.  Normally the CT leave for PALMER would be best, but the C ending takes the lead and gives me a rough board to work with.
>Jeremy: DEGMNTV 14H ..MED +14 156
#note Exch. DGTV keeping EMN.  -5.0 equity
>Sue: AAEELQT 11A Q.T +12 182
#note 15K TELAE -16.0 equity
>Jeremy: AFGNNTV 13K FANG +24 180
#note Despite giving up a monster hook, best.  FAN and FAG are well behind.
>Sue: ?AADEEL O9 DEALAtE +83 265
#note best... no sim needed.
>Jeremy: INNOTUV N6 VINO +18 198
#note best according to Quackle, but I think N7 UNION is better now that I look at it.  VINO constricts the board too much. If you can play M7 parallel, I get boxed in.
>Sue: AEGIIRT M9 GRAI. +15 280
#note L12 G(AD)I -11.5 equity.  I must open the board to get a bingo, and when I do holding a strong leave of AEIRT will help you to exploit it before I get to it.
>Jeremy: ELNNTUY L12 L..Y +28 226
#note best.  The leave isn't so pretty, but it scores more than any other play.
>Sue: EIIRRTU K9 IR. +7 287
#note 15K E(Y)RI(E) -2.9 equity, but a solid play.
>Jeremy: EFNNTUW 7K UNW.T +12 238
#note 15K W(Y)N. -5.1 equity.  I stand by my play.  It sacrifices points, but gives me space to bingo.  Finally I have a decent bingo line.
>Sue: EEIRSTU 10B .UE +7 294
#note L1 ESURIE(N)T.  -37.2 equity
>Jeremy: DEFNOOY L4 FEN.Y +30 268
#note best.  keeps a terrible leave, but strings out an E keeping a D for an -ED ending.  Interesting 2nd choice is I5 ONY(X).
>Sue: AEIRSTT 5F TREATI.S +66 360
#note 5E TREATIS(E) is a double-double.  -15.8 equity
>Jeremy: BDEJOOS H1 DOJO.S +45 313
#note Down 92 I will need a big play, and leave the board open to bingo, and pray for a lucky draw.  DOJOES* is phoney but better than all legal plays.  9C JOB is the best legal play, but that seals my fate because you only need to block the DWS lane row 4.  If I bingo, it's a singleton and not enough to win.
>Sue: EGILNOU 1H .UELING +10 370
#note Championship player pick I2 NO.  Valuation is 5.  I play 4A HEARSE, and you are out with 7C GUILE.  DUELING is valued at -4.  I play 2G BOSH, and you are out with OX.  So a net -9 point endgame ding.
>Jeremy: ABEEHRS O1 SHARE +57 370
#note +19 better than the best play, but DUELINGS* is phony.  2G BOSH is the best legal play.
>Sue: O I7 O. +10 380
#note N1 (G)O.  -6 points.
>Sue:  (BE) +8 388
