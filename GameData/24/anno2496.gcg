#note Brownie points if you can spot the 9-letter bingo that is playable here.

#note Lucky bastard! 335 points in 4 turns.
>Mark_K: EITW 1K TWI.E +42 245
#note 221 points in 4 turns! What does it take to win a game around here?

#note EKE J9 sims best. I thought that my play might get a challenge.

#note Had I been allowed to play QI J10 in the same game as ZA 14F and two 2x2s, Mark could have strangled me to death and no jury would convict him.

#note Taking the points is usually right. I balked at the miserable IKOU leave after MOG A7, which wins the sim handily.

#note Time to slow down. Despite everything, I had not won this game yet. I realized that Mark was probably fishing for EDITIONS. He might well have it. Is it worth it to block? What will happen then? He can't stick me with the J, but he will surely outscore me. What to do now?

#note He thought he might be able to win if he drew IS. He would have been right. The thought that he might think that was one of the reasons I played JO. A blocking play like EFT O8 will sometimes stick me with the J because TAJ 5M is no longer a possibility. EF O8 is probably a little better, but I'd be sacrificing considerable points to block a bingo that he might not have, or which will give me a big comeback if he plays it right.

#note My opponent won 20 bucks for losing this game, and earned every penny of it. Absolutely phenomenal!
