>Evans: AELNOOV 8G OVA +12 12
#note Opening short sims nicely here, although Quackle statically likes LAEVO or NOVAE. A style choice, I suppose. This placement, however, is retarded. I believe I accidentally said "Uh, why did I just do that?" aloud to Alyssa about two seconds after hitting my clock. Not sure if she heard me or not. -2
>Alyssa: BDEITT 9I BITTED +20 20
#note Oh, look... her play scores more points now. Duh.
>Evans: CEELNOT 7I COLE +19 31
#note Missing ENOL to the TWS, which sims very well. -5
>Alyssa: FORW 8L FROW +57 77
#note Yikes.
>Evans: EGIJNRT J6 J. +25 56
#note Fishy fishy.
>Alyssa: DGNO F6 DONG +17 94
>Evans: EEGINRT 10M GEN +16 72
#note This position was really weird, so I entered six options -- ED 6E, TEG K9, ET 10N, GEN 10M, exchanging an E, and passing -- started the sim, went to work, and came home nine hours later to check out the results. After 1.1 million iterations, ED for 3 points comes out on top. I'm a little skeptical though, mainly because the duck's probably a little stupid about how to respond to the obvious fish. I still like my play, sort of. A highly debatable -3.
>Alyssa: ACMR E4 CRAM +23 117
>Evans: EIIPRRT 4B PRI.E +18 90
#note Missed a couple of slightly better plays here -- I like PICRITE best, keeping just an R, although REFT/RIP keeps a nice leave and is also solid. -4
>Alyssa: DOSY 11J YODS +21 138
>Evans: IINRSTW 6L WIN +18 108
#note Sims best. Fishing off the W for 21 seems pointless on this board.
>Alyssa: IQUU B1 QUI.U +32 170
>Evans: DHIKRST O1 THIRDS +40 148
>Alyssa: EHOP 12I HOPE +33 203
>Evans: AAEKNUV N2 UKE +32 180
#note Did I even look at the Q? Jesus. Missing AQUA is awful. -11
>Alyssa: AELOSST 10C SOLATES +76 279
#note Cool placement. Nice find.
>Evans: AAEEENV E10 .EAVE +16 196
#note Sims best. NEVE 13J is interesting for the points, but I need to keep a consonant if I want to bingo soon.
>Alyssa: ?AILNOR B9 AILeRON +76 355
#note Maybe CLARION 15B? That would shut the I(SOLATES) bingo lane down a little, and it scores the maximum 80.
>Evans: AAEIMNX F14 XI +50 246
>Alyssa: AFILUY 1B .UALIFY +69 424
#note Oy vey.
>Evans: AAEEMNT 3F MANATEE +65 311
>Alyssa: ?BEGNRZ 15D pR.ZE +48 472
#note Row 12 is awesome... you can perfectly fit ZEBRA through the E and the A. ZEBRANO is best.
