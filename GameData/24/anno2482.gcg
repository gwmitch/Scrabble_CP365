#note Missing PRIMIN(G)S and IMPRIS(O)N.
>Elaine_Glowniak: HOW L12 WHO +34 54
>Jason: EILNRSV M6 SILVERN +74 110
#note On this board, I thought "no way is she going to give me a SILVERN spot". After this, I looked to see if I could hook the L to PAW and thought "Hey, wait a minute! She gave me the spot!" The accidental genius strikes again.
>Elaine_Glowniak: DYZ 14K D.ZY +34 88
>Jason: ?AITUUY -AUUY +0 110
#note Considered this, YUA(N) at I5 and AY at 15N. Missed AU(N)TY at I6. Of the three, Speedy likes YUAN third, keeping AT fourth (but look at the pool), this tenth and AY 14th. But only 5.6 points separate first and 15th.

>Elaine_Glowniak: DEILNOT 13B INDOLE.T +72 169
#note It must suck to not have power tiles to bingo with. Me, I can't bingo without power tiles. I just noticed that, other than OBTAINER, all of my bingos had an S.
>Jason: AHMNOTU N2 MOUTH +49 239
#note I played this very quickly. Elaine started to turn the board and saw it was already facing her. "You play upside-down?" she asked. "Sometimes," I said. "When I have no-brainer plays."
