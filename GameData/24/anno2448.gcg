#note What an awesome find... I've been through the five-vowel eights a bunch of times and didn't remember this one.  I had nowhere to play my bingo, though, and I thought that if I ended up losing the challenge, that might change at relatively little cost.
#note The important thing to remember here is that Winter scores this as 68 points.  I will remind you later.

#note Desperation again.  I was fishing, but I had no idea what for.  I assumed Winter would have a great Z play in the O column and I would soon be toast.  
>Winter: BEEEITZ L1 BIZE +50 423
#note That should do it.  Winter figured he could outrun me, and even if I bingoed in the O column it wouldn't be enough to win.  
>George_Viebranz: CILORST O7 COSTRIL +90 422
#note I had forgotten LICTORS, was very sure that COSTRIL* was good, and doubted SOLI. This was a Hail Mary, and even as I was scoring it I didn't realize that it would tie the game.  I hit the clock and waited for the insta-challenge.  The fact that it didn't come made me feel pretty good, because, like I said... I wasn't sure SOLI was good.  I don't think I'd ever seen it on a board before.  Now, if I had found LICTORS and known that it was the only good word in that rack, I could have played it at O6 and it wouldn't be enough.  COSTRIL* scores 90, which ties.  "Looks like a tie," I say.  Winter, unhappy, says, "unless you want a recount."  I thought about it for a minute, and I figured since I never thought I could win this game, a tie sounded pretty decent, and it would be nice to not have to worry about spread for a little bit.  I didn't have much and Winter had tons.  "I'll take the tie," I said.  Winter then announced that he wanted to do a recount.  I hung out while he did that.  He gets to ENCAENIA and finds that he overscored it by 4 points.  We both count it to be sure.  I feel a strange mixture of guilt, pride, confusion, triumph, and the knowledge that karma exists indeed, and it had dropped a huge golden egg filled with Gummi Sharks and dollar bills into my lap.
