>Pete: EGGRRSU 8D RUGGERS +70 70
#note I found the bingo immediately.  I didn't want to fool around whith whether or not there were any front hooks on the TWS, so I played it here. 
>Joel_Wapnick: BDEEINT J2 BENDIE.T +69 69
>Pete: DHLNTUW 3G UNW.D +14 84
#note THRU I6 is best, which I totally whiffed on.  My play was second, 4.6 points behind.  I took a long while on this play... a tough early position.
>Joel_Wapnick: AEFTT 5E FATTE. +20 89
>Pete: EHLNSTZ 4D LEZ +40 124
#note easily best.  Gotta love the no-brainers when playing a great of the game.
>Joel_Wapnick: ?ADEEUV C8 DEVAlUE +83 172
#note I didn't have the guts to challenge Joel freaking Wapnick here... especially since I saw it set me up.
>Pete: CHNORST 11A CH.NTORS +76 200
#note Only bingo.  Saved an otherwise tricky rack.
>Joel_Wapnick: AADEEEO -  +0 172
#note And then, he holds... and challenges.  When a really good player challenges, you start to doubt yourself, so I imagined that I was misremembering when we walked to the computer.  And then... Acceptable.  Wow.  
>Pete: AAJNOST 10F JO +52 252
#note Another no-brainer.  Altho ANNOTATE H1 woulda won me major style points.
>Joel_Wapnick: BDEEW 15A BEDEW +48 220
>Pete: AAFMSTT 14B F.M +30 282
#note I missed FRAT 17, as I apparently blanked on the spot.  FEM scored, but leaves awful and finished second,3.3 behind.  But I had a lead, and scoring isn't a bad idea.
>Joel_Wapnick: GOO 6F GOO +29 249
>Pete: AAIOSTT A7 ATTI. +21 303
#note Wow... I'm shocked how bad ATTIC does.  way behind TAO 12F.  STOAI H11 was another bad miss on this position... and of course I'll pay.
>Joel_Wapnick: AEIINOP B1 EPINAOI +74 323
#note and I pay immediately.
>Pete: AAAOSUY A1 YO +34 337
#note when playing Joel Wapnick, I don't need AAUY draws.  Duck likes BAYOU, but I couldn't justify leaving the super hot-spot open, even with the awful leave.
>Joel_Wapnick: EOPY H11 .EPOY +33 356
>Pete: AAALSSU 2J .AALS +17 354
#note JOUALS woulda been sweet.  I went with BAALS, forgetting the far more defensive anagrams.  I'm trying to avoid panicking... bunch of good stuff unseen, and it's close.
>Joel_Wapnick: AILM 1L MAIL +38 394
>Pete: AAHINSU I13 AHA +22 376
#note I knew I had to keep the UI for a possible Q play.  I didn't like blocking, but I didn't see a bingo as my likely way to win.  With AHA, which wins sim, I'm banking on drawing some of the good stuff left.
>Joel_Wapnick: INX J11 NIX +22 416
>Pete: INQRSUV 15H ..NQUI +19 395
#note I decided to set up the S hook, in case the blank was in the bag.  If it was, I had a vague chance at a big play.  Duck likes VIRL D1, which sim says wins about 21%.  I'm really missing how.  Please tell me.
>Joel_Wapnick: ?CEIKRR N11 RICKs +38 454
#note Missing ICKERs, which he saw after the game.  Not in the cards for me this time.
>Pete: ILORSV M9 VIOL +15 410
#note Missing VIS/BEDEWS, but all in all, I'm not at all upset with this game.  I played OK...  Maybe not Joel Wapnick level, but ok nonetheless.  Feel free to criticize on my LJ.
>Joel_Wapnick: ER 3D ER +10 464
#note Missing REE 7H 11, which he saw postgame.
>Joel_Wapnick:  (RS) +4 468
