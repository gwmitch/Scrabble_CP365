#note This is 0.6 behind trading all 7 or trading 6 to the D, which are virtually even.

#note Sim prefers playing this at M2 by a little more than 3 points.  I felt like six points was a bit much to give up here, but at the same time the other placement just seemed to make things too easy for the opponent.  There's a chance that he may not be able to score much after this placement.  However, there was also a chance that he couldn't play off the Q and I would hit it first.
>Koenig: ADEGGNT M2 GAG +21 110
#note Best, athough NAGGED K9 is a nice alternative.
>Dave: DEEITTV 11K EDIT +23 86
#note Playing to the score and board shape.  VET is a great play if you're in the lead, but it blocks the board up badly for comebacks.  This avoids shutting down the bingo line and creates several more.

>Koenig: CCHNRTY M11 .TCHY +26 178
#note I considered just playing ITCH to save the Y hook for the next turn, but thought it was better to score more and give myself more chances to draw vowels.  The openings this creates aren't a huge concern, but if you want to play it safer, CAGEY 4K is a pretty good play.
>Dave: ABKNTUU 15M .UK +30 145
#note I missed KYAT, but this is almost as good.
>Koenig: ?CLNNPR O7 P.N +5 183
#note The duck prefers trading here, but I thought there was some value in taking out the last open vowel, as opponent might also need it for a play.  With this leave, even one vowel may be enough to bingo.

>Dave: ANTUVWY E9 WAVY +32 194
#note I didn't realize that this played at 11C for one more point, but this way does keep the board a bit tighter.
>Koenig: ?BCLNST 12D B.S +16 213
#note Still no vowels.  BY might seem like the obvious play, but it's good to remember that the law of averages is a hoax. (i.e., Just because you've drawn consonants for the last few turns doesn't mean you're due to get a vowel.)  Also, the S isn't that helpful on this board, so I thought it was better to score the extra two and give myself another chance for a vowel.
>Dave: ANNORTU C8 OUTRAN +23 217
#note I took a lot of time on this play and had to scramble for the rest of the game.  This is obviously risky, but I tried to be honest with myself about what I could infer about the opponent's rack, if I hadn't been playing the other side.  It is likely that opponent has not only another S, but also good bingo tiles, meaning that the 8A-D spot is not likely to result in a huge score.  Also, there is a big danger after playing a move like AN C12 that opponent will bingo first and I will be down on a board where bingos won't fit.  This move has three points in its favor: 1) It scores best, keeping the game very close. 2) It turns over six tiles when both blanks are unseen. 3) It makes it likely that I can still get bingos down, even if opponent bingos first or hits 8A-D.
>Koenig: ?CLMNRT 8A CL.T +21 234
#note I wasn't tracking all the tiles, but I did a quick count here to see that there were no T's and only one N remaining.  So CLON is probably a touch better.  Then why didn't I play it?  I couldn't remember for sure if it was good.
>Dave: AAEILLN A8 .ANAILLE +83 300
>Koenig: ?FIIMNR 12H FIRM +17 251
#note Here and on the next turn I almost ran myself out of time looking for bingos.  However, I missed the very pretty nonbingo FILMI B6.
>Dave: ?AEEEIS 11C .A.E +16 316
>Koenig: ?IINOPR 12M .IP +10 261
#note Maybe FINO or FOIN is better, but there is value in keeping the row 15 bingo lane open, as opponent could shut down both the D and G columns at once with a play on row 7.
