#note First move, and already a mistake...Quacky suggests L7 L(Y)NX 29, which 1) I didn't see and 2) I don't completely understand. I see the leave is miles better, and maybe it's because I have a chance at getting ZAX next turn?
>Dave_Weigand: EELPRTY 10E PEYTREL +69 99
#note You're welcome, Dave.
>Jesse_M: FGNNNOX -FGNNX +0 29
#note Pretty much every other simulation sims better, which I don't understand either. I assume here that Dave is highly likely to play something under the P next turn, so what's the point of keeping the X? It's not going to score anything. The exchange it likes best is FGNN, keeping NOX. Is that because I have a long shot at drawing TOXINE or TOXINS?
>Dave_Weigand: IMV 11D VIM +28 127
>Jesse_M: ENOOQRV K4 OVER... +20 49
#note The frustration continues. Quackle likes 6 different exchanges best (OOQV being its favorite), and then my play 7th. I was so frustrated I just wanted to score something and sort of open the board up. I didn't like allOVER, zONER or QuOtE/QuOtER. Should I have just exchanged?
>Dave_Weigand: KST 11J TSK +38 165
>Jesse_M: ?BDENOQ H7 Q.O.ED +18 67
#note Quack likes L1 BOND 26 before my play. What's your call?
>Dave_Weigand: AEIN I5 NAI.E. +23 188
>Jesse_M: ?AABENU L1 BEAN +22 89
#note It likes playing 10M ABA 22. I would never in a hundred years consider playing that. I guess if I have a blank and I'm down a lot it's not totally unreasonable to leave an A hanging like that, but still, I dunno. I like my play...
>Dave_Weigand: CDEOR H1 CREDO +32 220
>Jesse_M: ?ANORSU 2B RANcOU.S +68 157
#note For once I get to play something that sims on top!
>Dave_Weigand: DOOR M1 ORDO +25 245
>Jesse_M: ABNPTTX 5E BAT.. +14 171
#note It should be clear why I did this. It sims 2nd to 1A BAP 27, which scores 13 more, allows for a similar score next turn if I get an E or U, and looks far less obvious. I understand why it's better.

#note I figured at this point, what the heck, it's my only shot...
>Dave_Weigand: DEEFIOT 13L DO +20 349
#note He amazingly doesn't bingo, but infers he is fairly close, based on his playing bowS last turn...
>Jesse_M: ?IORTUX 12E XU +26 301
#note Quackle likes 6I aXe 26 over my play...I disagree. I am scared of drawing that other U (or worse, WU), since Dave is clearly holding onto some really good stuff at this point, which is not likely to include the U or W. Thoughts?
>Dave_Weigand: AEFIMNS O6 FAMINES +96 445
#note It was coming eventually...
>Jesse_M: ?AEIORT 6N O. +7 308
#note To add insult to injury, I draw a rack with SOWPODS-only possibilities. Quackle thinks I should play more than one tile, and I'm certain it's wrong.
