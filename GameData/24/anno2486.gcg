#note This play blocked a lot of my potential moves -- OVERBRED/BROKERED/BORDERED/BORDERER through RE as non-bingo triple-triples and SOBERED/REBORED/BOWERED along the O column forming a bunch of overlaps. Luckily he still left good stuff for me to do.

#note This play was pretty dumb. I was playing scared, trying to close down bingo lanes and empty the bag as fast as possible, but that doesn't really merit burning the blank, especially when there's no reason to shut down the YEPS hook -- I have the last S and blank! (Also, Zyzzyva says there are ZERO bingos possible from the Y given the 15 unseen tiles.) Quackle suggests KABAR 6J, which is brilliant -- scoring 23, cleaning up the rack for a bingo, and opening an S hook for myself to cash in.

>Evans: AEILNRX 13C LINE +26 456
#note Redemption! I make a brilliant setup here -- opening KINA/AX for 58 and leaving myself RAX/ALINE if he blocks it. (LINER is two points better though -- that way AX is an outplay, and AX/ALINER is still good.)

#note Joey here.  I think I had lost interest in tracking, but I should have at least been aware of the X.  LINEN/NOT is best.
