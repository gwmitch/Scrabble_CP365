#note Linda Hoggatt and Jeff Clark played next to us ... Linda's been "cheated on" before, as an intermediate opponent once hid an S between her fingers while putting tiles in the bag. I missed it, but I heard Jeff say "are you (name)-ing me?" and I knew what he meant. He turned to me and said: "It was a U. She's not very bright."
>Jason: ADEGNOX G8 AX +36 36
#note Then Jeff said something like he expected to win by at least 100, to which Linda called him "Mr. Cocky." Said I: "I'm not touching that one." Linda, always quick, said: "He'd appreciate that." Laughs ensued. 
>Brian_Bowman: OT 7G T.O +19 33
>Jason: BDEGNOY 6I BYGONE +26 62
>Brian_Bowman: AII 10G I.IA +17 50
>Jason: DIPQTTZ 11J DITZ +31 93
#note Missed it at K10 for three more.
>Brian_Bowman: EIOOR M9 OO.IER +32 82
#note Have enough vowels, Brian?
>Jason: EEIPQST O4 QIS +35 128
#note Or at 11E, but I think this line's more important to block, esp. with both blanks and three S's out.
>Brian_Bowman: GIW 8M WIG +40 122
#note I remember re-counting this play, and I got 41 too. Hmph.
>Jason: EEEEPPT 13H TEEPE. +9 137
#note Championship player likes PEE(N) at M3 and P(R)EE at 14L, the latter of which seems too ballsy for me.
>Brian_Bowman: ?AAEISV 11A AVIAtES +80 202
#note Only bingo.
>Jason: ?EFHMPR A10 H.MPER +48 185
#note At this point I'm feeling good ... down 18 through six with the case blank. But the wheels are about to come off.
>Brian_Bowman: CORTV D10 C.VORT +24 226
>Jason: ?DFKNNS 13C F.ND +16 201
#note Only play.
>Brian_Bowman: ENORUY 15D .OURNEY +30 256
>Jason: ?AKLNNS K2 KLAN. +20 221
>Jason: ?AKLNNS --  -20 201
#note Confused it with KLONG. Should've just played KA(O)NS/S(WIG), Speedy's pick.
>Brian_Bowman: EF B14 FE +22 278
>Jason: ?AKLNNS L4 KA.N +16 217
#note Not sure why I didn't play KA(O)NS here. It's Championship Player's pick.
>Brian_Bowman: DEE 12L E.DE +18 296
>Jason: ?ADLNSU J3 DUL. +8 225
>Brian_Bowman: EIJLT 3E JILTE. +16 312
>Jason: ?AMNRSS F10 M.N. +26 251
#note The star play here is AM(I)NS at F1. In hindsight, I need to make some play opening two lines. Instead, I open none.
>Brian_Bowman: ACHL O11 L.ACH +30 342
>Jason: ?AGNRSS F2 S. +4 255
#note Fishing for the I; RASpING along row 1 or the three-overlap SIGNoRA along row 4.
>Brian_Bowman: ABIORTU E3 .UBA +26 368
>Jason: ?AGNORS M3 NA +10 265
#note Missed the out bingo again: OSNA(B)uRG. 171 equity points lost in two endgames against Brian. I was beating myself up pretty good after this one, but I didn't play THAT badly; I mean, when the bag emptied I'd lost 75.3 points of equity (about half on KLANG*) and was 88 down. Brian just needs to stop outdrawing me. :) Now 2-6 against him, including dropping the last five.
>Brian_Bowman: IORT 5C OR.IT +7 375
#note And I missed this out on top of it. Another well-played game from Brian.
>Brian_Bowman:  (?GORS) +10 385
