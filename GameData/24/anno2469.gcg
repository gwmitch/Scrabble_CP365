#note I really am frustrated with the strategy element of this game. I never fish at the right time and never go for points at the right time. Apparently, this time a play like C12 LO 9 or even 3L woO is better. I DON'T GET IT =(
>Steve_Glass: EEEILQS -  +0 234
#note On another unexpected note, he challenged AGAIN
>Jesse_M: DLSSTUU 2K L..U +8 213
#note I yet again do not understand. Quackle suggests 13E SULU 16 is the best, and it is completely insane. I thought about the move, but leaving the U there for the Q if he's drawn it? Completely insane. 
>Steve_Glass: EIV C3 VIE +14 248
>Jesse_M: DDOSSTU 6A U.D +12 225
#note Something like G2 DOS 22 or 13E SUDD 19 is far better here, I understand this time. I really have no basis in retrospect on why I played what I did...
>Steve_Glass: I 14A .I +4 252
#note Great, he has the other blank.

>Jesse_M: DIOOSST J4 T.S +28 253
>Steve_Glass: ?CEHINT N4 ETHNICs +72 324
#note Fortunately for me, he misses his 101 point bingo
>Jesse_M: BDIOOST O6 OOT +22 275
>Steve_Glass: AHL A5 H.LA +38 362
>Jesse_M: BDINRSS 2B BIRDS +29 304
#note Why does BINDS sim higher than BIRDS?
>Steve_Glass: EJO 10K JOE. +10 372
>Jesse_M: INORSUW 11K OWN +37 341
#note I see myself having a chance at winning still, if he has just drawn the Q. Even though Quackle sims them both the highest, I can't play 11J WON or NOW, or he gets 12L EXED and is able to outrun me even if he's drawn the Q. Playing 11K OWN looks good to me. How would you play this position?
>Steve_Glass: ADEEFNX 12J FEND +42 414
#note Of course, he doesn't have the Q; overcoming the odds.
>Jesse_M: IQRSU 13M SUQ +34 375
#note 13E SRI 15 is the only thing that blocks his out, and still allows me to go out with my Q next turn. I had 30 seconds left and played this end game badly.
