>Allan_Simon: ?AAENST 8G TAENiAS +64 64
#note Now that's an opening rack
>Matthew_Larocque: AAENNOY M3 ANNOY. +26 26
#note This sims high and playing through the N for 18 is pretty much equal. 7G ANY isn't too shabby.
>Allan_Simon: INNTUUU -INTUUU +0 64
#note He had UN(A)U,  but for only 4 points. Might as well just ditch all 3 back in the bag.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEFSWZ L1 FAZE +55 81
#note I didn't see this right away, but once I did there was no question.
>Allan_Simon: BDEEILN K8 .NEDIBLE +70 134
#note Oh it's going to be one of THESE kinds of games! But a good find by Allan here.
>Matthew_Larocque: AELRSTW 11D WARSTLE. +74 155
#note Sim likes WRASTLE(D) a tiny hair better despite setting up a juicy TLS. I once phonied with WARTLES so I redeemed myself this time.
>Allan_Simon: DIKMRTX 15H MIX.D +51 185
#note MIR(E)X, huh. I knew MUREX but not that. Still, Allan hit me hard again here.
>Matthew_Larocque: EJMOOOU 12A MOUE +28 183
#note MOJO! But that might not be that good because of where the J ends up. I tried for so long to played over the X - O(L)EUM was the one that worked. I didn' know if MOO(L) was in the dictionary.
>Allan_Simon: ABEILRT 14B TRIABLE +84 269
#note Again, highest scoring option. Allan was on fire here - I was just trying to make it close.
>Matthew_Larocque: HJOOSTY J10 Y.H +35 218
#note I guess I should have just ditched the J here, but I wasn't in danger of getting stuck with it or anytthing so grabbed 32 for H+ Y.
>Allan_Simon: DILNPPR N1 PIP +28 297
#note !
>Matthew_Larocque: CJOOOST 15A JO +29 247
>Allan_Simon: DELNNRV 6I VEND.R +14 311
#note Since ZAP is already there, this isn't really that dangerous, it just makes the hook a bit more flexible.
>Matthew_Larocque: CEOOSTU A7 OUTCO.E +33 280
#note argh
>Allan_Simon: CELNOUW 9E CLOWN +23 334
#note Quackle is giving the simple WO 5J as the best, but I didn't realise that CLUNE was a godly bingo leave. I wouldn't want to play short here either lets get the game done with.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKORSU O6 SOUK +35 315
#note I was debating wether to burn my S here or try to get a bingo. His lead wasn't massively out of control yet, so I took 30 points.
>Allan_Simon: FIQU 1H QUIF. +60 394
#note More pain. Funny enough, Eric Tran then plays QUIFFS on me for 82 in a later game. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEGIRT B1 TRIAGED +75 390
#note This was one of a handful of high bingo games for me this tournament. Well, at least 6 is a lot for me, maybe that's merely average for other people. *shrugs*
>Allan_Simon: ?EGIORS 4B .RGOSIEs +68 462
#note Kill shot. What the heck is GORSIER. G(A)SOlIER also gives 4 extra points but that's just icing.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGHITV A1 AAH +31 421
#note A(L)IGHT and it isn't even close. I learned the word LATER in the tournament of course! Anyways good show. This is how I like to lose games.
