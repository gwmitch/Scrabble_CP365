>Tunnicliffe: AACDEEE E10 .EAD +21 209
#note Sim gives the edge to DEED. Because I can't possibly draw anymore A's, right? (-0.8)
>Hildebrand: DEORSTY 6E STOREY.D +72 216
>Tunnicliffe: AACEESV 5B CAVE +22 231
#note C12 ACE is a clever play that never occurred to me. Still, would I have had the guts to do it? I should have had, but I wouldn't have had. (-3.2)
>Hildebrand: IILRRXZ 13C R..IX +42 258
>Tunnicliffe: ?AAEGSU 12H SAUsAGE +76 307
#note Okay, no complaints about getting all nine A's by turn seven. I was able to do quite well with them. Still, it was nice knowing I wouldn't be drawing any more of those suckers.

#note #@$%!
>Tunnicliffe: EEEFKOT M12 .EEK +18 325
#note Now the E's. I ended up getting 9 A's, 9 E's, and 1 I. Weird distribution and definitely in my favour. Anyways, I missed FEOD here, which does look better. (-2.0)
