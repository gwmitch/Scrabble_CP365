#note Game's still mine to win, 'cause, well, look at the crap in the bag.  I should've gone with my first instinct, and just played TWOO(N)IE, drawing to that keeper of an I.  Most tiles win, but I was worried about the case where he has WOG F4.  That made me want to take the spot and play it out.  Big mistake, as good as an endgame player as he is.  Champ says TWOO(N)IE wins 12.5%.  So, I guess there are a lot of tiles I could draw that lose, and only 1 that wins.  Makes me feel a bit better.  My only mistakes in this came were (arguably) YUTZ, BEAU, and MIDGUT.  Very frustrating.  It turns out, that the tile that I did draw would give me the win.  The W that I was so worried about being on his rack was in the bag, and was the only tile I could draw out of 8 to win, by PLAYING WI(N) 2J, which I didn't see.  Aarrghh!
