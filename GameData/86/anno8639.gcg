>Brian: EGP H7 PEG +12 12
>Dave: ?ABIKOS 8A KIlOBAS. +92 92
#note Brian immediately muttered to himself something along the lines of "Look what I gave you... oh you probably had something anyway."  "I did, with the blank as the same letter."
>Brian: DOW 9D DOW +19 31
>Dave: CNOOPU 7F PO. +19 111
#note Pretty sure I held COUPON, but I can't tell what the other tile is because I can't read my handwriting.  I think it might have been a third O, which would mean I had better plays than this, such as BOOCOO.  I wasn't totally happy with this choice, but the board is tight, so I can afford to unwind slowly.
>Brian: QTU B6 QU.T +33 64
>Dave: CNNOOSU 10E ON +20 131
#note Maybe ONUS, but keeping the S angles for the knockout blow.
>Brian: AFLM 11B FLAM +34 98
>Dave: CENOOSU I3 OUNCES +33 164
>Brian: LNXY H1 LYNX +85 183
#note And just like that he's back in it.
>Dave: ADFIOSV 12B AIDS +32 196
#note This is a funny play.  With the Q and one C and one M gone, the front hook isn't so dangerous.  This scores better than any other play, but it seems like I'm managing the rack in reverse, using the letters I want to keep and vice versa.  However, I'm happy to keep tempo on a tight board, and I'm also taking away what is likely to be his best scoring spot.
>Brian: EILR A12 RILE +22 205
>Dave: FOV B14 OF +19 215
#note Forgot to write this rack down, but I think this was a fairly obvious choice.
>Brian: IIIIU -IIIIU +0 205
>Dave: EEGGRUV 2D VUGG. +17 232
>Brian: AC D2 .AC +16 221
>Dave: EEEERRW 5I .EWER +16 248
#note Gives him some nice spots, but no choice with this rack.  In a game this close, I can't afford to play scared.
>Brian: DELTTU M3 TU.TLED +22 243
#note Brian sighed as if he had just missed on something.
>Dave: ABEEERS 8L B.ER +27 275
#note This feels right, despite the unbalanced leave.  There are still a lot of other R's to draw, as well as other good scoring tiles.  It doesn't strike me as right to forgo too many points chasing a bingo here.
>Brian: INV L2 VIN. +20 263
#note He blocked my best spot (for AMU) and probably set up an O.
>Dave: AEEIMNS L8 .EMEAN +23 298
#note Again, I didn't think I could afford to slow play here and possibly fall behind if he hit a big row 1 play.  I'd be glad to bingo, but I don't necessarily need to do so to win.  Other than the large number of I's, this is a nice pool to be dipping into.
>Brian: AEHT K10 HATE +29 292
>Dave: ?AIIRSY 4C I.Y +8 306
#note I figured there was a good chance he would block my RAISINY and BIRYANIS.  Now with the blank and the openings on row 14 and column O, fishing is merited.  Not to mention, I don't have a better option.
>Brian: ENORT 1K TONER +27 319
>Dave: ?AAIRRS 5E AR +14 320
#note Stay calm.  Had a pretty bad luck draw there, but I've still got good timing going into the endgame.  For a moment I thought of doing something ludicrous like AR 14J here, but then I realized there was no need to panic.
>Brian: H C3 H. +20 339
#note This play doesn't look like it gives him any chances, but depending on what he had, he may have already known that his situation was helpless.
>Dave: ?AIORSZ O3 bIZAR.OS +67 387
#note Even if he had blocked my bingo, AZO J1 would likely lead to an easy win.
>Brian: ADEIIJT -  +0 339
#note If you've got any doubts, you've got to challenge here.
>Dave: I 6B .I +11 398
>Dave:  (ADEIIJT) +30 428
