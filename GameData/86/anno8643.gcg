>Jermaine_Harris: MO 9C MO +16 16
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIOORV 10B VIER +29 77
#note I don't know why I didn't see VOE.  Played VIER so as to not give him IVIED.
>Jermaine_Harris: AM F6 MA. +11 27
>Ryan_Fischer: ADELOOU B10 .ODOU +18 95
>Jermaine_Harris: ADT 13A D.AT +10 37

#note 15A ANOLE 28 (or ENOL).
>Jermaine_Harris: AZ E5 ZA +26 63
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFILLS 11D SELF +29 155
#note Thought I missed FAILLES but luckily (?) it didn't go down after all.  I'm just trying to run far away from him.
>Jermaine_Harris: EERSTTU H1 TRUSTEE. +77 140
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEILOR G6 IL.A +20 175
#note More scoring and running.  Okay, though, maybe if I'd play for leave I'd've bingoed back.
>Jermaine_Harris: ?AEILNV 2H .AVELINg +86 226
#note And just like that, he's back in it.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEHOOR 14D OOH +17 192
>Jermaine_Harris: HIT 3K HIT +23 249
>Ryan_Fischer: AEENNRT 15F ANENT +20 212
#note G1 ETNA 23?  ANENT is a similar principle, trying to get the blank and not getting too married to an okay leave.  There are a lot of fishes ahead of this, though.  ANE is okay.  I should've left something with an S hook.
>Jermaine_Harris: ABO 1M BOA +25 274
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEEGRR 3C REARG.E +25 237
#note 4L BERG 34.  There's where I lose the game 'cause he hits me hard here, soon, and my hanging on to the B isn't helping matters.  I can't believe I missed that spot.
>Jermaine_Harris: ILPTU 14J UPLIT +22 296
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BEIIOY A11 YI. +17 254
#note Champ likes OILY best.  I guess it creates 7 lanes and all, and the BEI? leave is a little better.  It took me a while to find YID.
>Jermaine_Harris: DEXY 4L DEXY +52 348
#note Aarrghh.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BCEIOS L8 SOCIaB.E +76 330
#note Wow, 1A CObBIES(T) 92.  Didn't think that was good.  I should have seen EBONICS and CORBEILS.
>Jermaine_Harris: Q 11K Q. +22 370
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFGIPR M8 IF +20 350
#note Champ says 2B GAP 18, setting up RIFE for 32 underneath.  I did this to set up YAGER and block WOW, but couldn't get out faster.  FPG looked pretty ugly to me.
