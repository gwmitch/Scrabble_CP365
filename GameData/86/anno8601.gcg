>Tunnicliffe: ADDFHIO 8D HODAD +28 28
>Hildebrand: ?EIIMNR 7G MINtIER +73 73
#note Looks like H8 (D)IRIMENt is the play.
>Tunnicliffe: EFIOOST J4 FOO.IEST +64 92
>Hildebrand: ?AEGTVY D8 .EAVY +28 101
#note Lots of solid choices here, but none of the top ones keep the G, apparently. K3 GAY 29 and E7 V(O)YAGE 26 sim to the top.
>Tunnicliffe: EILLRRT 11D .IRL +14 106
#note I apparently misjudged between this and 4J (F)LIR. I thought it was better to keep the F, O, E, and R open for bingos, but I have a better chance to bingo with S and T open. (-3.7)
>Hildebrand: ?CGHOTT 5H CH.TT +20 121
#note Again, Quackle doesn't like keeping the G. 5I G(O)TH 16 has a little better odds on bingoing.
>Tunnicliffe: EELPQRT 10C Q.T +14 120
#note I had a tough time deciding between this and 8L LEPT. Covering the hot spot is not a huge deal, with FHHM already out. But Quackle gives the edge to LEPT, hoping for a U, I guess. (-1.8)
>Hildebrand: ?AAGGOR K11 AGGRO +18 139
#note Not a bad idea to open the 3x3 with a blank, but it might be safer to do it with 4L AGOG 20.
>Tunnicliffe: AEELNPR 15H PER.NEAL +149 269
>Hildebrand: ?AEJLMS M2 JAMS +37 176
>Tunnicliffe: AEIINST L5 .I. +3 272
#note Sort of an optimistic fish on a dead board. It's the top equity play, apparently, but C12 AI edges out in win%, probably for opening a nice line.
>Hildebrand: ?DEEILO N2 ODE +33 209
#note Taking the bingo ELOIGNED is probably going to be better. There is definitely some sense behind taking the J spot, though.
>Tunnicliffe: AEINOST O1 ATONIES +94 366
>Hildebrand: ?EILNOP 13H EPI.ONaL +76 285
#note In my defense, I held this for a super long time. I felt like an idiot. I'm glad my first instinct was right, but I wish I could be more sure of myself. (-76.0)
>Tunnicliffe: ABENUVY C12 BEVY +31 397
>Hildebrand: FKRSTWW 15A WR. +27 312
>Tunnicliffe: ABCENRU N10 CAN.B. +30 427
>Tunnicliffe: ABCENRU --  -30 397
#note Fumbled my tiles here. Probably because I was wishing CARNAUBA played before I spotted the solid CABANA play. (-30.0)
>Hildebrand: DFIKSTW N10 FIK.S. +40 352
#note And then this. I literally did everything possible to lose this game. (-40.0)
>Tunnicliffe: ABCENRU B11 CAB +19 416
#note Ostensibly clever for setting up a big CABER play. BUNCO sims better. (-3.3)
>Hildebrand: AADETUW 6E AWA +19 371
>Tunnicliffe: EENORUU M7 .OUE +10 426
#note But of course, I didn't actually see CABER. EVE is the play. (-8.6)
>Hildebrand: DEITUXZ 5B DITZ +50 421
>Tunnicliffe: EGLNRUU C3 RU.NG +16 442
#note GLUIER then NU. (-4.0)
>Hildebrand: ENUX 14C .EX +13 434
>Tunnicliffe: ELU 3A LU.E +4 446
#note Wow, that was brutal.
