>Kenji_Matsumoto: AFIJLRT 8G JILT +22 22
#note Starting with the J at 8g already starts blocking the left side of the board.
>Kamikaze: CCEEISU G8 .UICE +15 15
#note Simply careless.  Leaves too much open, and forms a right angle that will be tough to open later in the game.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ACEEFMR H12 FAME +48 70
#note Nothing fancy needed here.
>Kamikaze: ACDEHSX I13 HEX +39 54
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EHIMNOR J10 HEMIN +33 103
#note While MENORAH does score well and keep a better leave, HEMIN leaves the board more closed and will lead to more mistakes by the kamikaze.
>Kamikaze: ACDIOOS K9 CODA +29 83
#note ODA is better.  He just killed the last good bingo line when behind.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ELORTTY L12 TORY +32 135
#note Scoring is still important, but the kamikaze's chances of playing a bingo will run out soon.
>Kamikaze: BGINOSU 9K .UB +10 93
#note A desperation opening that has frankly no chance of working.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AELLRTU N6 LUTEAL +18 153
#note Equity goes out the window, as the kamikaze is going to be completely without a clue.
>Kamikaze: EGINOST 15L .OGI +24 117
#note He needs to fish and keep the GLUTEAL hook, but just hopes to get lucky.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DIINORZ J6 ZI. +32 185
>Kamikaze: DEINNST O7 NIDE +35 152
#note Not a bad play, as scoring is important here, but the board is nearing its doom.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DINORTV L6 VOD.N +17 202
#note Blocking column n.  Scoring may become important soon, but a 50 point lead is still significant, especially against a kamikaze on this board.
>Kamikaze: EGNOOST 9F O.T +5 157
#note Completely the wrong way to open the board.  Your opponent will block this line for sure, and often bingo themselves.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?AIRRTY E8 TRInARY +72 274
#note Like that.  Note that you still want to keep frustrating the kamikaze.
>Kamikaze: EEGNOSW 13C WO.E +14 171
#note Continuing to try to open bingo lanes in a desperate way.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEIKORW 10B KIW. +21 295
#note Continuing to frustrate the kamikaze.
>Kamikaze: EEGLNPS 12D G.N.. +26 197
#note Hoping to hit a bingo somehow  in columns b, c, or d.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ADEOQRS C7 QAD. +26 321
#note Still more blocking.
>Kamikaze: EEILNPS D6 LIP +27 224
#note Another attempt to try to open the board.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EENORST 5C ESTRONE +70 391
#note Well, I guess I have to leave the kamikaze an open lane now.  However, the game is already won.
>Kamikaze: AAEGNSS C3 AG. +8 232
#note The kamikaze just can't help himself despite the fact that his opponent often has good bingo prospects with this pool.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?AABRSU 4G SUBAReA +77 468
#note Pouring it on
>Kamikaze: AEENOSS 3J AEONS +19 251
#note Even after all that, the kamikaze still fails to bingo.  He curses his tiles and tells himself how unlucky he was that he never hit any of the open lanes and how he had unplayable bingos, even though he never really had much of a chance.
