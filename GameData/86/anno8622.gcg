#note Need the points, even though it's the case S. Q prefers 14B SHEAVE 40
>al_helfgott: NP 4H P.N +8 313
#note Al has no vowels, and decides to take out column H and rows 3-5. After my next play, he bemoans not taking out row 1 with PEN instead.

#note Considered a number of options here, most notably 5C OUTGAIN 20, which Q prefers. With no N's remaining, the G seems harmless here.

>trashman: DEILTUW 8A ILEU. +24 423
#note Almost lost the game here. C9 WIDGET 30 is the star play. The unseen pool is vowel heavy, but the Q is still out there. D3 DILUTE 21 is also far better than my play.
>al_helfgott: CELORTY A3 CRYOL.TE +64 426
#note Ouch! Fortunately, I have enough of a comeback to secure the win, albeit by the slimmest of margins.
