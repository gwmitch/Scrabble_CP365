>Hildebrand: AALRRRU 8D RURAL +12 12
#note Both 12-point placements give up several extensions. They sim about equally, though.
>Tunnicliffe: GHNOOUX 9G GOX +28 28
#note 7D OXO and D8 ROUGH both sim better. Apparently our next turn is on average a full 10 points better with ROUGH (compared to GOX). It makes sens to keep the X and unload the other chaff, I guess. (-1.6)

#note Sort of don't know / didn't see the only bingo BEGORAH. I spent forever looking. These are the positions I really muck up, because by the time I give up on the bingo, I am too frazzled to concentrate on finding the best nonbingo. BARE is lousy. REHAB was the five I couldn't see. And 2L OBA is obviously better. OBA sims best, in fact. (-8.9)

#note ISOGENIC is the play, but nice job spotting the hook I would have missed.
>Tunnicliffe: EEEIMPU E2 P.ME +24 322
#note Kind of a weird position. I find myself with all of the remaining E's, so it's not as ugly as it looks, and all of the top plays are perfectly happy keeping lots of vowels. The top choice is apparently J4 FUME, which I considered, but I preferred the points from POME. (-0.7)
