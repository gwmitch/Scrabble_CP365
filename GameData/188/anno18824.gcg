>Charles_Reinke: AADLNOX H7 LAX +20 20
#note Rafi: I was at an immediate disadvantage here, as we were playing this game on Thomas Reinke's board. Also, coincidentally, Thomas was sitting on the opposite site of the table directly behind me, and could use his newly grown goatee to theoretically signal to Charles whether or not I had a blank on my rack.
>Rafi: ??FINOT 8H .NTIFOam +89 89
#note Rafi: Luckily, I had been aware of the Reinke ploy from the get-go and decided to Suhas the blanks pregame in an effort to foil their evil plan. I also really wanted to play FINFOOT, as some people may recall I won high word one year for FINFOOTS 3x3 against Jeff Fiszbein, who I'm pretty sure isn't a Reinke, but I may be wrong. This is the only bingo to the triple, and just so happens to double the F.
>Charles_Reinke: ADINOOS I6 DA.IO +21 41
>Rafi: CHILNPR J10 HIC +29 118
#note Rafi: After DANIO, I see a huge opportunity to get the board closed in a hurry with HIC. After an overlap of ANTIFOAM + a play from the C, the board is pretty ugly for comebacks. However, this does not excuse missing PINCH, which is probably too much equity to leave on the table. 
>Charles_Reinke: IINOSTU 6I .UI +6 47
#note Charles: I hate fishing like this, but there are no scoring plays other than L8 (F)INITO, which I didn't see.  Drawing an E + almost any other tile seems likely to bingo
>Rafi: KLNOPRY 5K PYLON +28 146
#note Rafi: The K is a fabulously useful tile to save, hence why I thought PYLON > PORKY/PLONK. However, playing HICK could open up an S hook, whick I am not super excited about here. The K is still useful in other ways though, so I'm not obligated to play HICK, and I'm also not obligated to start a word with K, which provides the hardest-to-block lane.
>Charles_Reinke: BILNOST N1 BOLT.NI.S +74 121
#note Rafi: Nice play by Charles! We both noticed that OBLATIONS also fit. This partially foils my closed-board + 100 point lead plans.
>Rafi: KOQRTUW O1 OW +32 178
>Charles_Reinke: AEFHMNW L1 FAWN. +36 157
>Rafi: KNPQRTU 2J QU. +32 210
#note Rafi: With QUA unavailable, I would happily play TRUNK, setting up my Q. On a more open board, where playing through the U is less likely, I would maybe play TRUNK over QUA.
>Charles_Reinke: EEHLMSV M7 H.E +23 180
#note Charles: 7M H(I)M is better (even with the serious E surplus in the bag), but I must have been blind to putting my M on top of the blank M.
>Rafi: ABKNPRT 13J KBAR +33 243
#note Rafi: Not excited about opening up an S hook, but I'm only up 30, and all HICK plays open up a lane of some kind (ending in E, for instance). I also am setting up a nice scoring spot to counter a bingo. Another interesting note: HOE was the first E played!
>Charles_Reinke: ELMRSSV 14G REVS +25 205
#note Charles: 11I S(I)LVER doesn't squander the HICK(S) hook and also doesn't give up so much to Rafi.  To make my play look even worse, it is way too easy for Rafi to kill the board after REVS.  I would consider this to be the game-losing play.
>Rafi: ADENPTT 15D PATED +44 287
#note Rafi: Having REVS come down was a pretty ideal situation.
>Charles_Reinke: DLMRSTU D12 DUM. +18 223
#note Charles: I need some E's!  Where dem E's at?
>Rafi: EJNRRTU L10 JUR. +22 309
#note Rafi: Or JURANT or INJURE, which rids myself of an E with 8 E's unseen.
>Charles_Reinke: ALRSSTZ I1 ZA +24 247
#note Charles: Drawing into LRSST, a two-E draw would give me STREELS.  However, even if I do bingo, a counterplay by Rafi ending in a Z would keep him in the lead.  Quackle is high on N11 LAST, I guess because it thinks I can draw 15L ZEST at some point.
>Rafi: AEGNORT 1E NERT. +42 351
>Charles_Reinke: ILRSSTY 3C LYRISTS +87 334
#note Rafi: My mind was boggled when an E didn't come down...

Charles: That works too.
>Rafi: AAGGNOO 4B GOO +20 371
#note Rafi: ... especially when I didn't draw an E myself!
>Charles_Reinke: ADEEGRV 13A VAG.E +18 352
#note Charles: 5D DEAVE for 25 seems to maximize my bingo chances (no need to keep vowels with 11/17 tiles in the bag being vowels).  It also gets me into a situation where I might be able to overtake Rafi without bingoing, since there are not many scoring spots on the board.  This play introduces a scoring spot, but it's extremely unlikely that I'll get to use it.
>Rafi: AAGIIMN A11 MA.IN +33 404
#note Rafi: I can lose to DECOR(A)TE here. Maybe VIG instead to force Charles to have E's up to his ears? The pool is hilariously over HALF E'S!
>Charles_Reinke: DEEEEIR 3L .I.E +20 372
>Rafi: AEEGIOT E8 GOATE. +17 421
#note Rafi: This was a slap in the Reinkes' face, playing the one word that distinguished then from each other this year.

Charles: People say I have a chubbier face.
>Charles_Reinke: CDEEEER B6 DECREE +19 391
#note Rafi: To remove the Cree from.
>Rafi: EI 8A I.E +15 436
>Rafi:  (E) +2 438
