#note 9C BEWAIL scores 30 and the sim likes it, but I personally think that's asking for trouble if he has something like CLAY, FLAW, etc. in his rack.  This doesn't open the position up too much and leaves me a reasonable AILN.  Quackle can't decide at 1000 iterations whether this or BEWAIL is best; I'd make this play again.
>Jon_Shreve: ACEGR K2 GRACE +21 30
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILNO 8J .OILED +30 73
#note This rack only makes 8's with M, N, P, and T, so no bingoes play.  Q gives slight preference to BOLIDE in the same location since, apparently, BOILED gives up bingoes 1.3% more often than BOLIDE does.  I'm personally more concerned about giving up big plays with non-bingo 7's and/or overlaps, which is BOLIDE's shortcoming IMO.   I'd make this play again; YMMV.
>Jon_Shreve: JO N6 JO. +26 56
>Jim_Burlant: AAGNRRU K8 .URANG +14 87
#note I don't have any great options here; my highest scoring play is barely 18 points, and it was a non-starter for me because I didn't know GUARANA (which plays on row 4).  I saw M8 LANGUR but wasn't sure enough about it to risk it for only 2 more scoreboard points; hence, this, as it clears out the garbage and leaves a workable AR.  The sim confirms LANGUR or 4G GUARANA are best.  However, for this game, this was probably the best play I could have made.
>Jon_Shreve: ?IOORRT O6 OR.O +16 72
#note His rack.  Had I played GUARANA or LANGUR, he had ORaTORIO ready to go at K8.
>Jim_Burlant: ADINRXZ 4J Z.X +38 125
#note Saw this and stopped looking.  This is best - Just shy of 72% to win, but not for long.
>Jon_Shreve: ?EIILRT 9C nITRILE +73 145
#note Best bingo for Jon, and the sim indicates the game is still completely up for grabs:  Jon is winning 50.2%.
>Jim_Burlant: ADINRSS 8A DAIS +22 147
#note This rack only makes 8's with E and O, so no bingoes play.  Statically this play does terribly.  The sim indicates it's a very strong choice, but not quite best.  Better per the sim would have been 3K RANDS 21. From the perspective of rack management, I can understand that; DAIS leaves NRS with 4 N's unseen while RANDS leaves me IRS.  That said, I wanted to defend against something like NEEM or HEAP at 8A and unload one of my S's without giving him an easy target to play to.
>Jon_Shreve: EETV 3K .EVET +25 170
>Jim_Burlant: AENORRS A7 A.ORNERS +60 207
#note This and its anagram (which plays at A5) are my only bingo options.  I chose this because READORNS put the E at 6A, which potentially gave back too many easy plays, and this had no such problems.  Quackle agrees - this is my best bingo, and I'm 63% to win.
>Jon_Shreve: DEEILOT 12D DELETIO. +70 240
>Jim_Burlant: AFHIISS O1 SI.H +33 240
#note A strong choice but not best.  The sim says I should be more worried about his hitting a play at 11E and that  my play should have been 11D IF. IF wins 44.7%; this wins 43.6 and sims 0.8 points down at 1200 iterations.
>Jon_Shreve: APY 11E YAP +32 272
>Jim_Burlant: AAFINOS L12 SOFA +39 279
#note Prior to his play of YAP, I was going to play OAF 11C with the intent of preserving AINS to hopefully draw into a bingo back-hooking OURANG.  Once he took that away, I saw a bunch of lame plays (e.g.:  GANOF 13K) I didn't like...and I finally noticed the S back hook to DELETION.  Once I saw that, this came down. It scores very well and puts the onus on him to defend. This is clearly best and it wins just under 40%.  
>Jon_Shreve: ATW M13 TAW +30 302
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIMNT 14A .TEAMING +76 355
#note And then I fall head-over-tea-kettle into greatness by drawing GEMT to AIN and have places to play it on opposite ends of the board (ENIGMATA also plays at B1).  This is clearly best - 76% to win.
>Jon_Shreve: FM C13 F.M +16 318
>Jim_Burlant: ABEHUVY C7 V..Y +13 368
#note I knew Quackle would want me to play for points with something in the southeast.  However, if I play there he can hit easy 7's on row 6 that could force a very uncomfortable end game if I'm sitting on all these counters.  This kills row 6, forces him to bingo on row 2 (if he can), and if he does hit on row 2, surely it's going to give me a juicy comeback on row 1.  Predictably, Quackle doesn't like this at all and says I should play N14 YA for 34 because it expects him to hit row 6 which would leave me coming back with VU(G)H on row 2.
>Jon_Shreve: DIKNNUU 13H UN +10 328
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEHKU J1 KA +13 381
#note It took a while for me to figure this out before I put this down.  This takes away any easy 8's on row 2 (I saw LENITiN(G) as a possibility) and my attitude was, if he's got something to the K, that's life.  I can't defend against everything, but it'll be a lot easier for him to hit an 8 ending in ING than something to the K.  And if he opts to fish elsewhere, I've got BUC(K) coming back for 36 on the next turn.  While this play does terrible statically, it vaults to the top of the sim almost immediately.  It's best.

>Jim_Burlant: ?BCEHTU 6E CHUB +25 406
#note The blank was the very last tile in the bag.  I had to miss one somewhere.  Any number of plays score a lot better than this at N10 (BETHs, TECHs, etc.).
