>Jim_Burlant: ?DGIJOT F5 DJI. +28 28
#note Believe it or not I held ZINKY - I couldn't remember for the life of me whether this needed a C to be legitimate...then I opted (wisely) to let it go.  Play incorrectly scored as 58.   As for my play - don't ask me how, but I never saw JINGO.  JINGO is definitely best here.  40% to win, and JINGO sims roughly 4 points better.  The consolation:  my next rack was probably going back into the bag no matter what I did on this turn.
>Matt_Graham: EHRT D4 HERT. +34 96
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGOTTT -GOTT +0 28
#note None of my options are particularly good - anything that unloads more than one T requires me to slot the 3x3 for practically no points.  4A GOTH wins the sim, this is the runner up and the difference in the sim between this and GOTH is more or less splitting hairs.  29% to win.
>Matt_Graham: NOW E3 WON +25 121
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEOORT 3E .ATERlOO +62 90
#note Spent a long time on this turn trying to find the better bingo that wasn't there.  This is the only bingo.  That said, bingoing isn't best - C3 OOT scores 17 and doesn't play with fire if he's got one of those 4 unseen S's.  27.5% to win.  This is the sim runner up, and it sims 2 points behind OOT.
>Matt_Graham: DFFU 4L DUFF +36 157
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLNOV O4 .LAVONE +39 129
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Saw two plays here:  this and FLAGON keeping EV.  FLAGON only scored 27, this scored 39.  Couldn't think of FOVEAL, which scores 36, keeps the N to go with the G, and doesn't play with fire at N6 and N10.  I was reluctant to put this down due to concern about N10 plays (WEARY, YOWIE, etc.) but figured that for 39 points it was a risk worth taking given my deficit.  FOVEAL definitely looks best here.
>Matt_Graham: ADEEGRS 10H DEGREAS. +66 223
#note Well, at least he didn't hit me with a play at 10N  <<groan>>.  Fortunately for me he missed his best play:  DRAGEES scores 82 at 11I.  But, what does he do with this if I put down FOVEAL on the last turn?
>Jim_Burlant: AAGLNTW H1 AN.W +33 162
#note   Not at all thrilled with keeping the N-less G, but 8 points seemed like an awful lot to give up to get rid of it given my deficit and all my other options .  4 plays (of which this is one) stand out at the top of the sim:  this, C3 AWL, C4 TWA, and C1 GNAW.  AWL gets the marginal nod in the sim (0.5 points and 0.24% higher win percentage) over this.  10.3% to win.
>Matt_Graham: ANQU L8 QU.AN +48 271
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: AGILMPT 2L GIMP +23 185
#note Board vision failure.  These same letters score 33 at C2; I hit that spot in a few turns.  Nonetheless, this is looking bleak;  the C2 placement wins 6-1/2%; this wins 4.5.
>Matt_Graham: ITV M7 VIT. +26 297
>Jim_Burlant: AACDILT K9 C.AAL +25 210
#note Best is a word I didn't know:  DIDACT scores 36 at H10. DIDACT treads water at 4%; this wins 2.4.  The fat lady isn't singing yet, but she's getting warmed up.
>Matt_Graham: ABE 2F BA.E +26 323
>Jim_Burlant: DEIIORT 11B DIORITE +69 279
#note Only bingo - up from 2% to 11% winning chances.
>Matt_Graham: LOX 10D LOX +55 378
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: EGIMOPS C2 GIMP +33 312
#note As this came down:  "I assure you, this is not an instant replay."  :-)  Better late than never.   This or H10 DEMIES/DEMISE is best.
>Matt_Graham: BES 12D BES +33 411
>Jim_Burlant: ELOOSTU 14H OUTSOLE +76 388
#note Only bingo, and this game isn't over.   The sim says I'm 21% to win, and this is now close enough again that there's plenty to fight for: there are two bingo  lines, the pool is good, and if he plays for 27 - 30 on row 15 and I draw the blank, who knows what could happen?   
>Matt_Graham: ?EHRSUY 15C HURlEYS +106 517
#note Then again, he could bingo for 106 with a word I'm not entirely sure of.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIINT -  +0 388
#note I was set to bingo with CTENIDIA for 69 when he threw the monkey wrench in the works with his bingo.  I was pretty sure this was good, but there was no way to win the game if it stuck, so I challenged.  It's good.  Nice play by Matt.
