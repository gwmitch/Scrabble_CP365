#note An annoying rack, as it looks like it should have a 7 but doesn't.  I briefly considered plays burning the blank (e.g.:  JoUAL, ,etc.) but realized that they didn't score enough (JAUpED/JAUkED only score 42) to justify it when this play left me a juicy ADL? and scored 20.

#note If there is a teaching point to be taken from this game, this position is it.  Look at the situation:  nothing scores, I have nowhere to dink off tiles to give myself the best possible leave, I have the blank.  If he doesn't have an O, he can't do anything on row 6.  Even if he does have a bingo without an O, anything he puts down is almost certain to slot a 3x3 while I'm sitting on a groomed blank rack.  There is absolutely no reason for me to do anything but exchange either DGT or DGL.  So why this? The cartoon devil got over my shoulder and told me to have some guts, that I had the blank, and with all the I's and N's unseen, GLT? would bingo on the next turn and that I'd have to open up to do it.  The only thing that is impressive about this is how horrendous the play is. 
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AEQRRSU K3 SQUARER +87 102
#note What does he do with this if I exchanged like I should have?  But, if you think this is bad, wait until you see what follows:
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGLOTZ 6J Z.G +33 66
#note Despite the 6-unique-tiles-plus-blank appearance of the rack, there are no bingoes.  Believe me, I tried to find one.  This or GLOZED is best.  For reference, burning the blank with Za for 66 wins almost 3% less often and sims a few points down on this
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: BEISU 4H BIS.UE +40 142
>Jim_Burlant: ?EFLOOT 5C FOOTLEd +73 139
#note FOOTLEs scores 75 on row 12 and wins 1% more often. The only consolation:  for this game, it didn't really matter, as my turn two recklessness has turned this into a bloodbath.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AIKMT 3I KI.MAT +55 197
#note Nice play!
>Jim_Burlant: CCIILNR D4 C.LIC +24 163
#note No real standout plays here - from the standpoint of board position, CLINIC L9 scores 4 more but does a better job keeping things alive than this does and doesn't give back 8A counter-play.  I was expecting him to play something at 8A that  would open up.  Getting bleaker by the turn no matter how you look at it, though:  CLINIC wins 25%; this wins roughly 23 and sims 5 points down.  Consolation:  I benefit from this, and it wouldn't have stopped his next play.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ?AALRST O3 STRAtAL +84 281
#note Any number of bingoes that score 84:  ASTyLAR, gASTRAL, AuSTRAL, etc.   He's winning 95%.
>Jim_Burlant: GINPRTY 8A PRI.Y +36 199
#note Darn - was hoping he'd play something like HANCE and I'd be able to bingo back with PARTYING.  Instead, I have this.  Oh well.  
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: FO N5 OF +28 309
>Jim_Burlant: AEGNNNT C8 .NNAGE +16 215
#note Couldn't think of REGNANT, which plays as a non-bingo 7 at B8.  Given that my second turn made a mess of this game, and given his run, I'm pretty much in damage control mode and not too  concerned about rack building at this point.  Best if the duck is to be believed is H4 BEN.  Really?
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: BDOOY 12C .OODBY +34 343
>Jim_Burlant: EENTTWX N8 NEXT +31 246
#note Ok, this is a pretty bad miss.  The consolation:  the play I should have found, EXTENT N9, scores 60.  That said, it would have been way too little, way too late.  EXTENT barely wins 2.2%.  This?  0.66%.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: HIOO 11J .HOO.I +20 363
>Jim_Burlant: AEENNWW 12K AWN +29 275
#note At this point my prevailing sentiment was damage control.  No more bingo lines, just take points.  Anything is pretty much as good as anything here if it unloads the W and one of my N's. 
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: DEE 13K DEE +27 390
>Jim_Burlant: EEINTVW 11E WE +23 298
#note Just trying to score points and not open up so he can hit another bingo at this piont.   Trying to keep the spread within reason.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: IIL A8 .ILI +6 396
>Jim_Burlant: AEEINTV 14E NAIVETE +72 370
#note At least I get to save face, though the pool has me a bit nervous about his coming back for 90+ as an out bingo.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AEGHIRT O11 .THER +27 423
>Jim_Burlant: NOPRSU F2 PUN.O +15 385
#note Right idea, wrong execution.   I was correct to block his out play, but if Championship Player is to be believed, PURS 2F loses by 32 instead of 44.  Spread in a blown game.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AGI M8 AG +14 437
>Jim_Burlant: RS J9 ...S +13 398
#note This gets 5 more pionts at  L14.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: I 10A .I. +5 442
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom:  (R) +2 444
#note  If I exchanged as I should have on turn 2, I probably would have kept ADT? on the exchange; as a teaching point,  Quackle indicated ADL? would have been slightly better. Anyway, if I do that, he's sitting on SQUARER and probably exchanges the duplicated R since his bingo doesn't go anywhere.  My EOZ draw would have yielded a ZONATED bingo for 79, and he would have been trailing by 84 pionts sitting on AEQRSU plus an unknown 7th tile.  Maybe he bingoes back, or more probably he has to dump his rack for 34 - 36 points and he's still trailing by roughly 50 points before my comeback.  While there's no guarantee he doesn't go on an insane scoring spree like he did against me, it was pretty obvious at the time that my second play cost me any chance I might have had at this game. from that point forward there wasn't a whole lot I could do, but I never should have given him the chance in the first place.  This loss was on me.
