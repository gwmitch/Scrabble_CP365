>Meilssa: ACEMO 8D CAMEO +24 24
>Matt: ?ALSTTZ G7 L.Z +23 23
#note Perhaps with an S and blank already in hand I should play ZEL#.  I figured I should start making the board ugly since I should bingo very soon.
>Meilssa: IIIUU -IIIUU +0 24
>Matt: ?APSTTT E8 .TTAP +14 37
>Meilssa: BGU D11 BUG +24 48
>Matt: ?CEISST 11D ..SIlECTS +74 111
#note Focused on the 9 and didn't see that I could 3x2 the C.  3 bingoes score 85.
>Meilssa: AEGINSV K8 VIN.AGES +62 110
#note ENVISAGE fits nicely.
>Matt: DEFIORU 15G FOUR. +24 135
#note I knew I was missing something here at the time.  I've seen the alphagram before and I always miss it, thinking it's FOURDIE*.  I have to take out the S though.  
>Meilssa: ATW C12 TAW +23 133
>Matt: DEGIIKR 14F KID +26 161
#note Can't do anything about row 15, so this is fine.
>Meilssa: ILW I9 LW.I +8 141
>Matt: EEGINRX 8K .EXER +48 209
>Meilssa: ?ENPRRT N7 R.PENTeR +72 213
>Meilssa: AJ (challenge) +5 218
#note Challenged because it seemed like I could afford it here, and she seemed unsure of it herself.  
>Matt: EGIMNOR 7L MO.E +23 232
#note Going for a closed board here.  Maybe just MO(R).  
>Meilssa: AJ F6 JA. +30 248
>Matt: EEGINOR D1 EROGENI. +74 306
#note And I blow the board wide open, but I gotta take the bingo at this point of the game.
>Meilssa: DDIV 1A DIV.D +30 278
>Matt: AEFINOU 15A UNAI +22 328
#note Can't leave that hook alone.  FOU B13 sims well, but gives up Q(U)A plays for 40+.  I have FOE left in column E to shut those lanes down next turn.
>Meilssa: NOY B13 YO. +29 307
>Matt: AEEFIOQ E3 FOE +24 352
#note I'm pretty sure that QIN# will be available next turn, I'll kill these lines first.
>Meilssa: LTY 3C L..TY +30 337
#note Nice play to score and fork the board.
>Matt: AAEHINQ 6B QI. +32 384
#note I can't do much about rows 2 and 4; a bingo here and I'm sunk.
>Meilssa: BEILOSU O1 BLOUSI.. +33 370
#note With 4 tiles unseen, it's hard to come up with a good fish.  Champ Player suggests fishing off OU (MEOUS scores 11). However, I have ETA F2 ready to block those lanes next turn.  This goes for outscoring me, but I'm likely to have 1 H, and should be able to outrun.
