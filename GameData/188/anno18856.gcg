>Matt: AHILORT 8H OH +10 10
#note Wish I had this rack to go second.  Decided to play this short, but I do like LIROTH as a long play.
>Philip: BDEGY 9F GYBED +27 27
>Matt: AHILRTU 8A THULIA +33 43
>Philip: EOW 10H OWE +27 54
>Matt: EEGIKOR 10B KIORE +27 70
#note Ugly rack that I struggled with for several minutes, and then the light went on and this play popped out at me.  
>Philip: ANW 7I WAN +27 81
#note 4 out of 6 plays have scored 27 so far. 
>Matt: EEFGNNO L4 GONEF +33 103
#note Just happy for a good place for GONEF.
>Philip: ALX 8L .LAX +42 123
>Matt: ?EIMNPS 11A MISPENs +91 194
>Matt: AIINRRY (challenge) +5 199
#note He insta-challenged this, which made me a little nervous, but I was pretty confident this was good.  
>Philip: CEEINST 5E SEICENT. +90 213
#note ENTICES scores 94 with 4 underlaps.
>Matt: AIINRRY H1 RIAN.Y +36 235
#note Very happy to find this play.  MARRY was such an ugly leave, MIRIN wasn't much better.  RIANCY# scores best and ditches the duplicates plus the Y.  
>Philip: BMORSTU N7 T.MBOURS +86 299
>Matt: EIILQRT 4D QI +24 259
#note No reason to give him Q overlaps for one more point.  
>Philip: ADDI A11 .ADID +30 329
>Matt: ?CEILRT 15A .IRECTLy +83 342
#note TRICkLET# scores 3 more.  
>Philip: AGOTV 6B GAVOT +22 351
>Matt: ADEEFRU 13A .EFRAUD +28 370
#note With the game as close as it is, I want to dig for the Z or J for scoring in the pre-endgame.  He could bingo, but more likely he has one of the Z or J as well.  
>Philip: OPU O10 OUP +21 372
>Matt: AEELNOZ 14J ZONE. +34 404
#note As long as the J is not in the bag, this play wins (7/8).  Otherwise he has VAIRIEST# to go out.  ZONER is the only play that wins 100%.  
>Philip: AEIJRSV G3 JA. +37 409
#note This or JAVAS
>Matt: AELT O4 LATE. +15 419
#note I feel like I played this pretty well.  Had to come up with some good Collins-only content to stay within striking distance until DIRECTLy.  Didn't play the endgame perfectly.  
>Matt:  (RVIES) +16 435
