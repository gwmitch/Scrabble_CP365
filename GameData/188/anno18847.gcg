#note Phony spelling of ARBOREAL that I was pretty lucky to get away with.

#note Played too quickly, NAMED is clearly better here.

>Phil: DFINNTV E3 DIF +26 208
#note Obviously the leave sucks but this is my best scoring play and keeps the board somewhat inert

#note VENT/CENT f2 are tempting but too rich for my blood

#note CONSPUED#.... sigh. And if you're going to miss, 7h COOPT is probably a better way to do it.

#note Quackle thinks m1 CITESS# makes me a coin flip to win and I sure wish I knew it. VUGG isn't the kind of play that immediately implies a blank rack so I have no problem being aggressive and stabbing at the bag.

#note While I did underestimate the dangers on the bottom row, I just couldn't see a way to score enough points down there to justify blocking. CETE/CITE are only 12 and take away tiles that I need to score off that V and/or get out quickly, but will most likely save me the most spread in this lost cause.
