#note Or INVERTS 8B.  I probably should have played INVERTS 8B because that doesn't have vowel placement issues, even if the difference in the sim is virtually nil.
>Max_Panitch: IU I8 .UI +4 4
>Jim_Burlant: EENSTTX 11C EXTENTS +82 160
#note Luck box!  This was a bit rushed on my end and, even though this is my highest scoring play and Quackle thinks it's best, some of me wonders if I should have taken the 2x2 out with EXISTENT K6 for 2 fewer points.
>Max_Panitch: ?ADILRR M7 D.RAILeR +72 76
>Max_Panitch: ?ADILRR --  -72 4
>Jim_Burlant: AAELNOY 10E AY +28 188
#note Given that he's got legitimate bingoes all over the place, there's no point in blocking anything and I should just max my points out.  AYE scores 3 more but I felt that wasn't enough extra score to justify burning the E.  Any of my top 7 options (of which this is one) win between 96.1 and 96.7% when simmed against his rack of ADILRR?.  This concede roughly 1 equity point to the sim winner.  I can understand why AYE would have been a smidgen better.  But can someone explain why ANOA 10B 19 wins more than anything else?
>Max_Panitch: ?ADILRR M2 DARkLI.R +70 74
#note Interesting - Quackle says he should bypass the bingoes in favor of 12A LARI.  Counterintuitive for him to pass up 70 (I know it wouldn't have occurred to me with this rack), but it does make sense:  given that he trails by more than 110 after this comes down, his only shot of getting back into the game is to hit a 3x3.
>Jim_Burlant: AAELNOR H11 .OLAR +18 206
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  H10 ATONAL scores 5 more and leaves ER.  And with only 2 R's unseen, I need to treat my R like an endangered species.  Regardless, I'm still in great shape.  As long as I can keep the tiles turning and empty the bag, this game should be mine.   93.9% to win, but this is a huge dog (almost 10  points) in the sim.  ATONAL wins 95.5%.
>Max_Panitch: IOWW 2K WI.OW +24 98
>Jim_Burlant: AAEFLNN 13B FLANNE. +22 228
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  These same tiles play at 13G for 30 points and defend almost as well.  I was too preoccupied with making sure he didn't get some cheap points with something like FIE 12C.
>Max_Panitch: EEMNRST K7 M.SENTER +70 168
#note What does he do with this if I play at 13G on he previous turn?  He's still way in the hole; this brings him up to 10-1/2% winning chances.
>Jim_Burlant: AADGLOR O1 A.OL +24 252
#note Couldn't think of the 1H plays I needed to find:  ARGOL or GORAL.  This puts points on the board but I need to defend row 1.
>Max_Panitch: AEPTZ 4H PATZE. +40 208
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGIOR 5I GOA +35 287
#note Clearly best.  REDIA 5G scores 43, but burns the case R and leaves an uninspiring GO.  This leaves DEIR and gives me what little chance I might have of drawing into a bingo given this pool which isn't overly bingo prone.  89% to win.
>Max_Panitch: ABEM 1H BEMA +29 237
>Jim_Burlant: DEEHIOR L10 HEIR +27 314
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Couldn't think of HEIRED.  Q also likes L8 VIDEO for 30.

>Max_Panitch: CP 3L C.P. +17 271
>Jim_Burlant: EFHINTU O11 THIEF +47 393
#note Was ruing having had to play off the R a couple of turns ago, as FJORD would have been nice.  Nonetheless - once I got this down, I knew I could relax, as there was (at best) one bingo left in this pool, and anything he would be able to hit wouldn't be enough.

#note Fortunately, between my hot early drawing and his early mistake, it gave me the margin to withstand some rather shaky play on my end.
