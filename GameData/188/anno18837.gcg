>Jim_Burlant: EILMORX 8H REMIX +44 44
#note Couldn't think of this word's anagram, MIREX, until after I'd hit the clock.  MIREX is best, this is next best.
>Jason_Keller: HOW 7K HOW +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: ABLLORZ 6J LABOR +34 78
#note And, after a couple of minutes, I find it.  This is best.  L3 BOLLOX is also a strong choice.
>Jason_Keller: AGNQTTY -AGNQTT +0 27
#note He kept an R.  I don't recall his exact rack, but it sounded pretty ghastly when he told me what it was post-mortem.
>Jim_Burlant: AAIJLNZ I7 J.ZAIL +40 118
#note At this point I thought that, for sure, I was en route to totally bagging him.  I cashed the X for huge points on the open, my collection of clunk scored very well on turn 2, and now this for 40 on turn 3 while he was sitting on a random rack.  I haven't missed yet and I'm 80% to win in a short sim.
>Jason_Keller: ?AACIRR 12F RAI.CARs +70 97
#note Nice find!  The only other bingo in this rack is SACRARIA (multiple placements), but this is his best play.  He's winning just shy of 30% in a short sim.
>Jim_Burlant: AAENSTU L4 UN... +28 146
#note  The only 8's in this rack are NAUSEANT, NAUSEATE (saw them both) and MANTEAUS (didn't recognize it), and they don't play.  I considered SAU M12  and this. SAU's problem is obvious:  it only scores 4 points and opens up row 15 for huge plays with those two L's that aren't in my rack.  I don't like keeping duplicated A's, but there are only 3 left.  Q says I should have just fished off the A with J8 MA, which wins 72-1/4%.  This wins 70.5 and is the runner up, a little more than 3 points down.
>Jason_Keller: GMOS O6 SMOG +29 126
>Jim_Burlant: AAADEST 11K AA +10 156
#note I saw ADEST and figured a fish was in order with all the unseen I's and N's.  The sim says MAD J8 wins by the slimmest of margins.  That wins 70.64%; this wins 70.3 and sims not quite a point down at over 1200 iterations.  What followed was typical of the streak I'd been on for most of the previous month.
>Jason_Keller: AFKL 11D FLAK +30 156
>Jim_Burlant: ADESTTT 13C TASTED +30 186
#note FAIL.  I was right to not hold the rack together, but the execution was wrong.  How do I miss TETS 13F if I see this?  
>Jason_Keller: ?ELNNST D11 .L.N +14 170
#note Actual rack.  I blocked LINNETS.
>Jim_Burlant: CENOTVY F11 ...Y +15 201
#note He took a very long time on his FLAN play and I figured he was close to something.  I thought that if his bingo didn't begin in S or hook a P he wasn't bingoing anywhere so, after considering 13L plays like COVE or CONY, I changed gears and made blocking row 15 my priority.  Play incorrectly scored as 14.
>Jason_Keller: ?ENOPST G7 OP +22 192
#note Actual rack.  He missed STEPSON or PENTOSE.
>Jim_Burlant: CEENOTV 9C COVET +20 221
#note Played this to somewhat limit his bingo options. If  I play on row 13 per the duck (COVE, etc.) he has a very easy line to hit on row 6. This limits him to row 5 (must end in E or A), and to bingoes starting in S on row 14. And the C column is there, but it's not the easiest line.
>Jason_Keller: ?ENOSTU 14H SNOUTEd +70 262
#note Interesting sim result:  row 5 bingos, which only score 6 fewer points than this, sim well down the list.  The best of the row 5 lot are SUBTONE and CONTUSE, which win 3% less often than this does at a loss of roughly 5 equity.  This is Jason's best bingo per the duck.
>Jim_Burlant: GIINOPR 15K PIROG +37 258
#note Best, but still in the hole - 34% to win.
>Jason_Keller: EERSTTW F1 WETTERS +66 328
#note Oh well, so much for this game.
>Jim_Burlant: BEINNQU 3B QUIN.E +32 290
#note If Q is to believed I should take out row 1 and hold the Q.  REgardless, this is bleak - WEB wins 7% and this wins 4.

#note Jason's comment after the game was over:  "Well, I sure drew my way out of this one."   Seemed like a reasonable assessment at the time, but in light of the mistake I made on my TASTED play, I have to wonder.  Was this game winnable if I play TETS for 43 instead of TASTED for 30?  Or does he wind up hitting something like cONTUSE on row 5 even if SNOUTED isn't available?  We'll never know.  Outside of TASTED, I'm happy with how I played the rest of this one; there was some coulda/woulda/shoulda with no major blunders.  But TASTED may ahve done me in.  Or maybe not.
