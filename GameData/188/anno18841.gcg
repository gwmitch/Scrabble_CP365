#note How often do you make the correct play on your first turn and have 28 points of tiles in your second rack?  :-)  Brain overload from the counter overload left me puzzled.  Best is apparently to just fish off the G with ZAG G8.  This isn't bad, though.  ZAG wins 50.6%; ZAX wins 50.3 and sims 0.6 points down ona ZAG, and this is the silver medalist, at 49.5% trailing ZAX by not quite 2 points.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IMP I8 .IMP +18 40
>Jim_Burlant: DDJLOPX 6D DOX. +31 76
#note Not much else to choose from, as it's this or POXY in the same location.  Both of these plays set me up to score huge points with the J if I draw an A or O  on my next turn, but POXY gives back the juicy E front hook.  Between unloading the duplicated D and not giving back the easy front hook, DOXY was the choice.  What I can't understand is why, despite the defensive shortcomings of POXY, it's not even a 2-point dog in the sim.  I'd have figured that POXY would be 4 or 5 points weaker just due to the defensive liabilities of the play.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?BBIORV -?BBVI +0 40
>Jim_Burlant: DIJKLNP E4 PL.NK +22 98
#note Not sure what I was thinking here.  5B DJIN scores 31 and doesn't give back easy 8A plays.    If I didn't want to open bingo lines, E5 KOJI would have been reasonable, but not great.  Don't know how I missed DJIN.  (-9.9)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?AEIORR D1 AERO +18 58
#note His rack - he told me post-mortem that he chickened out on AIRPOWER on row 11.  This set the game in motion for me, as you'll soon see.  This is his best non-bingo option, and it makes good sense - he's got the blank, he's trailing, and maybe I can't do much with the opening he's just created?
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADDIJY 2A JAD.D +28 126
#note Any number of strong plays available here.  J10 YID scores 34 but doesn't defend.  With my lead, defending the 3x3 was the priority.  A sim says I give up a sliver of equity but the decision to add resistance to row 1 is correct.  It says JADE is best winning 85.95%; this is second best, winning 85.68% at a valuation loss of 0.8 points).  YID?  It has the highest valuation of all the choices, but wins 0.3% less often than my choice.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?EIRW 11G WI.ER +20 78
>Jim_Burlant: ?FIORTY 12C InTROFY +109 235
#note Was going to play fORTIFY 12C before WIPER blocked it.  Ah, well, I'm certainly not complaining. :-)  This is my only bingo and it's around 97% to win in a short sim.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?AIILNT C8 INIT.ALs +66 144
#note Only bingo for Jeff.
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEGOS A1 A.EE +36 271
#note While the J isn't a huge bingo threat, this still does take away something like EJECTION, and it scores 36 points.  I didn't look past this.  Q says B9 OBE is also strong and it takes the sim about 600 - 700 iterations before it starts sorting itself out.  This is best, and OBE is a strong runner up.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EW C2 .EW +26 170
>Jim_Burlant: BGLOSTU B8 TUB +25 296
#note Couldn't think of SUBLOT and didn't like GUSTO 15A for reasons that make no sense to me now.   If you miss SUBLOT and other 15A/15C plays, this or B7 GLOB are all that's left.  The sim says this doesn't concede much in terms of either win percentage or valuation, but that's bogus - I definitely needed to do something to take out row 15 here.  GUSTO 15A or even BUST 15A would be fine.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EMUV 14A VE.UM +20 190
#note Tough spot for Jeff.  His tiles don't leave him much choice but to play here, and this defends the board for me.
>Jim_Burlant: EGHLOSV A12 HO.E +42 338
#note Find a good play, look for a better one.  This was auto-pilot.  And while the 3x3 has been taken out, I need to take out bingo lines.  SHOVEL scores 58 at 15C and kills row 15 bingoes.  While it's never bad to score "only" 42 points, it sucks when you realize I should have found the 58-point play.  Shameful.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: HO 10I .HO +31 221
>Jim_Burlant: EFGLRST 15E ELF +10 348
#note Q says I shouldn't worry about defending.  I didn't see LEFTS J4 and just wanted to shut down row 15.  This concedes equity, but given the situation I'm okay with this.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ET 12K ET +7 228
>Jim_Burlant: BGILRST 9K GLIB +13 361
#note Now I'm just trying to add resistance to the hooks he's opening up.  Statically this does poorly but this is best.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ENOV 13L OVEN +16 244
>Jim_Burlant: ARRSSST J4 STARS +21 382
#note Jeff:  "An embarrassment of riches."   Yeah, it certainly was.  This was getting ridiculous.

>Jeff_Fiszbein: E 5E .E. +13 292
>Jim_Burlant: AINNRRS N9 .ARR.N +20 415
#note STIRK 8A looks  a lot better to prevent this:
>Jeff_Fiszbein: CENOSUU 8A S..C. +42 334
>Jim_Burlant: INS 4C ...S +19 434
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ENOUU 13F EN +12 346
>Jim_Burlant: IN K5 IN +10 444
>Jim_Burlant:  (OUU) +6 450
#note Sometimes the game comes a hair too easily.  Turns 8 and 9, I definitely fell asleep at the switch.  While HOVE on turn 9 was an easy auto-pilot mistake to make, turn 8 especially could not be justified.  A cheap defensive play for 18 would have been better than what I did.
