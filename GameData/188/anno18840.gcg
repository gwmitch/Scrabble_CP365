#note I chose to exchange because I couldn't wrap my arms around playing for 11 points with ROUE at 7D or 9D and giving back all sorts of easy poinits.  The sim says exchaning isn't necessary in the strictest sense but it's not unreasonable.  Best is apparenly G8 FOU.  I sort of see that...but with 9 E's unseen the wrong draw could leave me terribly vowel overloaded.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AY 7H AY +20 32
#note Round 7.  After spending the better part of the last three games more or less watching my opponents play, the strain was showing.  Between that and my having to wait a while for this one to start, let's just say I wasn't at my best.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIRSTU G8 .EU +7 7
#note Ok, so that's how it's going to be:  exchange a U, and out of a bag of 81 tiles, draw another U right back.  Wasn't happy with this choice but the U had to go and I didn't want to exchange on a second straight turn.  Best according to the duck is 9I AI.  The other star choice is to exchange IU.  This did work out.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ABORST H10 TABORS +35 67
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIRST 15H .ATIRISE +77 84
#note Best bingo - just shy of 49% to win in a short sim.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DPU F10 PUD +23 90
>Jim_Burlant: BCEKSTT 13G B.CK +18 102
#note Best here would have been a word I didn't know, OBTECT, which plays  at 13H for 26.  If you don't know OBTECT, this is your best remaining option.  51% to win.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: GIOV L11 VIGO. +18 108
>Jim_Burlant: DENPSTT E11 NETT +15 117
#note Weak.  Couldn't find 14K plays like TOTED or TOPED.  Both are much better than this nonsense.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DNUY 15B UNDY +18 126
>Jim_Burlant: DGIJNPS J10 JIN. +31 148
#note Row 6 plays like DJIN opened up a little too much for my liking.  This scored 31 and gave nothing back. Now that only 3 N's are unseen and I have an S, I proabably needed to turn more of the rack with 6I DJIN.  Just shy of 49% to win.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AE 14E .EA. +10 136
>Jim_Burlant: DGIILPS 6I PIG +16 164
#note Saw 12A plays and passed on them because I didn't want to give him the A column.  Also, PIDGIN gives back easy lines that this doesn't.  Nothing really scores well here, and if he doesn't have an S or blank, he can't do much with this.  60% to win.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DOU K8 UDO +13 149
>Jim_Burlant: DILRRSX 14L .XID +40 204
#note While my 5th and 6th plays left something to be desired, this is absolutely the right play.  This scores 40 points, kills the N column and adds a lot of resistance to the O column, as he's now restricted to 9's ending in DE and his only other lines are the B, C, and D columns.  The leave is crappy but the pool is a tiny bit vowel heavy (19 vowels, 22 consonants) so I've got a reasonable chance of drawing an A, E, or even an O, and should be able to grind through this.  In the driver's seat, and I'm just shy of 70% to win.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AEL 5K ALE +12 161
>Jim_Burlant: LRRRSTZ -LRRRT +0 204
#note You're kidding me - not only did I land ZERO vowels from that pool (probability of drawing a vowel was over 80%), but I had no choice but to keep duplicated R's on the previous turn and I draw only one of two remaining R's and a Z.  While I'm obviously not playing well, if you needed a tell-tale sign of how I'd been drawing for the better part of the last month, this was it.  Anyway, this is an obvious exchange situation.  If he hadn't opened the line with ALE, ZED on row 12 would have been my play, it would have killed everything and I'd have then been able to worry about the rack on the next turn.  Instead,with two lines open, he's been dumping A's and E's, and I have to assume he's close to something.  I opted to throw the R back in because I was less worried about building a rack; I wanted to cash the Z (an A gives me 50 on the next turn) and hold the S and I wanted as many cracks as I could get at one of those blanks.  Q says that I should have exchanged 4 and kept RSZ.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EH 4K HE +21 182
>Jim_Burlant: AANOOSZ D12 ZA +50 254
#note It's either this or 12A ZOONED.  ZOONED opened too much up IMO while this scored 50 and took away the C and D columns.  Q prefers ZOONED by quite a bit.  Still in the driver's seat at 80% to win.  ZOONED wins 85.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IM 14B MI +18 200
>Jim_Burlant: ANOOORS L7 ONO +10 264
#note OOZED 12B would have been much better, as it would have left a reasonable ANORS, and it would have prevented 7's ending in A down the A column.  A sim confirms this is my second best choice, but really - OOZED should have been a no brainer.   This is moronic.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?AEINRS 3E REtAINS +65 265
#note And, thankfully for me, he follows up my mistake with an even bigger one.  He missed REtSINA or SERINgA down the A column for 76.  This was crucial to how the game turned out.
>Jim_Burlant: AOORSTW 2B STROW +47 311
#note Q just wants me to play of OW and keep more of the rack together.  I was more concerned about matching his tempo since he'd just turned 7 tiles and I wanted more cracks at the bag.  OW on row 2 wins 70%, and this wins 67 and sims 1-1/2 points down.  But watch what happens:
>Siri_Tillekeratne: Q N13 Q.. +12 277
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACNOTV N5 CeNTAVO +75 386
#note Score one for tile turnover:  the fifth tile out of the bag was the blank.  Note to self:  LOOK AT THE WHOLE BOARD, NITWIT!  This word plays at 1E for 93.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AEFLLR 1E FALLER +39 316
>Jim_Burlant: EEGHLMW 4C WHEE +34 420
#note WHELM 4A scores 43.   Geez, that was awful.   Fortunately for me, his mistake trumped my mistakes.
