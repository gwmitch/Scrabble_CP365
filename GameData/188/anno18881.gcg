>Jim_Burlant: EIILNSV 8A VILE +29 37
#note I'd been hoping he'd float the O somewhere I could have extended it into OLIVINES, but oh well.  No bingoes play.  This is best - takes out the hot spot, scores well, leaves a good combinatoin. 54% to win.
>Jason_Li: APW 7B PAW +23 47
>Jim_Burlant: ?IINORS A8 .IbRIONS +83 120
#note Bingoes all over the place - IRONSIDE or SORICINE H1, E1 VIRIONS, etc.  Once I saw I had something from the V I put this down.  VISORINg in the same location may be a tiny bit better - tougher for him to extend the G into bingoes than the S, but this never really factored into the game.  Just shy of 76% to win.
>Jason_Li: DOU B13 DUO +17 64
>Jim_Burlant: AFGHOST C11 GHAT +27 147
#note No 7's in this FOGHATS* rack, and I didn't think he'd buy it.  This position comes down to either this or 7F HAFT.  I never saw HAFT, but this isn't much of a miss.  This concedes 0.35% winning chances and barely 1 equity point at over 1000 iterations.
>Jason_Li: MO D11 OM +25 89
>Jim_Burlant: EFOOORS E3 ROOFS +25 172
#note A little more patience is needed.  10E FOE scores 25 and doesn't give him all sorts of easy lines to play through.  And, more importantly, with only 1 O in the pool, I don't need to worry about keeping duplicated O's at this stage.  This scores as well as any of my other choices but prematurely sacrifices my S.  10E FOE looks right.  This concedes roughly 4% winning chances and 12 equity to 10E FOE.
>Jason_Li: EI 6E .IE +8 97
>Jim_Burlant: EHOORUZ 4B OUZ. +26 198
#note At least I got this one right.  10E HUE and D2 OOH round out the podium, but they both win a couple percent less often and sim 5 and 8 points down respectively.  91% to win. 
>Jason_Li: DEILNRT I5 TRINDLE +66 163
#note The I3 placement scores one more point but, despite what Quackle thinks, I think this is his best play - he can't bingo without opening up so this makes sure there's a hot spot for both of us.  The outlook is still bleak for him - he's only 19% to win, but the momentum of this game was about to shift and this was going to get much too close for comfort.
>Jim_Burlant: EEHIIOR H11 HIREE +32 230
#note Not much else to do with this.  I'm still in the driver's seat - 78% to win.
>Jason_Li: AEMNX J10 AXMEN +35 198
#note Jason was understandbly reluctant to put this down given all the easy HEX extensions.
>Jim_Burlant: EEFIOQV H4 QI +23 253
#note Too much auto pilot.  FIQUE scores 34 at C1.  This is weak.
>Jason_Li: DE 11H ...ED +32 230
>Jim_Burlant: DEEFIOV L9 VI.EO +18 271
#note I somehow kept thinking that if I played VOIDED I didn't hit the double word and that the V didn't double.  Total brain failure, as L8 VOIDED definitely should have been the play.  This is second best, but that's more a reflection of how limited my options are in this position.
>Jason_Li: AGY M13 YAG +24 254
>Jim_Burlant: CDEFNRS C3 F.D +14 285
#note Q wants me to play with fire by playing at 7H with FID or FIND.   I don't care if I have an S, I don't want to give him somewhere to hit the miracle bingo that will win him the game.
>Jason_Li: ABEN 15K BE.AN +27 281
>Jim_Burlant: CENRSUU 10E RUE +19 304
#note I figured the duck wouldn't like this.  At this point I felt the pool wasn't overly bingo prone and my best bet was to outrun.  This is my highest scoring option.  The duck thinks I should build a rack with 10E NU.
>Jason_Li: AT 11C ..AT +19 300
>Jim_Burlant: ACLNSTU 14F CL.A. +13 317
#note No clue what's right here - was just trying to take pionts.  I should apparently rack build with CLUE on row 15 or dump the rack in (vain) pursuit of the blank with CULET.
>Jason_Li: L 14M .L +8 308
>Jim_Burlant: EJKNSTU J2 JUTS +30 347
#note I put this down to block row 2 bingoes front hooking ROOFS.  I had no idea he had any 8's available on row 7...
>Jason_Li: ?CGIPST 2E PIC +20 328
#note ...and, fortunately for me, Jason didn't either.  He realized the next day he had missed PIGSTICK 7H, which is his only win.
>Jim_Burlant: AEKNRW 4J .ANKER +22 369
>Jason_Li: ?GST N2 Gu.ST +14 342
>Jason_Li:  (W) +8 350
#note Glad to beat the eventual 4th-place finisher, but disappointed that I missed two plays as easy as FIQUE and VOIDED on turns 8 and 9.  Outside of those two turns, I'm pretty happy with how this one shook out.
