#note Couldn't decide which was right - this or KIP 6J.  My thinking here was that, if I drew an A, E, or I, I was guaranteed some sort of K play (either PECKING/PICKING/PACKING D6, or KIP 6J.  Quackle says I got the order wrong and that I needed to play 6J KIP this turn and hold the X.  Both plays are strong; KIP wins just shy of 74%, and this wins .9% less often and sims 2.4 points down. 
>Richard_Spence: CNOU 10D UNCO +22 67
>Jim_Burlant: GIIKNPT 6J KIP +37 149
#note Well, that worked out nicely.  This scores very well and leaves a promising GINT. Other plays like KING/KITING etc. blow apart too much of the rack for nowhere near enough gain.  This is best.

>Jim_Burlant: EGILNOT N1 LOG +21 170
#note No bingoes play.  Q agrees that this is a strong choice but it's not quite best in the duck's eyes.  Apparently I'm just supposed to fish the O with E10 NO.  I realized this would probably give back points, but I felt this came down to trading 21 for 35 as opposed to trading 4 for 25 on row 12.  The duck says NO E10 is best,  winning just shy of 80%.  TOE N1 18 wins 1% less often and sims 2.2 points down on NO, and this play wins 0.4% less often than TOE and is 0.2 points behind TOE.  Pick your poison.
>Richard_Spence: EOW O1 OWE +37 130
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEINT F1 DETAINE. +63 233
#note Only bingo.  86.4% to win in a short sim.
>Richard_Spence: BFIS E2 FIBS +33 163
>Jim_Burlant: AABDEEN 1F .AB +18 251
#note I knew Quackle wouldn't like this a whole lot and that it would want me to play at C10 with something like BAAED.  I was more concerned about taking easy scoring away, and I was getting too protective of my E's.  A better play probably would have been DEANED (wasn't sure about it) and I never thought of DEANED's anagram, DEADEN.  If I had this turn to do again, I'd probably play DEADEN or DEANED.  Besides giving up a handful of scoreboard points, I've made this game a race to who can draw the J to play at C10 because I've played off my B and can no longer play at C10, which is why this play is a 9 point dog in the sim and it wins 3-1/2% less often than DEANED or DEADEN.  That said, I'm still in pretty good shape at 85.7%.  DEANED/DEADEN win just over 89%.  The sim winner, which I don't like, is BANED C10, because it gives him a lifeline by opening the southwest quadrant.
>Richard_Spence: LNOY 2E ..LONY +26 189
#note Nice play.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEMNU 5K MU.ED +28 279
#note To play the D or not to play the D?  The problem I had with MULE was the  unseen DSS??.  Q says there are 3 plays that stand out at the top of the sim and they all sim within 1.3 points and 0.28% winning chances of each other:  MULE 5K, this, and 3C UNITED.   In retrospect, I wish I'd seen UNITED.  88.4% to win. 
>Richard_Spence: AZ D3 ZA +44 233
>Jim_Burlant: ADEELNV O5 .AVEN +27 306
#note I initially put down DAVENED for 36 but didn't like it, as it gave back too many potential plays like FORTY/HENRY/etc. at N10.  So I rationalized this choice (which is decent, but not correct) by thinking that, if he didn't have a bingo and/or an S, he wasn't going to score. Then again, given his next rack, it really didn't matter what I put down here.  The word I never thought of was the common DELVED, which is what should have been the play.
>Richard_Spence: AENORST 10I ATONERS +71 304
#note If I'd played DELVED, I'm pretty sure he'd have found K8 SENATOR/SANTERO for 75.  As it was, during the game Richard slapped this one down in a hurry.  He's still only 35% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: DEJLMNS 11K MED +25 331
#note Statically, this isn't even a top-1o choice, but it doesn't take long to make its way towards the top of the sim.  While K8 SLOJD (which I never saw) is my best play, the sim indicates this is a good choice.  He can't do anything on row 12 if he doesn't have a blank, and I have the J for C10 hooks and the case S to back hook OM. Additionally, I've put myself in a position where the right draw could see me cashing the J for 50+ on the next turn, which, given this board, probably clinches the game.
>Richard_Spence: TUY E8 .U.TY +16 320
>Jim_Burlant: AFHJLNS L8 JA..S +40 371
#note Best.  72% to win.  Other options worth consideration per the duck are 12M HAJ and 12C FLY.
>Richard_Spence: EO 3H OE +11 331
#note Post-mortem, Richard told me that, as of this turn, he knew the game was over unless I made a huge mistake.  
>Jim_Burlant: AEFHLNR 12C FL. +18 389
#note I knew Quackle would want me to play longer here, but as far as I'm concerned, less is more.  This puts Richard down 58 points and renders the board completely dead.  Q prefers 12C FLYER and 12B FLAYER because it likes a few more scoreboard points and turns more tiles with both the blanks unseen.  I don't need the blanks, and the problem I have with both of those choices is that I could see those plays lead to a sequence where he'd play on row 13 and open up lines on row 14 that I might not be able to defend.  Q also likes FERLY 12A better than this, and with both blanks still (!) unseen, floating him the E (not to mention putting the F in the triple) is just insane.  I'm fine with this, even if the duck thinks it wins 7 percent less often than FLYER and coughs up ridiculous amounts of equity.  
>Richard_Spence: GO 9L .GO. +16 347
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEGHNR 8L .AN. +20 409
#note Darn - I was hoping he'd open up a row 14 possibilities by playing something at 13B.  Instead I have a nogo.   As far as I'm concerned I'll just outrun him.  Surprisingly, Q agrees with me on this turn.  The sim is conflicted; this wins most often (97%), but concedes nearly 7 points of valuation to 4H RE, which wins 0.1% less often.  I'm fine with this.
>Richard_Spence: EIRT 12C ...TIER +14 361
#note An excellent play by Richard.  As I said earlier, he realized that, once I hit the J bomb, he probably wasn't going to win this game unless I made a major mistake.  Besides creating scoring possibilities for himself, he's also laying a trap for me - do I fall for it?
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEGHRV H11 V.G +7 416
#note This was anything but straightforward.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, Richard has left HP in the bag.  The knee-jerk/autopilot response to FLYTIER was to play VERGE H11 for 27.  But depending on his rack, VERGE might give him an out bingo, and my 75-point lead would lose to any out bingo since he'd get points from my unplayed H.  Championship Player indicates my two best plays are 5E SI(GH)...and this.  I can afford to give him a 27-point (VEG)IE extension, but I cannot afford to let him bingo out.  This is one of a handful of plays I have that wins 100%.
>Richard_Spence: ?EIIRRT H11 ...IE +27 388
#note Had I fallen into his trap and played VERGE, he'd have bingoed out with TIRRIvE(E) on row 15 for the win.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEHHPR 14G c.PHER +18 434
>Richard_Spence: ?IRRT 3B zI... +26 414
#note Nice!  How often does this word get played?
>Jim_Burlant: EH C12 .EH +18 452
#note HE 13B scores 2 more.  Duh.
>Jim_Burlant:  (RRT) +6 458
#note DAB was the wrong execution of the right idea, and the only other play that I'm less than thrilled with was my play of DAVEN (don't know how I never saw DELVED).   The rest of it I'm comfortable with, even if Quackle took exception to my defensive posture in the late game.
