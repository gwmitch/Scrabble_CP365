#note Final round of day 1, and my lack of sleep the night before is definitely catching up to me. You'll note this is not my best played game of the tournament. Grab your popcorn, my brain is about to explode.
>Eric_Harshbarger: ACEILLO J8 .OCAILLE +68 68
>dacrON: EEFNOPP 7K FOP +25 69
#note This play is all well and good until you note that I completely whiffed on EPOPEE. :(
>Eric_Harshbarger: DDEIT 15J .DITED +27 95
>dacrON: EEEGNNP 12F PEEN.NG +22 91
#note PEE(I)NG is good, too. ;) I liked that this potentially set up a phantom S hook, perhaps.
>Eric_Harshbarger: NOW H12 .NOW +21 116
>dacrON: ?AEJNRS K5 JE.. +28 119
#note I considered J(U)N here, as well, but I should bingo often enough to keep the consonant heavy leave. Quackle suggests JA(P)ER, as well, which I don't like.
>Eric_Harshbarger: AILSTUV 10H VI.TUALS +65 181
>dacrON: ?ANORSY N1 bARYONS +81 200
#note I like putting the B here more than the C. Feel free to disagree here.

>dacrON: AAIMRTY O8 MI.TY +42 278
#note I made this play way too quickly, and didn't notice M(A)YA. The leave is certainly much nicer, and each play blocks a hotspot, but given that this board is so unfriendly to bingos, taking the 7 points now does seem worth it. I should've at least considered M(A)YA though.

#note So, I immediately see CLApTRA(P), and am all ready to play it, but then I think, "wait, CLAPTRAP is a character in a Mario game, not a word. Oh shoot, am I now making this up?" I then figure that because I am so fatigued, I am completely making up nonsense, and decide not to play it. I then fail to see the only reasonable alternative, AC(Y)L, and proceed to make one of my worst plays of the tournament which very nearly cost me the game. Of course after the game, I realize that the Mario character is called Klap Trap, and only then do I realize the mistake I have made, and immediately know I'd passed up a (gorgeous!) valid word. Only sheer luck brings me back after this point, and I am embarassed to post this turn.

#note I shouldn't be in this predicament, and yet here I am.

#note Look at that tile pool. I just gotta hope for the best.
>Eric_Harshbarger: ABNORST A8 BARTONS +92 466
>Eric_Harshbarger: ABNORST --  -92 374
#note BO puts Eric in great shape here. Lucky for me, he plays one of my own classic phoneys.
>dacrON: EINOSTU 4B .OUTINES +68 457
#note I'm happy to just take the guaranteed win here, but Quackle, with its nerves of steel, suggests 10B U(D)O for a guaranteed outbingo(!) If you came up with U(D)O here, props.
>Eric_Harshbarger: ABNORST A6 TABORS +41 415
>dacrON: GIU F10 GI. +10 467
#note Whoops, GI(P) plays for 7 more elsewhere.
>Eric_Harshbarger: N 3B .N +8 423
#note (WIVER)N is cool for 4 more.
>Eric_Harshbarger:  (U) +2 425
#note At this point, after realizing my CLAPTRAP story mixup, you could say I was anxious to get a good night sleep - I was very fortunate to escape with a 6-1 first day, especially after a couple of large mistakes in this final game of the day.
