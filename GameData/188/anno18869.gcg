>Jeremy_Hall: AEX 8F AXE +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIORT I7 ODE +18 18
#note Not sure why I didn't play this at 7G for one more point.  The surprises to me are that (a) Q wants me to play EIDE for 22 and burn both my E's and (b) this sims better than 7G ODE.
>Jeremy_Hall: AEP 7E APE +20 40
>Jim_Burlant: AEILNRT H8 .NTAILER +79 97
#note 7's all over the place down the D column but they all score 72.  This scores 79 and is best.
>Jeremy_Hall: AEF 10F FE.A +20 60
>Jim_Burlant: CIOSTVY J4 TIVY +23 120
#note  I debated between IVY/TIVY and felt like I shouldn't give up the easy hook.  Q says I sould keep the T for myself and play IVY J5 for one less point.  Still in good shape - 74% to win.  IVY wins just shy of 76.
>Jeremy_Hall: IQ I3 QI +23 83
>Jim_Burlant: ABCOSUY 6B BUOY +20 140
#note To play the S or not to play it was the question.  I saw that BUOY gave up 10 scoreboard points to BUOYS.  But, even though there were no really juicy S hooks on the board, the board was sufficiently bingo prone that I deemed it worthwhile to keep the S at the expense of points.  Q says BUOYS in the same location was the play.  And this did work out.
>Jeremy_Hall: AELNOPS 12D OPAL.NES +70 153
#note And a slight imperfection may have just cost Jeremy the game.  The 7, ESPANOL scores 76 at J9.
>Jim_Burlant: ACENOSU 15E NAC.EOUS +61 201
#note And if Jeremy plays ESPANOL, I probably would have missed SUBOCEAN down the B column and this would have been a completely different game.  Quackle likes SUBOCEAN for 64 a little better than this, and I can see why.  While SUBOCEAN gives back any number of plays like OWING for 41, this scores 3 less and creates a spot where something like TROOZ 14B could score over 100.   Still in good shape, though.  SUBOCEAN wins 69%; this wins just shy of 68 and sims 3 points down.
>Jeremy_Hall: EGNOTT 14A GOTTEN +24 177
#note Relieved to see this come down.
>Jim_Burlant: CDHNRRT D4 CH.RD +32 233
#note I liked this play a lot; this is the sort of play I probably would have missed on day 1.  This scores well, clears the consonant overload and eliminates the duplicated R.  It's best, and just shy of 70% to win.  Play incorrectly scored as 30.
>Jeremy_Hall: ABDE A11 BAD.E +30 207
>Jim_Burlant: AHNRSTW 11J HAW +27 260
#note Good score, but there were  better choices available.  THRAW 13J, 13J THRAWN wuold have been much better to clear the consonant overload.  Stil in good shape, at 77%.  THRAW, the star play, wins just over 80.  But this worked out.
>Jeremy_Hall: IIM 8A IMI. +21 228
>Jim_Burlant: EENRSTZ M9 ZESTER +60 320
#note And, out of a pool that has next to no vowels, I snarf two of the three remaining E's and the Z on my replenish, and it all plays for 60 on the next turn.  Can you say, "Luck box?"
>Jeremy_Hall: JO 11D JO +35 263
>Jim_Burlant: ?DGILNR 14H .NG +17 337
#note I wasn't particularly worried about rack building, per se.  He's down 57 points and needs a bingo.  And if he doesn't have an A, S, or blank, he can't hit.  The idea was to score some points and not open up for him.  Q says I had the right idea but, given both my rack and the tile pool (2R's, 1 N unseen) I should have played ERG instead of ENG.
>Jeremy_Hall: GU B8 .UG +10 273
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEILOR 10L O. +7 344
#note Not that I recognized it, but there was a bingo in this rack.  Can anyone find the 9 I missed?  That said, bingoing and scoring big is not called for here because the only good scoring plays I have (e.g.:  N10 DEIL and the bingo) give him all sorts of lifelines he doesn't need with a blank unseen.  Q says fishing was more or less the right idea, though LO 6G or ROE 10K score a handful more.
>Jeremy_Hall: AIILNRT D11 ..L. +11 284
#note Actual rack - he was fishing for either an E or a blank for INERTIA.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DILMRS 5I S.M +22 366
#note The 9 I didn't see:  ED(IT)ORIaL 4G.  At the time I didn't see another choice than this; he was just close enough that I felt the need to keep the pressure on.  And at the time, I said well, he doesn't have the S, and he'd need to make the blank an S or P to do anything to me so this was safe.    Less is more here:  MIREX (which I always miss) G4 scores 14 and leaves him with nowhere to go.  SILD wouldn't have been bad, either.  Instead, I made this game way closer than it should have been:
>Jeremy_Hall: AIINRTV L1 VITRAIN +84 368
#note Oh yeah - THAT hook.  <<face palm>>
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIKLR 1J KE.ILs +36 402
#note I held his last play because I was initially shocked by the SIMA hook, but took a few seconds to gather myself and I remembered that, yeah, SIM does take the back A.  As for this - 2J KRILL wins by 3 more, but whatever - he's not going out ahead of me.
>Jeremy_Hall: ?FIORUW N6 FORa +24 392
>Jim_Burlant: DR 2K R.D +9 411
>Jim_Burlant:  (IUW) +12 423
#note Outside of forgetting a back hook to SIM at the crucial time, the only play that really missed the mark (HAW) wasn't awful; it still scored  well but just didn't turn enough tiles.  In short, I'm happy with how I played this.
