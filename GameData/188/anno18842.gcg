>Jim_Burlant: AILMNOU 8D MOULIN +22 22
#note An annoying rack - looks like there should be a 7 but there isn't.  8H ONIUM leaving AL is a tiny bit better, but this is still a strong choice.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AOTZ D8 .ATZO +32 32
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEILOW E11 AWOL +41 63
#note I can't play off anything that doesn't set up some sort of hook or leave me too vowel heavy, so I might as well max out the points and give her something that she can't do anything with if she doesn't have an S. This is best, but ZOWIE 11D for 34 is also a strong choice.
>Cheryl_Tyler: EPR F11 PER +27 59
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEIINW E5 WIN. +14 77
#note Another annoying rack - this looks like it should have an 8, but there is nothing in it and my viable options all score between 14 - 16 points.  I considered WIT 10B but didn't like giving the easy T hook down the A column.  Didn't want to part with my E, which ruled out 14C WILE.  C9 BI is insane even if I do have the W, and 9C WAIN set up the easy T hook again, leaving this.  Q's choice is 10B WI(T) for 14.   Given these choices I'm okay with this.

>Jim_Burlant: ?BEEHIN D2 HEBE +24 101
#note FAIL - my first missed bingo of the tournament. THEBAINE scores 76 at 4F.  Since I whiffed on the bingo, Q says it's either this or at C12 for 4 more points.

#note At least I got this one right.  80% to win.
>Cheryl_Tyler: BF 4H F.B +12 114
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIORRS K4 SORRIEr +71 228
#note A zillion bingos and they all sore 71 points (ROISTER, PROSIER, HORSIER, etc.).  By the slimmest of margins, this is my best choice.  95.3% to win.
>Cheryl_Tyler: EENORRY -  +0 114
#note Lost challenge - she challenged the S back hook on FAB.

#note Yes, I have many plays that score more (e.g.:  VIVA) but I wanted to make sure she didn't get a spread saving out bingo.
>Cheryl_Tyler: ?AEEGNN 13E ..ANGEmEN +74 247
>Cheryl_Tyler: ?AEEGNN --  -74 173
#note Nice try - gotta give her an A for effort on that one. :-)

>Jim_Burlant: ADITV L10 DIVA +22 543
#note DAVIT goes out for 24.  Duh.  Outside of whiffing on the bingo I should have found and missing what should have been an easy out play, I can't otherwise play much better than this.  The tiles were easy to work with after the difficult second and third racks.
