#note I'm digging this board so far. Sid and Bingoboy would probably squeeing with delight to be in this position, as well! :)

#note 4A DO(R)mIENT scores 72. I'd take the points, personally. Quackle says that (R)ET(i/I)NO(i/I)D is easily better, resulting in a 5+ point increase for Leesa next turn, but not for me. Curious - thoughts?
>dacrON: ABGHLNO H1 BAG.L +24 126
#note I debated this play and B(AIT)H. Wasn't sure if Leesa knew that B(AIT)H didn't take an S. I had a feeling this play was terrible, and sure enough, I spaced on BOH(E)A somehow! Silly mistake.

>dacrON: DEEHJNV E2 JE.D +22 234
#note Tough rack with no really standout options. I'm happy to just take the 22 here, and hopefully score better next turn. For what it's worth, Quackle is in agreement, here.

>dacrON: AEHKLNV 10I HANK +24 258
#note Stumped again. I chose this play because an A or and I would allow me to control a bit more of the board next turn, but the same logic says it will be easier for Leesa to underlap for points as well. Although they don't give back underlaps, I am not a big fan of the 10I HAVE-like plays, as I don't think the leave is very flexible. Granted the pool is 20v 20c (2y), I can't afford to have a terrible rack at this score, so I'm reasonably comfortable with my play. Besides, maybe I'll draw AIRY. I'm open to thoughts again, though.

#note 14J SO(Y)UZ is obviously a better play, and I did see it. For some reason, I decided to get greedy, and thought Leesa may try to open next turn. I think fatigue was starting to set in here. Remember, I slept like 3 hours the night before.

#note You don't need to chastise me for this Marlon, I know it reeks of quack smoking. Yeah, this was a poor sequence of turns. Just incase you were wondering why my spread was so low this tournament.

#note Really fascinating game until VIRELAY, thanks for your input! Could I have done better on some of those plays? Wouldn't surprise me!
