#note Not that I've ever surpassed anyone in dating, but I should have seen OUTDATe.

>Andy_Saunders: ?ADJLRT 10G TAJ +17 45
#note For some reason I saw JARL and dismissed it. Quackle thinks it's the best play. I think that I liked the better synergy that DRL? has compared to DT?.

#note I was really surprised when I checked afterwards and found out this wasn't good. It's about 5 equity points better than BIPARTY, though -- and it didn't get a hold.

>Andy_Saunders: BEIORRW N8 .OWER +18 205
#note Plenty of scoring plays down from L1 here, like WRIER. I think that I was too focused on shutting down the bingo line from O8.

>Andy_Saunders: ABIKQRT M3 QI. +24 229
#note Quackle likes M2 QAT(S) better. I'm not sure why. It puts the Q beside the DWS, and you really need an S in order to make a good counter-play after opp takes the DWS. Yes, you do have an I if the spot isn't taken, but it isn't as if there is a dearth of Is unseen at the moment.

#note For some reason, I thought this shut down the bingo line down the B column.

>Andy_Saunders: ALNRSSU J1 US +26 376
#note If I'd realized that Beth could still bingo with the C in the 3rd position, I might have made some sort of blocking play.
>Beth_Amos: EIINRSU B4 IN.ISURE +62 357
#note Instead, I get bingoed out on. Fortunately, my previous play was enough to outrun the bingo.
