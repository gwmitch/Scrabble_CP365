#note Yeah, I missed the bingo here. I didn't know the word, and Zyzzyva puts it just above 18000 in probability. 
>Connie_Breitbeil: ?BILRST 4E BRISTLe. +60 182
#note I suspected that this wasn't good, but I had the second blank and a reasonably good reply. If I challenge and it is good, I figure that I'll have a significantly more difficult time winning the game.

#note Just didn't see the bingo here, so I figured that I might be able to get away with opening up another line; there'd be a good chance of a line remaining open even if Connie took the triple...
>Connie_Breitbeil: AAEQU A6 AQUAE +46 279
#note ...which she did. 
>Andy_Saunders: ?AEILNV B9 ALEVINs +78 304
#note I seem to recall being close to running out of time here, so I played the first bingo that I saw that played. Of course, (C)LEAVINg scores 20 more points at the top of the board.
>Connie_Breitbeil: EHO A13 HOE +28 307
>Andy_Saunders: AAEEIRS N1 AERIES +26 330
#note I figured that I'd have a better time here playing off as many tiles as possible. RAIAS is much better, though -- as it doesn't open the triple for a comeback play. Also, there are plenty of spots for a pair of Es on the board. Once again, low on time, I saw AERIES, saw it gave me a win, and played it.
