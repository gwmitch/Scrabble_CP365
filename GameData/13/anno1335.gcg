>Brad_W.: AAMOSSV 1L .AVA +42 210
#note There are 2 obvious hotspots on the board and I wasn't sure which to use.  It seemed like whichever one I left open, he was likely to use for points.
>Ross_B.: AAFH H12 HAAF +56 255
#note Yup.  Ouchies.
>Brad_W.: DMMOSSU 5J MUS +22 232
#note Didn't know what to do here.  Surprised the only better play is E5 OSM(O)US 33 which I didn't know.

#note Couldn't find a play I liked.  Was nervous about extensions to ACCENT.  I drew the blank after this play which I took as a sign of validation.  7L IWIS 22 and 7M WIS 21 sim better than my play.

#note Knew WINNY* wasn't a word.  Also knew he wasn't afraid to play phoneys.

>Brad_W.: ?AEFINR A1 NAIF +51 393
#note I checked the O column to see if he had any monster X plays hooking the S on ADENINE but couldn't find any.  I could have played 15L FARE 46 but decided to take the extra 5 points.  Plus I wanted to play FLEDGY.
>Ross_B.: AIILOUX -  +0 355
#note Turns out he didn't have the S, and couldn't find enough points to absorb my play, so he had to challenge.
>Brad_W.: ?EEPRS 15L SERE +22 415
#note Missed millions of out plays.
