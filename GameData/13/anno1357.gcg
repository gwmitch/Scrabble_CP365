#note I was quite surprised to see that this wasn't good when I put the game into Quackle, having remembered seeing it before. I then realized that I'd probably seen it challenged off the board at club.

#note Here I got it mixed up with EOCENE. Joseph Bowman later informed me that EOCENES* isn't even good.

#note The duck likes B(R)ISKER here, probably because I have the B left for the parallel play and only need to draw a vowel in order to possibly score well on my next play. I think that it has a good point - you need to keep scoring lines open in order to come back from 120 down.

#note CECAL is also good. Knowing that might have come in handy.
