#NOTE  I wasted a lot of clock on this turn.  I didn't even see (R)IPOFF for 51, but in the end I should have taken JIFF for 30.  FP is just too bad of a leave.  JO for 40, I don't even think is an option considering I have two 30+ point plays that get rid of some of this crap and don't allow for big comeback plays.

#note  I did not like this play.  It seems as if he is gearing up for a bingo rack.  Maybe a blank?

#note Q doesn't really like this play.  All of it's top 5 suggestions leave 2 I's on my rack which I just didn't like at all.  I settled on this play because it gets rid of 2 I's, set's up an F comeback with IFF, and is reasonably synergetic.

#note  I wasted a lot of time here and almost missed this.  ELEGITS/IFS is best because it doesn't set-up a potentially huge X-play.
>Scott_P: AT M3 TA. +30 303
#note after my bingo I am up only 16 points.  Thankfully I drew the X and don't have to worry about that.  EX for 50 really isn't an option because it sets up easy 8s starting with E in the triple lane.  What I really didn't consider was the potential bingo lane in row 2.  There are 3 plays that win over 80% of the time according to Quackle.  I picked one, but it was not the bext one.  Can you find the best play?  This is probably the most instructive endgame I have come across in a while.  I was happy to play it reasonably well over the board.
>Brett_H: DEHLRTX 14H .TH.L +19 338
#note  ETHYL leaves the potential for EX on the next turn, and also gives me a short rack to finish out the endgame a little quicker.  I also set-up potential X plays (if I draw the right things) under the L.  The #1 play here was DR(IF)T blocking the top lane.  I probably wouldn't have played this anyway, because of the possible A front-hook.  Not being a machine I would be too afraid of setting up potential bingoes that actually aren't there.  The #2 play was L(U)R(E)X for 24.  I really like this play because it scores well, gets rid of the X, and blocks that top lane.  The shitty thing is that all of these lose (I think at least) if the V is in the bag and he has the case E & blank on his rack.  
>Scott_P: ?DNNOSU 6B DON +18 321
#note  I don't think there's a win here, but it seems that DiNOS in the same place is the better play.  If I screw things up and play EX where I do, then UN under it will win.  I was very low on time and might have easily made that mistake.
