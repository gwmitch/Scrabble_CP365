>fishy: ABHIIUV -AHIUV +0 0
#note I'm not sure if I have the exchange count right; I normally write that down but I didn't here. I assume BI was kept since it was part of Jeff's next play. Anyway . . . ran a 50-play sim tournament just to see what came up (2-ply as always, 10k). Duck slightly favors VIA 8g, with VAU 8g and exchange seven close by. For the shorter exchanges, Q likes keeping AH or H. 
>hector: FIIMSSS -IFMISS +0 0
#note Normally I'd put down IFS with a shrug, which Q likes (the play, not the shrug). I wasn't in the mood to play that sort of game Saturday afternoon, I guess. Duck calls this an equity flush of 13-14 points. 
>fishy: ??BEILR 8D BoILERs +70 70
#note Kramer would say "just don't miss the star" on this sort of rack, but there are two concepts to keep in mind: slot the B, give back as little as you can. There's something to be said for a duplicated consonant on the blanks, say BIRLERS or BILLERS, if it comes to mind. BOILERS is certainly a sound play, though. 
>hector: EOSTTUV E4 OUTV.TES +90 90
#note My spotty opener was rewarded with a very lucky pick six. 
>fishy: ADENRTU H1 UNDERAT. +80 150
#note There's no big difference between DENATURE and UNDERATE here, though with a lead it probably makes sense to not slot the D at H1 (Q gives UNDERATE the slight edge). Otherwise, just don't transpose the letters and you're feeling groovy. After this play, you're around a 70 percent favorite to win. 
>hector: BDHLOSS F10 HOLD +31 121
#note Another in the "Idalski rack" series, where you have to appraise the value of the double S. Q says there's little difference between the top five plays (1.6 valuation spread), though the two best (HOBS F10 and BOSH D1) keep the best leave for bingoing quickly - DLS. In retrospect I like BOSH more than HOBS (and HOLD, which came in fifth) and would probably play BOSH next time.  
>fishy: AGGHILN 1F LA.GHING +64 214
#note A bongo for the estimable host. I recognized the extension potential as the play went down, but I didn't know LAUGHING takes an S. 
>hector: BEISSTV 14B VIBES +35 156
#note Best. 
>fishy: NOPQRRW D1 PROW +34 248
#note Best. With only a short way out of the Q, keep scoring and pick four new ones. 
>hector: CIIKRST 1B KI. +9 165
#note If I knew LAUGHING-S was good, STRICK for 58 becomes a no-brainer. KIP is 5-6 valuation points worse than SKIP, but it's a practice game and I felt like an unconventional play. 
>fishy: AENQRWY 2A YA +22 270
#note QWERTY 6A is a neat option; scores 37, and as Kenji no doubt would diagnose in 3.7 seconds, there are no triple-triples from the pattern S????Q??. 
>hector: CIIRSTZ 9C ZI. +26 191
#note RITZ 6c is a little bit better - scores seven more points, and gives me one more pick to draw something like SYCE for 60. The A1 hot-spot, incidentally, underscores how well I don't know short words that start with SY - I thought of SYN and SYNE and SYCE pretty quickly, then I bit into the tootsie roll pop and stopped counting. Three. Your answer is three. 
>fishy: ELNOQRW C13 Q. +22 292
#note REWORN i4 is kinda cool: get the game five tiles closer to completion, take out all those floaters. DOWNER 3H is a point back, QI about two back. All of these win at least 90 percent of the time. 
>hector: CIORSTU 6C CU. +5 196
#note Ever have one of those long, long, loooong turns where you just can't see a good play? That's me here. I felt like I was trying to order a seven-course meal in French, just couldn't process. I did see the bingo on my rack and I spent some time looking for a non-existent eight. The clear sim winner - which will win 8 percent of the time - is RIB D12. 
>fishy: ELMNORW 2H .OM +27 319
#note Earlier in the day Jeff put out lunch, which was a delicious chicken-pasta salad. The marinated chicken was ridiculously good. The size of the portion I filled into my bowl was equally ridiculous. I'm lucky to have good friends. 
>hector: IORSTTY 3F TI.Y +24 220
#note Minor error. TODY in the same spot is better. 
>fishy: ELNNPRW 6G W.RP +15 334
>hector: EJNORST 3C J. +18 238
#note This is slightly preferred to the three A1 hits (SYN, SYNE, SYREN). Triple-triples have nothing to do with it - the 8s you can make from STONER-Y won't fit. There are 90 possible 8s that start with SY, for what it's worth, though only 15 of them are in the Top 15,000. Arcane facts like this in the middle of the night - that's the secret to my success, friends.  
>fishy: ADEELNN M1 .LEAN +12 346
>hector: EINORST L4 NORITES +72 310
#note All of the bingos are preferred to the A1 hits. Optimum bingo is ORIENTS N2; my play is second. And for fun, give a good look to Jeff's next position. 
>fishy: DENOORX N2 OX +31 377
#note The sim winner is OXO M8, which scores 39, leaves well, and has a defensive tint to it. For bonus points, find a way to score 50 with the spider. 
>hector: AEEIMNU K3 MAE +19 329
#note Nope, try again, son. I looked at the vowel-heavy pool and misjudged the path. Yeah, we're running low on consonants, but there's still a lot of viable bingo material left, and pretty much all of the bricks are on the board already. Saving -AEIMN to this bag has risk, sure, but it's a risk worth taking - playing something like LUTE F1 or RUE 2D makes sense. My play flushes 12 points of equity. The crazy point grab would be NAME K3 for 36 (there's that WARPER cranny spot again), but the leave is suicide. 
>fishy: ADEENOR G11 DOE +15 392
#note YEARNED or YEAREND A2 would pretty much end the game. 
>hector: ADEGINU H12 GENU +31 360
#note GENU is the big winner on equity, but AUGEND or AUDING at K9 have slightly higher winning percentages (perhaps you draw the S and make a miracle play of some sort). When I saw GENU, honestly, I stopped looking. 
>fishy: AAEEFNR 10B FA +24 416
#note Things still look good for the home team - this play wins about 89 percent of the time. But I've built a dangerous rack on the other side - give this next position a good look. 
>hector: ACDFIST M8 IF +20 380
#note I'd like to think I get these sorts of plays right a fair amount of the time. Not today. I can't even remember what my internal pitch for IF was; I know 7-on-7 is a loser so much of the time unless the board is super dynamic - exact pool knowledge and going first after the bag is empty means so much. Anyway, playing off the F only is the way to go - DICAST makes a seven-letter bingo with six (!) of the unseen nine tiles, they're all playable as the board is currently constructed, and his ideal block doesn't strike me as obvious. An I-pull is also in play for me assuming I can find SADISTIC from the blank tile sitting at 8J. I wonder if EF really wins 61 percent of the time, but that's what Ducky Medwick says (the only bad pulls for me are the two As). SYCE for 60 at A1 is also possible if I draw an E (though DACITES is better), but I'm probably too far behind for that to win. (If I do play EF, his best block from the AAEEINR rack is likely ASEA 10K, but again, I wouldn't call that obvious.)
>fishy: AAEEINR A2 .ARE +8 424
#note Looks right. SYCE won't beat you, but why give it away? 
>hector: ACDEOST N6 DOC +15 395
#note I think we played the final four moves right but let me know if you see better. 
>fishy: AEIN D12 NI. +21 445
>hector: AEST O8 SEAT +30 425
>hector:  (AE) +4 429
#note A fun game, against one of my favorite sparring partners. Jeff (6-1) probably could have gone on kicking my ass all night, but he had a Petty-Winwood show to get to. Coincidentally, "You Wreck Me" (Track 4 - Wildflowers) is playing on my ipod as I type this. G'night.
