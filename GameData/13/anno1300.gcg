#note Good to see you too. Harriette the Spy was one of five opponents to open with a bingo against me on Day 2. 
>hector: DEHMNRZ K7 D.ZEN +30 30
#note A good player knows and finds HERDMEN. I'm trying to get to Division 5 as quickly as possible, so I score less here. 
>laker: ?BELOTT 12E BOTTLEs +74 144
#note Oh Daddy, oh daddy daddy. 
>hector: HIKMQRT 7M HIT +21 51
#note Quackle doesn't like this as much as I do. Maybe it's a silly play, dunno. I figure it doesn't infer the Q since QIS is there for 32, and at least I get one extra pick at fixing this rack (and hopefully reloading an I). 
>laker: OW J10 WO. +29 173
>hector: EFGKMQR F11 F.RK +21 72
#note I need more volatility, and I need to keep her away from my QI spot. If she hits the bottom row, so be it. 
>laker: TUU H12 .UTU +12 185
#note A low score from the Laker Girl. Imagine that. 
>hector: AEGIMQY 6N QI +65 137
#note Just because it worked doesn't mean it's right. But hey, I'm back in the game - and I got a Y, too, which is obviously useful on this board. 
>laker: JO J6 JO. +29 214
#note JOB is better, obviously. 
>hector: AEGLMNY 15A MEANLY +51 188
#note Ack. A good play but clearly not the best. The first option I saw was the best one, MANGEY, but I was 50-50 on it at best. I made an internal decision that if I couldn't find another 15A hit, I'd throw MANGEY on the board. Unfortunately for Hectro, there are too many choices here (and I missed some other preferred plays, GLEAMY and GAMELY). Bottom line, when in doubt, learn the words, son. 
>laker: HOY 14A HOY +34 248
#note My oversight gave her more points here. 
>hector: ABCDGIS E10 DI. +22 210
#note I didn't want to play GIB in the same spot because I don't like what it does to the board. Mostly, I don't like anything here. 
>laker: ?GGINSU 7B GUShING +63 311
#note All of the bingos are going to slot the I at 7F. She was all paranoid about an X comeback, but don't worry, be happy - Quackle says you're a 92-93 percent favorite to win from here, all else equal. 
>hector: ABCDGSV -VDBACG +0 210
#note In a closer game I'd make a play, but I felt I was too far away from this rack being dangerous, and if something's gonna happen, it's gotta happen *now.* 
>laker: AIP 6F PIA +27 338
#note Makes sense, score, take away this hot area. 
>hector: EIIPRSU 13C PI +24 234
#note I don't see that anything else is logical here. 
>laker: AN I14 AN +6 344
#note She actually misscored* this play, which is pretty funny. (Okay, make that underscored. I caught this error; I didn't notice until today that she also took one extra point on her second bingo.) 
>hector: EIMNRSU D1 MURINE. +24 258
#note Her blue-hair block did take out TERMINUS, though even if I get that, my winning percentage is still a joke (in the 5-6 percent range). I hate blowing all of my synergy with the MURINES play, but I need the board to have some options. 
>laker: COR 1A COR. +24 368
>hector: AGINOST 3C O.GANIST +72 330
#note Hey, a break! I'm still a giant underdog, 6.73 winning percentage, but I'll fight until it's over. 
>laker: EET 2H TEE +13 381
#note I'm starting to think there's a chance . . . 
>hector: AACDLRS L8 .AD +23 353
#note Nope, try again. The three best plays all go on the top shelf; I didn't know two of the words but that's my own fault. DAD sets up a giant ZAX spot which I inexplicably didn't realize until today, about 67 hours after the game was played. 
>laker: AEFLR 1I FLARE +18 399
#note Setting up my next turn, I had an ordinary play available that, given what was left in the bag, would have won the game for me (with no heavy endgame lifting needed, at that). I took all the time I could, got down to 20 seconds or so, and then played something else: as it turns out, a phony that she game-situation accepted. Damn, I was *this* close . . . 
>hector: ABCELRS 15H ..CLEARS +33 386
#note UNBRACES is going to win most games (threatens LEX in the top right quadrant when I pull EX out of the bag, and her only logical block gives me AXEL or AXLE; if she plays really short on a block, ZAX beats her). UNCLEARS* was accepted only because she couldn't lose; had the game been in question it's coming off. UNCLEARS* also gives her nuclear waste of a rack a surprisingly easy out-in-2. 
>laker: AAEOVVW N10 AVOWE. +28 427
>hector: BEX 8E EX +22 408
#note I was right not to play BOX 12M because that adds to the weight of her VAW; even with no real time to think about the position, I was able to grasp that. What I didn't see was the tricky find of ZAX/HEX. I should lose 129 rating points on the spot for that oversight alone; at least it didn't lose the game. 
>laker: AV 13L VA. +18 445
#note It's the game we always seem to have; she races out to a big lead, I try to come back, I fall short. But again . . . a better player from my position walks up with the tally slip. I didn't finish the job.
