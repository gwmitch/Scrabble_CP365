#note Well, Zyzzyva says that BEAMILY is around 11,000 in probability. Of course, if I see the -ILY ending, I might find the bingo -- and the blank doesn't start to grow moss on my rack.

#note Of course, the bingos I do see, don't play.

#note AGOROTH is around 8800. I've never seen it before (apparently it's an alternate spelling of AGORA).

#note I'm getting my fours mixed up again; of course, that says nothing about the fact that I missed a cool parallel/through play on the right side of the board; VI(N)CU(L)A M3 for about 45 points. That in itself could probably keep me in the game.

#note DEALATES, ADAPTERS, and CASEATED all played. Plus, anything through that E would have blocked what my opponent's next play was.

#note I liked it, but at this point, down 130, I was getting desperate (as well as incredibly frustrated).

#note Anita left this pretty terrible phony on the board, thankfully. Quackle likes TRiPL(IT)ES 3C here, if only because it keeps the D open for one last bingo shot.
