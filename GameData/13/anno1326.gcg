#note Now it's a race to the next S.  Surprisingly the hook never happened.  I wondered if FRETSAW was a verb like JIGSAW, and perhaps it would even take the N hook, but no.

#note Spent a while on this one.  12A DU(N)AM 20 is best... not sure why I didn't see it.  I considered N2 MA(U)T 24 but wasn't sure of it.  Also considered 11H L(E)UD 22 but decided to undouble the A's.

#note Quackle wants to play the X but the leaves are ugly.  I chose to keep the X because there were many high-scoring X spots for a future turn.
