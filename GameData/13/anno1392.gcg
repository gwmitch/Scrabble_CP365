#note OK, So I open with 2 missed bingos.  Granted, I didn't know either ABDOMINA or BOARDMAN, but I probably should have at this stage of the game.  Especially BOARDMAN, since that even sounds SCRABBLE related.
>Christopher_Sheppard: AIJL 6D JAIL +31 57
>Dallas: ADEFNOR 7H FARO +16 35
#note He makes two Speedy Player "bests" in a row, I make two "urps" in a row
>Christopher_Sheppard: DEINP 8K PINED +31 88
>Dallas: ADEEENO O8 .ONEE +7 42
#note Make that three #1 plays to three urps

#note Finally a No. 1 play for me
>Christopher_Sheppard: ADGIO M10 AD.GIO +16 142
#note And, as an added bonus, and urp for him finally
>Dallas: ?IPRTUU 15L P.UR +27 120
#note I'm a little frosted at myself for this one.  PURsUIT may be a tough find, but I saw the two U's on my rack and didn't try to do anything other than decide between dumping one and exchanging both.  I can't give up on any rack so easily, because there may be something in there.

>Dallas: ?CHIOTU K5 CH.. +22 142
#note My fourth, count 'em FOURTH, missed bingo of the game.  Kelly McKenzie is right, you can put just about anything behind OUT.
>Christopher_Sheppard: CLU G3 CUL. +9 172
>Dallas: ?INRSTU 13D UNITeRS +62 204
#note O.K., now Quackle's just being mean.  I get an urp for finding a bingo, just because there were a bunch of places I could've scored 12 more points. Of course, those 12 points would have come in might handy in the end game.

>Dallas: AEIOQSV H13 .VE +15 219
#note SEQ(U)OIA is the one I most regret missing here.
>Christopher_Sheppard: NT D12 N.T +9 191
>Dallas: AIOOQSV 4F Q.A +13 232
#note I actually looked at and rejected Q(U)AI and Q(U)AIS, although I couldn't say why today.
>Christopher_Sheppard: BE 11E BE +13 204
>Dallas: ILOOSTV 15A LOTS +20 252
#note My play scores higher than any of Quackle's suggestions that I actually know.  Learn the words, Dallas. Learn the words.

>Dallas: IOOSVXY O4 OXO +14 266
#note I am confident he is holding the last blank here, and I should have blocked the only legitimate bingo line.  I looked at a potential block, playing YO for 16, but that would have actually played into his hand.  I didn't think this through right, but the potential game winners here (in light of his next rack) are VIO(L) at A12, YO(N) at 12B, and perhaps VI(N)O at 12B.
>Christopher_Sheppard: ?AEIORT A8 ORIEnTA. +71 294
#note Not quite as good as EROTIcA(L), but good enough.
>Dallas: HIRSVYZ 10A .VY +17 283
#note SIZY N1 still doesn't get me a win, but it helps me lose a lot closer.
