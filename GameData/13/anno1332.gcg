#note Didn't think he would go for D7 BRIND(L)ER* 62.  Quackle likes E11 B(U)R 18 which is not bad.  K4 BRIN 25 is also better.  My play is not listed but I don't think it's that bad.  K4 BRIN 25 sims best, followed closely by K3 REBID 30.

#note I could have played this at K3 for 6 more points, but he was fishing like crazy and I wanted to take out the easy bingo lane.

#note This was the wrong play, and I noticed it during his next turn, even before he bingoed in the spot I left open.  I should have played 14F WE(N) 19 but didn't notice the hook he gave me when he played the R.  14E WEE(N) 14 might be even better because it dumps an additional E.

#note This was the best I could come up with in terms of blocking.  I assumed he had drawn the second blank.  I wanted to play G3 LUMA 17 but I wasn't sure of it.

#note I was low on time so I went for the first out-in-2 I could come up with, even if it meant burning the blank for 3 points.
