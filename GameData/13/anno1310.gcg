>Jason: GLNRTTU 8D GRUNT +16 16
#note Yeah, this opening rack was a bad omen. Joey jokingly asked Paul Epstein if I left LS. I know there's a story there, but I don't think I ever heard all of it.
>Joey_Mallick: EHMRY F5 RHE.MY +30 30
>Jason: IILORTW 10B WILT. +19 35
>Jason: IILORTW --  -19 16
#note The sad part is: I put it down, didn't like it, picked it up, and then put it back down again. Sheesh.
>Joey_Mallick: ?EFGINS 5E F.EShING +94 124
#note I can read the writing on the wall and it says: "Surrender, Dorothy!"
>Jason: IILORTW H1 TROW. +36 52
>Joey_Mallick: AIILNOT L1 INTA.LIO +72 196
#note "Welcome back to Division 1"? What was that, sarcasm?
>Jason: AEEIILP 2J PI.EAL +28 80
>Joey_Mallick: ABEIKL O2 .IKABLE +54 250
>Jason: AEIRSUV 3H .VA +14 94
#note Q says to play VA(R) at 2F, which makes no sense to me. Of course, you sometimes get goofy results in hopeless causes like this.
>Joey_Mallick: DFO 6J FO.D +31 281
>Jason: EIRSUUW -UUW +0 94
#note Well, if I must fish and draw UW, make it a game in which I'm already getting bombed into next week.
>Joey_Mallick: MOUV E10 OVUM +23 304
#note Hey, he had a clunky rack!
>Jason: DEIRSSS N8 DISSERS +73 167
#note Saw DIS(T)RESS and didn't know its anagram, which played. Again, I played the tiles in the right order! When Jeff F. asked Alex if he liked DISSERS, Alex said: "As a word, yes. In Scrabble, no." Sounds about right.
>Joey_Mallick: OX O11 OX +36 340
>Jason: ABEEILT 13B BEA. +16 183
#note Bad play. If I'm going to play off those tiles, play BE(M)A instead, which opens a line...
>Joey_Mallick: DEGHIOU 13G DOUGHIE. +82 422
#note ...and would've stopped that.
>Jason: ?EEILTU 4B ETUI +13 196
#note WTH kind of word is TULLIBEE?
>Joey_Mallick: ADEIORT 2A ADROITE. +72 494
#note I want my mommy! (He's averaging a tick under 55 per turn, if you're scoring at home.)
>Jason: ?EELRWZ 1A ZEE +74 270
#note "You got more out of that than I did!" Joey pointed out. Hey, something had to go right eventually.
>Joey_Mallick: Q L12 Q. +22 516
>Jason: ?AALPRW B8 WARPA.Le +82 352
#note If I'd known ABEAM, I would've played WARP and been done with it. Sometimes ignorance IS bliss.
>Joey_Mallick: ACJNOTY A7 JAY +59 575
#note Says Joey: "At least you got the second blank to stop me from drawing everything." Yeah, except for ?SSSZ, Joey drew everything. I appreciated the sentiment, though.
>Jason: CENN H12 C.NN +27 379
>Joey_Mallick: CNOT 15A C.NTO +21 596
#note Says Joey: "Considering what I scored, you did all right for yourself." I'll take it as a compliment and add it to my press clippings from James, Kenji and Joel. :)
>Joey_Mallick:  (E) +2 598
