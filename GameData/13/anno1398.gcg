>Christopher_Sheppard: AAGLMOO -AA +0 0
>Dallas: CEFGHIO 8H CHIEF +34 34
#note The duck's only better play was CHIGOE 8C, which I didn't know.
>Christopher_Sheppard: DEENRST M2 TENDERS +82 82
>Dallas: EGLLNOR 5J GOL. +12 46
#note Quackle likes (F)LONG F8, which - surprise, surprise - I didn't know.  Hmm, wonder if I should learn the 5's?  Aside from the point differential, I'm not sure I understand why the ELR leave is so much better than ELNR.
>Christopher_Sheppard: ??AINOR H8 .ReAtION +74 156
>Dallas: BEILNRU 12F BU. +4 50
#note I played UNIT(A)BLE* (at least I think it was through the A, in an earlier game, so it's somewhat ironic that I missed (didn't know) the valid RUIN(A)BLE.  In any event, I made major points concessions here, and for nothing, really. Urp, indeed, Quackle.  Urp, indeed.
>Christopher_Sheppard: EINRTU 10B REUNIT. +10 166
>Dallas: EGILNOR L8 .LOG +8 58
#note O.K., (F)LORIGEN and L(I)GROINE I didn't know,but ELOIGN(E)R is right in my wheel house.  This is a stupid miss, pure and simple.
>Christopher_Sheppard: ADIOU 6F AUDIO +15 181
>Dallas: AEINOPR 5B OPERA +16 74
#note I should have found one of the 36 point plays here.
>Christopher_Sheppard: AESTV H1 STAVE. +42 223
>Dallas: DEGINOW M11 OWING +21 95
#note WIDGEON(S) and WENDIGO(S)???  You don't say.  Two ways to play ENDOWING?  Well, at least I know that missed word.
>Christopher_Sheppard: AH 6B HA +30 253
>Dallas: ADDELQY 2F QA. +32 127
#note I really can't explain why I didn't play Q(U)AY.  It is clearly a superior choice.
>Christopher_Sheppard: JT 10K J.T +20 273
>Dallas: DDEELWY 15J WED.ED +42 169
#note Finally, a play I am happy with.  The duck prefers W(E)EDY, I prefer the 4 extra points and not giving him a chance at that TWS.
>Christopher_Sheppard: AIL K10 .AIL +30 303
>Dallas: BEEFLOY 13A FEEBLY +35 204
#note Now, this time I do have to concede the D4 play.  BE(E)FY is clearly better than my play.
>Christopher_Sheppard: CIMN D1 MINC. +24 327
>Dallas: EIIOOPT 1A POE. +24 228
#note I didn't clean up my rack as I should've, but the points were respectable here.  Although, at this point, I really have to think towards a couple of bingoes to have a chance, and time's a wastin'.
>Christopher_Sheppard: RY A13 .RY +27 354
>Dallas: EIIOSTX 2A EX +40 268
#note EX is o.k., but I really wish I had at least seen and considered I(B)EX
>Christopher_Sheppard: AMZ 3J MAZ. +15 369
>Dallas: AIIOSST N1 TIS +26 294
#note TIROS is better, of course.  But, it's a 5, of course, so I don't know it, of course.
