>Jason: DEGHORU F3 DOUGH.ER +69 69
#note I might not have seen this if not for Joey playing it on me, and it's the only bingo. Still could've blocked it, though...
>Steve_Pellinen: EFGIN C3 FEIGN. +22 124
>Jason: ?AIIKNO D1 KOAN +35 104
#note Q likes OINK at B2. Take note of the number of times where Q's play has 3+ overlaps and I don't make it.
>Steve_Pellinen: EEM 1A MEE. +30 154
>Jason: ?BIIINR A1 .IRI +7 111
#note I saw BINIT, I liked BINIT's leave, but I hated what it did to the board. Q liked BINIT best, and mine wasn't in the top 10. Maybe I played situational Scrabble too early here.
>Steve_Pellinen: CDILOSU -CDILO +0 154
>Jason: ?BINOOY 5E B.OY +18 129
#note BOY at G2 is Q's choice. My play's tied for best equity-wise, but not in Q's top 10. I don't think Q likes where I put the Y. Again, reasons for my opponent's 455 average through 16.
>Steve_Pellinen: EILR H1 RILE. +27 181
>Jason: ?GINOOT 1H .OOsTING +77 206
#note Q likes the other 77-pointer, ROGaTION, slightly better.
>Steve_Pellinen: DEITV 4H .VITED +20 201
>Jason: CFLSSUW B8 .WFUL +19 225
>Steve_Pellinen: ?ADEMPV 10F .EVAMPeD +71 272
#note He drew six after EVITED, I look at DPX, throw back the X (Q agrees), and therefore let him bingo. Future opponents, I'm telling you: If you're in trouble against me, just overdraw. I'll help you out. I bet the blank was in the six drawn, too.
>Jason: CEOSSTT 12A C.OT +18 243
>Steve_Pellinen: AORR 11I ROAR +23 295
>Jason: AESSSTX 5J SAX +35 278
#note Q likes SAXES for 48 at 12I. Missed parallel plays: two.
>Steve_Pellinen: EILN 3L LIEN +24 319
>Jason: EISSTTW 13C WIT +24 302
#note I can't understand how WITE makes it Q's top 10 and not WIT. I know I can maybe make the board a little more open, but now now. BTW, Q's play is STEW at 12J, which has a good IST leave given three unseen E's.
>Steve_Pellinen: EHP 12K HEP +28 347
>Jason: ACENSST 14E ASCENTS +65 367
#note I saw SECANTS first. I thought "Too bad TE* isn't good." Then I saw ASCENTS. Yay, that plays! I can't explain why I refused to look left of OW. SECANTS at 14B wins 75% of the time. Even ASCENTS at 7H wins more than half the time. My play's at about 45%. And that my draw was one of the 30% in the 75% and not the 45% was a little unlucky, you could say. But to paraphrase Pianowski: That would be like walking into oncoming traffic and complaining I got hit by a car. Got only myself to blame. When I said I saw SECANTS first, Steve saw the play in about 10 seconds.
>Steve_Pellinen: AEEJLOU 15A JOULE +42 389
>Jason: AABDRYZ H13 Z.D +39 406
#note Forgot to include in the equation comparing it to ADZ that this game him a better out. Two-point mistake.
