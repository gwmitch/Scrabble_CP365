>Eric_Ufferman: FRY 9E FRY +24 54
>Andy_Saunders: AEEMOSV K3 MOVE +20 83
#note SOAVE takes the TWS at A8 and scores 41. One of the few mistakes made this game.

>Andy_Saunders: ILNORRU L11 .OUR +10 299
#note If I'd seen the best play here (OR), I probably would have played it, DOUR is incredibly risky, especially as I wasn't 100% sure on the back-hook.

>Andy_Saunders: EILNORU 15B NEROLI. +8 307
#note Quackle likes REV, though I really think that the position is open for debate. In fact, it is, over at <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/scrabbling/50578.html">LiveJournal</a>.

>Eric_Ufferman: ADGOTUW 15L AUTO +22 361
>Andy_Saunders: CEEI 13J .E.CE +16 388
#note Eric thought for some reason that I had said "and out" when making this play -- I hadn't. He then claimed he'd said "challenge"; I didn't hear him say it, but he then held himself to challenging the play.
