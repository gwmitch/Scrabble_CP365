#note I didn't think about it at the time, but why not at 8H?
>Jason: GINORVX 7F OX +37 37

#note All the V's and G's gone on back-to-back bingos!
>Bob_Linn: ACFIM C10 MAFIC +30 118
>Jason: LOOPQSU E11 POOL +22 135
#note Wondered if SUQ, leaving POOL, in the same spot was best, then thought: "There's no law saying you have to get rid of the Q now. POOL leaving SUQ sets you up! Duh!"
>Bob_Linn: AOZ 14C .O.ZA +36 154
>Jason: DEQRSSU H1 QUER. +45 180
#note SUQ at 15G is better. And I refuse to admit QUER(N)S is better than QUER(N)!
>Bob_Linn: INPTU 15G INPUT +23 177
>Jason: DDEESSS 10C ..SSED +18 198
#note Yeah, the Tile Gods and Q are in cahoots to convince me to start playing off S's with two-S racks so I can avoid stuff like this. I hated this play, and agonized over this rack, but Q agrees with the play.

>Bob_Linn: AAB M12 BAA +14 216
>Jason: ?ADIRSW N9 InWARDS +83 306
#note "I set you up pretty good," Bob said. Well, the three-overlap InWARDS at M7 was 101, I think. WIzARDS is four more and sims slightly better. Also, I say words like INWARDS, OUTWARDS, TOWARDS, BACKWARDS, FORWARDS, all should be -S less.

>Jason: AEIJLNY O7 JANE +36 342
#note "That's trouble," Bob said as I put this down. Not for me!
>Bob_Linn: DEINW B2 WIN.ED +26 265
>Jason: EIILLOY A7 OILY +24 366
#note Up to this point, I've made the best play six times, second-best once and third-best once, losing a total of 14.5 points. "This may be my best-played game yet!" I think. Then I make a 24+-point error by missing OILILY, which wins 100% of the time compared to OILY's 85+. I just played too fast. OILY was going down at M6, then he played, so I just blocked the more dangerous lane without thinking. No excuse for not getting two more points by playing it one spot up, either. Dumb.
>Bob_Linn: ?BEEMRT 2D EMBR.TEs +69 334
#note Bob shuffled for a while here. "366-265?" he said. I confirmed. "101?" I confirmed. "Too much!" he said. About a minute later, I got my "You stinker!" I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. (U)MBRETtE is 15 more and makes life a little more interesting given my rack. Q gives ME for 22 at 14J the best chance of winning, which I understand. (He scored this as 68.)
>Jason: EEILOOR A1 ROLE +25 391
#note Bob was surprised I didn't block his best FEH play, but this (or OILER/ORIEL at 1K) is a net gain of seven, which is as good as I can do (I think, given how Quackle couldn't find my win Marlon found in the McArthur endgame).
