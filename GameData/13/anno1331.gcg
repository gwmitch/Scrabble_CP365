#note Here we go again.  The other 2 times I've played him, he's creamed me.
>Brad_W.: DIJLMQU 5G M.QUI +32 32
#note 10F JI(S)M 29 is better.  I wanted to get rid of the Q, but it's probably OK to keep it here since I have the U to go with it.

#note Quackle wants to play off 3 consonants for less than 10 points.  I didn't think the leave was good enough to justify doing that.

#note I knew EYNE and EYEN but thought there was a third, EENY*.  How stupid.  To add insult to insult, I had to wait about 10 minutes for this challenge to be adjudicated because he was also the director and had to resolve some complicated rules dispute at another table.  So I sat there for 10 minutes stewing and beating myself up for playing a phony 4.

#note I didn't hesitate playing this.  He was fishing again and I needed something big to stay in it.  I thought I remembered this word from real life, but maybe it's slang.  Anyway, it's a phony.

#note This was a whiff.  My play is not even listed.  F8 H(I)ND 19 is better in the same spot.

#note Thanks for the O!  This also won me $25 for the highest scoring MG word.

#note Nice play.  Now I'm Z stuck.
>Brad_W.: GLSSUZ D1 LUG +12 418
#note Wanted to block A1 FI(R)E 26 or similar, although he could still play 1A FOI(L) 21 or something.
>Bernard_G.: ?EFIOU -  +0 363
#note I guess he passed so he could make me get rid of my S's.

#note I thought this might be phony, but I didn't challenge because I didn't want to bother.  It didn't seem worth it.  There's always the possibility I would challenge it off, then he would find some miracle play for the blank that wins.
