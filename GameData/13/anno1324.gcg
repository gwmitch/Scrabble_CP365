#note I11 RADON by two equity points and several style points.

>Jean_Carol: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 106
>Chris_Lipe: ?EEINOR M8 .OmINEER +68 227
#note Second-best, six points behind M6 INDORsEE.  Fair enough.  I guess the I at M6 is less risky than the E in row 14 or the R at M15.
>Jean_Carol: EKLV 14J KEV.L +44 150
>Chris_Lipe: GIPRUWY N7 G.RY +30 257
#note Quackle like L4 WRYING by 7.  
>Jean_Carol: EEGO K3 OGEE +15 165
>Chris_Lipe: AIPRSUW G13 PAW +29 286
#note O12 WISP, this was a major miss.  I didn't conceive of that O12 spot until a couple turns later.
>Jean_Carol: IX L11 XI +31 196
>Chris_Lipe: AILRRSU 4K .AUR +10 296
#note 4K GULAR and O12 URSA are about six points better than my play.  
>Jean_Carol: III -III +0 196
>Chris_Lipe: DDILRST O12 LIST +28 324
#note O11 DIDST -- this is a major miss by equity (12 points) but LIST is better in win % than a lot of higher-equity plays elsewhere.  Right idea, wrong word.
>Jean_Carol: EF F14 FE +33 229
#note At this point I'm going to refuse to be the guy to open the board.  With the lead, I can wait all game for her to open.
>Chris_Lipe: AADDMRW 3M MAD +22 346
#note 6F DWAR(FE)D is the best play.  I didn't see it of course.  Interesting that Quackle likes MAW in this spot better than MAD -- shedding the W + 4 points is three points better than undoubling the D's.  
>Jean_Carol: ISV O1 VI.S +34 263
>Chris_Lipe: ADIIJRW L6 WI.D +21 367
#note Quackers gives this the thumbs up.  Still not going to open.
>Jean_Carol: HT N2 H..T +24 287
>Chris_Lipe: AAEIJRU K13 J.U +10 377
#note Quackle barely prefers 2M AHI or exchange AIU.
>Jean_Carol: BTU 10D TUB. +12 299
>Chris_Lipe: AACEILR D8 CA.ER +20 397
#note Quackers likes D6 RECITAL, but, you know, that opens a bingo lane.  It moves two more tiles, though.  A bingo back would open row 1 and empty the bag.  Hmm.
>Jean_Carol: ?DILNOT H2 TOLuID.N +61 360
#note Right, that lane.
>Chris_Lipe: AGILNOP I2 APO +19 416
#note  3F POO is best, but APO wins 100% as well.
>Jean_Carol: BCEMNOR E9 B.M +26 386
>Chris_Lipe: EGIILN 4D NIEL.. +12 428
#note c11 GENII best; NIELLO still wins.  
>Jean_Carol: CENOR C11 RECON +21 407
#note Total equity loss was about 95, or six and change per turn.  WISP was a major miss.  DIDST was also.  Blew 41 points in the last three turns, but never jeopardized the win.  I would have had to try much harder to lose this.
