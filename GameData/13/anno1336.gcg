#note Missed H4 WANGUN 28.
>Joel_W.: GIORT 5C TRIGO. +14 14
>Brad_W.: ?APRSUV 4H .UV +7 29
#note Missed 8C PARVe(N)US 63.  Didn't know E2 PAV(I)oURS 62.  C3 VA(T)U 14 and F5 (G)UV 9 sim better than my play but they seem too defensive considering I have the blank.
>Joel_W.: EELMRST K2 RESMELT +76 90
>Brad_W.: ?AAHPRS J6 PA +22 51
#note Missed E4 P(I)RAnHAS 74.  Quackle likes J6 HA 28 but I would rather keep the H with the S than the P.
>Joel_W.: AEKW 8K .WEAK +48 138
>Brad_W.: ?ACHIRS M2 InARCH.S +84 135

>Joel_W.: EOSY 1D .OEYS +45 209
>Brad_W.: ?EGILNT O8 .EtTLING +89 255
#note I wasn't sure of this word (obviously) but so many of those "container" words are also verbs.  Shouldn't KETTLE be a verb meaning to place in a kettle or to cook in a kettle?  I did verify that I had 2 places to play bingos should it get challenged off.
>Brad_W.: ?EGILNT --  -89 166
#note He didn't even hold.
>Joel_W.: AF 2F FA +31 240
>Brad_W.: ?EGILNT D5 .ETILiNG +68 234
#note Didn't know O8 (K)INGLETs 89.  Saw L8 (W)INGLETs 74 and L8 (W)ELTINGs 74 but opted for more defense.  D5 (R)INGLETs 70 is better than my play.
>Joel_W.: AIV 11B VI.A +14 254
>Brad_W.: AEELORZ 8A ZOR. +39 273
#note Almost played ZORIL but decided to keep the L with my vowels.  Missed 6B ZE(E) 46.  8A LAZ(I)ER 45 is also good.
>Joel_W.: ABH 7B BA.H +17 271

>Joel_W.: FITY L8 .IFTY +30 327
>Brad_W.: AEEILOR A12 OLEA +22 332
#note I was very surprised to draw 3 more vowels after this play.  That meant only 3 of 15 unseen tiles were vowels.  I felt pretty good about that.
>Joel_W.: DOPR 11H DROP. +16 343
>Brad_W.: EEEIIMR 10I EM +22 354
>Joel_W.: X 13A ..X +20 363
>Brad_W.: DDEEIIR H11 .RIED +24 378
#note This seemed like the play that would most likely give me an out on the next turn.  The C was the one letter I didn't want to draw because he could block my out and go out in 2 himself.  If I draw an O, I don't have a guaranteed out but he's in deep trouble with only one vowel.
>Joel_W.: CDNOOST 14F CO.DS +16 379
>Brad_W.: DEIN O6 IN.ED +10 388
#note Would have been willing to try DEIN(K)* if I needed to.
>Brad_W.:  (TON) +6 394
