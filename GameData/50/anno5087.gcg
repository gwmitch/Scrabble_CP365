#note Maybe the 11H placement? It's rare that I sacrifice points AND open the board against a 1900s player, but I have the case S and like this board configuration more than if I hooked to THIRL.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ?ABEITT 12I BIsTATE +76 157
#note I understand why people like Ron play slowly, but I can't understand what took him like five minutes to play this, shuffling furiously most of the time. Was he looking for something through the X?
>Jason: ADEEGIS N10 GA.ED +22 124
#note I'd gotten Ron to get over time all three games I played him last week (including seven minutes one game), so the blitz was on. I hated this play (and the EIS leave) given how we've (I've) burned through consonants, but I gave myself about 15 seconds and hadn't seen anything better by then, so down it went. GAI(T)ED at L9 is an improvement, but I would rather play this quickly than GAITED slowly.

#note At some point, maybe after this play, I had 20+ minutes left, Ron about 2.
>Jason: ?AELOPS 15F PSOrALE. +80 242
#note Surprised at how many players who watched part of the post-mortem commented on not knowing this word.
>Ron_Hoekstra: PRTW 8A TW.RP +33 288
>Jason: ABINNTV B4 NAB +23 265
#note Maybe this is where I should start slowing down. The 12D placement scores six more and gives less back.
>Ron_Hoekstra: CENOR A1 RECON +30 318
>Jason: EFINTUV 14I EF +31 296
#note I'm pretty sure Ron was over by this point, as I recall factoring in 10 points into this play.
>Ron_Hoekstra: EM B1 EM +18 336
>Jason: DINOTUV N2 TONDI +41 337
#note I was proud of this one. Played it as soon as I saw it, not knowing how much it scored. Left UV, but so? Ron's already over and now has to figure out what I have, see my only out and how to block it.
>Ron_Hoekstra: AILNOR 2J A. +5 341
#note Ron was about 1:40 over after this.
>Jason: UV O8 .U +9 346
#note In my haste, trying to push Ron over by more, I donate the game by missing my V play, which easily keeps the spread within 20 and wins. Knappster (of all people) was sympathetic, saying he understood how it could happen.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ILNOR 1A ..I +3 344
#note Ron hurriedly tried to make a four-tile play at 1G, but misspelled it, and then replaced the wrong tiles trying to fix it. When he went to 2+ minutes over, he picked it up and took his time. By now I'd seen the V play and hoped against hope Ron would give me a reprieve, but he didn't. Lesson learned: Ignore the opponent's clock at this point and always, always, always think the endgame through. Very frustrating, esp. since Ron's first reaction after the clock was neutralized (he finished at -2:59, I had about 14 minutes left) was that he couldn't believe he'd lost. I asked what he had for a score and he said "I stopped, but you won by like eight." Uh, no.
