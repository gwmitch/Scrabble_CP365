#note i spent a while wondering if i could get away with notorni, but doubted it. then i had no idea what to do here. just KROON is better than KROONI, i don't know if i knew it. but M4 NORITE sims best. (-4.5)

#note low on time. nathan was sitting next to me and told me what i missed after the game.. that's why he wins tournaments. i wouldn't have found it even with 20 minutes, i didn't know the word. GASTRULA. amazingly though, Quackle prefers my move to the bingo, giving the bingo an only 14% win.
