>trashman: DEHILOS H4 HOLED +26 26
#note Chicago, 11/09. HELIO is Q's choice, followed by simply OH or HO
>Al_Helfgott: AEGU 8D AGUE. +8 8
#note Didn't look right, but for 8 points, I didn't even hold... It's phony.
>trashman: ?BIPRSW 7G W.B +24 50
#note Missed BOWSPRIT 78. Sigh...
>Al_Helfgott: AACENTU 5H .CEANAUT +70 78
#note I blocked 2 bingos through the L, although LACUNATE still plays for 2 more. However, it gives me...
>trashman: ?AIIPRS O1 PARI.IeS +140 190
#note ...also AIRSTRIP. Woohoo! The exuberance is short-lived, though, as I proceed to piss away a seemingly insurmountable lead...
>Al_Helfgott: MOY 4K YOM +29 107
>trashman: EEFFGIN N8 EFF +19 209
#note N7 FIEF for 5 more
>Al_Helfgott: ADGIOST D6 AG.TOIDS +70 177
#note I held for quite a while, sniffing a phony, mixed with desperation. I decide (stupidly) to let it go, thinking I can hold the lead, and that a failed challenge puts me behind...
>trashman: EGINNRZ 11C Z.NGER +32 241
#note ...and proceed to miss a pedestrian REZONING for 72.
>Al_Helfgott: KST I10 TSK +24 201
>trashman: DIIINRU 12I .IND +18 259
#note Best scoring play, but doesn't show up on Q's radar. URIC I2 12, GUID F11 10, DUI for 10 at J8 or E4. 
>Al_Helfgott: QT 6C Q.T +12 213

>Al_Helfgott: JOT 3F JOT +21 292
>trashman: BEIPRSU M2 RE..P +26 324
#note Best scoring play that doesn't shed the S, but again not on Q's list. It likes 7B BIG 19. I need the points.
>Al_Helfgott: EE C11 .EE +31 323
>trashman: ABIRSUV C3 BUR.A +38 362
>Al_Helfgott: DORV 8J DROV.. +11 334
#note I'm feeling a bit easier now, thinking I have control again...
>trashman: AEEISTV 2K VA.I. +16 378
#note Q likes O10 EVITES, but that's just crazy
>Al_Helfgott: LU F11 .UL +4 338
>trashman: EEMOSTW D3 EM +20 398
#note Not thrilled with any options here. Q likes D1 WEET 30, which seems silly. So do its other top choices, B7 MEOW and B12 MOW/WOE. 
>Al_Helfgott: N J12 .N +2 340
#note Make or break time...
>trashman: EIIOSTW L10 W..E +8 406
#note ...colossal choke job here. Any blocking play starting with S at 14J wins. None of those show up on Q's list, either. My rationale here was to make it tougher for Al to bingo, but I only gave him more points. Idiotic. I gave this one away...

>trashman: CEIIOST F3 .OTS +28 434
>Al_Helfgott: ILO 15M OIL +14 429
#note Yeah, I suck. Al ended up winning the tourney, with a little help from my foolishness...
