>Laurie: ?EFRSTT C7 F.RThEST +80 154
#note Oops!  I held on ACERATES, but I wasn't sure.  Quackle prefers the B8 placement for 82, forming LACERATES 
>Michael: AEELPRS J2 LEAPERS +73 141
#note Oops!  I held on ACERATES but I wasn't 100%.  Quackle likes PRESALE or RELAPSE at B1
>Laurie: AGORSUX F8 .AX +53 207
#note G9 GOX is also a good choice
>Michael: CFH 12A CH.F +30 171
>Laurie: AGIORSU A8 AURI. +21 228
#note Too bad there's no place for the word that refers to non-Muslims.  Quackle prefers ORGAIC in the same place, but I like to get rid of the U.
>Michael: JLLY 3I J.LLY +46 217

#note At this point, Michael stated that we've got ourselves a good game here.  He was right!

>Laurie: ?ABGNNR 6I B.G.N +8 356
#note i thought I should save my only vowel, but N11 BAN is a better play, especially given that the tile pool is full 'o vowels
>Michael: AIR B12 .AIR +20 362
>Laurie: ?AKNORZ A14 ZA +51 407
#note I thought about taking out the row 15 bingo line with ZONKs, but ZA scores almost as much and I thought I might need to hold on to the blank.
>Michael: DOY 3E YOD +15 377
#note D'OH
>Laurie: ?KNORVV -KVV +0 407
#note EWW...VV was not what i was hoping to draw after ZA.  I thought about L8 OINK which seems to be winning out in the sim, but figured that holding two V's might hurt in the end. 
>Michael: AEINSTU 15F AUNTIES +84 461
#note Ouch!
>Laurie: ?EILNOR B1 pROLINE +71 478
#note I went through the alphabet twice before coming up with this - the only bingo.  Still, Quackle prefers MOO at L11.  Interesting...  I suppose the downfall of bingoing is that my goose would be cooked if I drew two Vs.  
>Michael: IKOOVVW -  +0 461
#note YUCK!  Bad luck for him to draw all the junk after the bingo.  Michael held me on PROLINE for a long time.  He determined that he had no chance of winning if PROLINE was good.  After a few minutes passed, I drew my two tiles and came to the same conclusion.  Incidentally, Michael would have set a club record for high loss had he made a play and he knew it.  However, he made the smart decision to go for the gusto.  Good playing by him!
