#note Really felt I needed to block, and couldn't decide between MU and MUD. Seemed like the unseen tiles were so good that Quackle would probably find lots of outs-in-two even with one in the bag, and I wanted the points and a vowel. I drew TWO vowels, and was still screwed. The plays at G7 would probably have won for me against what it actually had.

#note There's no win. Saw that JA(M)S lost to BITO# 4A, so I blocked it without looking terribly hard for the other outplay. Some cool # J sevens are among the other losing plays.
