#note I was really out of it this game.  DUD 8G is obviously much better than this.

#note This play pretty much sums up this game for me so far:  one giant gaffe after another.  How's about STAFFER 13B!!!!!!  4 whiffs in 5 turns.  How can this get worse, you ask?  Keep watching...

>Jim_Burlant: AENRSTU 13B NATURES +72 160
#note Amazing - I actually didn't miss a bingo.  And I even chose one of the two best options.   (NATURES M6 is best).   Too bad the good play didn't continue.

#note Given how I've been playing this one, it's amazing I even found the bingo.  But it's no surprise I chose this one, since it's the worst choice of the 3 bingo options I have.  If you think this is bad, it only gets worse.

#note Didn't like the leave at all...just was blind to everything this game.  Don't know what was wrong, but my head was anywhere but the game.

#note Right idea, wrong execution (gee, what a surprise).  MINI M8 wins the sim.

#note This is just horrific.  CIVIC 4A!!!!!
>Dan_Terkell: ADGO K3 DAGO +21 380
>Jim_Burlant: ACEGIIV J2 VIA +19 380
#note Seeing the tile pool at this point, I figured he was tring to set up QI J2 as his exclamation point.  I figured that he had been sitting on QI but didn't have the U when he played DAGO.  I thought that if I went with CIVIC he'd burn me with QI, and that the spread minimizing option would be to let him have QUAIL 2A.
>Dan_Terkell: ABELQTU 11J E. +18 398
>Jim_Burlant: CEGIIQ 3C IC. +10 390
#note Obviously I was wrong and the Q was still at large...and courtesy of VIA I've dug myself what should be an insurmountable hole here.  The first inclination is to get rid of the Q with QI F1...but that gives him QUA 1F for 36 and there is no way on earth I can overcome that...and it will blow my spread.  So I have to make the feeble attempt at giving myself a place to play the Q since I outsmarted myself on the last turn.
>Dan_Terkell: ABLOTU 4A BOT +10 408
>Jim_Burlant: EGIQ A4 .EG +6 396
#note Continuing with the "plan."  He has to be aware that I'm sitting on the Q, considering that he immediately blocked my feeble Q setup.
>Dan_Terkell: ALU 3B L... +8 416
#note ...and Dan makes the wrong play.  LA 2E only scores 4, but I would have been unable to unload my Q.
>Jim_Burlant: IQ F1 QI +17 413
#note When he put down LO/LICE, I had to do everything I could to contain myself and not tip off that he was giving me the game.   After I put down QI, went out, got the 4 points from his rack and tallied my score, he was (quite understandably) in utter shock.  I truly felt badly for Dan - he had played a much better game than I had, and it only took one end-game mistake on his end to bail out all the misfires and idiotic plays I had made.
