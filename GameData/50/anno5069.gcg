>Jim_Burlant: ILLOPVZ 8G ZILL +26 26
#note I didn't like keeping the V but felt that 12 points was too much to give up for a leave of OPZ.  Quackle's preference is VILL 8E.
>Diane_Firstman: EHLO J6 HE.LO +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: AEMOPSV K10 MOVE +22 48
#note Too obsessed with clearing out the V.  Quackle prefers POMS K5 39.
>Diane_Firstman: FNORW 14J FROWN +48 66
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEOPS 15E APnOEAS +90 138
#note Makes up for the miss on the previous turn.  This is the best choice.
>Diane_Firstman: EINPRU K2 PUNIER +23 89
>Jim_Burlant: BCEELTU 14B CLUB +20 158
#note Quackle's preference here is CETE L1.  So let met get this straight - I'm supposed to give up 12 points on the scoreboard to get rid of a V, but I'm not supposed to trade 8 points and a leave of TEE (admittedly not great due to the duplicated E's) for a leave of BLU?  My preference would have been to play BLUE somewhere but I couldn't put it down.   
>Diane_Firstman: EQRY 3J Q.ERY +34 123
>Jim_Burlant: EEETTTW L5 TWEET +23 181
#note Hey, I found at least ONE good non-bingo play!  Joking aside, there wasn't much else I could do with this rack.  This is the best play according to Quackle.
>Diane_Firstman: CIM 8L .MIC +24 147
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIIIT -IIII +0 181
#note This isn't Quackle's auto-generated exchange rack; this was the actual draw.  Yuck.  Not much else to consider here.  Quackle prefers tossing in the A as well, probably due to the 6 unseen A's in the pool.  This exchange sims second best.
>Diane_Firstman: JNOT N6 JO.NT +30 177
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEGTX 15N EX +29 210
#note Championship Player's first choice is BEAT 9E 21, leaving GEX as a setup for an X play at 10G on the next turn.  This choice comes in 4th, sacrificing 5.4 points of valuation and not quite 4% winning chances.  I'm still at 58% winning chances with this play.  My rationale for this play was that I was concerned about preventing something like FISH or HUSK O12.
>Diane_Firstman: ADG 9F GAD +21 198
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEGNT E8 BEGAT +22 232
#note Her play of GAD threw a monkey wrench into the works, blocking my planned bingo of DEBATING.   With SSS? still unseen, I didn't like leaving the board with only one easy bingo line  (front-hooking GAD).  Since I didn't have letters to open another easy bingo line to counter it,  I figured I would limit bingo options to 7's ending in A or force her to find an 8.  Otherwise, the onus would be on her to open up.   Championship Player does not like this play, preferring BAWD M12 31 or DEBAG E8 24.
>Diane_Firstman: FTU 12B TUF. +14 212
>Jim_Burlant: DIINNRS 10B DIN. +10 242
#note Quackle prefers VIRID 12K 22.  Not sure I like leaving myself NNS this late in the game. 
>Diane_Firstman: ADS 11K .DAS +18 230
>Jim_Burlant: IIINORS 11A OI +6 248
#note How did Quackle know I would draw 2 more I's after my last play? :-)  Kidding aside, this was an interesting position.  Though the tile pool shows an S is still unseen, Diane's previous play of ODAS makes clear that the unseen S is in her rack.  And given this board, it's going to take at least 2 turns to clean my rack out.  Quackle prefers J3 QI, which I considered but rejected; a bingo by Diane  down the B column could end this game if I don't have an 8 through her bingo that very turn, and I didn't like my bingo prospects from a leave of IIONRS.  So, once again I felt I should block and make her open up.  Throughout this game I've been holding steady at just under 60% winning chances, and this is still the case here.
>Diane_Firstman: AIY 4H AYI. +19 249
>Jim_Burlant: AHIINRS G13 HI. +9 257
#note After puzzling over this position for a couple of minutes, I decided that the best tack would be (a) to not open up anything of import and (b) cross my fingers when I fished for one of those unseen E's.  I felt that leaving the board as is would allow parallel bingo lines on rows 3 and 5.  Quackle's preferences (SAHIB 8A 33, HIE L1 14) strike me as being too dangerous for this late stage of the game, with only 12 tiles left in the bag and Diane sitting on the S and probably the blank.  This play sims fairly well against an inferred rack of AERS?, but fares poorly against an uninferred rack.
>Diane_Firstman: ?AEORRS 5B rOARERS +64 313
>Jim_Burlant: AEIKNRS 3B SNAKIER +77 334
#note The hammer.  When she put down rOARERS I was not at all surprised to see both the S and the blank.  I also caught a huge break.  Had she played dROSERA in any of the 3 possible locations (D2, 3B or 5B), I would not have been able to get my bingo down and I would have probably lost the game.  
>Diane_Firstman: AEGIOTV -  +0 313
#note (lost challenge)
>Jim_Burlant: DN F2 D.N. +9 343
#note After Diane lost her desperation challenge, I went out with DINE F2...or so I thought.  Neither of us had realized until after the 20-second grace period had long expired that I had inadvertently failed to draw the case U.  The director confirmed that since more than 20 seconds expired between the time the game had ended and we had noticed the missing tile, that the U stayed in the bag and the game was over with the final score 365 - 313.
