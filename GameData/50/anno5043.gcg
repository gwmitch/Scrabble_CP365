#note I thought about HATH, but the strong defense of this seemed to be worth the point sacrifice.
>Winter: BEOPRRT 9C PROBE +16 16
>Dave: AABEHLR 10F AB +17 29
#note Kibitzer prefers ways of playing HA here, though it's ignoring the very bad defense of those plays.  Although my play is justifiable, in retrospect I was thinking about the value of the tiles too stereotypically.  In general H is a better tile to keep than B, but the B goes better with AELR.
>Winter: ACELRTT H8 .RACT +23 39
>Dave: AEHLMRU 11H .HUM +22 51
#note Don't remember if I considered HUM D11, which scores one more point.  Both moves have their defensive shortcomings, and for that reason HAULM might be preferable.  However, the difference between all these plays is slight.
>Winter: EEILPRT L9 REPTILE +84 123
#note Jeez, I really helped him out there.
>Dave: AEELORT 8A ALOE +22 73
#note Ooh, that's a bad miss.
>Winter: DEEOQUY 11C QUEY +40 163
>Dave: AEEINRT 14G ENTAI.ER +70 143
#note This is a tough call, but with the triple already open for so long, I thought it was worthwhile to partially block.  This play is hoping for an S draw so that even if he hits 15H I can make a comeback on the O column.  That being said, bingoes on the M column and even TREENAIL B1 are reasonable alternatives.

>Winter: EINOVWY 12A VEIN +37 227
>Dave: LNNRSTV J11 .LN.R +5 185
#note Another tough choice.  Trading might seem to be called here, but I thought the chance to draw an A or E for VAST/VEST O1 made this play just worthwhile enough.

>Winter: EIIJMOU N10 JEU +28 279
>Dave: ANORSSV 7I SOVRANS +68 289
>Winter: AGIIIMO 14A IMAGO +23 302
#note I was awfully surprised by Winter's play here, so I asked him about the rack after the game.  After he told me about the two I leave it made a lot more sense.  In fact, it's kibitzer's top pick.  That being said, the improved defense and four extra points of AGISM sure would have tempted me, despite having to keep an extra vowel.  But Winter wanted the extra turnover with ??SZ still unseen.
>Dave: ?CEEGGO O7 .EGO +24 313
#note I was relieved to still have this, as I would have had to settle for something like EGGER if he had taken the spot.
>Winter: AEFIIIT 15A FIE +39 341
>Dave: ??CDEGN J6 G. +7 320
#note There's no playable bingo here, but I spent a good five minutes or so looking at all the bingo lines, including the D column and row 6.  There might be other good fishes, but in general I think it's a good idea to play slowly here for a few reasons: 1) There are several bingo killers remaining in the pool. 2) With limited openings it helps to keep him as uncertain as possible about what bingos I could be holding. 3) I may need to fish again.
>Winter: AAFIIIT 5H FIAT +18 359
>Dave: ??CDENZ M1 CaDENZ.s +86 406
#note This seals it, though I had a much better bingo, which shouldn't have been very tough to spot after seeing this one.
>Winter: AAIIILS 4D AALIIS +22 381
#note SIALIC is a few points better.
