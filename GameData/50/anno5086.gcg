>Jason: BDDINRY 8D BIDDY +30 30
#note I saw BIDDY on the completed Armstrong/Hoekstra board after round one and joked to Chuck that he just taught me this word. "I forgot to look it up and see if it was good..." he commented. (Yeah, right.)

#note I felt like, with the blank, scoring and not fishing was the way to win this game. I felt like if I drew one of the two big tiles, I still had a good shot. Even with blank in hand, pool looks good and I'd rather not turn this game into a race to the bingo against a player like Chuck.

#note The only play, I think. "How did you get vowels?" Chuck asked. "That doesn't bode well for what I'm about to draw," I said.

#note (grumble, grumble)
>Jason: ?AMSTTZ E3 Z.T +24 385
#note After I was done internally grumbling, saying "All I needed you to do was not bingo!" I went through the endgame procedures: play his rack first. I saw R(E)X, X(U) and playing the R at L11 as his only plays, and thought "Wait, I can win this..."

#note (I actually played (JAR)S/(FOH)S#, but since I have Duck set to Collins, it can't challenge that off like Chuck did.)

#note "Are you playing a game of phonies?" Carol Rav asked. "He started it!" Chuck said. How mature... :P
