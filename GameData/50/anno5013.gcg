#note Either placement is rather dangerous.

#note If I had played in the other spot, he probably would have found RICINUS, since he wouldn't have had this bingo instead.

#note Tough to decide whether or not to tack on the S.  I opted for a better leave, since my lead wouldn't be insurmountable either way.

>Joey: DEEEESS J12 SEE +16 348
#note I still have no idea what's best here.  There are about a half dozen plays all bunched together.

>Joey: DEEGIST C12 .EG +8 356
#note Probably the most fatal error of this sequence.  DIGEST 15J and hoping he doesn't bingo seems to be the best option, but I figured I could hang on without him bingo-ing.
>Chris: AENORSY 15J RAYONS +43 375
#note DOPS.  GV was not what I wanted.  I wanted his last two letters (AM) instead.
