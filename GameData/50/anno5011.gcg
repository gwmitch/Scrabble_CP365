>moh: BCEOUWY 8G YOW +18 18
#note COWY, BUY, BUOY, and YOW are all reasonable. Since COWY scores the most, and since none of the leaves are great, it's probably best to take COWY's points. 
>sue: AADINOX 9G AXON +34 34
#note Easily best.
>moh: BCEEOUU K6 CUBE +20 38
#note Either cube or K9 ECU.
>sue: AADDGIN 10I GADID +31 65
#note All of the best plays hook CUBE-D. GADI sims ahead of GADID since it leaves slightly better tiles and sets up the GADI-D hook. Compare GADI's leave of ADN to GADID's leave of AN: While they're close, ADN has a better vowel-consonant ratio, which makes it just a bit better.
>moh: EIMORTU 8K .RUIT +24 62
#note There are four plays from 8K to consder: (B)RUME, (B)UTEO, (B)IOME, and your play, (B)RUIT. BRUME and BIOME score more, so they're probably better than BRUIT. Another option is O(D)IUM M9. While it only scores 18, it boasts an excellent leave (ERT). A player who knows she will find most of the bingos that cross her rack should probably play ODIUM; otherwise, take the points for BIOME or BRUME.
>sue: AAINNOT O6 NA.ATION +59 124
#note The only bingo.
>moh: AEJMOUW N12 JEU +31 93
#note JEU is best because of the huge setup that JAW, JOW, and JEW would offer your opponent.
>sue: DEFHOSS 10E FOH +20 144
#note 11E FEODS is best, followed by my play of FOH.
>moh: AEEMOSW 11D MEW +31 124
#note It's worth keeping a better vowel/consonant ratio with 11D WAE, or possibly 12L MO(JO). MEW scores more, but the expected scores of future plays changes a lot when you go from VVVC to VVCC (V= vowel, C= consonant).
>sue: ADEEOSS 12D ODE +29 173
#note I think ODE is pretty clearly the best play.
>moh: AEEORST N5 OE +8 132
#note OE is the best play.
>sue: AEIIOSS G12 AI +8 181
#note Quackle prefers taking points for something like 13D OSSIA 26. With the lead, I guess it makes sense to keep running, but I'm not sure.
>moh: AEEORST D11 ..O +5 137
#note We missed the bingo ROSEATE! I had actually seen it on the previous rack, but there was nowhere for it to go then, and so when you drew the same rack, I didn't even really look. But it now goes down at either 14B or 4I. (MO)O is the best non-bingo.
>sue: EILNOSS 14B LESIONS +77 258
#note Lots of options, but LESIONS 14B is best.
>moh: AEERSTT 4I RESTATE +69 206
#note RESTATE, RETASTE, or ESTREAT all score the same. RE
>sue: AHILLRV 15H HILL +36 294
#note HILAR in the same place is better.
>moh: ?ILMPPZ M3 L.MP +25 231
#note It's pretty close among M3 P(A)LP, 13K MIZ(EN), and our L(A)MP. I like PALP a lot because when you don't draw anything better, you can score well with MIZEN next play.
>sue: ADINRVV O1 VIV. +30 324
#note VAV 7F is score a little more, and it starts to shut the board down a little (though not much with the bingo lanes along rows 3 and 5).
>moh: ?EEEIPRZ 5C EmPRIZE +86 317
#note EmPRIZE is best, but it scores more along row 3 instead of row 5 (because of the 2Ls at 3G and 3I).
>sue: ADFNRTY L12 FRAY +43 367
#note Best.
>moh: ?ACGRTU 7E CRAG +30 347
#note It's either CRAG or possibly C1 ACUT(E) 14. At this point you really need to bingo out to win or stick me with the Q.
>sue: ADIKNST 15A KID +29 396
#note An argument can be made for 2N K(I), which minimizes my chances of drawing the Q and also allows a response if you bingo. Otherwise, KID is the play.
>moh: ?EEGQTU C3 QU.En +26 373
#note 3E TuQUE is best because it allows you to go out next play.
>sue: ABNNRST J2 TR.S +24 420
#note TR(E)S blocks your only out. (GET(S) to the S at K4).
>moh: EGT 13C G. +16 389
