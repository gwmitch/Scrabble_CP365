>Jeffrey: ABPRUUZ 8G ZAP +28 28
#note Not much to really debate, although PUB is surprisingly high in the static eval.
>Chris: IMNOSTT J6 MOST +27 27
#note EL:Man, I thought for sure this was telegraphing that you had an S to burn!
>Jeffrey: BIIRUUY K5 BUY +25 53
#note best play again, not much to ponder
>Chris: AEGINQT L4 QAT +33 60
>Jeffrey: DIILRRU M3 RID +25 78
#note static eval says LURID better in same spot, but I don't like his comeback chances.  I suppose leaving him a slutty hook isn't much better. -10.2
>Chris: EGIINSX 2K EXING +31 91
>Jeffrey: EILRRUW 1H WEIR +23 101
#note Q likes U(G)LIER or WRIER/WIRER, -2.8
>Chris: AEINOOS G8 .OO +13 104
#note ELJEFE: Chris jokingly pulled a Kramer here for about 3 seconds by slapping down (Z)OOEA# but then picked it up.  That is so '06!
>Jeffrey: EILORTU K9 OUTLIER +66 167
#note If I had done the math (same pts.) I would have opted for this at 2C.  As such, K9 was fine for a casual game
>Chris: ADEINOS O1 A.ONISED +149 253
>Jeffrey: AABEMNO N8 AMOEBAN +79 246
#note EL: Q wants me to open up ANOTHER 9X with the same word at 11A?  No thanks.  I also saw the AMO(E)BEAN but this was better at reducing the volatility
>Chris: AEGNORT 2C NEGATOR +67 320
>Jeffrey: DEILNRS D1 R.DLINES +72 318
#note Best.  Didn't bother to look for something else, (discarded 14E spot quickly) but would have found ISL(A)NDER if I needed to.  
>Chris: ?AFILUV 8A VAU. +21 341
>Jeffrey: ?EEHINW 12D pINWHEE. +84 402
#note At this point, with my drawing fingers of gold we had a bit of an audience.  Steve Glass hinted that there was a 7 in there, but I fiddled with it and slapped down pINWHEE(L) because I had not played it before.  -17 for not finding WHItENE(R) (or lesser penalty for WHErEIN @ F9 or 11A)
>Chris: ?EFFILP 15E PIFFLE.s +95 436
>Chris: ?EFFILP --  -95 341
#note ELJ:  I held, recognized PIFFLE as a verb, but knew several more common verbs do not take -R.  It would be outside of my prob. study (maybe 20K+ and I'm up to 14) if it were good, but I wisely challenged
>Jeffrey: ACDGHRV 15H CHA.D +39 441
#note best
>Chris: ?EFFILP 13I FL.P +24 365
>Jeffrey: ACGKRUV 5C V.GA +16 457
#note The Champ. Player likes B4 VACU(A) best.  Normally the GKR leave would fellate, but on such a vowel-open board it's okay I guess.  My first priority was adequately blocking/closing, and I thought 3 1/2 lanes was a worthy result.
>Chris: ?EFIJLT F10 JI. +51 416
#note ELJ:  too bad a spot's not open for JEFILTe*
>Jeffrey: CEKRTUY O12 YEUK +60 517
#note Clearly the best play- 94% win prediction.  Next is 11E K(I) for 75% chance. 
>Chris: ?EEFLOT A3 LEFTO.Er +64 480
#note ELJ: Just wow!  Q says LO(V)EFEsT and Fo(V)EOLET are quiet opulent as well, but they equally get the job done.  The phat 28-point outplay I have waiting in the wings (had Chris not outed) is quite suitable as well!
