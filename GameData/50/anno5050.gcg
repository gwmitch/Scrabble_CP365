#note Kate said she saved ?INT, but that's impossible because of her next play.
>Joey: CFHLRSY K8 LYCH +40 111
#note I saw FLYSCH and I'm not sure why I played this instead.  Saving the S isn't worth it.
>Kate: ?AEIRTW 13G WAIsTER +85 115
#note Big break for me here, as she started to play WEARIEST through G3, which would have blocked my bingo.
>Joey: DFLORST H12 F.RD +36 147
#note Unfortunately, I forget that my bingo is no longer blocked.  And this only the beginning, folks.

#note This used to be good before it was removed from the later editions of OSPD2.  But it left me a bingo, so why challenge?

#note Brava to Kate for rightfully pulling this out, and for choosing the lowest scoring bingo.  What a mess this was.
