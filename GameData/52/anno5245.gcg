#note It came down to this versus BELIE, and the sim thinks I'm off by a couple of points.  I thought the improved leave and defensive value would cancel out the eight-point difference. Close but apparently wrong.
>olaugh: AKNP 7G KNAP +28 28
>squinchy: BEILNOR 6I BO +21 33
#note EYELINER is 15 points more, but compared to BO, it's awful defensively and the leave is bad too. Plus the EYELINER possibility isn't going anywhere, most likely -- I can keep the board closed to big scoring spots now, take BO, and maybe tack on the -LINER later once the board is more open. The sim likes my play best.
>olaugh: CFOT 5J COFT +26 54
>squinchy: EILNRRV 8H ...LINER +36 69
#note Okay, now it's definitely right.

>squinchy: HIRRRVW 12J WHIRR. +22 91
#note Seems right. The other option is VROW K3 to unload that ugly V, but this looks a lot better.
>olaugh: EPV N6 VE.P +21 161
>squinchy: ADEINRV 14J DIVER. +28 119
#note This one is tricky. DIVERT made sense to me because it scores the highest and creates a little volatility, which is important when I'm down 70. But if he just takes out row 15 next turn for a good score, I might be down even more than 70 and looking at a dying board... this is a risky play. The sim gives DIVERT the highest valuation, but VAW J10 (17, DEINR) has the better win percentage. VAW looks a little too safe to me.
>olaugh: BFI L3 BI.F +24 185
>squinchy: AAEINNR 11I NAE +21 140
#note Again, the highest valuation but not the highest win percentage. Sim leader is ANT M3, which doesn't seem to do anything useful to the board, and if I draw another two vowels, it could be game over. I like NAE... extra points, balanced leave, taking my chances that a good draw can get me back in the game.

>squinchy: AACINRZ 14B CZARINA +92 232
#note ...like I said, a good draw.
>olaugh: LOW 10H LOW +33 256
>squinchy: AEMOOQS C12 MO.O +30 262
#note Definitely best. I'm not panicking about the Q at all here -- AEQS is an excellent leave with four U's in a 35-tile pool.
>olaugh: ?AILNOS D6 ANISOLe +70 326
>squinchy: AEEGQSU 8A QUA. +39 301
#note This has to be best, right? QUAG 6B blocks up the board something awful, and AQUAE 6A just gives him an easy TWS lane, meaning he'll score a lot next turn and I won't. QUAI at least gives me a fighting chance.
>olaugh: DEGSU E4 GUDES +33 359
>squinchy: EEEEGST M1 GEE +16 317
#note Time to get desperate. This keeps as good a leave as possible, scores a little, and opens one corner of the board to extremely-long-shot bingos. Doesn't look like I've got anything better to do.
>olaugh: DIIT 1K DI.IT +24 383
>squinchy: AEEGHST 15M HE. +16 333
#note Quackle wants just to fish off the H, claiming that AH D14 is 23.64 percent to win the game. It's an interesting idea -- with AEEGST, I have a decent shot, since there are a couple of draws that can bail me out. There are two T's and an R for GESTATE and RESTAGE -- those play at 2E, and it doesn't look likely that he'll block that spot. Maybe if I bingo out and catch him with a J on his rack, a win is possible. As for my play, I thought AEGST had a slight chance -- either GESTATE/RESTAGE, or I can draw LR for GESTURAL B4.
>olaugh: DEJSTTU C1 JUTTED +33 416
#note As it turns out, I did draw GESTURAL, but he blocks it and scores nicely. Game over.
