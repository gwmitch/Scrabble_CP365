#note I then noticed I'd made the blanks NG and almost winced. Having finished Agassi's book on the ride up, I learned Brad Gilbert would tell Agassi his draw saying things like AG (All Good) or NG (Not Good). I'm up a bingo and here I am trying to tell myself that a foreboding premonition means nothing.

#note I felt like I had to challenge, even though my gut said it was good. Kenji said given the score and situation, I should've been about 66% to challenge; I was about 90% sure it was good. Bad, bad, bad. Go with your first instinct! Randy sympathized, saying he understood why I challenged even if I thought it was good. "I guess I shouldn't beat myself up," I said. "No," Joel Sherman said. "We'll do that for you." :)

#note So frustrating. He played NURL(Y)* first, announced his score, did his "hover over the clock" thing ... meanwhile, my heart's beating in my ears hoping he'll hit his clock. Nope. Instead he does this and I know my bingo won't be enough. Tough game to lose, but I can't complain. Better player won.
