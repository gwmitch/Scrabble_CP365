#note Dave already posted his version, so I won't comment on any of his plays. I'll include his racks, though.

#note I considered EAU 10F, but this seemed better

#note Liked this over D11 plays to try and get a bingo down quickly. Quackle doesn't, prefering one of TWEED, TEWED, or TEW D11.

#note For those curious, this sims about 2.5 points better than UNSURE O4, and 3.5 better than XU. Didn't see any pressing need to take the triple here, Dave didn't keep an S and it's unlikely he blocks the hook unless he drew an S or blank himself.

#note Simulation likes either EKE D10 or MEEK 13A. EENRS is of course better, but not by as much as I would have thought, especially with all the Us on the board and a Q to come. KERNES O1 is also a serious consideration. My play ended up working out best for me in the game, though.

#note We'll be taking suggestions all night, folks. VIGS? VOX (which keeps LIS for the SLIPsHOD possibility)? VOLE? VIGORS?

#note Smart play by Dave to choose this over ANApAEST
