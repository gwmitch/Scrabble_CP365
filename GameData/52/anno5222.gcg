#note This position sims best, and Ricky told me afterwards that I had stopped him bingoing through a floater.
>x: FRY 4L F.RY +28 98
>Andrew: ?ADEIOZ 13G ADOnIZE +96 250
#note Best; DIAZOLE and DIAZOES (either 13H or K9) are also good.
>x: EEILMST N8 ELMIEST +97 195
>Andrew: ADENTUW L10 WAN.ED +42 292
#note DAUNT/ED O8 for 41 leaving EW is stubbornly a few points ahead on the simulation. Fair enough, it is probably slightly less swashbuckling.
>x: EIINORR 14A IRONIER +70 265
>Andrew: ADEEHTU O8 HAUTE +53 345
#note HAUTE is best, and despite consecutive bingos from Ricky I still have an 88% winning chance according to Quackle.

#note Ouch! Ricky's third successive bingo was most unwelcome. But he did miss a better play - EPITAXIs would have netted 203. Here DEMIC and MEDIC are about equal, but it looks as though DEEV 8A is slightly preferred - getting rid of the V clearly outweighs the four-consonant retention.
>x: LLOR E9 ROLL +15 378
>Andrew: ADGINOV K11 VO.D +33 411
#note I picked the right lane, but a better choice is GOV K9 leaving ADIN. AGIN is a good keep, but less likely to be remunerative on this board; GOV also scores 4 more.
>x: ORT O1 TOR. +21 399
>Andrew: AGINOPQ J1 QIGON. +19 430
#note Sigh - PAN(DEMIC) is tempting, but it is now imperative to get rid of the game-changing Q. I still have good prospects depending what Ricky holds, assessed at 75% by Quackle.
>x: ACETTUV 8B V.T +7 406
>Andrew: AGHP I2 HAP +22 452
#note Brilliant setup by Ricky, which is apparently the only guaranteed win.
