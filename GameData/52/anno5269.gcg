#note Well, this is a swell start.  I don't exactly want to leave Will an easy h1 play or 3 antisynergic consonants in a consonant heavy leave, so FOLK over FLICK isn't so bad, is it?

#note Well, I see IODIN, IODIC, and NIDI.  The top of the board is already shut down and it's going to be very difficult to open up since I'm behind.  NIDI offers me an S hook on line L to help me access the top of the board, and IODIC gives away free H1 plays as well as two easy bingo or scoring lanes.  IODIN gives away line 15 which is just suicide.  The L absorbs vowels reasonably well, so why not give NIDI a shot?

#note Oh great.  He has a big rack after fishing with OKAPI.  What am I going to do?  I have no good plays!  I guess I have to take out line 11 and hope at least make him open the top of the board if he wants to bingo.  Opening line 12 isn't so bad because he probably doesn't have high scoring tiles in his rack, since he's obviously fishing.

#note LIMNEST... isn't a word.  Okay.  Now we got that out of the way.  I could play LIMN to shut down the board again, but he can still hit line l or 14, and I have to hit something too.  Maybe he doesn't even have an S, but has something like a blank or AENRT.  I need to try and hit sometime, what about LIME setting up my S?  I don't know if HE has an S.

#note Well, Will didn't play perfectly.  Still better than me.
>Hero: GNOSTTU 12H OUT.NG +16 85
#note Well, OUTING creates another S hook in case line L gets blocked.  It's better than TOUTING and UNGOT is too defensive.  Let's play that!
