#note I had been planning on VOrAGOES#, but when that got blocked I had to dig deep to come up with this beauty. Not sure where I remembered it from; it's well beyond the probability range I had studied. Most likely, someone once showed me the oddity WAYZGOOSE#, which is apparently the preferred spelling. It's not any kind of goose, by the way.

#note Obviously, it was either this or QI. I didn't see very many bingoes that would play from the ABELNT leave, but this was incomplete thinking. Most plays by Nigel would open up more lines, and keeping the stronger leave is surely worth much more than 1 point. Sim rates QATS as a 13 point dog. 
>Nigel: GHINRSU H7 ..RUSHING +101 174
#note Sure enough, if I'd played QI, I'd have a bing now (though I doubt I would have found the P word).
>Bing: BEELNPU C13 PU. +20 183
#note Really tough rack. I guess my play is about as good as anything.
>Nigel: DEEIIRT 11H .IDERITE +68 242
>Bing: ABEEILN O10 B.ANIE +27 210
#note Sim prefers ABELE 10J. Not sure I agree with taking out all those bingo lines, but I guess it has the virtue of keeping the N for VODOUN.

#note Curious move. Nigel does love to wait with his big tiles.

#note Hmm, apparently GNU J6 wins 10% more often. I don't think I considered playing there; I was still trying to keep bingo threats alive. 	
>Nigel: AAAEILR O1 ARE +28 373
>Bing: ?CEIKNT M2 KI +25 372
#note KNIT/VODOUN wins the sim. Looks right - the extra turnover is a positive since I need vowels for the endgame, and the extra 3 points can't hurt either.
>Nigel: AADILOT K8 LAT.D +18 391
>Bing: ?CEIMNT B10 ChI +34 406
#note Hoping to outrun him. I think I was bound to come up short whatever I did - the J was the critical tile.
>Nigel: ABEIJOR G12 OBI +22 413
>Bing: EMNNTY I10 N.M +15 421
#note I missed Nigel's outplay, but it really didn't matter. If I try to block it, he just wins by more.
