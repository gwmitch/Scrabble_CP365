#note I hold but dont challenge because 1. I see HOWLETS, TOWHEADS, (but not TOWHEES)  2. Steve doesn't phony very much at all. 3. if he didnt see the bingos, he'd normally just block.  Must be good then right ?

#note TERGA is the play. I missed it. REGNA fits also in the H1 spot but is level with my play and a bunch of others in the sim.

#note ok, its a crap post bingo draw and five are in the bag - and Steve is -20 on time. I just put this down and hoped to draw something.  Q prefers O(G)EE - i guess it blocks bingos thru the E & G

>james: AEEOORZ N6 ZOEA +37 392
#note ok. Steve is -40 on time now. there is no 'win' if time wasnt a factor. I dont see anything thru the G with his tiles, so go with my play.
