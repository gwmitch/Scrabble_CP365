#note It's late at night, and my brain is fried.  I should go to bed.  Let's play some Quackle!
>Dave: EFOORST 8D FOETORS +78 78
#note That was easy.

>Dave: AAAEITT C13 AA +10 88
#note Uh shit, no idea what to do here.  Maybe partially block him and hope to draw into something good?
>Kwak: BDEEIMO J1 EMBODIE. +71 143
#note Dammit, now you're gonna make me think and look for bingos.  Don't seem to be any.  I probably ought to just score and take out row 1.  But let's look for ways to make this more volatile.
>Dave: ACEIPTT B10 EPACT +33 121
#note Looks like my silly choice blocked his bingo.  Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.

>Dave: AEINOOT 3J .OO +5 126
#note It sucks to have a wide open board and a rack like this.  If I do anything "normal" here, Quackle will easily outgun me.  I need to crank up the noise.

#note Yeah, TANG might be better, but sometimes you gotta take the style points.
>Kwak: EMORTUV A7 OVUM +31 309
>Dave: ABDEHSX L11 DEASH +39 286
#note Is this better than using the X?  Hell no, but it was such a cute play!

#note At dinner in Orlando, Jesse Day said, "did you know that GULLIBLE has an anagram?"  It was great, because no one knew how to react.  Later I said it could also be spelled GULLABLE, and they thought I was full of shit.

>Dave: EFIINTU B2 FINITE +24 440
#note A whopping eight points worse than UNFIT, but I was afraid of picking up another vowel with the EI leave.  Which doesn't make sense because the bag is empty.  I was tired.
