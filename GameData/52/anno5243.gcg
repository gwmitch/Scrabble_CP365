#note The other placement sims a bit better. I dunno, I thought it would make sense to open up both ends of the board.

>Matthew: ?DENOOR H1 fOREDON. +77 143
#note FOREDONE and OVERDONE sim close, but ENROOTED beat out both by 2.2 valuation. Why would that be? It's putting a T on the board instead of an F or V. Maybe because ENROOTED shuts down bingos through the S?

#note DEPTH is a dumb dumb miss. But my play sims best.

#note There are some fishier plays available, but this is the right time to jump on the points, with Jeremy finally taking a low score.
>Jeremy: EGI 14A GIE +21 209
>Matthew: AADEFMU 2K FUMED +28 261
#note This and 15B AMU sim close.

>Matthew: AACQRWX 15B AX +27 288
#note Quackle hates this play. It wants 15B CRAW or 15C WAX, neither of which seem to block the line as well as AX does, but my play is just asking for a shitty rack next turn. (-8.0 error)

#note Quackle says COW(E)R now and hope QI stays open next turn.

#note My reasoning: score points. block the best lane and open an okay lane. empty the bag and not let Jeremy have another turn to improve his rack. According to Quackle, this play is wrong, wrong, wrong. It gives me only 54.85% to win after this, giving 75.08% to B2 TA. I don't understand how my play can be so wrong, but that's the game right there.
