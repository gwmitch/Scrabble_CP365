#note Don't really like the easy (QUOIT)ED exploit, but it's this or 8I SUQ.  They sim within a point.

#note Quack likes J1 (E)D by about a point.  I wouldn't have guessed IRSTTU was that hot a leave.

#note The bag is REALLY vowel heavy.  This can't be bad at all.  Quack slightly preferes D1 V(I)BE ditching both V and B, but what does it know.

#note Lou put down 12M FRET, and then picked it up.  I was glad he changed his mind.

#note Quackle loves this play on Many Ply.  53.56% to win, but I have to assume Lou's tiles are going to be very close to the #OTARINE rack.  I'm hoping he can't bingo.  If he does bingo, maybe I can counter with a big J play.  My first choice would have won the game.  15I OBESE blocks most of the bingo lanes, and gets P and J onto my rack.

#note Oh well, I can't say I played this one bad at all.  Yet somehow I know Marlon will smack me in the head for not playing OBESE.
