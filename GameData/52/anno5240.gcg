#note Much safer than the 10J placement.
>Jason: EEHIRTV 8K HIVER +41 108
#note THRE(A)VE K5 is another good possibility.
>Bing: AEGOPRR A10 GOR.ER +27 215
#note Missed PROGGER. Apparently it's ours, still looks weird though.
>Jason: AEEIJTT 10K JEAT +26 134
#note Quackle prefers 6F JA# but for nuanced reasons. Two crazy aspect of the sim details are that oppo is 23% to bingo after JA# but 13% to bingo after JEAT#; but average oppo score is 40 after JA# and 45 after JEAT#.

#note This weird-looking exchange was aimed at drawing an O or U, for ZOBO# or ZOBU#/BUFO#.
>Jason: CEINSTT O3 CITTE.NS +73 253
>Bing: BEEILOZ A5 LOBI +27 367
#note Still focused on BUFO#, and now with a nongo on my rack. Maybe I should have gone with ZEBEC or ZIBET, to take out the S-hook.

#note Not quite so comfortable now as Jason was coming storming back, and I had no real option but to leave the triple open.

#note The knee-jerk play of MAQUI loses to outbingoes; I think this was best.
>Jason: BDLOORU 5E LUDO +15 391
#note Best is BUROO# 5D.
>Bing: ADDGNOS M2 GAS. +32 459
#note Best is GODS 4A making GLOBI#.
