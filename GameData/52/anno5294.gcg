>Seth: ?DDNSTY -DDY +0 0
#note Seth's actual opening rack. I like keeping NST? best, even if Quackle seems to think ST? is a tad stronger.
>Evans: ABEEGIJ 8E JIBE +26 26
#note Definitely opening with JIBE, the only question is where. I spent about three minutes on this, and I think I settled on the right placement. Especially since he just traded three -- if he's sitting on a monster leave like... gee, I dunno, NST?, then opening a 22-point J play is the least of my worries. Giving him a JIBER hook where he can double-double for 100 would be a nightmare.
>Seth: KNOT 9C KNOT +24 24
>Evans: AEGMRTT I7 GREAT +23 49
#note I really haven't got a clue. This is kinda typical of me -- when in doubt, turn over a bunch of tiles and hope for the best. This play is pretty bad defensively -- not only does it open up an obvious giant X spot, but it gives him easy access to the TWS lane at the bottom, with no guarantee of an easy comeback for me. This move is sort of a crap shoot. The sim is suggesting a tighter play like GAM 7F -- similar score, solid leave, not much in the way of opponent counterplay.
>Seth: IX J10 XI +52 76
#note ...so yeah, like I was saying. Obvious giant X spot.
>Evans: EMNOOTV K9 VENOM +36 85
#note The other option is VETO in this spot, keeping a better scoring leave and setting up the M, but I think it makes more sense just to take the points.
>Seth: ?IOSTUW 14H OUTSWIm +83 159
>Evans: ADNOOQT 13M QAT +47 132
#note Lucky me -- his bingo gives me a huge Q comeback.
>Seth: IIIIUUU -IIIIUUU +0 159
>Evans: DNOOPTU 15D POUND +42 174
#note Lucky me again! If he draws anything other than complete garbage, I don't get this easy TWS spot.
>Seth: HWY F6 WH..Y +30 189
>Evans: AGILOTU O8 GALIO. +24 198
#note This looks pretty clearly best. Knocks out a TWS lane and scores the most.
>Seth: EEFS G5 FEE.S +33 222
>Evans: AABETUY 13C BEAUTY +31 229
#note Maybe you could make a case for 13C -- bingoing doesn't look too likely on this board, so perhaps it's better to go for a stronger scoring leave. Keeping AY might be better than keeping A in this situation. But BEAUTY is more defensive in this spot, and the pool is strong enough that maybe it's better just to dig into the bag for goodies. Quackle likes this play.
>Seth: CDELO H1 DOLCE +38 260
>Evans: AAALNTV E3 LAVA +20 249
#note This is an unusually defensive move on my part. AVANT 12A is eight points more and keeps a perfectly fine leave, but I just felt like that made his counterplay too easy. This is safer and forces him to work for whatever score he gets next turn -- hopefully offering me a spot in response. Maybe AVANT is better... I'm still not sure.
>Seth: DEMR 4A DERM. +20 280
>Evans: AAEEINT 3G A.IENATE +70 319
#note Relieved that he didn't block this. No spot for TAENIAE.
>Seth: ADERZ 2J RAZED +59 339
>Evans: FGIOORU 4J FIG +49 368
#note My dismay at his 59 went away quickly when I saw this.
>Seth: ?EIPRRS A1 PRE.RIeS +140 479
#note Oh. I see. Good game, then.
>Evans: IILOORU 1A .OILU +8 376
#note Pretty lazy endgame on my part. I'm just trying to guarantee myself an outplay for next turn. The best play is IREFUL J1, which I missed -- then I get IROKO for the unblockable out. Cool sequence. Wish I'd seen it.
>Seth: CHNNS L11 SH +24 503
#note Clearly best. Gotta take those points.
>Evans: IOR 7I .IRO +5 381
