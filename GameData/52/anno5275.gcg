>moh: DEFFJKQ -FFJKQ +0 0
#note This is an obvious exchange rack. It's pretty close between keeping nothing, DE, and DEF, according to Quackle. I don't like keeping an F.
>wall-e: ACDILTY 8H DACTYLI +84 84
#note DACTYLI was a great find, but the placement is unnecessarily risky. In fact, I inferred from the placement that Wally didn't know the back hook.
>moh: ?DEEEIO 9L EIDE +17 17
#note Quackle recommends taking the big hook now with O5 DEIcE 54. That may well be right. I like my bingo chances in the next play with EIDE (well over half the time). I think my inferrence that Wally isn't going to drop a C there probably justifies EIDE.
>wall-e: AAILRRV 7C ARRIVAL +72 156
#note Nice start, finding the only bingos on his first two racks.
>moh: ?EEIORW D3 tOWE.IER +72 89
#note The only bingo, playable at either D3 or E3.
>wall-e: EEEKLRT F2 TREEL.KE +66 222
#note Uh-oh. I'd only won one game in my life when my opponent bingos on their first three turns (vs. Thevenot, I think at the Houston tournament). This play makes Wally a 19-1 favorite, according to Quackle.
>moh: ACIMOOS C9 OOMIACS +79 168
#note I almost took advantage of the DACTYLIC hook with MAC(E) or AMIC(E), but I thought the bingo was a bit better, especially since I was not 100% sure of the hook in the first place. If I can draw the other blank, I won't need a bingo to get back in the game, just the biggie at O8.
>wall-e: ?AGNQUX -  +0 222
#note Wally knew UMIAQ (or course), UMIAK, OOMIACK, and OOMIAK. This one looked a little too desperate, so he challenged. We've now got a game!
>moh: BEEOQRT 15C .TROBE +27 195
#note Quackle prefers E3 OBE 29 or E4 BEE(R) 32. I prefer to go ahead and kill the 3x3 lane and draw more tiles in hopes of an A for N6 QA(ID) or a U for a big QUI- play at 12A.
>wall-e: HLNPT 12A PL.NTH +28 250
#note Nice consontant dump!
>moh: EEFNOQS A12 .ONE +18 213
#note This was one of my less inspired plays of the game. G9 FOES 32 was much better.
>wall-e: GIMNSUU 5D .H.RVING +72 322
>wall-e: GIMNSUU --  -72 250
#note A good try, I thought, but I was pretty sure WHERVE is a noun only.
>moh: BEFNOQS G9 FOB +21 234
#note It's worth tacking on the S, although I didn't even consider it.
>wall-e: HN 5D .H.N +20 270
>moh: DEIMNQS 10J QIS +38 272
#note H1 MENDS is tempting, but shedding the Q is best. I considered C2 QI, which would keep the big H1 play for next time, but I couldn't justify foregoing 14 points. Quackle disagrees.
>wall-e: IZ 10B Z..I +33 303
>moh: ADEMNPS 14H DAMPENS +89 361
#note The same word plays at 14F and 6H, but the 14H placement is best.
>wall-e: ANV C2 VAN +16 319
>moh: AFGJOTU 6H TAJ +33 394
#note At the time, I was pretty confident about TAJ, but Quackle suggests some nice improvements. 13G TOFU is nice, but I like 6H FAGOT even better. It sets up the huge J play for next time, and blocks the 7s along row 6 as well as my TAJ did.
>wall-e: DEGNORU 3F .EGROUND +74 393
#note His fourth bingo gives us an interesting late game.
>moh: AAFGOTU 15L FA +20 414
#note I didn't want to empty the bag in a game this close, and I thought that blocking 15L XU seemed right. L1 FU(N)GO just seemed wrong to me (opening row 1 for plays like (F)aUX is a bad idea, plus it empties the bag), although Quackle likes it. Quackle's favored play is 13G TOFU, whch I can't really argue with.
>wall-e: ISX 11I XIS +35 428
>moh: AGGIOTU H1 GI.A +21 435
#note I was worried about Wally making the blank a C and dropping it at O8 (c(E)E, for instance). But no block scores enough to win, so I decided to just set up the out-in-two and hope he didn't think to try DACTYLIC.
>wall-e: ?EUUWY 2A gU. +10 438
#note Quackle's evaluation here is wrong because it assumes Wally had a W, but we knew going into the game that we were missing a W. Wally decided to block GOUT B3.
>moh: GOTU 13G GOT +14 449
#note After Wally's block, I suddenly started doubting my other out, U(N)GOT, so I took the certain win.
>wall-e: EUY 7N YE +12 450
>moh: U K13 U. +4 453
#note Pretty cool game overall.
>moh:  (UW) +10 463
