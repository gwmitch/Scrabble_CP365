#note DO(W)NLOAD and (W)OODLAND. Sure wish I could anagram. As it was this play was embarrassing enough because I played NODAL in this spot first until I noticed it made DA#. Kenji reminded me I was in America. :)

#note Or RIDGY, 6I, but against the Kenjis of the world, I don't like opening double-doubles. Make opponent's bingos hard to hit, low scoring, and/or rife with counterplay potential.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EJO 6I JOE +25 112
>Jason: AGINNRT 10B GN... +18 98
#note I don't know if I can stomach blowing up the rack and double-doubling here, though Duck wants me to. I suppose the pool is rich and there's a decent chance my bingo next turn will be orphan, though. Hm.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AELNORS 9I LOANERS +74 186
>Jason: AIINRRT C13 AIR +16 114
#note I can't play RAI at 8M, despite what Duck says. This sims second.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?BDEETV 15B B.EVETeD +92 278
#note Kenji said in the post-mortem he thought the game was over here. "So did I," I said. But I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
>Jason: BINNPRT K5 P.RT.IN +36 150
#note Well, if I'm going to lose I might as well make cute plays.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EEN 8M NEE +19 297
>Jason: BEFINOS 14F FIB +34 184
#note Hey, it only took until turn eight to get an E or power tile! (Oh, wait, I missed a bingo and have no leg to stand on whining-wise. Scratch that comment.)
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DEY L4 DEY +32 329
>Jason: ELNOSST O2 STONEL..S +60 244
#note TELSONS for 76, yeah, yeah. But if I do that, I figure, I'm down a bingo on a near-dead board against arguably the best defensive player in the game. This gives me volatility, the (slim) chance at a free turn, style points, etc. Plus, I figured if he didn't know he'd be loathe to challenge ("why didn't he play TELSONS?"). Duck gives TELSONS twice the win chances (4% to 2%) and it sims more than 16 points (the difference in scores) ahead. Boo.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEEEGRT 2H ETAGERE. +72 401
#note Given that Kenji's best play without this is GA(B) for 23 leaving EEERT, it surprised me that he took so long to (grudgingly) let it go. But I learned Kenji hates leaving phonies on. He also muttered a "nice play"; between that and Joel Sherman's "cute play" when I played HE(AVER)/H(I)/E(T) for 35, the new year got off to a good start.
>Jason: ACFIIXZ 1H FIZ +73 317
#note Back to respectability, at least.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CEKOQUV J9 .KE +35 436
#note I commented after the game that it was the unhappiest I'd ever seen someone score 487. But Kenji was understandably vexed here ... after having a 162-point lead at halftime, he's not 100% to win here! Although he was when he pulled the blank after this play.
>Jason: AACGIOX B13 CA. +26 343
#note Hey, it sets up potential for unblockable outs with COAXInG in Collins! (FEG#, CIT#)
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?COQUUV 11G COV.. +10 446
#note I thought this was a pretty slick endgame from Kenji, but Duck says QU(IT) is nine better.
