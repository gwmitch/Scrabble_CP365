>Matthew: CINRSTW 2F CR.WN +18 39
#note Just CR(O)W wins the sim here. Also, if I had been more sure of R(A)WIN, I might have jumped on that.
>Ross_Brown: DIT K5 .DIT +21 107
>Matthew: AAIRRST J7 .AR +12 51
#note This was a tricky position, as a ton of plays sim close. 6F RA(T) looks nice, but I didn't hav anything to hook to it. JAR and RAT sim neck and neck.

>Matthew: ENNOUUY D3 ENNUY +23 177
#note An awful rack which I am able to solve with a phony. From here on, I am going to outscore Ross 294-105, so you can see how this play is the turning point. Best real play is Ex. NOUUY. *ENNUY, by the way, is a pretty easy phony to play/accept if you know French.

>Matthew: CDEFOSU 13E DEFOCUS +75 252
>Ross_Brown: AINO 8J ..ONIA +21 262
#note Ross played an uncharacteristically open board, lucky for me.

>Ross_Brown: GRU 5B RU.G +10 272
>Matthew: ADEEHIL N2 HEAD +33 357
#note I wanted to try and obscure the O column while still scoring points. Quackle likes (DEFOCUS)ED, however.
>Ross_Brown: V 4M ..V +10 282
>Matthew: EEEGILV B1 GIVE. +18 375
#note I probably won't lose to a bingo through the A, but I could lose to a a big one hooking W(RUNG). I have the right idea, but Quackle says 8A GL(E)E. I'm trying to figure out what makes that play so much better than GIVER...

#note Missing the best sequence which involves blocking row 15 better, but I'm not playing for spread here. I should have realised how big of a play I was setting Ross up for, though.
