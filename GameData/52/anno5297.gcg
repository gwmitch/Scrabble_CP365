#note ah, lester's law of post-bingo crap. quackle likes 3I MEWLS better. it is hard for me to judge the difference between DQR and DQRS. (-3)

#note B1 AG is certainly very interesting. I just thought with so much good stuff in the bag I better try to get it, especially after his exchange 5 :( 1A ICH is also worth a try. Basically Quackle thinks I should just keep fishing. Also this is phony. (-8.5)

#note there is nothing else that makes sense here. I'm always going to be scared of making a play like this, but I have to get used to it. this game is lost without taking crazy chances.

#note i opened the board once, why not do it again? after 5 new tiles, his chances of drawing a bingo aren't THAT high, eh? again, nothing else makes sense.

#note this is a pretty cool find. i'm surprised he had no blanks or Ss.

#note i guess i kind of gave up on the game here. first of all, i mistracked and didn't realize he had an I. but I could not think of a real way to block the O column. maybe I was just hoping he didn't have the H. as always, quackle has cool ideas with 14E AVA, which would at least potentially give me a high scoring comeback (as well as it being a fish). somehow my move is still simming ok. 3L AVE is worth a try too. perhaps I need to fish and create a threat at the same time; I could always bingo out with something awesomely lucky like OrDNANcE if I do L1 VIAL. I dunno what is "right" here. maybe even VAVs and hope for a miracle. help! (-10%)

#note i'm kind of annoyed that i didn't think of NAANS until i was in the airport, since the indian restaurant kept bringing some to our table and it was delicious.
