#note could've made a short play on row 11, but I didn't really like the resulting board geometry

#note saw GRAECIZE, wasn't sure about it, but it's actually TWL. GRAECISE# as well, also AGACERIE#. But I think REGINAE is likely best anyway

#note ok, this is the position. What play gives me the best chance at winning?
>Magra: AILORST 4D ..RTIAL +22 392
#note quackle is unhelpful here and doesn't come up with most of the candidates. Plays I've evaluated: 15K ROIL (suggested by theodoro), 4H ROLAG#, 15K ROTAL and this one.
>Theodoro_Martus: BCGIILT C6 BIG +20 420
#note apparently Theodoro missed TIGLIC#, which I think I've seen at some point or another. The draw of the R kills me regardless.
