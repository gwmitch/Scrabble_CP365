#note Dammit! Thought there might be a bingo and missed GRAT(U)ITY. (-

#note Should've played YAG at 10B. (-9.0)

#note (T)APALO, L9. (-4.3)

#note Creating offsetting biggies.

>Jason: ?ADDFHO 4J FAD +26 104
#note Stupid fives. HODAD at 4H is the clear play.
>Mason_Shambach: IQ 3I QI +26 126
>Jason: ?DEHMOS O1 MOSH.D +48 152
#note Missing MEtHODS, but this is super-close. You could almost call it a stylistic difference. (-0.7)
>Mason_Shambach: O N5 .O +10 136
>Jason: ?ACEIST 5C STEArIC +74 226
#note Better bingos. Correctly passed on cATECISM*, but AuTECISM and CAsTEISM play. Saw but wasn't sure of SEmATIC at 12D to take out that long-open hot spot. (-18.1)
>Mason_Shambach: W F5 .W +13 149
>Jason: ?DIINUV B10 ..VID +22 248
#note Looked for -IU(M) words but none to be had. Considered Q's pick of (B)INDI but didn't like the UV? leave. (-1.3)

>Jason: ?EIILNU 1K ILIU. +8 256
#note I simmed this giving Mason ES ... I think by now it's 99.9% safe to assume he has at least that combo. I took a loooooong time on this play, but at least with reason. 14 of the 15 suggestions are within 10 points and cover a range of 97.73-95.67%. LIEU at 4A leads in valuation, but I am NOT opening up trip-trip possibilities after three one-tile fishes. I've gotten lucky, but I am leading the turnover battle 38-26.

>Jason: ?AENNNR 13B .NN +6 262
#note Q wants to run. A(V)ER at 12A for 42, though leaving ?NNN, is best. Although just giving Mason ES, Q doesn't know how close he is to bingoing. Maybe fish them off at M1? (-6.7)
>Mason_Shambach: V F4 V.. +9 195
>Jason: ?AENRRT O8 .R +2 264
#note OMG! Missing the fit for ERRANTs at 12E is bad enough, but not seeing it at 14D?!?! Oh well, it was a bagging and I didn't need to know what I was doing.
>Mason_Shambach: ER D3 RE. +6 201
>Jason: ?ACENRT 14D ENACToR +64 328
#note Wait, I played BOVID thinking it didn't take an S! Oops. Yeah, sCANTER's kind of way better.
>Mason_Shambach: AELNOST 13I TOLANES +70 271
>Jason: EEIJPST N10 JET.S +56 384
#note For the third time in 13 turns I make the best play.
>Mason_Shambach: HKORUX 4F .OX +39 310
>Jason: EIP M11 PI.E +14 398
#note Three more for playing PIE at 6B. Wow, did I play badly and just get lucky.
