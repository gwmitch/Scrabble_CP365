>Cornelia_Guest: BIL 8F LIB +10 10
#note (FWIW, this will the last play Cornelia scores less than 20.)
>Jason: CDDGHIN G6 CH.DING +20 20
#note Thought about just CH(I)D since CHIDING gives up Q or X bombs, then went "That just makes the board ugly if she E hooks it. Don't be a lollipop!" CH(I)D is the clear favorite, though. (-12.7)
>Cornelia_Guest: AX F8 .AX +54 64
#note TSAHTMIAO! In hindsight, though, the LIB placement should be setting off alarms. I didn't even notice. Next time I'll play CHID.
>Jason: ADEIORV 6G .OVARIED +70 90
#note Only bingo.
>Cornelia_Guest: AFT 5J FAT +23 87
>Jason: AENNOOT H12 ONTO +19 109
>Cornelia_Guest: ETW M3 TWE. +21 108
>Jason: AEEEKNR 7K KEN +27 136
#note Even if it's sub-optimal, I want to set up the A- hook, which I (correctly) believe is mine and only mine. Q reminds me that I'm a dumb@$$ since TWEE already takes the E- front hook. It likes KEENER at 2I. (-6.4)
>Cornelia_Guest: AQST I9 QATS +27 135
>Jason: AAEELOR 14B AREOLA.E +70 206
#note This or AREOLAE at 2H, but this play 1) keeps the A- hook open, and 2) slots the A less dangerously. ZA at 1H is 68 if I play AREOLAE. Plus, I thought she might be more likely to challenge this. Wins sim slightly.
>Cornelia_Guest: EPZ 13B ZEP +47 182
#note TSAHTMIAO! Laugh at playing by the Murphy's Law of Scrabble if you must, but it worked this time.
>Jason: ?DEIMRW D10 WIM..D +32 238
#note WEIRD(O) at H1 gets a slight edge. (-1.1)
>Cornelia_Guest: DIV J8 VID +29 211
>Jason: ?AEHNRY 2L YAH +27 265
#note Good news: I cash in on the hook. Bad news: I missed YAH/(TWEEN)Y for 12 more. (-)
>Cornelia_Guest: CLO B10 COL.. +22 233
>Jason: ?AAEENR 1H ARENA +24 289
#note I saw ARSENATE and SERENATA at 3G literally seconds after hitting the clock. ANtEA(T)ER, too. Given that I've played COVARIED, AREOLATE and ATWEEN with nary a peep from Cornelia, I probably had free reign to try a word-ish seven ending in A. (-)
>Cornelia_Guest: OY 1N OY +20 253
>Jason: ?EGIILN 2B LIGNItE +70 359
#note Missing the 71-pointers making G(LIB). But I like slotting no vowels, esp. with the J out. Q agrees, as this wins sim.
>Cornelia_Guest: SU 15A US +23 276
>Jason: EIORSTU D2 .OUT +10 369
#note Nice post-bingo rack, but bad time for it. Normally something like (C)O(W), but that's out of the question after her play. I took a lot of time here. Trying to toe the line between defense while keeping a good leave to bingo myself and pile up spread. Giving Cornelia the case S, SOU at K9 leads in wins, (D)OUR at N6 in valuation. But this is in the conversation. (-7.5)
>Cornelia_Guest: JSTU 6B JUST +33 309
#note She said in hindsight she should've held back the T. Hard to argue.
>Jason: EEGIRSU 5D .IE +10 379
#note Shutting down the slightly easier bingo line to hit. I'm willing to get out of Dodge winning by about 70. RE(J)IG is better. (-16.6)
>Cornelia_Guest: FIN 3A FIN. +20 329
#note A play like F(I)N may be a spread saver ... perhaps forcing me to block along row 15. With perfect knowledge of her rack, I was pretty sure she had no bingo.
>Jason: EGOPRSU K9 SOUP +28 407
#note (J)UG wins by two more.
>Cornelia_Guest: ?BEEMRR L11 MEER +24 353
#note I didn't even stop to think about this being phony. Wow. That's where my head was. I'm just "Oh, she's playing the M and scoring 20-some, like I thought."
