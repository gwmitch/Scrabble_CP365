>Jason_Ubeika: CENOSTW 8G COW +16 16
#note I *think* I saw Jason expose an S as he turned over his tiles. Clearly best.
>Jason: EEGILRW 9H WE +17 17
#note I think I missed WILE at J6. Can't explain why I wouldn't play it if I saw it. (-5.4)
>Jason_Ubeika: EENNSTU 10F TUNE +18 34
#note Jason overdrew and I looked at ENX. The X (correctly, Q says) went back.
>Jason: EGGILRY J4 GIRLY +23 40
#note LEGGY at 11I. Or in this spot, for that matter. (-6.4)
>Jason_Ubeika: ACEHNPS 5I P.NCH +24 58
#note I didn't know PECHANS or PA(I)NCHES.
>Jason: ?EEGINV 11I rEGIVEN +76 116
#note I wisely passed on EVE(C)tING*. (-0.2)
>Jason_Ubeika: AAENSTV O11 .AVES +27 85
>Jason: AEIISUZ M10 U.EA +14 130
#note (V)AU gets a slight edge. (-1.1)
>Jason_Ubeika: AADHLNT N10 H.T +30 115
>Jason: DEEIISZ 14J ZEES +41 171
#note I didn't want to part with an S and both E's, but Q says yes. DI(C)E at L3 leads in valuation by a bit. (-0.9)
>Jason_Ubeika: ?AADLLN 15H ALAND +42 157
#note Close in valuation to the bingo of LALLAND, another one I'd never heard of.
>Jason: DGIIITX 11C DIXIT +30 201
#note Or at 14D. In hindsight, that's where I should've gone. (-1.7)
>Jason_Ubeika: ?DFLLOY D7 FLOr.DLY +80 237
#note "You stinker," I said in the post-mortem, pointing at this. "When you did this..." "Yeah, I just learned this recently," he said. "Yeah, when I took it in our Anagrams game New Year's Eve!" I exclaimed. Bitten by my own word knowledge...
>Jason: AEGIRST 9C G. +5 206
#note Looked through the C and H in PINCH and the L in FLORIDLY. Didn't see the C in COWY to which AGRESTIC and ERGASTIC play until after I'd fished. (-20.5)
>Jason_Ubeika: ADIKMOR L10 D.M +31 268
>Jason: ABEIRST B4 BARITES +67 273
>Jason_Ubeika: AEIKORS A6 OKE +35 303
>Jason: ABIJNPT 5A J.PAN +43 316
#note Jason regretted not playing OKA instead after seeing this go down. But JAB at 14F would've been close.
>Jason_Ubeika: AINRRRS 14D .IRR +9 312
>Jason: ABEIOOT 4D BIOTA +26 342
#note Q likes TABOO or BOO, same spot. I'd rather take the extra four, even keeping an O with three out. (-2.4)
>Jason_Ubeika: ANORRST H1 TOR. +12 324
>Jason: EFIOOQU 1D QUOI. +24 366
#note Not on Speedy's radar, but wins the sim easily, almost 30 percentage points ahead of the second play. (-2.6)
>Jason_Ubeika: AENORSU 12D .UNE +20 344
>Jason: AEFIMO 3C FOAM +30 396
#note FOAME(R) is good, but I wasn't about to take the chance. (-11.0)
>Jason_Ubeika: AORS 6E SOAR +10 354
#note OR(C)AS is four more. Well-played from Jason, but like a  lot of games this tournament, I had the tiles and timing at the end to pull out a close one.
>Jason_Ubeika:  (EI) +4 358
