#note Tough decision here, for me at least. This and REMIX score the same. REMIX kills the triple without offering any reasonable tile for 8s but keeps the N column open for bingos, and leaves poorly. DEX could be disastrous if he has something like ?BSS on his rack but it's probably too early to worry about that. Is this obvious to everyone but me? I don't know what to do here.

#note This wins with an A draw (PRAHU and RAPHE) but that's it. Here's the problem: I somehow had mistracked G for K so I thought I had to block both GENEVAS and ENVISAGE. LOFTIER is a pretty cool play in that case! Not sure why someone who can't even track correctly is posting annotated games, but I hope this was at least fun for you to watch. In the meantime I'm just going to keep pretending my only problem is that I don't draw blanks :)
