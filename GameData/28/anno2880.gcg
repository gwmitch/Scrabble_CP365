>Jason: ALLRUUW 8F WAUL +14 14
#note Q likes LULU ... didn't think of that. (-1.7)
>Sam_Kantimathi: FUX G7 F.UX +19 19
>Jason: DLOOORU F10 ODOR +18 32
#note A couple of turns later, I thought "Hey, why didn't I add the U?" (-11.1)
>Sam_Kantimathi: AAGM E10 GAMA +37 56
>Jason: AGLOORW F6 WO. +22 54
>Sam_Kantimathi: GU 13C GU.. +10 66
>Jason: AGLPRSU I6 GU.P +11 65
#note WTH kind of word is SPURGA(L)L? (-33.8)
>Sam_Kantimathi: IJ C11 JI. +11 77
#note Hey, I'm not the only one who pulls the J on a fish!
>Jason: AELRSTY E10 ....Y +11 76
#note Held and released. Sam struggled some with the Collins-to-OWL switch, and it''ll rear its head in our ME game. I nearly threw back the Y; glad to see this. Prolly my winning play.
>Sam_Kantimathi: Q 12B Q. +11 88
#note Hey, I'm not the only one who picks a Q on a fish!
>Jason: AELNRST 15E SALTERN +83 159
#note To play this and give up the -S hook or STERNAL and give up a potential Z bomb? In hindsight, I like STERNAL based on his past two plays. Without any rack inferences (can't be 100% he has the blank or S, though I'm 90+% sure), Q likes this by about seven points.
>Sam_Kantimathi: AAH E4 AHA +17 105
>Jason: EEIKORS D3 OKE +31 190
#note Loved the leave so much, I missed KORE at D4. (-0.9)
>Sam_Kantimathi: ?AEEORS L9 AERObES +73 178
#note The four-overlap AREOlES at 14H scores three more.
>Jason: DEEIIRS 13L .I +2 192
#note Q says (P)I is the best fish. (-2.8)
>Sam_Kantimathi: DIIORV N10 VIROID +38 216
>Jason: ?DEEIRS M3 REvISED +75 267
#note Should've played the 80-point bingos hooking the S- to OKE and doubling the D. I liked this board configuration better, though. Touch of FPS. (-2.0)
>Sam_Kantimathi: INZ C1 ZIN +28 244
#note The right time to take the risk, but it won't work out.
>Jason: BCEILMN 1A BI. +42 309
#note Played too fast and whiffed on BE(Z)IL, though BEZIL creates another lane. (6.7
>Sam_Kantimathi: OTY F2 TOY +18 262
>Jason: CEELMNT K4 CEMENT +24 333
#note Dammit! CLEMENT is good! I wasn't sure. (-54.5)
>Sam_Kantimathi: EL 8M .EL +9 271
>Jason: BEFLNOT N6 FO. +29 362
#note Surprised FOB at G3 is higher in win percentage, though I see why it's better in valuation. F(I)T at 2B, which I considered, is best in win %. (-8.8)
>Sam_Kantimathi: AEV L1 AVE +9 280
>Jason: BEILNPT 1K P.INT +21 383
#note Most 21s through the A are more than fine. BEPAINT is highest in valuation. (a grudging -21.6, since BEPAINT only wins by seven in this case.)
>Sam_Kantimathi: ADENRST A1 .ARTENDS +86 366
#note Insta-played, when I had him down to about 10 seconds before this.
>Jason: BCEILNT J5 BET +22 405
#note Missed TE(R)B(I)C. (-4.0)
>Sam_Kantimathi: H 3F .H +9 375
#note Ooh, (OKE)H is 20! Now 3-0 vs. Kantimathi.
>Sam_Kantimathi:  (CNIL) +12 387
