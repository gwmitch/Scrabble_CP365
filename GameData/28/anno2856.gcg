>Jason: EIILRTU 8H TUI +6 6
#note Passing IU is better. (-3.8)
>Ember_Nelson: LNOO 9F LOON +11 11
>Jason: AEFILRT 7I FA +21 27
#note Missing FLA(UN)TIER and TRIFLE for 41 at 8A. (-25.2)
>Ember_Nelson: NR H8 ..RN +4 15
>Jason: EFILRTZ F6 ZIL. +33 60
#note Now I see TRIFLE, but that just has way too high a chance of turning her rack from an orphan into an eight. These two are very close. (-0.2)
>Ember_Nelson: EEHILST K8 SHELTIE +74 89
>Jason: EFIORTT J13 OFT +29 89
>Ember_Nelson: GOU 15G GOU. +15 104
>Jason: ?AEGIRT 11B RElATI.G +66 155
#note Yup, 66 is all I can get. Making the blank a D leads sim. (-0.9)
>Ember_Nelson: AEINSVW C8 INW.AVES +80 184
>Jason: EIJMOOP 15A JI.M +48 203
>Ember_Nelson: ACIO B6 CIAO +16 200
>Jason: EEOOPRX A8 REX +42 245
#note Saw in the post-mortem I missed PREX. It's not like I can use keeping my only consonant as an excuse ... there's only 16 vowels left in the pool, compared to 28 consonants. (-10.9)
>Ember_Nelson: AEO F11 .OEA +6 206
#note The pool becomes more consonant-heavy.
>Jason: BENOOPP 14B B.E +22 267
>Ember_Nelson: ACEL L12 ALEC +31 237
>Jason: NOOPPTW 10J W.PT +17 284
#note Felt like I had to kill the spot as best I could with ?SS (and YY) out. POW and WOP seem too gutsy. WONT I could live with, though. (-2.3)
>Ember_Nelson: ?EIMNSU D2 MINUtES +73 310
#note She can fit UNMI(T)rES for 10 more. It was the only blank she saw in the first five late bird games.
>Jason: AKNOOPV C1 KOP +30 314
>Ember_Nelson: DIY M10 .IDY +34 344
#note Not looking good for the home team...
>Jason: ABDNOSV G5 BAD +24 338
#note I'm surprised VAN wins sim by so much. I saw it, but down after this play, I don't want to make the board near-unplayable. This is second. (-6.1)
>Ember_Nelson: ADEEHNR H4 DE +9 353
#note We post-mortemed during the whole dinner break (save for the last 15 minutes, in which I raced up to the room to heat up leftover pizza). We didn't talk about this rack much (just that the only five ending in E is RANEE, which would be stupid to play. Gotta think DA(K) or (C)HAD are among the better plays, though. I was happy to see her let up on the scoring pressure.
>Jason: ADNOSUV 1A DA. +24 362
#note As soon as the last I came, I saw the Q-stick possibility and was glad to pluck the U. Considered ANO(DE)S, but thought she didn't have the Q and playing short was the way to go. Best in win %, but DU(OM)OS leads in valuation, 46.8 points ahead. I'm making an executive decision that DUOMOS is stupid, and giving myself a 28.7 equity hit, the difference between this and ANO(DE)S.
>Ember_Nelson: AEEHNRY B1 .Y +26 379
#note HOMEY wins for her, as she can probably outrun the Q stick. Esp. keeping the A for Q(U)A; that limits my options on the first turn. On its surface, this is a good play, though. But now I'm pretty sure she's drying to duck the Q, too.
>Jason: NORSTUV 11M .T +2 364
#note Q no likey. After the fact, I realized it too. So what if I've got a second SUQ spot; it scores bupkis*. Try to pull off the Q-stick now, starting with UN, which wins 7/9 of the time. (-79.3?! Yeah, I guess so.)
>Ember_Nelson: AEEGHNR I3 REG +14 393
#note As soon as Ember was surprised that I played off the last T and said "Where's he going with it?" I knew I'd left the Q in the bag. Randy came up with an interesting option: Pass. The only danger is if I've picked up the Q and play S(U)Q to go up nine, but then her rack is so good and mine so bad she probably wins anyway. Q disagrees, though. CP says NAH at H3 leads the guaranteed wins.
>Jason: NORRSUV E4 UN +10 374
#note Best.
>Ember_Nelson: AEHNQ G13 HA. +22 415
#note Also best. I didn't have a lot of time left (neither of us did), and I said "You may win this anyway."
>Jason: ORRSV 4H ..V +7 381
#note I figured it was now or I die with it, but Q says (G)O to block N(OILY) is best. (-4.0)
>Ember_Nelson: ENQ 13I N.... +9 424
#note Best.
>Jason: ORRS J6 R.. +5 386
#note Two worse than OR?
>Ember_Nelson: EQ I11 .E. +4 428
#note Missing (W)E for six.
>Jason: ORS 3H O. +6 392
>Ember_Nelson: Q -  +0 428
>Jason: RS H3 ...S +17 409
>Ember_Nelson: Q -  +0 428
>Jason: R 5C R.. +3 412
#note Shoulda played R(ODES) ... had nothing to lose. Once again, as happened a lot in Albany, the bag bails me out.
>Jason:  (Q) +20 432
