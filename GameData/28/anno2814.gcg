>Matt_Robin: ADEILNY 8H ADENYL +28 28
#note Never played Matt before, who had won his first twoi lower div tourneys in blowout fashion.  I was curious to see if he was for real, while wanting to keep him from being the youngest player to beat me in rated play, an honor currently held by Alex Fiszbein.  After the game, he mentioned he kept the I.  Nice play on his part... he's studied a bit, I saw right away.
>Pete: CEIOOSX 9I OXO +26 26
#note Bunch of plays all in the same ballpark equitywise... This finishes best.  I briefly considered COXES, but wanted to play for the first bingo.
>Matt_Robin: AEGM L4 GAME. +22 50
>Pete: CEIILNS 4F CEILIN.S +62 88
#note Only bingo.  Took a while before I gave up on cooler ones and looked through the G.
>Matt_Robin: JOU F2 JU.O +29 79
>Pete: BDFIKNR E5 BRINK +30 118
#note I decided to turn over an extra tile rather than play BIFID of BRINK K1 for a few more points.  Plus I didn't see a use of leaving an easy line quite yet.  BIFID wins sim... i didn't realize the power of the KNR leave.
>Matt_Robin: EIMRU 8A MURI.E +27 106
#note I wish I was this good when I played my third tourney.  I'd have probably fished no matter what the two unseen tiles were.
>Pete: DFPRRTY G3 P.D +22 140
#note Took forever on this turn, and still missed the star play of PREX, threatening a ton of points with the Y on 10J next turn.  I liked PED, because I figured that as bad as the leave was, there were likely scoring opps next turn with the F or Y.  at worst, there would likely be TURFY B7.  PREX, PREXY, and TURFY are best, in that order.
>Matt_Robin: IIII -?CEE +0 106
#note Matt exchanges 4 tiles.
>Pete: FLRRTUY B6 FL.TY +27 167
#note I totally missed the spots on column M, which had the cool plays.  I played FLUTY, figuring it would tue up the board abit, score well, and I'd get through the RRU leave eventually. FLURRY M7 and FUR 7H are best.
>Matt_Robin: AEIIIIS -  +0 106
#note Matt challenges.  
>Pete: ARRRRUU -RRRUU +0 167
#note Teach me to leave RRU.  My exchange of RRRUU is best, not surprisingly.
>Matt_Robin: ACEINO 6H ENCO.IA +19 125
#note Nice dump here... I thought he was trying to bait me with the nonexistent hooks... 
>Pete: AELRTTW M4 .T.L.WATER +91 258
#note This play either deserves huge props or an aisle seat on the plane to hell.  After looking in wain ffor a real bingo, and being upset about the lack of an N from TRAWLNET, I look for rack cleaning plays/fishes.  I see STILL M4, and then I see that leaves WATER.  I was about 85% sure it was no good... but he had already made a bad challenge, and had two zeros on his last three turns.  Besides, if it were good, I'd have never forgiven myself for chickening out on it.  He held for five minutes, muttering to himself that he thought it was good, and that it was just sick, until finally...
>Matt_Robin: EHP L10 PEH +32 157
#note He let it go.  
>Pete: EINOORW N9 OW +34 292
#note best.  I'd give him one shot to make a bingo hooking both of the words on column O before going into shutdown.  
>Matt_Robin: AEGHIO A1 HOAGIE +41 198
#note Gotta say, he made a lot of good plays, and turned over a bunch of tiles.  He could have panicked in a number of spots and got fish happy and he never did.  Unfortunately for him, his reward was not forthcoming this game...
>Pete: EINORST O7 STONIER +89 381
#note As I pull ST out of the bag for the clincher. best.
>Matt_Robin: ENTV C3 VENT +20 218
>Pete: ADEORRZ C8 .OARED +24 405
#note The seven didn't play, but I couldn't be too upset up 160. ADORER scores more, but ROARED sets up the R hook for a cool play starting with R on column A, or a big Z play on row 12.  
>Matt_Robin: ADF F7 D.AF +25 243
>Pete: AEIQRTZ 3J QI +24 429
#note best, and holding the ZE with ??SS unseen, not to mention a pretty strong bingo rack, considering a Z.
>Matt_Robin: AB G9 BA +24 267
>Pete: ?AERSTZ H10 gAZERS +77 506
#note I miss the sweet sweet bingo ERSATZES for 102.  GAZERS, while not pretty, worked alright tho.
>Matt_Robin: ?GISUUV 14J VUGS +30 297
>Matt_Robin: ?GISUUV --  -30 267
#note Yeah, I'm going to hell for this.  
>Pete: T K3 ..T. +14 520
#note I played alright with great tiles.  Matt played very well, al things considered.  I'd imagine this won't be his last time in a Michigan D1.
>Pete:  (GISUUV?) +20 540
