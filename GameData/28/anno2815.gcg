#note Woof; missed ABOIDEAu.
>Cathy: GNU 11H .UNG +14 112
>Phil: ADEGIIS D8 .IG +11 94
#note Tough little position, but this seems best.

>Phil: CENOQVY O14 Q. +11 169
#note Obviously not at E7, with so many E and O parachutes out there.

#note 9F EVE? halp
>Cathy: DEGINR 5E .RINGED +22 191
>Phil: DEEEERY 15A REDEYE +36 227
#note F2 EERY feels a little too volatile for me.
>Cathy: EFIY F2 FIE.Y +40 231
>Phil: AAEKOOT 13F OK. +27 254
#note H1 OAKEN is a pretty huge miss. Even stuff like TAKEN and TOKEN that I dismissed out of hand would've been smarter choices.
>Cathy: AFLMNU 12A MANFUL +33 264
#note Some of these players have some pretty sick pockets of word knowledge.
>Phil: AAEOTWW 14B WAW +36 290
#note That's probably the happiest I've ever been to play two tiles and draw two Ws.

>Cathy: BELT 4J BELT +19 316
>Phil: AEELMOR 3J OLEA +23 331
#note Spent about eight minutes on this play. The EMR leave looks like a poor conception in that pool but I really feel like she did BELT for a reason. Quackle wants to do 7B OM; I guess everything at this point is a coin flip anyway so why not? Is that the rationale here?
>Cathy: EPRT 2K PERT +25 341
>Phil: EHIMRSS C3 REMIS. +16 347
#note I will leave the proper sequence as an exercise for the reader. Burned too much clock on the previous turn and had it down to about 45 seconds when I threw this down in a mild panic. I also need to work on my mental arithmetic because I didn't realize that this ends in a tie after 4B VEEP.
>Cathy: AENNPTV 1M PAN +23 364
>Phil: HS N4 SH +12 359
#note Caught some nice breaks at the end there, but I guess that's how opens work.
