>Jason: CDIINTZ 8G ZIT +24 24
#note Play DITZ and quit succumbing to FPS. (-3.4)
>Karl_Higby: ?EHIRSV J2 tHRIVES +83 83

#note Missing C(H)ILD. (-)
>Karl_Higby: OX 10F OX +34 117
>Jason: CDDGINT 5G DIC.NG +20 67
#note Really close ... top five plays within .5%. This is among them and leads in valuation.
>Karl_Higby: AEL 4J .EAL +16 133
>Jason: ADGPTTY 11D GYP +23 90
#note PATTY/Y(CLAD) would've been nice, but this leads in wins. Again, four plays all around 20%, within .5% of each other. (-1.1)
>Karl_Higby: AEINNRR 2C INERRAN. +59 192
>Jason: ABDLMTT 1A BAM +25 115
#note B(A)AL(I)M? Whoa. A bunch of better plays. (-11.9)
>Karl_Higby: LOOW 1E WOOL +36 228

#note Missing DUNT, 3C. (-)
>Karl_Higby: EFK 6F KEF +28 256
>Jason: DNORTTU 4F TOD +19 160
#note UNTOat 12A is a slight leader in wins. Best in valuation.
>Karl_Higby: AF 3L FA +21 277
>Jason: ANPRTUW 2M PAW +21 181
#note (G)AWP: Same tiles played off, less chance of a big comeback play. (-5.3)
>Karl_Higby: AY 1N YA +35 312
>Jason: EJNORTU 12C JOE +31 212
#note Yes, I'm drawing into RUNT until it works. You can't stop me! I'm a donkey on edge!
>Karl_Higby: EIMOSTU 13E TIMEOUS +69 381
>Jason: DNORTUV H11 OV.RT +36 248
#note UDO at 13A is interesting and has a slight lead in wins, but I'm all about making my spread not-totally-embarrassing. For that purpose, this is best.
>Karl_Higby: ?EHORTU 15E OUT.HREw +60 441
#note Passing on (S)OUTHERn ... concerned of a comeback bingo down column A.
>Jason: DEEIINU 12J NUDIE +16 264
#note Eh, there's only a 50-50 chance he has the S, why not? Q says throw back all but DN. (-28.4)
>Karl_Higby: ABEN 11K BEAN +29 470
>Jason: AEIIINR C1 ...IA +7 271
#note Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Play off all three I's without giving him a Q spot. This message will self-destruct in five seconds. BI loses by 180 under optimal play, this by 184. (-4.0)
>Karl_Higby: EEGQS C12 .EE +20 490
#note He should play (YA)GS first. JEE is unblockable without giving up a Q play.
>Jason: EIINR A1 .I +4 275
#note (FA)RE loses by 186, (B)I by 181. So, even though FARE is CP's pick ... best?
>Karl_Higby: GQS N1 ..GS +20 510
>Jason: EINR C12 ...R +11 286
#note I maximize the endgame sequence.
