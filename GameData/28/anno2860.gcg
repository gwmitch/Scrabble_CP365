>Jason: FGOOOOX 8F GOOF +16 16
#note FPS or a clever setup? Q votes the latter! Whee!
>Joel_Horn: EMOU 9H MEOU +17 17
>Jason: AAIOOWX F7 A.IO +7 23
#note Q likes WOO at 9D, which I dismissed. IXIA/A(W) if my fish for EX at 10I goes wrong, maybe? (-6.5)
>Joel_Horn: ADQ K8 Q.AD +28 45
>Jason: ABINOWX L10 BOX +31 54
#note Q likes W(A)B at 10J. (-2.6)

>Joel_Horn: AEINSTT N3 INSTATE +64 144
>Jason: ?HINRSV 11A VaRNISH +80 178
#note Or SHRIVeN at E9, which I wasn't 100% on. (-1.9)
>Joel_Horn: IPRY A8 PRI.Y +51 195
#note Again, Joel's sighing and I think I may be able to be in good shape despite my rancid post-bingo draw, then he whips this out! Said he hated to part with the Y because of (VaRNISH)Y ... but it's 51! Sheesh.
>Jason: ALLMSUU M2 ULU +12 190
#note I liked this, in possession of two of the five hook tiles (not counting the blank). Q agrees.
>Joel_Horn: DEZ O1 ZED +43 238
>Jason: AAELMPS O7 MAE +31 221
#note Considered holding the E back, but with seven out, take the nine points. Q disagrees, hmph. (-1.4)

>Joel_Horn: CEHINOR 2F CHINE +33 292
#note If I'd played PASTELS, he had CHORINE!
>Jason: ?ACGGLT D8 CLA.G +22 327
#note G(I)G at E10 gets a slight edge. (-0.3)
>Joel_Horn: BFO L4 FOB +28 320
#note He's just not going away...
>Jason: ?EGIOOT B10 T.O +13 340
#note Tough call. A bunch of options, none of which score more than 18. I'm surprised there's such a clear-cut favorite: GOIT(R)E at 14I. I guess I can see it ... case O for row 15 play, case blank for a column O play, pool's benign enough that rack-blowing-up is OK. Never considered it. I'm looking to bingo through that R. (-16.4)
>Joel_Horn: EWY 13C WYE +30 350
#note Well, I found out where I lost the game ... challenge this off, bingo and I probably win easily. Thought I'd played well and done all I could do. Stoopid. I would know if CLANGIER* was good, too. Never considered it being phony. Dammit.
>Jason: ?DEGIOU 14F DOUGhIE. +63 403
#note Sure enough, wins sim but CP says there are better options, led by GOU(T) at E4. I hate, hate, hate bingoing with seven in the bag, esp. with this pool...
>Joel_Horn: EEINRRV 15A VERNIER +88 438
#note And that's why. He later saw he had NERVIER for nine more.
