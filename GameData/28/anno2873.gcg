#note Had no idea FIXIT didn't take an S until Q told me. Whoops.
>Jason: AAEINOT G7 A.O +14 153
#note Dammit, I'm opening up this mess of a board.
>Trix_Kout: GHUV F4 VUGH +20 157
>Jason: AAEINOT E6 AA +11 164
#note Ah yes, the always fun "play AO, draw AO"... Q likes (D)O(C). (-2.6)
>Trix_Kout: BG 5E B.G +22 179
#note Somehow I knew she'd have the case B...
>Jason: EIINOTW -IOW +0 164
#note Right now I'd rather have my wisdom teeth extracted sans anesthetic. Q likes WE at F9. Too fixated on trying to get the first bingo? I am up after WE and her options are limited, too. (-5.3)
>Trix_Kout: AL F9 LA +13 192
>Jason: EEIINNT K8 INT... +12 176
#note OK, seriously ... not cool. Q appreciates my creative board-opener, even if it is probably laughing at me for 176 in 10 turns.
>Trix_Kout: ?AELP H1 LEAPs +33 225
#note Oy vey...
>Jason: EEFINTW L8 FE +20 196
#note WTF am I doing blocking the line I just opened? WTF am I doing not playing WIFE for five more ... better leave, another lane. The stuff you ask yourself annotating games from eight-nine months ago... (-7.1)
>Trix_Kout: JY 3G J.Y +25 250
>Jason: EEINOTW M9 WOE +20 216
#note I hate feeling like I need to pick the unseen blank or S to win, but that's where I am. Best.
>Trix_Kout: GOO 1H .OGO +5 255
>Jason: EIIKNRT C9 KI.. +13 229
#note Ducky says take the points with TINKER at N9. (-5.3)
>Trix_Kout: IL D8 LI +9 264

#note Again, take the points. TITMEN. (-6.2)
>Trix_Kout: MORWY 2K WORMY +31 295
>Jason: EEINRTT O1 T.E +18 260
#note I saw TENTIER at N9 if I got the E on the fish. When I drew the E, I looked again and thought: "Stupid! TENTIER doesn't fit, there's only six spaces." Uh, yeah, it kinda does fit. Note to self: Learn to count to seven. This may be a good time to mention that my rating was in the 1500s entering this game. (-55.9)
>Trix_Kout: A 10B A. +9 304
>Jason: ?DEINRT N5 pRINTED +75 335
#note Passed on the stuff at N9 ... didn't want to give up a juicy -S hook. (-9.5)
>Trix_Kout: EINPRUU O7 NU +14 318
#note Whoa! The best play is a one-pointer! U(p) leaves PUNIER/R(AI) as the out and blocks my best play.
>Jason: ILOSTV 4J VIOLS +24 359
#note Ah, for the open O... It's OK. I'd played vOLOSTS a couple weeks earlier at the Petoskey tournament.
>Trix_Kout: EIPRU A7 PIER +21 339
>Jason: T 7M T.. +4 363
#note I shouldn't need to get so lucky at the end to win that game. But except for whiffing on TENTIER, I didn't make a double-digit mistake. Thoughts?
>Jason:  (U) +2 365
