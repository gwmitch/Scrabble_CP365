>Jason: BCDDNST -BCDD +0 0
#note A bit of an ominous start to the day. I swear, you look at six consonants, the odds that the seventh one is also rise to like 90%.
>John_Morse: AGNTY 8H TANGY +26 26
#note I must've been nervous, as I was such a space cadet. I knew I was going first, yet I drew my line down Player 2's column. Then I put this play/score under my column; I'd forgot to record the exchange. I also had a three-rack stretch where I forgot to write my racks down and had to piece them together from memory. That's like automatic for me!
>Jason: ENOPSST 7L OPS +13 13
#note Missing STEPSON. I know I've missed GRANDSO(N) before, too... (-)
>John_Morse: CNOO 6L COON +24 50
>Jason: EEINOST H8 .EOSINTE +77 90
#note My thought process: "Damn, he blocked ESSONITE. Damn, he blocked ESSONITE. Damn, he blocked ESSONITE. Oh wait, I have TEOSINTE, which I should've played anyway."
>John_Morse: ACEILR K8 .LACIER +20 70
#note I love the ECLAIR anamonic: "BOTH DUMPY GUVS NOSH."
>Jason: AAEEEGV 14J G.AVE +26 116
#note Didn't know G(R)EAVE. But this will work out. (-9.7)

>Jason: AEINQRR G12 QI +26 209
#note Losing equity, but shutting down the -S lane. I'd play this again. (-7.8)
>John_Morse: DE L4 DE... +22 122
>Jason: ADELNRR K3 RAD +17 226
#note Q likes DARN(E)L at 5H. Meh. I don't mind setting up row 2 or 14 and column B or N bingos; give me the triple coming back. (-6.0)
>John_Morse: IW J6 WI. +14 136
>Jason: EILNORV 2J VOILE +37 263

#note Missing ROM(A)N at I5. (-6.5)
>John_Morse: IP 9F PI.. +7 177
>Jason: ABENORT 13M AB. +26 315
#note I seemed to be making a lot of plays like this, cute little decently scoring plays that didn't open anything new. My board vision was pretty good all week. I prefer this to REBATO at 8A, given the fishing. (-4.5)
>John_Morse: GI O4 GI. +6 183
>Jason: EKNORTY F13 KYE +25 340
#note KEYNOT(E)R, eh? Never would've guessed. (-46.2)

#note TRIUN(E)'s a tick better. (-2.7)

>Jason: ?AHNTUU 15A UH +20 386
#note HU(R)T at 12A leads in valuation. (-2.7)
>John_Morse: EF 3M FE +28 252
>Jason: ?ANRTUW 12A WA.N +22 408
#note TU(R)N is the clear valuation leader. (-7.5)
>John_Morse: S K8 .......S +11 263
>Jason: ?ADRTUX 11E eX +30 438
#note sTRA(W) or ThRA(W) is 20 better.
>John_Morse: ?ADENOS A8 ENDO. +27 290
>Jason: ADRTU B5 TURD +10 448
#note Missed DURA. Not a game for the highlight reel, but it got the job done. (-3.0)
>John_Morse: ?AS J1 A.eS +11 301
#note Took the free challenge. Wasn't 100% on it. k(V)AS is one more.
