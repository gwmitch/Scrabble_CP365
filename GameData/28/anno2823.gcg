#note I got way too carried away with dumping excess consonants here. I didn't know OBTECT, which plays at 14A and sims best, but BOD C12 is way better since it scores a lot more and BOTTS N6, while burning the S, is an even better score and a good leave, too. I'm just not scoring enough here... that should have been obvious. -11
