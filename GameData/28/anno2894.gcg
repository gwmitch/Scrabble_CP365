>Jason: ?ENOVWZ 8D WOVEN +30 30
#note I thought this was one of the more interesting opening racks I've had in a while. VOW? Or burn the blank for ZOWiE? ZONE? Then I saw WOVEN and concluded this rack wasn't as interesting as I thought.
>Chris_Lipe: AAELORR 7H AREOLAR +61 61
>Jason: ?EPQUYZ 9B QUEY +27 57
#note Q likes Z(E)P at J6. I figure this play is the more urgent one; Z(E)P or ZAP/ZEP/ZIP at 6F is likely to be there next turn. (-13.7)
>Chris_Lipe: EEGHMRT 6J RHEME +33 94
#note "Bad Boy" fives Chris has played on me in the tourney: 4.
>Jason: ?DIIPUZ 6F ZIP +39 96
>Chris_Lipe: BGGTTTY -IIIIII +0 94
>Jason: ?DDDITU J6 ..DID +11 107
#note Missed DIT at 5I. Fortunately I'd cash in there next turn to minimize the damage. (-11.1)
>Chris_Lipe: CEFILTX I9 XI +37 131
>Jason: ?ADNOTU 5K ODA +29 136
#note Missing two nines: OUTgNA(WE)D and UND(ER)cOAT. Best among plays humans not named Nigel Richards or Adam Logan can find. (-20.6)
>Chris_Lipe: CEEFLTT 7C FET +22 153
#note FETTLE at F10, maybe?
>Jason: ??ANOTU 11C NOUgATs +69 205
#note Q says to be ballsy and play through the Q. Saw e(Q)UATiON, missed a(Q)UATONe. But given what I drew post-bingo, I'm kind of glad I did. Although after AQUATONE, I'm almost guaranteed to have something in one of the spots. I guess if I knew AQUATONE, I'd have played it. (-10.2)
>Chris_Lipe: BCELSTV 12A BLEST +28 181
#note Especially given that the other three are unseen, he's got to have an S, right?
>Jason: DFHIJUW F3 WHI. +19 224
#note Whiffed on WHIF(F). (-19.8)
>Chris_Lipe: CEILNRV 5C CIV.L +22 203
>Jason: DFJKNRU A12 .UNK +30 254
#note FUJ(I) at D2. (-3.8)
>Chris_Lipe: EINRTTT G10 T.T +3 206
>Jason: DEFIJRR 13F JERRID +21 275
#note I felt like I was going to make Chris have to bingo through the W (never an easy task with both blanks gone, even after a fish) to win.
>Chris_Lipe: AEGINRT 3F .ATERING +78 284
#note OMG, he has no S?
>Jason: ACFMNOU 12J MOC +21 296
#note I punted with this play and that's the wrong move. I couldn't bite the bullet on plays like FOU or FON because of the juicy -S hook they created. I've got to play Chris for an S (math says he's got at least one 70-75% of the time). As it turned out, though, Chris' rack is such that I was probably dead no matter what I played. (-21.4)
>Chris_Lipe: BEEEGIS 14J BEIGE +45 329
#note Or BEIGES for 44 at O1 if I'd made a decent play. I'd lost this game with five double-digit mistakes in the first seven turns.
>Jason: AFINNSU 15F FAUNS +32 328
#note I made a good pre-endgame play! That'll stop some of the equity hemorrhaging.
>Chris_Lipe: AEOOSSY O11 EYASS +45 374
#note "Bad Boy" fives Chris has played on me in the tourney: 5, and the last. These people who know their fives make me sick...
>Jason: AAGILNP -  +0 328
#note Noooooooooooo!!! I can win without the desperation challenge! LI at 2G sets up PAGAN for 45 and enough given his last rack. Dammit, dammit, dammit! Oh well. That's tough to see and given how this is my last loss of the main event in round 18, I can't be too upset.
>Chris_Lipe: OOO 14A .OO +6 380
#note As we came back and Chris picked his last tile, I said: "If you want to switch to tic-tac-toe, I'll understand." He looked at the board for a while, then started frantically shuffling, getting a laugh out of me and Joel Horn. I saw OO(T) for three more.
>Jason: AAGILNP 2K PIAL +21 349
#note Missing APIAN. Perhaps an implication by a certain stinkeroo/something I said to Kurt Davies in our Albany game last year came to pass: "I get distracted when I have sexy opponents!" (-12.0)
>Chris_Lipe: O 12N O. +5 385
#note (T)O(R), a tough spot, for seven.
>Chris_Lipe:  (AGN) +8 393
