>Pete: AIIMTVW 8G VIM +16 16
#note Before this game, I had played Chuck Armstrong 5 times.  He beat me five times... usually in bludgeonings.  I feel like I've improved since our last game, but I knew I'd need some good luck and good play.  So my first rack has IIVW... sheesh.  Duck likes VAW, but I stand by getting rid of the double I's... Ws don't scare me early in the game.  
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEV 7I AVE +12 12
#note When making this play, Chuck mentioned something to the effect that he was just opening it up for me.  I immediately worried that he was about to bingo next turn.
>Pete: AEILTWY 6F WILY +26 42
#note WILY cleaned the trash from the rack, but leaves the K and L lines wide open... Duck likes TAWIE just a tiny bit better than WILY.  
>Chuck_Armstrong: ADQ G3 QAD. +24 36
>Pete: AAEORRT 5D ORA. +15 57
#note so after in my mind dodging a bullet, I manage to miss a ridiculously hi prob bingo.  ORAD is the best nonbingo, but I don't believe I lost my patience and stopped looking.  I still need to not give up on racks with clucky one pointers.
>Chuck_Armstrong: IIIII -IIIII +0 36
#note Chuck exchanges 5.  
>Pete: ABCEMRT K5 CR.MATE +44 101
#note I was pleased with my play here until I told Chuck my rack postgame, and he saw the bingo immediately.  I also missed some cool plays starting horizontally at 4D that I'm still nowhere near good enough to see... MACABRE woulda been sweet. 
>Chuck_Armstrong: BIOT H1 OBIT +35 71
>Pete: ?BEHLLN 10D HeLLBEN. +66 167
#note I found the only bingo.  This is the kind of find that makes me love scrabble... i've not studied it, and it was an ugly rack... I'm proud of this one.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EGO 4C EGO +16 87
>Pete: AFIIINT 11B NAIF +27 194
#note Duck likes the dumps over the points.  INIA is best, and I should have taken it, but I was afraid of big scores on row 12.  
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEHP 12A HEAP +46 133
#note Which I proceeded to give up anyways.
>Pete: AIILNTU A12 .ILI +21 215
#note I was hoping he'd open a spot for NAUTILI.  MIAUL clearly best.  I just wanted to dump the I's.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?EOSSTU 12G lOTUSES +76 209
#note I figured he'd have to bingo eventually.  to still be leading afterwards was a bit heartening.

>Pete: ADENTUY 8K .AYED +36 251
#note Missed bingo number 3... I was so focused on the ones through the S not fitting that I didn't look for the easy one thru the O.  BOUYED H10 woulda been sweet. 
>Chuck_Armstrong: EJT 6B JET +30 239
>Pete: INOOSTU 2H .OUTONS +22 273
#note Duck hates this play but I liked it, and so did Chuck, in our post-mortem.  I had to clean the rack, and I figured chuck had another bingo in him, so I wanted to score, and take my chances to draw some of the good stuff left.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEINORT O6 OR.INATE +60 299
#note My play kept chuck from the far better scoring bingoes to the triple... an unintended but pleasant consequence.
>Pete: CDIOSUX 1L DOUX +51 324
#note Best.  My turnover play works, drawing the X and the case S, and DOUX was a pleasant way to retake the lead.

>Chuck_Armstrong: ENRZ H10 .R.NZE +51 350
#note But he's Chuck freanking Armstrong so he makes a sweet play with the Z.  Dude's good.
>Pete: ACIKRSU 14J KAURIS +50 374
#note This rack took me forever to figure out.  KAURIS wins almost exactly 50% of the time, nothing else close.  After I played it, Chuck held me, which got me amazingly nervous.  When he didn't release for a couple of minutes, I realized that he must have some serious crap on his rack, and that I might actually win this one.
>Chuck_Armstrong: DEGGNPR N6 DE.P +24 374
#note Best.
>Pete: CEFIW 3A FEW +28 402
#note WE is better, since chuck can't go out... but with the win in hand, I wasn't fooling around... take the points and run.
>Chuck_Armstrong: GGNR L7 R.G +14 388
>Pete: CI B9 CI.. +8 410
#note Missing ICE for two more, but not particularly caring.  
>Pete:  (GN) +6 416
