>Sue_Gable: ACER 8G CARE +12 12
>Jason: DEFGIIR K3 FRIGID +30 30
#note A word used in "Dylan's Dads"! Q likes the K7 placement instead. (-0.9)
>Sue_Gable: AIO G8 .IAO +7 19
>Jason: BCEEOUV 4I CU.VE +20 50
#note OEUV(R)E would've been cooler. (A)BOVE is best. Boy, four-vowel sixes were quite the stumbling block for me. (-1.6)
>Sue_Gable: HO F9 OH +28 47
>Jason: BBEEOOT N1 BOOTEE +31 81
#note Missed EBBET at H11. (-0.2)
>Sue_Gable: AEW O1 AWE +37 84
>Jason: ABINRTZ O6 RITZ +41 122
#note Weird that this late, we just see our first power tile. They're about to come in bunches. Q prefers NAZI. (-2.9)
>Sue_Gable: ILRV H5 VIR.L +11 95
>Jason: ?ABFNQS H11 SQuAB +77 199
#note "You're going to town with those power tiles," Sue said. Then I see ?S as my first two replacement tiles. "Oh dear," I thought, feeling guilty.
>Sue_Gable: MPRT 13F TR.MP +12 107
>Jason: ?AEFMNS E3 FAMiNES +76 275
#note "Sorry," I said as I put this down. "There is no justice," Sue said, not meanly. "That's probably what 20 people who finished below me in the main event are saying," I said. "Couldn't happen to a nicer guy," she said. Aww... FLAMENS scores six more at E4 and, surprisingly, F(RITZ) leads in valuation. (-5.8)
>Sue_Gable: DHL 4C DH.L +16 123
#note I said I'd support Sue if she petitioned the rules committee with her idea: If rating difference is greater than 200, lower-rated player gets both blanks. 
>Jason: EGKNOSY C4 .ONKEY +23 298
#note Missed (H)OKEY, which would've been sweet. (-16.8)
>Sue_Gable: AET F2 TA.E +15 138
>Jason: AEGIORS 11E GO.. +16 314
#note Doubted myself on the clearly superior GO(OS)IER. (-10.9)
>Sue_Gable: EENOPU 14B EUPNOE. +28 166
#note At this point, Sue was probably wishing she could draw vowels and consonants at the same time. She ended up finishing 6-4 (including a win over Kantimathi right after this) and gaining back all the points she lost in the ME. Good on her.
>Jason: AAEIRSU 14J AUREI +20 334
>Sue_Gable: ILSTT 1F STILT +20 186
>Jason: ADGISUX 13B AX +38 372
>Sue_Gable: JW M3 J.W +51 237
>Jason: ADGINSU 3E ..D +9 381
#note Missing AUDINGS. Fishing for the N for GUANINS/S(AX) or GUANIN(E)S. I'd be better off doing it at F6. (-42.2)
>Sue_Gable: DILNNOY 10K DOILY +28 265
>Jason: AEGINSU A7 GUINEAS +87 468
#note Oh hey, the E works if she doesn't block.
>Jason:  (NN) +4 472
