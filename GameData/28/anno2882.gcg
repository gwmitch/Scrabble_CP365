#note Was happy to see this, as it beat option B: Deliberately phony and hope he gave me an E for MOVELIKE*. :)
>Jesse_Day: GIOOSTZ E5 OOZ. +26 26
>Jason: EMORTWW F4 MEW +31 65
>Jesse_Day: AGGIPST 9A GIGAS +29 55
#note a pretty interesting move. I thought about GIG at G7 for a while, but the points eventually seemed too good to pass up. quackle disagrees entirely. I drop my bingo chances by 20% or so and then in turn make it easier for him to bingo by opening the board. GIG keeps things tight, especially if he lacks the hook letters. The general principle is that it's generally unwise to open the board while leaving yourself a bad leave. I think I agree with quackle in retrospect. Another interesting thing is that I took long enough on this play that he deduced that I didn't have another S. An interesting game theory situation.
>Jason: ?EHORTW A7 rE.ROWTH +104 169
#note Gutsy, yeah, but like I said about my ?ELMRSU opening rack vs. Dackman, I'd rather try to win a game of coinflips instead of a game of skill against a player of Jesse's ability. Plus, the amount of time Jesse took to play GIGAS told me he didn't have an S. The only other bingo I saw was WORTH(I)Er, 37 points worse. In hindsight, I should've played this quicker than I did. (-0.1)
>Jesse_Day: ACFNPTU D1 CAPUT +27 82
#note turn over tiles and open the board. took me a while to see this.
>Jason: ADQRSTU 15A SQUAD +93 262
#note Can't get any luckier than that. And QU(A)DRATS doesn't count in the missed bingo tally.
>Jesse_Day: EFNNSTY G7 F.N +11 93
#note so close. This move is maybe an exaggeration. I was just trying to keep the board very volatile and minimize turnover. I don't think quackle's win percentages are accurate here because I will need to bingo multiple times, and quackle fails to take into account board conditions in calculating those percentages. FENNY is out because I will need to hit SQUADRON to come back in all likelihood. FINNY at G7 and WYNN at 12A are quackle's other two favorites. Maybe FIN is over the top, especially with 4 Ns unseen which would make FINNY a better play.
>Jason: BEEGIRT 1C I.EBERG +36 298
#note JI: Really wanted to stop trip-trip potential but saw nothing decent through the C or the A until this jumped out at me out of nowhere. For a brief second, I thought: "I can haz first 600 game?"
#note JD: wow. great play.
>Jesse_Day: DEENSTY 2D .NY +31 124
>Jason: AINPTUU 13A .UTU +8 306
#note JI: Ooh, P(rEGROWTHS)! Among the non-6A plays (PIU being clearly best), this is decent, although (O)PUNTIA, which I nearly played, is second. (-12.0)
#note JD: I think OPUNTIA is a lot better. Take out lanes (the one on row 14 gets taken out by TUTU, sure, but that one's less valuable), score guaranteed points and end the game faster.
>Jesse_Day: DEEELST J1 STEELED +75 199
#note JI: Ooh, this board has comeback potential...
#note JD: ok, now for another couple of bingos
>Jason: ACIOOPY 5H PO.ICY +26 332
#note "Hey, wait!" you may think. "Didn't he keep an N?" I overdrew, Jesse saw NOP and threw the N back. Still missing 6A plays, but I'm more annoyed over not seeing COPAY at 10F, far more defensive. I deserve a bigger equity hit than what Q's giving me. (-5.9)
>Jesse_Day: BEFIILL 3I B.LIEF +28 227
#note JI: (Gulp.)
#note JD: trying to give myself a chance...
>Jason: AEIJMOT 2M MOA +24 356
#note Mainly *gulp* because it's not out of the realm of possibility to see a *AS***** trip-trip. Q says make a J play at 10F (JO or JOTA, preferably) and stop being a defensive weenie. (-21.5)
>Jesse_Day: ILNNOSX 12D XI +36 263
#note JI: He's not going away, is he?
#note JD: Playing this instead of OX up top for a reason...
>Jason: AEEIJRT 10F JEE +33 389
#note JET leads in valuation and win %, but each are super-close. Counted as 34. (-0.9)
>Jesse_Day: ELNNORS 15A .....RON +54 317
#note JI: I held onto the R because there were bunches of O's and N's for (SQUAD)RON. Jesse insta-plays this and I say "Genius! He can hit it, too!", thinking "You moron!" Jesse laughed.
#note JD: aww. poor jason needs to take it easy on himself. quackle agrees with my decision to pass up the bingo, but still only gives me a 6.5% chance of winning.
>Jason: AAIIRTV I10 RIATA +17 406
#note For the first time in a while, I'm confronted with the real possibility of losing a game I've led by 180, esp. with ?S out in an unbelievably good-looking pool for bingos (except for there only being one E), as you can see. I then promptly choke and miss TRIVIA in this spot. (-7.0)
>Jesse_Day: ELNNOOS C3 ON +14 331
#note JI: Can't remember what Jesse said his leave was here, but I remember it was potent. LORES, LONES, something like that. Jesse said he probably should've turned over more tiles to try for the blank, but little does he know I just picked it.
#note JD: yep, LONES. this is a big, big mistake. I'm kind of upset at it in retrospect. Maybe I was hung up on UNLOOSEN. Quackle comes up with a couple of great looking plays, both of which turn over 5 tiles - perfect because it means that any block of his empties the bag and gives me a much better shot at the blank. The first is IONONE at 11I which looks great. It sets up the last S and leaves a spot that could be tricky to block as long as he doesn't have the V. However, I think quackle overvalues it by not blocking the S hook, when any block there should win the game, even with a potential bingo on row 13. Maybe better is COLONE at L5, which sets up a lane that, while tricky to hit, can't really be blocked. COLON at that spot is worse because of tempo, I think. Frustrating to make two mistakes up to this point and then make such a bad play. I clearly have a ton of work to do before I can play a good preendgame.
>Jason: ?ADINRV 12H V.RIA +24 430
#note Pleasantly surprised to see I didn't miss a bingo. This play's mediocre, but it's among the guaranteed or near-guaranteed wins. (-14.2)
>Jesse_Day: DELNOST K11 L. +4 335
#note LI couldn't find a fish that worked. My best chance is to try to hit ASTONIED for spread purposes, and playing short at K11 has the added bonus of blocking some of his bingos (HANDRAIL, HARIANAS were the two I saw). The spread play is evidently OLD at 11K, which makes perfect sense. Low on time and thought I would at least try to steal the game with a lot of luck.
>Jason: ?AADHNR O1 D.sH +44 474
#note JI: Missed DARsHAN, but if Jesse had seen it, he'd have blocked it with (A)L. Meanwhile, I know I have to block (A)STONIED. "He didn't even look!" Jesse said as I insta-played this. "When you took more than thirty seconds to play, I knew the L wasn't in the bag," I said.
#note JD: More great play from Jason. I guess OLD is better because it also blocks DARSHAN, but that's a tough find.
#note JI: Only Jesse can call a play "great" when it loses 93 spread points. :) Why are you being so nice to me?
>Jesse_Day: DEINOST O1 ....IEST +33 368
#note JI: TOD at 11E is two better. But this is pretty cute.
#note JD: low on time and this looked reasonable.
>Jason: AANR N6 NA +10 484
#note R(AN) at J12 scores one more.
>Jesse_Day: DNO 11F OD +21 389
#note The best out is 10 better, but I had less than 10 seconds left and Jesse thought I might go over.
>Jason: AR 6H AR. +9 493
#note (Y)AR is five better. Who knew I set up a better out for myself?
>Jason:  (N) +2 495
