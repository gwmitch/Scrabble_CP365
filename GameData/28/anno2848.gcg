#note Should be gutsy and slot it for the lucrative -S hook with the blank. (-0.2)
>Roy_Kamen: AEW 7G WAE +25 25
>Jason: ?BDDNOR 9E BOD +26 48
#note Surprised Q likes ROB, same spot. (-3.6)

#note Only playable seven. OV(ER)mINED is also a possibility. A close second to this is passing on the bingo and playing VO(I)D for 30 at 12A.

>Jason: AEINRRW 15F WAIR +36 182
#note I'm feeling good here. Up 50, he's got a random rack, I'm drawing into the nice ENR ...
>Roy_Kamen: AEINNOT K5 ANOINTE. +86 218
#note Ooh, my life still sucks. (Scored as 82.)
>Jason: ACEGMNR L4 CRAM +24 206
#note Missed plays along row six hooking the A to WED and G(R)AN, putting the N between BO and NET. (I'd see the spot later, too late to use it.) Q's pick is (I)MAGE, which I discarded. 20-28-1 C/V/B ratio makes me nervous drawing into CNR. (-7.6)
>Roy_Kamen: FIX 10H FIX. +30 248
>Jason: EEGNORY 6F YON +25 231
#note Didn't know GY(R)ON or see the BONNET spot. Didn't know enough to hold back the N.

>Jason: ?DEEGRU 9J E.G +13 244
#note Q likes GUDE at J2. I can see that. (-2.9)
>Roy_Kamen: APP 5E PAP +30 278
#note Dammit! POWED* is no good. I wondered.
>Jason: ?ADERUU -UU +0 244
#note Ooh! Missed U(NA)U! (-6.6)

>Jason: ?AEGIKR I4 KA +16 283
#note Thought this was cute. He hits me with H1 plays and he's opening a bingo line. Plus, still three S's to draw. (Little did I know I'd get them all...) Q likes KAE at 2A. (-6.1)

>Jason: ?DERSTU M9 STUDiER +72 381
#note Gotta like making the blank an I and putting it in a semi-open spot with the Q still out. Q likes SpURTED a little better, refusing to recognize my 1843 skillz. :) (-1.6)
>Roy_Kamen: AEEIOTV 4L .OTE +7 357
#note Put down (C)OAT, saw the big QU(A) comeback, and picked it up to do this. Seeing I had no Q comeback, I said "nice play." Then seeing he set up the VI(T)AE out, I corrected myself. "Damn nice play." COVE is one better though, under optimal play from me, which won't happen.
>Jason: LNQSUU 12B Q. +11 392
#note Adam Logan saw part of my post-mortem with Greenspan (I showed him the ALMUDE circumstances) and this post-mortem, too. It took him less than five seconds to see a better play: LUN(E)S, blocking the only out. Didn't think. Even Q(i)S is two better. (-10.0)
