#note (Sorry, Noah.)  I didn't like FOR, didn't see FROUZ(y), so I thought playing a phony was best.  Second best equity wise anyway.  :)  He thought it was plausible.  I, admittedly, less so.  He joked he's familiar with the one his mom REALLY wouldn't like him saying.  :)

#note Just wanted to play this cool word for once.  Way off base, though.  I SAW ZONAR(Y), so why couldn't I see ZONAR(y)?  Blank makes things so sticky.
