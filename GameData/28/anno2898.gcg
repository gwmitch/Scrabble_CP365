>Roy_Kamen: AADLMW 8D WADMAL +32 32
>Jason: EEINOTX 9G OX +24 24
#note Too defensive. OXIDE or DOXIE through the D. (-6.5)
>Roy_Kamen: CEIV 10E VICE +28 60
>Jason: EEINNTU E7 N.E.I +16 40
#note Or (V)ENUE. (-0.6)
>Roy_Kamen: HM D11 HM +19 79
>Jason: DEINTTU 11H DUNITE +26 66
#note Highest in valuation. Slightly better in wins is (HI)T.
>Roy_Kamen: BNT M10 B.NT +12 91
>Jason: FGIOOQT C11 GOOF +27 93
>Roy_Kamen: GIST 15A GIST +27 118
>Jason: ?EEIQTV N9 QI +19 112
#note In hindsight, being less ballsy and playing it by itself at K10 is clearly best. Dunno why I didn't. (-5.9)
>Roy_Kamen: DIR O8 RID +29 147
>Jason: ?EEPTVW 7H WEPT +29 141
>Roy_Kamen: AAAA -AAAA +0 147
>Jason: ?AEIPVZ F6 ZE. +35 176
#note I scared myself a little by seeing VAPORIZE through the right letters. Since they're not there, Q says VA(N)E at 7C is the play, probably setting up ZA for 64. I gotta get better at seeing stuff like that. (-3.0)
>Roy_Kamen: ?AEENRS 14H NEARESt +73 220
>Jason: ?ABIOPV 13G BOP +22 198
#note VIA (Q's pick), OVA or AVO at 15F. I considered that, but hated the ?BIP leave. (-7.1)
>Roy_Kamen: DEU 15F DUE +21 241
>Jason: ?AEINOV K1 InNOVA.E +70 268
>Roy_Kamen: AACFGLU 1H FAC.AL +36 277
#note Roy ran this rack after the game and said this was his losing play. FAUC(I)AL is Speedy's pick, which we discussed, but he was disappointed in missing CALIF (as one from Calif.). It certainly makes it harder for me to bingo.
>Jason: EEEIKNY 2F KYE +25 293
#note I'm thinking: "(FACIAL)LY?" He could well have it, too. Nowhere near certain enough to fish for it. E(EL)Y/(OX)Y woulda been sweet. (-3.2)
>Roy_Kamen: GJU 7M JUG +25 302
#note Glad to see the last power tile go. Roy thinks this play might've cost him, too.
>Jason: EEILNSS N1 SEL +18 311
#note Scores decently, good leave, kills FACIALLY. Drawing into SINE with three A's, four R's and two T's out seems like a good proposition. Q likes ES at 3G for 15. (-1.2)
>Roy_Kamen: ORT 4J R.OT +8 310
>Jason: AEINORS 3B ERASION +84 395
#note Not gonna lie ... I said a little prayer asking this to stay open.
>Roy_Kamen: AAHILRT 2B HAT +26 336
#note HIT at 4D for 31. (Scored as 28.)
>Jason: ORUY 15N OY +16 411
#note Missing R(EL)Y/(OX)Y again. (-12.0)
>Roy_Kamen: AILR O2 RAIL +9 345
>Roy_Kamen:  (RU) +4 349
