>Joe_Dackman: DDEEGTU D4 DUET.ED +18 18
#note Joe overdrew on his opening rack; I looked at EGX and threw back the X. (Q says put the E back.) "How many you get for that?" he asked. I said I hadn't counted yet, and realized that I'd made a mistake; I should've finished my turn because now I could alter TEAWArE's position with knowledge of his rack. Not that I would, but still. Then I felt scuzzier when I picked the X on my draw. Then he goes DUET(T)... and I (thinking DUETTING) said "I knew I was letting you bing ... oh." Other than that, our opening plays were perfectly kosher. (rolls eyes)
>Jason: DENNORX C1 REDOX +38 108
#note Missed (E)XON at E8. (-21.8)
>Joe_Dackman: ABF 1A BA.F +39 57
#note After the game, Joe asked if I knew Alex Jaech. I said in name only. "You're him squished about six inches," he said. "Or he's you stretched out about six inches." Anyone who know him care to comment?

#note Scared of the S?
>Jason: ILLLOST 15F .LL +9 191
#note Didn't like LILO at K10, but Q does. (-4.3)

>Joe_Dackman: AEIILNR L5 AIRLINE +63 193
#note *This* is the great word knowledge I'm supposed to be intimidated by? :) Seriously, I'm stunned he's still power tile-less.
>Jason: LORRSTU 12K .RT +22 239
#note Nice time to pick two R's.
>Joe_Dackman: IJO F6 JI.O +27 220
>Jason: ALORSTU N6 TORULAS +65 304
#note The finish line's in sight...
>Joe_Dackman: AEGM O5 GAME +33 253
>Jason: AEEFMUV M1 FAUVE +24 328
#note Gah! Debated between this or VUM at K3, didn't see FAUVE at 14K, clearly best. Doesn't open the board for bingo or Z plays. (-9.6)
>Joe_Dackman: ENS 5A NE..S +24 277
#note Nice. I may have to just outrun the bingo.
>Jason: EEIIMTZ 1M .IZ +45 373
#note Fortunately I've picked the Z to help me do just that. EM at N1 is an interesting gambit ... sets up ZIT for 86 if unblocked and therefore leads in valuation, though lags a little in win %. (-9.7)
>Joe_Dackman: NV 2L V.N +16 293
>Jason: DEEIMTY A4 E.EMY +33 406
#note Missed E(N)MITY, but who cares? The upset's official. (-8.8)
>Joe_Dackman: ?CIORST 3E OCTRoIS +61 354
#note Somebody will appreciate that ORg(A)STIC is among the bingos that score one more. But he overscored this by one anyway, so it's a wash. Said he was fishing for the challenge ... but it was an out play. As Knappster might say: "?SSQXZ to ?SSJ. A nice even draw." lol
