#note I need to study more.  It shouldn't take me so long to find bingos like this.

#note Many higher scoring plays in that spot, but I have to be mindful of the triple.
>Quackle: ACOQRSS 10H SACS +29 428
#note Indeed, I was right to worry:  Both blanks and all four S's.  *sigh*
#note I've observed that Quackle's Championship Player is quite vulnerable to Q-stick gambits.
#note If it thought more like a human, it would probably have played 4J QA(T)S and coasted home.
>Ross: DEGIJTW 10N T. +4 365
#note Quackle prefers 9M JI(B) to stick the Q.  I figured I'd need the J and I for points later.
#note The main reason why the Quackle simulator logic is vulnerable to Q-sticks is that it sees plays like JI(B) and doesn't see plays like T(I) that are so low in static valuation that they fall below its cutoff.
>Quackle: NOQR 5J ON +13 441
>Ross: DEGIJW J4 J.. +13 378
#note This is the best remaining spot for the J alone, and could be taken if I don't play here first.
#note B10 JE(U) scores more points, but eats up the valuable E.
>Quackle: QR 8H .R +8 449

#note The other thought was 1L (V)IE to set up 1L (VIE)W.  However, that eats up all of the vowels.
