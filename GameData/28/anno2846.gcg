>Jason: AEILOOS 6I O.IA +7 21

>Jason: DEILNOS 9B INDOLES +68 89

>Jason: ?BEILNS L8 BErLINS +84 297
#note Missed (G)LIBNESs. In the post-mortem, Randy pointed to this play and said "I thought I was in trouble after this. "Yeah, I thought you were, too," I said. (-5.7)
>Randy_Greenspan: CDEFNP 2I FEC.ND +36 236
#note Put down P(E)ND at 5K. If he hits his clock, I play STUDY/(PEND)S for 35, lead by 112, and am in great, great shape. But he picked it up, looked harder and found this. Hmph.

#note I'm hearing footsteps...
>Jason: BIIRSTT 8L .RIT +18 341

#note Thought I had him. He saw this with about 19 seconds left. grrr...
