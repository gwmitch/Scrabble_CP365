#note That morning, Sam was talking to Winter. "You play a SOWPODS five against me, I hold and let it go because it gives me a spot for my Q, but do I see that in your blog? Nooo... It's 'Sam let me phony on him.' I don't mind letting a Collins phony past when it's a Collins player, but to you it's just another phony!" Debbie Stegman and I were laughing throughout.
