#note Randy talked a lot about this play after the game -- he referred to it as the turning point of the game. TOT in the same spot, he later realized, is a lot better.
>Evans: ?DJLOYZ 7M JO +36 132
#note JO instead of JOY is wrong here. I was holding onto the Y for two reasons -- one, it plays beneath JO for a JOY play later, and two, I might want to play DOZY G7 nex turn -- but those reasons aren't enough. JOY is a lot more points; it sims best.-5

#note Sims best. I'm scoring decently (only 5 less tham MEEK 12L), taking out the triple, and closing the board off a little bit with a nice lead. Also, keeping the K is awesome on this board (N6, hint hint).

#note I spent FOREVER looking for a five-tile play at O1. Turns out I missed ILLUDE. Nice anagram pair there -- ILLUDES SULLIED. This play sims second-best.

#note Randy was probably a little bit demoralized after this frustrating game and didn't feel like thinking much, but there's something crazy he could have realized about this board: he can I-stick me. RENT L1 is definitely the play, blocking my IT outplay and giving nothing back. He retains both S's and can now score boatloads of points to cut spread.
