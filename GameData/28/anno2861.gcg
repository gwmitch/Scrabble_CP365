>Sam_Kantimathi: DFIN 8G FIND +16 16
>Jason: CEEIIUU -CEIIUU +0 0
#note This, keeping CI or keeping CE. Q likes the latter. I've got to start keeping CE on exchanges like this. (-1.1)
>Sam_Kantimathi: EGY J7 E.GY +17 33
>Jason: AEFHLUW 6I WHA +38 38
#note Gah! If I was sure WEDGY was good (thought it might be just -IE), I'd have played AWFUL. (-7.2)
>Sam_Kantimathi: AEENSSV 9B AVENSES +73 106
>Jason: EFGIILU E3 FIGULI.E +74 112
#note Thanks for the N, Sam. But crap, does this take an S? (Yes.)
>Sam_Kantimathi: KP D8 K.P +29 135
#note Winter was blogging in the corner next to us; Rod MacNeil came up to him. "Us next, Rod?" Winter asked. Rod said he was playing (so-and-so, I don't remember). "Bradley, then?" Winter asked. Rod said he was playing (other so-and-so). "Wow! So I'm not playing any of the four of you? This could be my break of the tournament! A great chance to go 8-0." Having looked at the pairings, I wanted to say "You've got Keller and shut up!" but it was on Sam's time. You know me, I'm never rude. :)
>Jason: DEHIINP F9 .HIP +33 145
>Sam_Kantimathi: GORU 12B GROU. +16 151
#note Teamwork! Totally kill the S hook!
>Jason: ?BDEEIN 7H BE.DI +24 169
#note Missing BE(F)rIEND, BE(E)lINED and (I)NEDIBlE. Shoulda looked harder. (-23.1)
>Sam_Kantimathi: DTUY 8L DUTY +35 186
>Jason: ??AENOT O1 AtTOrNE. +80 249
#note Like I was going to play ANT(ID)OtEs/(WHA)T! (-12.8)
>Sam_Kantimathi: AEENRRV N8 .AVERNER +88 274
#note In just five games, Sam has taught me some weird bingos: ELENCHI, OUTCAVIL, and now this.
>Jason: AIILLST 15L LI.A +15 264
#note Bunch of tightly bunched options. (-1.0)
>Sam_Kantimathi: EJT D2 JET +29 303
>Jason: ADINQST B6 QAN.T +36 300
#note I had QAT for 39 at F2 ready to go, this if he blocked. So, after checking my track/count, I happened to look over at Keller just as he was putting seven tiles down. "That could be a good sign," I thought.
>Sam_Kantimathi: BMO 5K MOB +26 329
>Jason: DEIILRS C6 ID +21 321
>Sam_Kantimathi: ACR M2 CRA. +16 345
>Jason: EILRSWZ 13J WIZE. +34 355
#note WZ not the draw I was looking for ... but I remind myself that I'm already 4-0 vs. Sam and if Keller can beat Winter, it's all good. Q likes R(EF)LEW. (-6.8)
>Sam_Kantimathi: LO A7 LO +16 361
>Jason: ALOORSU N1 LOO +19 374
#note Q gives an edge to passing all but S. (-4.2)
>Sam_Kantimathi: AT 2B TA. +20 381
>Jason: AOORSUX 12J OX +23 397
#note I thought this may have been my best pre-endgame play ever. If I pick a C and he can't bingo, I have CO(Z) for 48 ... or R(EF)OCUS for 36 elsewhere, leaving A+other tile and a near-guaranteed out. Naturally, Q says O(A)R/R(EF) wins more often. Hmph.
>Sam_Kantimathi: EEINRST 14E ENTRIES +79 460
#note When I saw the C, my heart lifted. When I saw the M, I groaned. Ah well. Just wasn't to be.
