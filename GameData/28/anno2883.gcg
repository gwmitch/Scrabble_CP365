>Jason: DEEEOPT G7 OPED +21 21
#note I played this quite quickly and shortly after thought that maybe I should've taken more time. But even if I had, I would've still missed DEPO(R)TEE. (-40.9)
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ABIISTX 4H .IXIT +26 94
>Jason: CEERRTV 6G C.RVE +28 49
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AABBSSU 3I BABUS +46 140
#note Can't remember if Bradley told me he left AS or US here. Either way, nice play. (Except, upon further review, Q tells me he had BABASSU for 100.)
>Jason: DELNRRT 5K NERD +25 74
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AAMSTUY O1 MAYAS +39 179
>Jason: EFILLRT I10 FILL +14 88
#note Ooh! L(AX) is an interesting gambit. (-15.1)
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: EHLTTUW N1 UH +24 203
>Jason: AAEEORT 12E AREO.ATE +68 156
#note One of those "dammit, I drew AAEO, dammit ... oh hey, I have AREO(L)ATE" racks.

#note Missed pEONAGE and Es(PI)ONAGE. (-17.6)
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AEILOPT 14I OPIATE +36 298
#note Hm, somebody doesn't have one of the two unseen S's...
>Jason: ?EEEKNO B12 KEEN +24 226
#note If there's ever a time to make a super-ballsy play, it's now. Can't ask for a better board to come back on.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AEHLNSU A7 UNLEASH +97 395
#note Owie.
>Jason: ?EIMOOT B1 EMOTIOn +71 297
#note Not dead yet! Two trip-trips and a juicy -S hook open! I'm surprised Q likes fishing instead. MOTE for 38 at 15L leads. (-7.8)
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: CDFNRVY 1A N.RVY +45 440
>Jason: GIIJOSW 15F JIGS +45 342
#note Order matters in the pre-endgame, too. (R)OW at C1, which I'll play next. (-1.2)
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: CDEFGRT 5A F.DGET +22 462
#note C(O)FT at 3A is seven better; blocks my best play and leaves GELD/(AREOLATE)D.
