#note Strongly considered the 12C placement for what it did to the board if Ed doesn't have an S. I'm not really sure why I opted not to play it - 6 points seemed like a lot, and that (QUAHOG)S hook was guaranteed to come up eventually anyway.

#note I think I made a mistake here. The question is - what to do? OOT(I)D looks nice, but I didn't see it Turn over the rack with 4G ODO(R)ANT?. Tough call.

#note (J)EHU seemed to be inviting trouble, but E(C)U C12 is cool, because it gives me an outside chance at a (T)H bingo hooking ED(H).

#note I realized this opened a big hook, but in a one-day tournament, the chance at extra spread was tantalizing. I considered UNSET as an option, but eventually went with the better leave. I won't lose this game even if he does bingo, so I think it's a safe bet in a short event.

#note I'm not going to lose at this point, so I figured I'd cut his bingo%, especially with there being a small chance he missed the hook.
