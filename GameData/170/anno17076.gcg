#note no idea what this was

>Joshua_Sokol: ABFLLOO --  -78 70
#note this should be a word. Jason wasn't foolable.
>Jason_Broersma: AFHIORX I11 FOX +46 46
>Joshua_Sokol: ABFLLOO 9E FOO.BALL +67 137
#note noticed what I should have played upon being held
>Jason_Broersma: AHR G11 RAH +37 83
>Joshua_Sokol: EOQSUVW 10J WO +28 165
#note I didn't like playing VOW anywhere cause it gives him a great unblockable lane unless I draw the A. Too much to worry about imo, this seems fine. Maybe 10B WOVE or K5 VOWEL are better
>Jason_Broersma: AANZ 8L AZAN +45 128
#note yeah, probably should have taken out one of the triples.
>Joshua_Sokol: EILQSUV N6 QU.IL +36 201
>Jason_Broersma: ?ABEGIR I1 BRIGAdE +64 192
>Joshua_Sokol: EERSVYY 2F VEE.Y +27 228
#note I don't think I want to play 8A SERVE here. I considered (R)EVERY but I was uncertain. 
>Jason_Broersma: AAEEIOS -  +0 192
#note challenged
>Joshua_Sokol: ARSSTUY 14I YURTAS +39 267
>Joshua_Sokol: ARSSTUY --  -39 228
#note challenged, again, this time for the better!
>Jason_Broersma: CNNOT 5H C.NTON +16 208
#note this doesn't appear to be the right play given my partial rack
>Joshua_Sokol: ARSSTUY 4L YURT +28 256
#note Hmm, I should still play 10D SAY perhaps. Didn't like the J threat.
>Jason_Broersma: EEIMNOR E7 IN.ORMEE +76 284
>Jason_Broersma: EEIMNOR --  -76 208
#note This was a difficult challenge.
>Joshua_Sokol: ANNSSTU 11K TUNS +29 285
#note Because I want to be sure it's good if I want to play SUNTANS. If I challenge and it's good, I have an unblockable SUNTANS next turn. If it's bad, which I was leaning towards (I thought I would have seen it before), I don't get to play SUNTANS. If I don't challenge and it's good, I still don't want to play SUNTANS with INFORMEES, cause he might challenge it and it might be taken off, just like the game where Jason played ABVECT* and later challenged ABVECTS*. Luckily then I had somewhere to bingo that he couldn't block but this time he can. So whether INFORMEE is a word or not, if I don't challenge, I play SUNTANS at D1 and fear INFORMEES the rest of the game. 
>Jason_Broersma: EEIMNOR 1G MO. +31 239
#note 13G (HEX)EREI is available
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIKMNS 10D DAM +27 312
#note I didn't know the word KAMSIN. It's better if I close everything down though. I noticed MIK(ADO) after the fact but this is a tad bit better.
>Jason_Broersma: EEINPRT 11C PET +25 264
#note Cool, I still know his leave.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIKLNS 12B KALE +35 347
#note totally KALI(FAT)E for style and challenge drawing stuffs
>Jason_Broersma: DEINRW 13A WIRED +48 312
#note also cause of this :(
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIINSS O1 GIS. +15 362
#note J threat is no more with this move. Good thing I didn't play (HEX)INGS*, cause that would have cost me and I would have had to get up for the 6th time this game...

>Jason_Broersma: EN 14B NE +24 356
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINORS 15C SENIOR +28 412
#note Blocking the only thing that has any chance of working, (OUTRIDE)r setting up a case S, and even rY_______/(OUTRIDE)r/(FOX)Y bingos if there are any. 
>Jason_Broersma: T G1 ..T +6 362
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIIPS F2 .IE +8 420
#note After I played this I realized how much spread I had just flushed down the drain :( -23 to 4C SEPIA, but maybe he had something ridiculous so I didn't want that to happen. Best paranoid play is (V)APID, which I considered, but I couldn't find 2 outs.
>Jason_Broersma: ?ACEGIV 5B CAVEs +24 386
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIPS A13 .AP +27 447
#note I didn't know (C)APSID, so instead of this being a 12 point error this was a 0 point error
