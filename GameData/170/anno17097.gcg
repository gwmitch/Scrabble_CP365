#note I have no idea what to make of this play. BOO at 7E wins the sim by 3. I like the idea of keeping the board more open against a lower-rated player. I guess BOO isn't so bad because if she does play to the triple then she is opening up more lanes. my bingo percentage jumps from 22% to 30%. this is an interesting segment of leave-space - EVER is 4.1, BORE is 3.1, OVER is 2.5, BEER is 1.8. EVER seems pretty bingo-prone.

#note I didn't think ABEORS was better than ABERS but I hit 66% after ex Q and 56% after ex OQ, so this is wrong.
