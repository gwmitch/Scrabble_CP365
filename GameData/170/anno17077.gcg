#note I didn't want to leave this spot open despite knowing 2/7 of Marlon's rack here (he laid down GI(V)ERS and then CI(V)IES and then GI(V)ERS). Was too paranoid. Probably UTA here.

#note I almost played SHEILAS. This is bad because it only bingos with DNNNTTTT.
>Marlon_Hill: CENS 3J S.NCE +32 316
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHILNS M5 INHALES +72 277
#note Marlon overdrew here right as I put INHALES M5 on the board. I handled it by taking away his V from LTV because I didn't want him to score with the A I was putting at 8L. This must have distracted me from rethinking this play and finding D3 after forgetting about it. This turns out to be much much worse than usual, and usually this would be a big mistake.

#note I'm once again oblivious as I miss E5 VEX. This destroys a lane too.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEOTUV I12 .UE +4 306
#note A lot of the time I am going to draw EE, so I forked for dEVOTEE, which plays with RUED and at C1. Good thing I didn't play (WO)VE, which was my first idea. The best play seems to be 6A E(F), since I draw (I)NVOLUTE 3/9  and VOLUTES C1 2/9 times. I have a 2/9+ guaranteed chance of bingoing next turn with (E)F. With my play I have 12 possibilities of drawing EE, which, if O'Connor's calculations are correct, translates to a 1/6 chance of bingoing next turn. I still lose unless Marlon messes up, which he obviously won't.
