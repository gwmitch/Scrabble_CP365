>Joshua_Sokol: ACDFIRU 9C CARFU. +15 65

>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEGPUX 10M .X +25 156
#note pretty sure I should play E(A)UX despite the B's. This doesn't bingo with a lot of tiles.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEGPRU O1 PlAGUER. +83 239
#note Missed EAR(P)lUG(S) even though EARPLUG/GRAUPEL/PLAGUER is one of the first of the first seven groups I learned. Not that this isn't better.

>Tim_Weiss: ILNO L10 LOIN +21 247
>Joshua_Sokol: EHSUWWZ H1 HEW +34 354
#note Pretty sure I just live with my UW leave, 3G WH(E)W could cause problems with board control later on. 
>Tim_Weiss: NOO 15F NOO +19 266
>Joshua_Sokol: OPSSUWZ 6F ZOU.S +40 394
#note Gotta drop the S for sure, taking out the N and a better leave...
>Tim_Weiss: ABEHIIT 10K I... +11 277
#note nice fish for BATHETI(C), a word I didn't know. If there were any N's left this would also be a fish for HIB(ER)NATE, but Tim didn't see that. 
>Joshua_Sokol: JMOPSSW D8 J.W +21 415
#note Gotta take out as many lanes as I can after that play even though I have no clue what he could be going for. 
>Tim_Weiss: ABEHITT J1 TAB +20 297
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMOPSS N3 POME +33 448
#note (I)MPI K10 is better than this if I think I'm not drawing the Q/ he won't block the only spot for it after (I)MPI. 
>Tim_Weiss: ABEHIT 7E BAH +32 329
#note He should have done this last turn instead of taking out his only longshot (ER) lane. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIOSST K7 I.S.ST +22 470
#note missed I(N)T(I)S/A(N)T(I)S but I was happy enough with this. Overscored by 2.
