>Joshua_Sokol: EINRTTU 4F .RUIT +9 242
#note INTER(C)UT chickened out of and TIN(C)TURE missed. Ouch, another costly mistake. I didn't think Kurt would have the Q after his exchange or the X after FEH so I was going for those too, kind of.

#note By the amount of time it took to play COOK I'm thinking Kurt is more likely to have the blank than usual. I decided not to play TRENAIL for that reason. But maybe I need to chance it. And if I'm chancing it I guess I should also hope for the X, for another play at N6. Very interesting turn that is up for debate I think. This was my only chance that I can remember where I could have played something like this: http://cross-tables.com/annotated.php?u=15946#6

#note These look like the best tiles left to have. I can't believe this materialized, but I have even less of an easy time believing I had a higher-scoring bingo than this. 15A DRIVEwA(Y)! I need to look even in these situations. I just couldn't conceive a higher-scoring play.

>Joshua_Sokol: EGIIJOU 6I JU.O +14 473
#note Man oh man this was terrible. I had tracked correctly, I had all of the time in the world and I still didn't see his outplay. I also missed J(EH)U. I saw this set up (V)IGI(A) and was happy enough with it cause J(I)G would have left me with crap that might not have even gone out in two after the play. This is 11 points worse than JIG, and 6 worse than JEHU.
