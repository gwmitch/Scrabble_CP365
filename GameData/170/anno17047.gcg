>Steve: CEGINNR 8D CRINGE +24 24
#note Interestingly, Q (not latest version) chooses to exchange the C. Exchanging the N is the second choice and CERING 8G is the top play among actual moves.
>Josh_Kopczak: EEOORTV G2 OVERTO.E +67 67
>Steve: ENQRTUX 5D QUE.N +28 52
#note 5th choice of Q. No. 1 is 4G EXTERN which I missed. E5 QUERN placement is second, but a clear error that sacrifices 4 percent winning chances.
>Josh_Kopczak: AIIL D8 .ILIA +14 81
>Steve: EORTUXY F1 OY +26 78
#note Third choice behind 9I XU, which I rejected because of easy scoring responses by the opponent. I like the Q second choice of ORYX J7, which I overlooked. OY is third. I chose it because it set up the TWS nicely, and still left 9I as a fall back.
>Josh_Kopczak: AAFL C10 ALFA +23 104
>Steve: ERTUX H1 XU +33 111
#note Full rack not recorded
>Josh_Kopczak: ABEHOS J3 BOHEAS +23 127
>Steve: CDEEPRT K4 PERT +30 141
#note way down the list. K1 CREPED for 43 tops the list. Word knowledge error, for me. I chose this over PED K4 because I wanted to keep an E in the leave. Q disagrees.
>Josh_Kopczak: EKPU L1 PUKE +36 163
>Steve: ACDEEIR M3 ID +25 166
#note Missed the bingo. Doh. More word study needed.
>Josh_Kopczak: GV I7 V.G +23 186
#note Seems to indicate Josh is low on vowels. That's how I read it, anyway.
>Steve: AACEEMR 1L .ACE +24 190
#note 2nd to, and tight with APACE, which I saw. Figured I could save the A and if nothing else play AM/APACE next turn.
>Josh_Kopczak: ??ADDDS L7 SADDleD +75 261
>Steve: AEMNORS B4 ENAMORS +68 258
>Josh_Kopczak: EIILLST 6B .LIT +17 278
>Steve: EHJNORZ A8 JO +56 314
#note Best. Would have been an interesting choice against ZONE A6, if that was still an option.
>Josh_Kopczak: ILNY A1 LINY +42 320
>Steve: EEHNRTZ 10J ZE. +33 347
#note Q makes the interesting choice of playing E10 TERNE (HZ) here for 26, and even has M12 HENT (ERZ) as second best. 
>Josh_Kopczak: BERW E11 BREW +34 354
#note Sends me a pretty clear signal where the case S is.
>Steve: AEHNORT M13 OH +16 363
#note Best if you assume your opponent has the case S, followed in order by M8 HO, and F12 THO. Otherwise, it's HARLOT at 11I.
>Josh_Kopczak: FIIMSTT 15C MISFIT +46 400
#note Q likes N13 TIT.
>Steve: AEGINRT N8 GRANITE +84 447
#note Got one of the three unseen I's I was hoping for. N8 INGRATE scores four additional points.
>Steve:  (ANOTUW) +18 465
