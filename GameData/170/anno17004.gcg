#note This game will be a case study of how I used to play Scrabble. I shouldn't have played this game the way I did, but I guess I still have more to learn.

#note I didn't even consider playing short here. What I didn't do here: tunnel vision, not evaluating leaves.
>Leesa: ?AGNRTU 5E mATUR.NG +82 106
>dacrON: ?EILORR D8 .ORRIbLE +72 122
#note A horrible play, as I let my guard down and momentarily forget SHOVEL, long enough to make my play.
>Leesa: IRTVY 15C V.RITY +36 142
>dacrON: ACEIMRT 14F MA +22 144
#note I really thought this was better than MI, with more As left, and this sets up a stronger 7 line than MI does. But no, apparently I am wrong.

#note Perfect example of why I can't play Scrabble like this anymore: I didn't even bother generating candidate plays here - I just saw one that scored a bit, turned some tiles, and then just played. But this play is awful. 4I A(H)EAD scores 28!

#note I had myself with 20 extra points here. If that was the case, maybe this isn't such a bad play. Leesa was sighing here, so I knew she had dreck. I figured, set up (W)AY for 27, the Y isn't so useful for her, keeping a mind for drawing an N for the IN(VERITY) snapback. But really, what the heck do I actually do here?

#note I knew there was a T out for (ERS)T, but figured I'd be able to outrun most of her bingos (remember, I think I have 20 more points than I actually do. In reality, this play is silly, and I am probably best playing (W)AY, giving her one shot to hit a miracle bingo, then I close the board off and win next turn.

#note Anything that blocks DEMENTIA wins. What would be insanely cool is if I could get a read that the Q was in the bag, pass, and Q stick after DEMENTIA for a bajillion points. OK, yeah, so I gotthe same over with, and realized my scoring mistake after this play and felt silly.

#note Anyway, some interesting insight into a game where I played like my "old self". Just not a 2000 player like that.
