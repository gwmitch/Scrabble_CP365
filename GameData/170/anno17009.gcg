#note I went back and forth between F13 FEH and FEM for a bit but decided on HM merely because it scored more.  The best play is SHEAFS.

#note Oops.  I  missed J7 FILAREES.  Actually I saw it but I forgot about VOICER.  I also overscored this by 2.

#note It may look like I'm completely oblivious to Mike's fishes, but I'm not.  There are two bingos lanes (three if you count row 15, but one-tiles fishes smell "I'm gonna bingo with a seven, not an eight" to me) and it makes no sense to block one for chump change while he bingos on the other.  I'll be in trouble then.    Instead, I'm going to keep scoring and outrun him.
>Mike_Baron: F B14 F. +10 211
>Tasha: ADEHIRX M9 HI. +21 315
#note I'm saving the X for a possible high scoring counter when he bingos on column 2.  Quackle says I played the right letters, but at the wrong spot.  It's suggesting I14 HI instead to block the most threatening bingo lane.  I didn't see the play, but I was unconcerned about Mike bingoing o the M.  I was pretty certain that he will play a 7.

#note I was curious about this play.  The only other play I considered was 1A OR, but I didn't like the play because it completely ignores Mike's last play.  I wrote the unseen pool as EILLNNOOORTU (apparently I mistracked an I) and decided I should be playing longer, not shorter.  I'm not really concerned with any non 3x3  bingos on column O (i.e, NEUTRINO, OUTLINER) because I'm drawing six tiles in an 8 vowel pool and I'll win the game even if he bingos anyway.  The only thing I AM concerned about is a 3x3.  I actually didn't see any 3x3s, but there's MILLINER for 83, but I'm not concerned with any bingos to the M either.  I played SHODDIER to score and block any 3x3s that I may not see and it also blocks row 15.  I also liked leaving one in the bag.  Mike will have to bingo this turn or he's emptying the bag.  Wait, that was redundant because he'll still empty the bag if he bingos.  Anyways,  according to Championship Player, SHODDIER is best with O8 DRIED right behind.  Run the sim and SHODDIER is second to O10 IODIDE.  DRIED is similar to SHODDIER, but scores less and only blocks column O.  IODIDE is the only play that blocks ALL possible bingos so that play is awesome.
