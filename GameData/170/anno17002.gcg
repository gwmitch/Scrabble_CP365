#note Is NTH right here? I didn't like it, though it doesn't give back much at all.

>dacrON: ANOSTUW 9H WO +17 17
#note Also considered L4 NOWA(Y) and K3 OUTWA(R) here, which both sim slightly ahead of this play. The bingo %s are what throw me for a bit of a loop - the extra points of NOWA(Y) must be worth it, but OUTWA(R)? That seems like a bad play...

#note Super tough position here. Quackle wants B8 DEA(V)ING, which is certainly volatile. I can see how Mike wanted to play it safe here, and I'm confident I have no idea what to play here.
>dacrON: ?EIILQY D1 Q.EY +52 296
>Mike: CDEKNO 12D NOCK +37 259
#note I held this for like 4 minutes. I realized it was probably a word after about 1, but then kept doubting myself. I probably wouldn't have even held NOCKED, which Mike wasn't sure of. Momentary lapse of sanity.
>dacrON: ?ADIIIL 13G ILIA +13 309
#note I think I like this more than N11 (M)IDI. To be honest I didn't consider much else here - this seems like such a strong play.
>Mike: ?ADEIRS O7 bRAISED +84 343
>dacrON: ?DEEILS 14A EyELIDS +79 388
#note Definitely not out of the woods. Also down to 1:30 now - stupid NOCK.
>Mike: EHIRR 14J HIRER +45 388
>dacrON: ABENOTT 15A NOTATE +38 426
#note I think I'm in decent shape so long as I draw a vowel. 14H BOAT is competitive with this play, but 12 points just seems like so much...anyway, I wanted to save a minute for the endgame, and NOTATE seemed a reasonable choice.
>Mike: ABEGLOS 15H BLASE +35 423
#note No wins for Mike here, but this play forces me to hold back the V - VAT for 14 only ties. Fortunately, Mike took plenty of time in this endgame, and I had enough time to work this fact out.
