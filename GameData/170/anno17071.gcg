>Joshua_Sokol: DGGIMTX 9F GIG +14 44
#note H8 (A)DMIXT keeping GG? I think 6H MIDG(U)T is an OK play. This too though. I wanted some defense. I didn't see MIDG(U)T, and that provides a decent alternative, nor did I see ADMIXT. All three seem like good plays.
>Joel_Horn: ADEINSU J2 AUDIEN.S +63 83
#note ooh, did Joel make a defensive play for 2 less or did he just miss SINUATED?
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDMTTX I1 MAX +39 83
#note This gives Joel less points next turn, apparently. 
>Joel_Horn: FOY M2 FOY +25 108
>Joshua_Sokol: CDFNSTT 6I D.F.NCT +19 102
#note I was lucky to have this but unlucky to have had to have this to give Joel some competition if yaknowwhatImean
>Joel_Horn: AEW N2 AWE +35 143
>Joshua_Sokol: EJQRSTZ -JQT +0 102
#note O1 TRES is an interesting alternative that I think a lot of people would not have seen in the first place! Nothing is good. I want to keep my Z since I thought bingoing is not likely and I want to be able to score. Not sure which exchange is right, but I think TRES is right to keep up with Joel. I don't understand where I'm going to bingo next turn unless Joel opens something up. Anyways, TRES keeping JQZ is my best option. lol.
>Joel_Horn: DOU 1F DOU. +21 164
#note heh, maybe I would have bingoed. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EERSVVZ 2B VERVE +31 133
#note Unless I drew this. I almost layed down (R)EVVER*/(S)E* because I was seeing the boardupside-down for a while and got fixated on that, and then I saw this. 
>Joel_Horn: ?EEIMNT D2 .EMINTEd +70 234
#note Joel missed a few things through AG and also could have played (PANTRY)MEN, which also looks better than his play. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EELNNSZ 5C Z.NE +26 159
#note Not sure why I didn't play ZEIN.
>Joel_Horn: AQ 7B QA. +13 247
>Joshua_Sokol: EEJLNPS K4 EL. +29 188
#note I had spotted this last turn. Maybe I hold onto it for next turn again and play F4 J(E)E or J(E)EP? But I could draw JAG/JIN next turn at H7, so this looks right. 
>Joel_Horn: GO O6 .OG +12 259
#note he's doing that fishing thing again. I am frustrated.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEJLNPS H7 J.. +11 199
#note I guess if he doesn't fish last turn I should play at O1 this turn. I thought this would be best if I wanted to respond to his imminent bingo (yes, I'm pretty damn certain he has the other blank, I can read Joel despite his constant negative ticks, he took long to play this too). Maybe ANES is still the play though. I can probably still draw into JIN/JAG.
>Joel_Horn: OR 6D .OR +11 270
#note He decided to play this here instead of 6D OR, and he told me it was because he didn't want me to get a "cheap" H play at F6. I'm sure that would have bothered him a lot despite his lead. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AELNPST O1 ATES +40 239
#note Instead he was bothered by something else, and immediately started to regret his last play. Of course I have ATES and not H, since Joel's opponents always have power tiles.
>Joel_Horn: IO 8A OI +17 287
#note Another chance for me! Thank you tile God! I think that either Joel missed I6 (D)I(N), was a bit vowel heavy (he does make plays like A(V)O for 7 keeping AEIOS relatively frequently), or was simply afraid of an 8A play, or all of the above. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIKLNP C1 K.P +26 265
>Joel_Horn: ?ABCIOR C9 AeROBIC +74 361
#note Finally, it took poor Joel 4 whole turns to bingo again on a closed board. Madness, I tell you! :) 
And seriously, this spot over N8? A 3x3 is the only thing that he should be remotely afraid of, not an S hook. I guess the fear of power tiles overcame rational thought, as I've already had one S too many this game. This is probably around a 10-point error, more than the total of my errors this game combined, I believe. Had I known DOU(M) was going to be laid down I would have thrown the Z away. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIILNS 12A LI.NISED +74 339
#note *Opponent shakes head and sucks teeth*
Hey, I drew IS, someone give me a cookie!
Turns out you made the right play, Mr. Horn! LINDIES/AEROBICS would have been a heartbreaker.
>Joel_Horn: HOU 15A OU.H +39 400
#note Quite a self-explanatory play.
>Joshua_Sokol: ILRRSTW H12 .IRL +15 354
#note I have around 17 minutes on my clock, Joel has 2. Forgot to mention that surprising fact. I am hoping he doesn't block my only out, but I should have tracked and figured out he would even if he didn't know what I had he would have blocked me anyway. I noticed he didn't have time to track and was trying to do so on my time and so I spontaneously laid this down. And so I lose around 20 points in the endgame, almost making up for Joel's blank bingo mistakes.
>Joel_Horn: AAEHIOT 11E HAO +26 426
#note Ooh, -9 to 11C (R)ATIO. 
>Joshua_Sokol: RSTW 10B W. +12 366
#note and another -5 for yours truly, E10 W(HI)RS and such.
>Joel_Horn: AEIT 14H .ETIA +7 433
#note He stops the clock. 
"TE(R)AI is a word", I tell him.
Thus concludes the most frustrating game of my tourney so far. I think it's Joel more than anything else... Whatevzz 

>Joel_Horn:  (RST) +6 439
#note Let's use Joel's method of determining why someone won a game.

Power tiles for Josh: JZKXSSS + EEEEEE + Q exchanged and J exchanged (double the J joy!)

Power tiles for Joel: QS?? + EEEEEE

Most sound logic for deciding who played better or worse! Am I right? Anybody? It makes so much sense! :)
