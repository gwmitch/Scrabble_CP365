#note I think he wouldn't done better to play shorter here instead of blowing up his rack.
>JD: ACEMNRS 3F MENAC.RS +78 140
#note I actually would've chickened out on CRAGSMEN (collins confusion), so I'm lucky I had a spot.
>Jerry: CEFRSUY H1 SY.C +36 74
#note I think this is a really cool play, especially when down 100.
>JD: ?EFIOTT 1B lOFTIE.T +64 204
#note biggest mistake of the series (along with eugenol), ofttimes is a word I've studied but apparently not enough times.
>Jerry: DEEFRSU L6 REFUSED +87 161
#note defuser might have served him better

>JD: BEGLRXY C1 .XY +26 263
#note not playing flex here is way too chicken. the board is really closed so I was reluctant to open an easy 8s lane, but this play also gives him free points.
>Jerry: ?AILNOQ 2A LO. +22 211
#note he held onto the Q for awhile trying to draw a huge play.
>JD: BDEGLLR 1L .ELL +21 284
#note takes away a way for him to get cheap points. also I liked WELL instead of WELD because it leaves the same letter to bingo from (the L).

>Jerry: ?AAEIQV 8L .AVE +30 266
>JD: ABDORRT 11C BROAD +30 334
#note quackle likes this play, but with 4 As and the J left I think setting up ABROAD is too crazy!! by comparison, ABORTED at O3 drops bingo percentage to 5%. I think BRAD would be fine.
>Jerry: ?AAINQR B10 QANAt +75 341
>JD: EOPRTTU D10 T.OUPE +18 352
#note I wanted to retain the consonants with lots of vowels unseen, I could also try to cut down on turnover and play BUT at C11.
>Jerry: IIIIJMR 6B MIRI +16 357
>JD: AEKRSTT A13 KAT +28 380
#note TAB at C9 is awesome - threatening a big out on row 15 with RETAKES/KEESTER/KEISTER/RESTOKE and TUSK or JESTER.
>Jerry: AEIIIJU C9 JA. +32 389
>JD: EORST M10 ORE +19 399
#note I should slow-play with ORE and TWIG/TONE and GOLDS/ZINGS, but good enough!
