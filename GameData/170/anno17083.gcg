>Joshua_Sokol: ABIJRRY H7 RAJ +20 20
#note Bad start as I miss BRIARY. JAY and JIB also look better than this
>Tim_Weiss: EIMPRU 9H .UMPIER +20 20
>Joshua_Sokol: BEGIQRY L8 Q. +21 41
#note I guess I could play 8M BEY too, but this looks right.
>Tim_Weiss: III -III +0 20
>Joshua_Sokol: BEGGIRY J6 GRI.Y +23 64
#note Last time he exchanged 3 he bingoed next turn. I'm thinking he has something pretty powerful based on previous experience. I decide that PIGGY may not be a word and that even if it is this wouldn't be far behind and would shape the board in my favor. Unfortunately the leave is so much worse that it's not even worth considering GRIMY. 
>Tim_Weiss: AR K9 .AR +15 35
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEGOTT 12H BEGAT +28 92
#note I've given up on stopping his imminent bingo. I believe it is rightly so. 
>Tim_Weiss: ?AEEFIS 10B FrEESIA +80 115
>Joshua_Sokol: ELLOTTU 13D OUTLET +15 107
#note unfortunately I lose around 50 points by talking myself out of OUTTELL. 
>Tim_Weiss: DINW 12A WIND +30 145
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIILLZ A12 .ILL +21 128
#note M4 GILLI(E) seems like the only other viable option besides (W)ILE.
>Tim_Weiss: ?ACDEIP N6 PIC.AtED +70 215
#note I guess N7 PE(R)ACIDs is a bit too dangerous. I like G2 PEDICAb. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGILVZ E8 GE.Z +28 156
#note I should play D4 ELEGIZ(E) here.
>Tim_Weiss: ENRT O12 RENT +21 236
#note TERN is more defensive, twice as many things end in T compared to N.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFILTVW H12 ..EF +27 183
#note Yeah I'm in big trouble.
>Tim_Weiss: BDU M5 DUB +20 256
>Joshua_Sokol: EHILTVW L1 WHILE +33 216
#note I considered that maybe LV was better than TV. Therefore I should play WITHE or WHITE instead of this, but I also think I could have played L3 WHIT, not sure if that's better or not but in this situation it seemed to have been. 
>Tim_Weiss: AEINOSV O1 EVASION +93 349
#note Although Tim did have multiple spots. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEMOOTV 3I VOM.T +28 244
#note I considered MOV(I)E, but I had given up :(
>Tim_Weiss: AKOORTY M13 OKA +22 371
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEIOOU -OOU +0 244
#note maximizing bingo percentage for next turn
>Tim_Weiss: ANORTXY 2J NA. +16 387
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEHIOY 14J YOC. +21 265
#note this is wrong, I need to keep CHIDE or something and play OY at G7. I know what kind of stuff is in the pool
>Tim_Weiss: ANNRSST 8B TAN. +6 393
#note lol, nice try
>Joshua_Sokol: DEHIOUX 7B UH +20 285
#note F7 HODS gives me 21 more points in a perfect endgame. B2 HIDEOU(T) is good as well.
>Tim_Weiss: NOORSS 6C SORN +12 405
#note Nice play!
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIOX 15J OX +23 308
>Tim_Weiss: OS A8 SO +24 429
>Tim_Weiss:  (DEI) +8 437
#note OUTTELLS and other big mistakes, I thought I had no way of winning
