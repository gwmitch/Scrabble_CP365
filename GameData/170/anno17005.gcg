#note Juraj blocks my bingo with his 6 overlap.  I choose this because he might not know the hooks here.  Also best opens the board.  Sims best, ahead of the x2x2 plays.

#note TZAR 10E is the obvious play.  TAT/ORT 10H are the next best according to sim.  Given the score, I went with the 4th option, TORQUING.  it opens the board.  I can play ZA 10F next turn, without hurting the 7-line.  Interesting positional debate.

#note Held this play for about 5 minutes.  Given my rack, it'll be difficult to come back, so I thought my win% would be better with a challenge.  (With a nicer rack, I'd be more willing to let it go)

#note Sets up my X.  Else, if I get an O, I have a play at 6E.  Sim likes just VEX or VEXT, but I need the variance
>Juraj_P: ADEIO O3 IODA.E +24 282
>E_Tran: BERTUVX H1 RUB.. +36 207
#note Need to keep the T for TAX(A) at 6L.  Slotting the R also makes it easier to access the x3's.

>E_Tran: ?EINTVX 4A VINE +34 241
#note Given the score, I'm looking beyond trying to bingo.  I'll need to score well, and bingo.  This scores well, keeps my draw to TAXA to score well, and a blank to bingo.  H8 GO(X) is tempting, but this does sim best.
>Juraj_P: ANY 11E NAY +31 341
>E_Tran: ?DEKSTX O12 DESK +45 286
#note Once again, keeping TX for TAXA.  Once again sims best, ahead of many other scoring options, like DEX/KEX, or EXiST XyST.

>E_Tran: ?ELMNST 3B LES +26 371
#note MINSTREL doesn't sim very well.  SNOWMEN is best by about 8% and 8 valuation.  I saw SNOWMELT, but not SNOWMEN.  LES is 2nd. (4ply)  Note that the pool is 10v-6c.

#note Should really have played VUM here.  I was too paranoid about him fishing with OVUM; that is of little concern.  His most likely bingoes will be through the R, but unlikely to start with R.  This play covers his most likely bingoes, and saves me two bingo lines if I need.  But, VUM is way better,

>E_Tran: ?EINOTV 14B VIOlENT +74 452
#note Low on time.  Quickly looked at the pool.  Saw he had SIDEMAN for a lot, and would win by 1 (actually by 3).  Saw he didn't have bingoes starting with R.  Made the correct call by eschewing REVOTINg
>Juraj_P: ADEIMNS N1 DIMS +20 402
#note Turns out he did have SIDEMAN.  Overall, I have to say I was quite proud at all of the non-obvious plays I made in this game.  Still made mistakes, but also did a lot of things right.
