>Joel_Horn: HO 10I OH +19 31
>Joshua_Sokol: ABRSTTX 10E TAX +28 47
#note When I drew 4 consonants I thought about my 2 previous games against Joel because very similar things happened in the beginning of the game. I started having bad thoughts.
>Joel_Horn: BEILMNR 7B NIMBLER +67 98
>Joshua_Sokol: BORSTUU B4 BUR.OUTS +64 111
#note When is drawing OUU ever a good thing? 
Wasn't sure which of RUBOUTS/OUTRUBS was good, and wasn't sure enough of OUTBUR(N)S. Psychological mistake here. 
>Joel_Horn: EGHIT A11 EIGHT +32 130
#note no, this can't be right
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINQSU 11E ANE +26 137
#note no idea why I missed QUEAN, but I feel like this is a better play than the credit it is given. 
>Joel_Horn: IJ E5 JI. +24 154
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIQRSU 12G SQUIRE +61 198
#note phenomenal miss here
>Joel_Horn: DILO M10 LIDO +27 181
>Joshua_Sokol: ACGNOTV 14A .AVOC +26 224
#note the most defensive choice was chosen. I also considered A1 OCTAN. 
>Joel_Horn: IVY C2 IVY +25 206
#note Joel made a bad play here. He didn't even have one of the three T's left in the bag. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AGNPRTY 1A PATY +49 273
#note Knowing that staggering fact (no T in Joel's leave), I would have seen (and longly considered) 8A P(O)NY. 
>Joel_Horn: AAK C12 KA.A +22 228
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEGNNR L4 GRANNiE +68 341
>Joel_Horn: AIU H12 .UAI +39 267
>Joshua_Sokol: CILOSTW D13 T.W +21 362
#note Interesting turn here. What do I take out? 8A? 12D? Both spots seemed quite threatening for easy points. One of them requires the use of an S to score a ton at, and the other one doesn't. I decided to block 12D even though the spot favors me more than 8A for future turns. Although I don't know why I didn't drop the L instead of the T. And I should have considered just dropping the W.
>Joel_Horn: ?EEINOR 3C .OmERINE +62 329
#note This is also an interesting turn, this time for Joel. The sim has 5G ERIgE(R)ON as the top play, as it cuts my score most and has the second best bingo% next turn for Joel (obviously that's inflated as I am not always going to play the top static play next turn). (V)OmERINE, Joel's play, gives him the best shot at a second bingo next turn, but it's also very volatile.
>Joshua_Sokol: CILNORS 8A C.NI +28 390
#note another weird situation. Maybe I should play R(E)L(AXES). I chose to score and therefore hopefully outrun. Not much I can do to reduce his score without crippling myself.
>Joel_Horn: DG F2 G.D +9 338
>Joshua_Sokol: ELORSST N4 STEROLS +66 456
#note this is correct despite the -2 points. Joel thought this was the only bingo in the pool. I asked if he meant before or after his last play, and he said after, which I let him no made no sense at all. In any case, I see FOSTERS, FLORETS, LOFTERS, FORESTS, ZOSTERS as well as this and OSTLERS. So much for Joel's already fallacious theory. 
>Joel_Horn: DEEELMP 2J PEELED +40 378

#note Most satisfactory win of the tourney.
