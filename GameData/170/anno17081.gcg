>Dan_Stock: EFIW 8E WIFE +20 20
>Steve_Grob: ?AEGTXY I8 YAG +22 22
#note (W)AXY is best.
>Dan_Stock: ABOOT 7B TABOO +15 35
>Steve_Grob: ?EMPTUX C6 E.UX +19 41
#note 9G EX(A)M for 29. An interesting play that ranks third is UrTEXT for 56. 6F PUT is second best.
>Dan_Stock: ILNT 11H LINT +16 51
#note A curious play. What can we derive about our opponent's rack here? Duplication of single point tiles, perhaps. Maybe setting up an -S hook.
>Steve_Grob: ?MMOPRT 6F PROM +25 66
#note This or POM in the same spot.
>Dan_Stock: IKL 12K ILK +16 67
#note The I and the L again from the opponent, and again manufacturing bingo lines. 

NB: Underscored by two in the actual game.
>Steve_Grob: ?DEHMTV 5H HM +18 84
#note An 8k 2ply sim has my play third behind THEM and then METH, but it's very close.
>Dan_Stock: IPZ 13I ZIP +29 96
>Steve_Grob: ?CDERTV 4B VERDiCT +83 167
#note Finally. Early mistakes, like holding on to the X, kept the blank in my rack for way too long.
>Dan_Stock: DO 3C DO +14 110
>Steve_Grob: EENQSUY N12 SUQ +32 199
#note Another fun decision to make here, and many options. Q likes B9 EYEN, keeping the SUQ leave. It's second choice, SQUE(G) on row 10 is something I didn't see. It seemed to me during the game that Dan had bingo prone tiles. SUQ was the highest scoring play I saw, and so I went with it. The sim rates it poorly, and has SQUEG jumping over EYEN by a tad. Third is M12 (K)YE.
>Dan_Stock: AELORSS 15I OARLESS +87 197
#note Dan pointed out he was ready to play LASSOER at 14H for mega points, so opening row 15 wasn't didn't really add any more damage.
>Steve_Grob: EEIINWY 9A NI.Y +14 213
#note This was the game's critical point, and where the top players are able to find the best play from a rack that is less than ideal. I'll post the answer to what's best after the next play, so anyone who wishes to look for it can do so.
>Dan_Stock: AEHIORT A8 A.TIHERO +185 382
#note This bango carried a punch. Game, set, match. 

My best move on the previous turn was to play EYEWIN(K). Not the easiest of finds, but a word I'm familiar with, and which rids the rack of all duplication, turns over 6 tiles, scores 25 points (11 more than NIXY), and doesn't open up the triple line. E1 WEE(D)Y was the duck's second choice.
>Steve_Grob: EEIOORW D9 .OWIE +22 235
>Dan_Stock: AAN C12 ANA +12 394
>Steve_Grob: DEEFNOR E10 FORE +35 270
#note I was happy with this play, until just now, as Q points out the missed bingo. Answer after the next turn, tho your word knowledge will have to be excellent to find it.
>Dan_Stock: ?EGILNS 2B LoNGIES +74 468
#note Best scoring play among the bingos available.

The bingo I missed on the previous turn: (F)OREFEND.
