>Joshua_Sokol: ADDFIMT 6G T.AM.D +28 254
#note Weird position. Wanted to score and keep scoring tiles, but maybe I should play more defense and play J2 FAM(E)D or play offense and play J4 D(E)F. I didn't consider 6J F(E)TID, but that gives up more spots for Marlon to seal the game by bingoing with.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEFGIIL 1A FLI. +21 309
#note I have no idea what this was all about. I didn't even consider FIA(R) or FAI(R), although there are fewer vowels than consonants in this pool. I guess it wasn't a (big) mistake?
>Marlon_Hill: ABEPRS 2H .PBEARS +34 306
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGILNO 1K ALOIN +27 336
#note please don't tell me to fish here, Quackle. Or open a ton of stuff. is N2 (S)O even a consideration? I bingo with GLNTV if Marlon doesn't block, and RK if I see FINAGLER/FANGLIKE so that's a 10/19 chance if Marlon doesn't block and a 5/19 chance if I see the stuff with the F. But why take the chance when I can score? Does he really beat me that often after ALOIN? I guess if I mess up.
>Marlon_Hill: CGIO B1 .OGIC +16 322
#note I didn't know at the time what this was about but Marlon was looking for the K for (F)LAK, which I missed completely.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGORTV 9I V..OR +13 349
#note So here is the worst screwup of the entire game. I have the pool as AEEIKLNORRR, one tile too many given that there are 3 in the bag. I don't know which one it is, and instead of figuring that out as soon as possible I play V(IS)OR, blocking the perceived threat of (NO)OKIE. Unfortunately there is no I in the pool and I didn't know that. Therefore, I'm emptying the bag, which is already dangerous as I'm giving him full advantage in the endgame, blocking something that doesn't exist, and missing a play that would make it very hard or maybe even impossible for me to win, A1 (F)LAK. I believe something like 12C OVER would be a good idea.
>Marlon_Hill: AEELRRR 8M ERR +11 333
#note this is the right play
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGKNOT 10M EKE +20 369
#note Marlon hoped I wouldn't know or see K(ER)OGEN, both coming true. I also chickened out of TOKE(R), which would have been an extra-embarrassing loss of a turn against Marlon ;). So yeah -15
>Marlon_Hill: AELR C12 EARL +11 344
#note correct again. 
>Marlon_Hill:  (GNOT) +10 354
#note The deadwood overscored by 2, the final score is 356-369 in my favor.
