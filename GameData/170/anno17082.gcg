#note If you saw the bingo that plays in row three for 88 you're pretty darn good. There's also a low-scoring nine that plays on the I file thru RE.

>Steve_Grob: AAEMNRY N1 AY +32 235
#note Q likes AM in the same spot, likely because I have one of the few E's left to play down the O column. ARAM(E) at H1 also not bad.

#note Was looking for plays that took advantage of the hooks on ZOO, but was unable to find them (HAMAL, ALMAH). They top my play by a smidge.

>Steve_Grob: CEIINRS E9 ..IC +18 281
#note Inexcusable to miss the 7; finding the 8 would have been inspired. One of those words I recognize, but am not too good at finding. Of the non-bingo plays, INCISE is best on row 15.
