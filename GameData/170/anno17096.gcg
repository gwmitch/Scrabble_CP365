#note VROW is risky but I thought of RO(P)E as a setup. Quackle says to go ahead with VROW

#note Weird play
>Matt: ABILNOR B9 BAL +19 357
#note I fail to see why other plays are better than this, since I thought this was really defensive and grabbed a big enough lead to win this game.

Overall I played pretty well at the beginning and then not very well at the end. Fortunately it was enough to win the game, but it won't be against stronger opponents.
