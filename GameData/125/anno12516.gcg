>John: CFIO 8G FOCI +18 18
>Matt: DEEEIIR G5 REI.IED +13 13
#note Going for turnover, which was a good idea since I was plagued by vowelitis all night. 
>John: BBDEE H11 EBBED +42 60
>Matt: AAEHLRS 13C SHARA.LE +80 93
#note Couldn't come up with ASHLARED.
>John: NN J8 .NN +5 65
#note I had him on 3 N's, an S, probably an E.
>Matt: EILMNRU 6F L.MURINE +64 157
#note RELUMINE is 4 more points, but again I can infer he's close to bingoing himself, so I go with the unhookable word.
>John: DENSTTU C6 STUDENT. +62 127
#note UNTESTED is 72.
>Matt: FGOOOQS K5 Q. +22 179
#note Yeah, this wasn't terribly smart.  I should take a shot at drawing an I for that spot next turn.  FOG 14J for 28 looks fine.  
>John: IOV L4 VI.O +25 152
#note Also he doesn't get an additional 11 for that V dump.
>Matt: FGOOOST 14J FOOTS +45 224
>John: EKY 8A YE.K +48 200
#note He hesitated before playing this, I asked him why he would hesitate, he said he's still solidifying the 4's and 5's.  
>Matt: CEGLOTY L12 CL.G +18 242
#note FOOTSY!  Forgot about that hook.  Thought this ditched the junk, plus I keep the Y for E8 and the two TLS's.  COLOG is better though now that I look at it.  
>John: JMOR E10 JOR.M +28 228
>Matt: AENOTWY F13 .YA +29 271
#note Still missing FOOTSY.  I liked this play since it scored 29 and didn't offer any counterplays to the triple.  
>John: ADIOZ B2 DIAZO +38 266
#note I think AZIDO D2 may be right, as it gives back the least amount.  The duck prefers AZIDO B2, but with all the A's unseen that's gonna get hit for ~40 next turn.
>Matt: AAENOTW A1 WEAN +32 303
>John: OPX M6 .XPO +39 305
#note Gah, when will he stop playing power tiles?
>Matt: AGHOTTV N10 GOTH. +13 316
#note Well he blocked my play of GAVOTS, so I made a calculated risk and tried to dump as much junk as possible, sacrificing points.  Both blanks are unseen after all.
>John: NSU 8L S.UN +30 335
#note I thought I was going to lose at this point.  That's 5 turns in a row with a power tile if you count the K.  
>Matt: AEGRTTV D2 GRAVE +21 337
#note Maybe TRAVE, since there is now an N to play through.  Either way, I have to create another lane and hope to draw a blank.
>John: ?AAEIRU 12C .A. +16 351
#note His actual rack. Playing off 2 is the play, since he can win without bingoing with tempo.  VAU is really nice since it hinders Column O, the best bingo line left.
>Matt: ?EILTTW B10 WE +28 365
#note I saw there were only two consonants left, so he was unlikely to bingo and he couldn't really score down Column A.  This set up a diversion, scoring a lot and putting the pressure on him to keep up, while I hoped to draw into a bingo elsewhere.  I can't do this effectively if there's only 1 in the bag.  Champ player agrees, putting me at 69% to win after this play.
>John: ?AEIPRU A11 PUREr +26 377
#note I undercounted my score by 5 up to this point, so we thought it was closer.  But John is sunk now.  He has to block the N, but the best he can do is for 10 or 11 points.  Meanwhile I play TIdAL for 18, and he can't make up the difference on this board while going out with AE? or whatever.   
>Matt: ?AIILTT O2 mILITA.T +58 423
#note Or LITIgANT.  ALT/(DIAZO)L(E) is a cute fit.  Crazy game that was a lot of fun.  
>Matt:  (AI) +4 427
