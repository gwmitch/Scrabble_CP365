>Rafi: BEEEFMS 8G FEEB +18 18
#note I liked this placement because of the chance to hit the double lane with my S. I prefer FEEB over BEEF because it's more likely to be parallelled underneath (AB vs BA, BE, etc) meaning that if FEEBS is blocked, I'm likely to be able to S hook whatever letter is played under the E.
>David_Gibson: ADDIKNZ 9F ZADDIK +42 42
>Rafi: DEGIMSS L3 SMIDGES +96 114
>Rafi: DEGIMSS --  -96 18
#note I was in disbelief that both placements of SMIDGES were blocked. I happened to have skimmed over the 6 letter Z words on the plane so I was pretty sure ZADDIKS was phoney, but not sure enough to pass it up. Plus, if there's any chance it's going to stay on the board, it's probably worth a shot considering that it's going to be hard NOT to open up a spot for this rack if it's challenged off.
>David_Gibson: LNNORUV H3 UNLOV.. +12 54
#note Pretty much any play gives me a place to bingo. Exchanging is probably best.
>Rafi: DEGIMSS 4B SMIDGE.S +74 92
#note Wow. 
>David_Gibson: INORSTU -  +0 54
#note Challenged! A doubly fortunate turn of events for me.
>Rafi: ?AAEJLO B4 .OJA +27 119
#note This pretty much ensures me a bingo lane next turn.
>David_Gibson: INORSTU A7 NITROUS +76 130
#note We both ended up missing the T hook on ZADDIK all game, but luckily it hurt Gibson more than me.
>Rafi: ?ACEGLN C7 GALENiC +80 199
>David_Gibson: EEILLNO 3C OLE +19 149
>Rafi: CHIPPRR 6H .RPHIC +19 218
#note Hard to say what's best here. ORPHIC seemed like the highest scoring play that had a good leave and kept the board reasonably closed.
>David_Gibson: EEILNTU M2 LINE.UT +20 169
#note Another TZADDIK opportunity.
>Rafi: EEIOPRS 5K OP. +24 242
#note OE seemed like too obvious a fish, and OPE scores 6 points more. I thought that since there aren't great bingo lanes it was worth scoring a few extra points, but the extra vowel could hurt me if I draw 2 more. Quackle prefers OE.
>David_Gibson: BEEGITV 10J BIG +31 200
>Rafi: EEIINRS 8M .IE +9 251
#note This seemed like the best fish - the E isn't easily blockable and gives me another good lane to work with.
>David_Gibson: AAAEETV F3 A.AVE +21 221
>Rafi: DEINRST 12C .NDITERS +68 319
#note My turn to miss TZADDIK. TINDERS/TZADDIK scores 20 points more, but opens some lanes and a huge scoring spot. NITRIDES is another good option. INDITERS scores significantly less, but only leaves one bingo lane and gives me a chance to kill the board sooner than the other bingoes allow. If I see it, I think I have to take my chances and go with TINDERS (especially considering AGAVE, which doesn't indicate much about the leave).
>David_Gibson: ?AEMRTY O8 .RYThEMA +86 307
>Rafi: EEHNOTU N13 HEN +27 346
#note Missed TZADDIK again. Definitely right to preserve the U with the Q unseen here, and some decent Q options (SUQ for example) I played HEN instead of HET to set up my T.
>David_Gibson: AFOOWWX 11K FOX +49 356
>Rafi: EIORTUY E1 RE..Y +28 374
#note A lot of better options involving TZADDIK, such as TRODE, preserving the U and scoring well. REEDY is probably the best non-TZADDIK play though - if I draw the Q I win (QUILT or SUQ should do it) and the only good play through the R is ARROW. Gibson is going to have a hard time having a good enough out-in-2 to win here.
>David_Gibson: AAOQTWW 10E QAT +33 389
>Rafi: AIORTU 1C OU.ARI +21 395
#note QADI and TO(PI) are the other two winning plays. QADI only wins if I find RUT(H)!
>David_Gibson: AOWW 2J WAW. +18 407
>Rafi: T 13M T.. +12 407
#note An intense and exciting win on board 1!
>Rafi:  (O) +2 409
