>Winter: QSU 8G SUQ +24 24
#note Winter showed up 15 minutes late for this game, the first of the afternoon session, so he played this game with 15 minutes on his clock.
>Matt: AABOORZ 9C BAZOO +23 23
>Winter: DEOSTUV J2 DEVOUTS +80 104
>Winter: DEOSTUV --  -80 24
>Matt: ABEIRRY 8A BRAY +52 75
#note Quickly made this play, but BERAY# is 54, and there's a bingo available that's the best play.  
>Winter: DEOSTUV 10F DUVET +25 49
>Matt: EEEIILR H10 .IRILE +30 105
>Winter: IJMS K8 JISM +36 85
>Matt: DEEILNN 8K .INNE +39 144
>Winter: EFOOW 12C WOOFE. +24 109
>Matt: AADEIIL 11C AIL +17 161
#note Uh yeah, play AID for 4 more points.  Or AALII (which I always have a hard time seeing) and dump more of this junk.
>Winter: GLOSTT L3 GLOTT.S +18 127
>Matt: AAADEEI K4 AIA +14 175
>Winter: ?EIIKRS B1 fRISKIE. +76 203
#note A few bingoes from the B, but they're all Collins-only and not obviously valid.
>Matt: ADEEOTV 13A VOE +24 199
#note Well that's a fail.  Whiff on fOVEATED.  
>Winter: AMNOOPW A11 GY.ER +48 251
>Winter: AMNOOPW --  -48 203
#note He made this play quickly, hoping it'd be good in Collins.  GYVE means "to fetter", and FETTERER is good, go figure.  
>Matt: ADDEETT N4 ATTE.DED +64 263
#note Gah, DENTATED.  Especially since he has GREY for 45 for certain after my play.
>Winter: EPRY O1 PREY +48 251
>Matt: ?ALNRRU 1B .ReNULAR +68 331
#note I announced the score as 68, hit my clock, and Winter said "That can't be right, it's on the triple".  This is the best bingo though, the rest are 58 points.
>Winter: EFW 14B FEW +35 286
>Matt: AACHNOT O11 ACTON +33 364
#note Saving the H for next turn, at either 2F or J6.
>Winter: X 13G X. +34 320
>Matt: ACDEGHO 2F HAG +33 397
#note The pool looked pretty ugly, and I didn't see much of a way to block everything.  Quackle suggests CADGE J2, which blocks INGENIUM# and INHUMING in both spots.  I kept the O for Column M plays.
>Winter: GHIMNNP J6 HM +29 349
>Matt: CDEEOU M10 DOUCE +23 420
#note COLED is 3 points better.
>Winter: GINNP 6A P.NING +13 362
