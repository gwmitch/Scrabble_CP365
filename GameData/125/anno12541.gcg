#note Didn't think of HU(L)A which is a good alternative.

>Rafi: ADINRUV 10M .UV +8 123
#note I was pretty unsure what to do here. Considered INVAR, but DU is ugly and the lane is easy to shut down (and score) with an S or an E. ULVA (which I didn't think of) looks promising, scoring 15 and opening up a decent lane. I picked LUV because it makes HAULS very difficult to block without an S, and could allow me to open the board with VARIED next turn, or get lucky and draw a bingo.
>Robin: RWY 5J WRY +33 221
>Rafi: ADHIINR I6 NI.H +13 136
#note Another tough decision. NIGH leaves the possibility for VARIED if I don't draw a bingo, but is much easier to block (with a T) than I would like it to be. None of the options here look too promising.
>Robin: EX J9 EX +30 251
>Rafi: ADDIORY K9 YID +32 168
#note YID is hard to deal with if Robin doesn't have an S, but that seems like a very unlikely scenario with 4 unseen. HAULYARD is another good option but I didn't see it.
>Robin: CERST 12H CREST +28 279
>Rafi: ADELORR H10 RE.LAD +27 195
#note With a forked board, I might have a small chance at a comeback. Maybe RECORD instead, because there are more O's unseen (although Quackle prefers RECLAD). This was my first E I drew all game!

#note If Robin has 6 vowels and decides to exchange, there's a nonzero chance I could get two bingoes down and win. Barely nonzero...
