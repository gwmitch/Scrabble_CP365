>Andrew_Fisher: GINTUVY 8D VYING +32 32
#note Woohoo! Lovely setup for OUTVYING
>Cameron_Farlow: AENRSST D5 SER.ANTS +72 72
>Andrew_Fisher: DEFGITU G7 U.GIFTED +67 99
#note The same word from 10C is worth two more. Can't recall if there was a valid reason for spurning it.
>Cameron_Farlow: ADELOST 10G .SOLATED +65 137
>Andrew_Fisher: ?EHNOQS 11K HONE +31 130
#note HONE just about sims best, with QOpH E2 and HOSEN C9 in the mix
>Cameron_Farlow: ELMY 12L YELM +43 180
>Andrew_Fisher: ?BEIPQS 10B QI. +32 162
>Cameron_Farlow: AEFHRUU H12 EXER +51 231
>Cameron_Farlow: AEFHRUU --  -51 180
>Andrew_Fisher: ?BEOPSU 5B BE.POUtS +72 234
#note I avoided the VYING(S) hook - PUEBLOS/PHOEBUS -  to retain the OUTVYING potential - a double-edged sword though. Nice non-bingo here is OBSERVANTS for 30
>Cameron_Farlow: EEW 13M WEE +35 215
>Andrew_Fisher: AAABORR 4I ARAROBA +72 306
#note Astoundingly, I had played this very same bingo on the previous day.
>Cameron_Farlow: ADEX H12 AXED +54 269
>Andrew_Fisher: AFGIIJO O1 JAF. +42 348
#note FIGO 3G comes out ahead in the sim, the point being the creation of a juicy JOR hook. I'd rather not leave the TWS alone though.
>Cameron_Farlow: ?CDEIIR 3C ICtERID +80 349
>Andrew_Fisher: AGIINOU 11B IN.I +21 369
#note Trying to be too cunning here, though it did pay off. QU- plays such as QUOIN are better.
>Cameron_Farlow: AEP N2 PE.A +29 378
>Andrew_Fisher: AGKOTTU 8A OUT..... +45 414
>Cameron_Farlow: ELZ 9I ZEL +51 429

>Cameron_Farlow: HIO F13 HOI +27 456
>Andrew_Fisher: GMORTUW 2F WOG +33 485
#note The seven here does not fit, alas. The Japanese version of MUGWORT was the nickname given to an old University friend studying in Japan, as it sounded similar to his name (at least to Japanese ears). Actually GOMUTI 15A turns out better.
>Cameron_Farlow: CILORTV K1 VIC.R +20 476
>Andrew_Fisher: MNRTU 2A RUM +14 499
>Cameron_Farlow: LOT 6A LOT. +14 490
#note Looks as though Cameron played the optimal endgame with CILORTV.
>Cameron_Farlow:  (NT) +4 494
