#note IMBIBE is a funny word. I was trying to decide whether to withhold the T here, or play to the T instead. It's pretty close.
>Eric_Tran: KU 6I UK. +17 81
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEEIOT 9G OBE +17 51
#note Missed BOITE.
>Eric_Tran: EINSSUV M2 NIVEUS.S +74 155
#note Eh. It's not even spelled correctly! Oh well. The word was familiar but I didn't know what it meant. In retrospect, I should have considered that the board was starting to get crappy and a challenge might not hurt me too bad.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIILNT 10I LI.E +10 61
#note L8 (T)I in the sim. I checked EEILNT? and it does have a lot of bingos that can play to jO, but still. I try not to make one tile fishes unless I have a really strong leave like retina/tisane/satire.

#note Ruh roh.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAFOOOY D11 .OOFY +30 160
>Matthew_Larocque: AAFOOOY --  -30 130
#note I knew this was no good... I really should refrain from playing short phonies against players who are assuredly going to challenge them off.
>Eric_Tran: JSU 15F JUS +45 237
>Matthew_Larocque: AAFOOOY D9 FO.AY +22 152
#note I guess I should leave these letters open, but then do I just exchange here?
>Eric_Tran: ELR 10C L.RE +14 251
>Matthew_Larocque: AADDEOT C13 ADO +18 170
#note DOATED. That's really the only good play here, but I whiffed DUKE the entire game.
>Eric_Tran: GOY B13 GOY +32 283
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDERTW E8 WA..D +17 187
#note This doesn't really accomplish anything, being blind to DUKE just kills me. WARTED and TRACED.
>Eric_Tran: Z L1 Z. +21 304
>Matthew_Larocque: CEGRTTV -CGVTR +0 187
#note I dunno, I kept a T because there's none left in the bag as opposed to 2 unseen Rs.
>Eric_Tran: IIOOO -IIOOO +0 304
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIIPT N6 PI +22 209
#note What else do I do, another exchange?
>Eric_Tran: DNOOR O5 RONDO +26 330
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEGIT J1 I.E +5 214
#note I need some hooks...
>Eric_Tran: CH 1H CH. +24 354
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEGTW 3H EW. +10 224
#note ETW(E)E never even thought of that.
>Eric_Tran: FL H1 .L.F +13 367
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGIMT 1N EM +14 238
#note Sim is saying just grab some points, I guess I'm too behind for a bingo to make any difference anyways.
>Eric_Tran: IIIOO -IIIOO +0 367

#note Really, just shoot me already.

#note LENTI(GO) is too cool. Or even LATI(GO). (E)NTAIL would have still been much better than this.

#note I went way over on time here..... thankfully this is only one of a couple of rough games I had in Calgary.
