#note 2 points less and doesn't leave a DLS open. I don't need him getting power tiles and end up beating me by enough.

#note FAIRLEA(D)...
>Matthew_Ridout: DENORRS 11E .DORNERS +68 94
#note FOLIAR + DRONERS is good.
>Avery_Mojica: AAELORT G5 ROT. +21 64
#note AREOLATE. I felt kind of lazy knowing I had a comfortable lead I guess. This is much more fun than everything... except AREOLATE.

>Avery_Mojica: AEGGNOQ -GOQ +0 96
#note The only exchange that made it onto the sim. I didn't feel like keeping a Q on such a closed board. He seems to be drawing well, and it can easily turn into a consonant heavy game, thus making me lose by enough to lose the tournament. That Omaha tournament has made me more cautious...

>Avery_Mojica: AEEGGNS 5G ..ENGAGES +72 168
#note The only bingo. He complimented me on this.
>Matthew_Ridout: ACENRRT N1 CANT.RER +74 223
#note He debated between this and RECANTER. Dammit, of course the one he plays is a phony. Should have challenged.

#note RADIX is best.
>Matthew_Ridout: EEEEHIT A11 .HITE +45 336
#note He said this was his rack.
>Avery_Mojica: ?DIINTU C9 T..IN +26 306
#note Wasn't sure about MUTINIeD.
>Matthew_Ridout: ES 14C ES +15 351
#note He said he was setting up for a play beginning with I at the bottom. He drew poorly and I knew I had to block.
>Avery_Mojica: ?DINTUY F11 .UTY +16 322
#note Like that.

#note Wow, this sims second to VIAND, which I would have played, had I seen it. I wasn't entirely concerned with winning, just not losing by too much. I couldn't find a bingo in the pool, but knowing that he plays many bingos that I haven't heard of, I figured there may be something out there just waiting for him. No risk. VIAND is still preferred.
>Matthew_Ridout: EEG J1 GEE +15 366
>Avery_Mojica: ?BDFIIN 12C .F +10 338
#note I figured when he exchanged with 8 in the bag, the Q had to be one of them. I found the best plays, but I liked this one-tile play, leaving me with Is in case I get the Q and somehow have a way to play it.
>Matthew_Ridout: QSU 13L SUQ +27 393
#note One space to the left...

>Matthew_Ridout: EIIL L3 .I. +12 431
#note LEI 6I fits very well.
>Avery_Mojica: D M7 ..D +8 392
#note VANED is one point better. Not 159, but enough to get one more win for him. gofightWIN
