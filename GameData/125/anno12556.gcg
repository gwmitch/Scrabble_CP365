#note Not happy that he bingoed, but happy that he was courteous enough to give me an H to play to.
>Sam_R: DIILO E6 LI.OID +30 174
#note Very nice play.
>Matt: ?EKNPRV 12A PERK +38 205
#note PENK# may have given me a better chance, given my next couple of draws.
>Sam_R: FOR A12 .ROF +27 201
>Matt: ?CFINNV H4 FINC. +14 219
#note Yeah, I don't know why I didn't play VINCA instead.  That's the play.  FINNAC# would have been nice to know as well.
>Sam_R: RT 6J T...R +16 217
#note Well he's close to something.
>Matt: ?DNNRTV -DNV +0 219
#note I kept too many consonants once again.  Keep just R?, you'd think I'd have learned my lesson from last game.
>Sam_R: EINNRST G13 .N +4 221
#note Setting up a second S lane, he must have EINNRTS.
>Matt: ?ELNRTW D7 L.WN +19 238
#note TWEEN looks like a good play, to set up another lane and score 7 more.
>Sam_R: EINRSTT O6 STINTER +87 308
>Matt: ?EGJNRT B11 J.ER +28 266
#note That was another unfortunate draw.  I have to keep scoring and hope to hit column O.

>Matt: ?EGMNTY H12 E.GY +34 300
#note This blocks my best bingo lane, but Quackle still thinks it's my best option.  Maybe ORGY instead?
>Sam_R: ?DEELSU M8 SEcLUDE +82 409
#note That's game.
>Matt: ?AMNOTY D12 ..T +7 307
#note Fishing for AMMONIFY.  I can play MANY etc. next turn, most likely.
>Sam_R: BEIV G3 VIBE +24 433
#note He had the I and blocked the spot anyway, oh well.
>Matt: ?AAMNOY L12 MANY +39 346
>Sam_R: GLOTUVW 5G ..G +6 439
#note Blocking my only out.

>Matt: ?ACO 7J A.t +18 364
#note I should block N13 plays, but I thought this was cute, and I can still go out in 2 places next turn.
