#note best.. his win% is now up to 94% with 14 tiles left. and i now have a beautiful rack to work with.
>Mike: AIIILRU H11 .URAL +15 328
#note rURAL leaving me III is horrible i guess and i now have a 0.6% chance of winning. but i'm down 77 so i need to score here or he is going to outrun me.. i also want to leave myself bingo lanes because i know i'm going to need one to catch up. quackle prefers an exchange of everything but A.
