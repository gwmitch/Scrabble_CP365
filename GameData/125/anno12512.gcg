>E_Tran: ARRTTTU -RTTU +0 0
#note Against a 1400 rated, I want to maximize my chances of bingoing early, and taking control.  Quack 2ply likes my play; quack 4ply likes RUT or TUT.  I stand by exchange.
>Wayne_C: AFY 8G FAY +18 18
>E_Tran: ABOOQRT F6 BOOR +22 22
#note Didn't consider BOO, which sims slightly better.  But, don't mind my play.  Sets up QAT for 30 next turn.
>Wayne_C: ADEGILN I4 DELA.ING +65 83
>E_Tran: ALMQTTU 5I .QUAL +28 50
#note 2ply Sim likes M(E)LT, keeping QATU.  QAT still scores 30, but I wanted to force the board open.  This also creates a hotspot at 4L, to balance out the hotspot at H1.
>Wayne_C: EIKL H1 LIKE +31 114
>E_Tran: EHMOTTW 4L MEOW +36 86
#note MEOW > METH.  Quackle agrees.  W makes it tougher for him to use the TWS.  HTT is bad balance, but goes well with the W on the board.
>Wayne_C: EFIO 11G FO.IE +18 132
>E_Tran: ADEHTTV O1 THA.ED +39 125
#note Ugh.  OVATE and VATTED open the board more, and keep a better leave.  I was too focused on points, but should go for rack management and opening the board while behind.
>Wayne_C: AEGU 12D AGUE +15 147
>E_Tran: ALNORTV 11A VOLTA +24 149
#note Didn't see NOV(EL)LA, but would play it if I saw it.  Same with LOVAT.  My plan was to open the board even more, but this is still not that good.
>Wayne_C: BPU 13B PUB +19 166
>E_Tran: DEEINNR A7 ENDI.E +33 182
#note Uggh.  Didn't see LINED/LINE until the next turn.

>E_Tran: CEJMOOT 11M J.T +10 317
#note My plan is to fish for O(V)ERCOME, which he may not see. Champ says 7C MOJ(O) wins 17% of the time.. I am skeptical.  The other plays I thought worth playing was O11 MOJO, and hoping he doesn't have an S or ?, or JET 14A and hoping to get a miracle also.
>Wayne_C: ARY C2 .ARY +20 388
>E_Tran: CDEMOOR 4A CO.MED +28 345
#note Phony.  Figured he wouldn't challenge in the endgame.  Sim says CODE 14E is best
