#note REFEEL, FEEL, and PEGBOX all sim better than REEF. Does the L make the leave that much worse? I guess REFEEL makes some sense... five more points, turnover for the blanks and 3 esses, plus all the I's and N's unseen to improve the worth of the G.

#note Quackle likes OPE wayyyyy better than LOPE here. With all the A's and eight I's unseen, keeping the L is very important for hitting a bingo, and leaving off the L also gives me a lane to end a bingo in G. I thought setting up my E was a good idea with few unseen, but many of my bingos are going to have the E in an early position, so the hook isn't that valuable.

#note Maybe M(U)N or MIR/LOPER to hold onto my E. VENT still sims best though - best way to get rid of the V.

#note ANILIN/AGON is pretty cool, blocking the AGO hooks and partially blocking the HARIANA lanes. NIHIL sims well too... the G is a pretty usable lane.
