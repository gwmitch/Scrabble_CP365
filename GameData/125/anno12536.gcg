#note Hahaha. I blanked on DUMBO. GRANDS plays for 30, although I'll admit I wouldn't have been sure about the pluralization. I usually don't mind keeping a leave like RNS and this is a little more defensive. But GADS would have made more sense.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ANV C2 VAN +20 36
>Matthew_Larocque: IIMNORS 9F MI.IRONS +64 114
#note Really happy I found this. The only other 8 with this rack is IMPRISON. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: CLT K8 C.LT +12 48
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEGIOT 10A hOGTIED +71 185
#note I didn't look for every single bingo, this seemed like a pretty good choice for limiting his scoring options. Simulation likes the -IEST bingos a little better at M3 but it's negligible. I forgot INGOTED was a word, and I also didn't know GRODIEST.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: UUU -UUU +0 48
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEINQY M7 QI. +22 207
#note Wow, did I seriously miss the 32 point spot? But open esses are pretty dangerous so I suppose this isn't completely awful. (h)YAENA is actually second in the sim, I didn't know that spelling. Even though I have two q spots, should I really be concerned about him playing through that blank H?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: GIJN B6 JING. +29 77
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEENTY 6D .TY +31 238
#note I figured this wasn't that good a play, but again I didn't know (h)YAENA, and I didn't really want to keep the Y. So I just opted to use it for points now.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: FX 7A F.X +21 98
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAEENU 4H .AUNAE +18 256
#note That F really bailed me out, but now I'm worried he's going to play something like A(N)IL.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AL 2A LA. +12 110
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEPRR A1 P.EBE +36 292
#note I didn't know (C)E(I)BA which looks a little cooler, but gives him another spot to bingo.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?AELOPT 11H PLO.TAgE +59 169
#note He also had PELOTAs for 65, APOsTLE for 74 and Ou(T)LEAPT for 72. He probably wanted to stick the E right between the TWS squares though because he's so behind.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAERRRT O8 ARR.AR +21 313
#note Kinda have to do this. I should have checked my tracking though - TEAR(E)R, RET(E)AR,  because there's only 1 A unseen and 5 Es. Or TERRA(E) for 18 which doesn't give him anything to hook or play to - but I didn't know it :(
>Siri_Tillekeratne: CEIU D8 CU.IE +20 189
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHNOST H11 .HONE +42 355
>Siri_Tillekeratne: HOY 3L HOY +27 216
>Matthew_Larocque: ADISTTU 15C DAUTI.ST +60 415
#note Good god. I played this really fast, and I knew it was phony. And I know Siri has a good enough word knowledge to challenge off garbage like this. AND I had a valid common bingo in SITUATED. He didn't challenge it which is shocking, but it's still a really stupid play.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: K I3 K. +11 227
>Matthew_Larocque: IOOVWWZ 14B WIZ +44 459
#note I missed the other spot for WIZ so I thought I needed to play it immediately.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EEENRRS O1 RES +19 246
#note RESEEN scores 31, it's probably his best bet.
>Matthew_Larocque: EOOVW 2J VOW +26 485
#note I flip-flopped between this and WO(N), but I should played something in the lower right corner to disrupt all his out plays - I didn't have time to analyise it that much. I incorrectly added my score up to 483.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EENR 5J NE +10 256
#note Luckily he misses all of them.
>Matthew_Larocque: EO L11 .OE +6 491
#note I finished with 2 seconds left - there's 6 better places to play here.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ER) +4 495
