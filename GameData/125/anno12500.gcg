>Eric: DFOW 8H DOWF +22 22
>Matt: ABDEGNQ 7E DEBAG +22 22
#note Yeah, play BANGED and give myself an extra shot at an I or U, plus he doesn't get 29 easy points next turn.
>Eric: EH 6E EH +29 51
>Matt: ?GNNQTU 5B TUNG +20 42
#note No letter that I need for QUANTONG :(.  (GO)NG isn't a bad idea, and I think it's too early to burn the blank for just 40 right now.  
>Eric: EGIT 4A TIGE +21 72
>Matt: ?ENQRVZ -NQV +0 42
#note I kept the Z with the idea of using it at B6...but didn't see fRITZ apparently.  Even with the awful leave that's worth doing.
>Eric: IIIII -IIIII +0 72
>Matt: ?EEERWZ 6H REZ +40 82
#note WEEZERs*: (n) They look just like Buddy Holly.  Didn't like giving him a 40 point counterplay after my bingo, and the duck agrees, slightly preferring ZEE to my play, then WhEEZER.
>Eric: AIQR K8 .AQIR +34 106
>Matt: ?EEEIMW A1 WEE. +21 103
>Eric: ADLY 12I LA.DY +18 124
#note Of note; LA(IT)Y for 38.
>Matt: ?AEIKMV 3D KIVA +19 122
#note I was pretty sure that KIEV# took an E (it does), so I decided to make him use an S to hit H8, plus give myself an extra bingo lane.  
>Eric: AMORS 8A ROAMS +36 160
>Matt: ?EIMOOP 4G IPOMOEa +78 200
>Eric: AHY 5K YAH +34 194
#note Recorded as 34, but I gave him 10 extra points to put him at 204 (again, I can't add).
>Matt: AEFIIRU 10I FI.UE +19 219
>Eric: OX B1 OX +41 235
>Matt: AEINRSS 13E SARNIES +82 301
#note I thought there were others in this alphagram, but it's just ARSINES and SARNIES# (AEIRSST is the one with lots of CSW-only words).  
>Eric: JNN C7 J.NN +20 255
#note Scored as 19, so I have him at 9 more points than he should have.
>Matt: AAEINUV 12C UVEA +18 319
#note MAUVE is the play, does what I set out to do and scores 6 more.  
>Eric: ILO 10C .OIL +6 261
>Matt: AIINOTT A6 TO.I +4 323
#note I didn't know TRITONIA# at the time, but even if I had there's no way I'm playing it after his last fish and S? unseen.  T(aH)INI is a play I wish I had looked at though, that blocks row 2 bingoes, which are a bigger threat than the R, and doesn't open up column O in the process.  
>Eric: BU H13 .UB +15 276
>Matt: AILNOST 2G TALIONS +62 385
#note There are so few vowels left that I should be in good shape, even though I'm emptying the bag. 
>Eric: ?CCEELR M7 CRE. +10 286
#note Holy crap...find the bingo.  It's Collins-only, but certainly is a word in use in North America.  If he managed to find it, we'd be tied by my count, but upon a recount I'd win by 9.  As it was he only had a minute left.
>Matt: DNPRTT M7 ....P. +13 398
>Eric: ?CEL 15D CeLE. +11 297
#note 14B plays are 1 more.
>Eric:  (DNRTT) +12 309
#note Final score recorded as 398-318.
