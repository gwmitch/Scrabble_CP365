>Wayne_Clifford: EJU 8H JEU +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: ADDGLSS I4 GLAD.D +13 13
#note Wow, I never even considered that this might be phony. Neither did Wayne. I hated giving him free points but I wanted to turn some tiles rather than playing something like G(E)D.
>Wayne_Clifford: OY J5 OY +28 48
#note Well I have the X, so I don't have to worry about that now!
>Matthew_Larocque: FGNOSSX K6 SOX +34 47
#note FOX is the obvious play here right? But I kept looking at SOX and it seemed like Wayne would score next to nothing unless he had an -ING word. It also sheds my duplicate S. It didn't really work out, but I opted for defense over brute scoring which I don't usually do. *shrugs*.
>Wayne_Clifford: IIII -IIII +0 48
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BEFGNS 6H F... +10 57
#note Or perhaps just exchange....
>Wayne_Clifford: ?AEINPT 4B TAPErIN. +72 120
#note I needed for that to not happen.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BEGNSV C3 G.NEV +26 83
#note No bingos here - V + B really kill it.
>Wayne_Clifford: AOZ H1 AZO. +39 159
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BELPSY 2F BE.YL +27 110
#note Hahaha, I thought this was a word too! Wayne didn't know either. I missed the only bingo of PAYABLES. Both placements sim worse than a few short plays including this phony, though. I totally missed BYS 8A.
>Wayne_Clifford: EH 5E HE +21 180
>Matthew_Larocque: ?HIIPSS K2 SIP +25 135
#note What the hell, why didn't I know PISH? that's 49! PIS also scores 25 and isn't phony.
>Wayne_Clifford: MT G2 .M.T +22 202
>Matthew_Larocque: ?HIOSUU 4K .IU +10 145
#note This is pretty iffy. Exchanging might yield better results, especially since I can't even s-hook this. But there's also no letters to even play through.....
>Wayne_Clifford: NO 3K .ON +12 214
>Matthew_Larocque: ?HLOQSU 9G HO. +20 165
#note Wow, I missed QUO(D). Seriously. Sim actually likes H(E). Drawing either R or A gives me SQUALOR. But like I'd actually think of something like that in a game >_>
>Wayne_Clifford: EFI 10F FIE +29 243
>Matthew_Larocque: ?KLQRSU 8A RUSK +49 214
#note Hey I finally noticed I could score here.
>Wayne_Clifford: ADENNT 11B TANNED +26 269
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BELQWW -BLQWW +0 214
#note Uh, I didn't see WEB for 28. Or (T)EW for 29. I think I just decided to exchange before even looking for any plays. But since the W scores on this board keeping one isn't as bad an idea as it seems.
>Wayne_Clifford: RV 6B R.V +8 277
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEIRR B10 A.RIA +14 228
#note I see AIRFARE, I didn't know the second bingo in this rack. I was sure there'd be more than 2. RAIA 12A has a small edge over other plays. Yeah I like that.
>Wayne_Clifford: EEILRST 12F RETILES +80 357
#note Bleh.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEEMRW 11K MEW +26 254
#note I never even thought to move my play over to the left - MEWED scores 40. I need places to bingo though.
>Wayne_Clifford: CO M9 CO. +11 368
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CDEGRR 10L R.C +14 268
#note I really liked this - there's next to nothing he can do to block it completely.
>Wayne_Clifford: BIO A13 OBI +21 389
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEGORU O6 GROUsED +85 353
#note Or DROGUEs, GOURDEs. I didn't know either anagram.
>Wayne_Clifford: AW B2 WA. +15 404
#note Wayne thought for quite a long time. In his effort to block QA(T).....
>Matthew_Larocque: AALQT A1 QAT +45 398
#note !
>Wayne_Clifford: EIINT H12 .INT +12 416
#note He missed his out play. In fact, this isn't one of his winning plays - he has several and several that produce a tie. Lucky for him that....
>Matthew_Larocque: AL C13 LA +15 413
#note I went over on time. I figured I already lost and got lazy, so I didn't even care if I lost timer points. Getting QAT for 45 was completely shocking. I figured I was gonna lose at least one game this way, anticlimactic as it is. Everything was scored correctly too, so a recount would have kept my win! 
>Matthew_Larocque:  (EI) +4 417
