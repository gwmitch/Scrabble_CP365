#note Considered LOW, POW, and PLOW. Wasn't sure of REPLOW and OW. I liked this better than LOW/POW because I thought it made scoring harder for her. It's probably between this and OW.

>Noah: AEFOORY C10 .OOFY +26 101
#note I thought about this play for awhile. I really thought she would find STARTLE, so it seems fine to give her FLATTERS. Turns out OFAY or OY would've worked out better.

#note I also considered ENDUE but I don't really see why I should open all this good stuff for her when DEINU? hits plenty of bingos already.

#note Blocks shit and keeps a pretty good leave given the remaining tiles. The S hook is somewhat annoying but something like RAVEN still gives her plenty of good plays.
>Charley: IV H6 VI.. +13 288
>Noah: ?AABCGN L3 GAB +17 343
#note DIdn't think of KAGU, which looks pretty good. There's not really a good reason to open up column M.

#note Actual rack. Seems like a good play to me.
