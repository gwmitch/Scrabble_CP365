>Matthew_Larocque: DEGIRTU --  -64 4
#note Ugh. I kinda knew this wasn't going to work, but I was really liberal with my phony playing this time around. It almost never worked either, meanwhile my opponents slipped a whole ton of phonies on me! Not good.

#note Oh for f***  sake. This is just embarassing. At first I thought she played ReSLA(T)ED. Then I held when I saw she didn't. Why wouldn't she just play ReSLA(T)ED if this was a phony, though? Didn't make sense. So I figured I must be forgetting some basic anagrams. This might as well be labeled as a forfeited game too. That's 3 games out of 4 losses in early bird 1 that I basically just resigned and let my opponent win.
