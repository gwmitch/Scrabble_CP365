>Matt: IOPSTTY 8D POTTY +26 26
#note If I'm psychic, 8H is better.
>Ben: CDKS E7 D.CKS +24 24
#note As I had suspected, he confirmed this was a vowelless rack. 
>Matt: BEEIIRS 9C BI.E +17 43
#note He blocked BOISERIE and IBERISES# (plural of IBERIS#) doesn't quite fit.  DIEB# is 3 more.
>Ben: AHOX F11 HOAX +35 59
>Matt: ?EIIRST 11E ..IRTIESt +72 115
#note TRImIXES is 78, but this is fine.
>Ben: AGJ E13 JAG +29 88
>Matt: DEEIMOS G13 MEE +33 148
#note I wanted to grab this spot, ME gave easy access to the triple, and MED was imbalanced.  Quackle prefers the better balancing of EMO#/MOE# along row 10.  Scored as 34 - really, I can't add.
>Ben: ARUW 10K WAUR +17 105
>Matt: DINOPSV 15A OPIN. +27 175
#note PID(DOCKS) is awesome.  If I want to take a triple, ENVOI is better.  
>Ben: EGRW 9I GREW +22 127
>Matt: DEHNSUV 12L HUED +42 217
#note Very lucky to draw the H right then.
>Ben: FOST 8L SOFT +36 163
>Matt: EMNNOSV 15G .NVENOMS +92 309
>Matt: DEIILOR (challenge) +5 314
#note And even luckier to draw into that.  +5 for the challenge, and it lead to a discussion on EN- and EM- words after the game.
>Ben: DFI 14J FID +33 196
>Matt: DEIILOR 14A IO +14 328
>Ben: ANQU O4 QUAN. +24 220
>Matt: ADEILRT 10B DIR. +22 350
#note That's an awful miss, especially when he played the stupid extension next turn.
>Ben: AIL O1 ALI..... +51 271
>Matt: AEILORT J2 RETAILO. +62 412
#note But I luckbox into this anyway.  Just that kind of game.
>Ben: COZ 11A COZ +31 302
>Matt: ?ABELNR H1 uRBANEL. +89 501
#note Can you find all the bingoes that extend to the Y?  Only one of the 4 other solutions besides uRBANELY is CSW.
>Ben: AAGNTUV 4D GUAV. +18 320
>Matt: EEELY K3 LEY +26 527
#note 5 more points at 12B.
>Ben: ANT N1 NAT +14 334
>Ben:  (EE) +4 338
#note Final score recorded as 528-338.  Eventually I have to get a score correct, right?
