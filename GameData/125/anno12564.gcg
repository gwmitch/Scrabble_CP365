>Jim_Burlant: ACENNOO 8F COON +12 12
#note So Jim has already posted his racks in this game. I'm going to copy his commentary for his turns while adding my own on some of mine. His quotes will be in quotations. 

"Didn't occur to me to dump the rack, but that's what Quackle says I should do. Q's preferences are 8D CANOE or NEOCON. At any rate, this set a very interesting sequence into motion."
>Matt_Canik: AILPTUY 9G PYA +27 27
#note Quackle likes PIU. 
>Jim_Burlant: AAENNTT 7H TANNATE +69 81
#note "The only other placement is at 10A for 66. Despite the board position I felt that it beat the alternative of potentially giving him a 3x3 for 3 fewer scoreboard points. At about 1000 iterations, these two plays sim identically. Given his next rack, 10A looks an awful lot better."
>Matt_Canik: HIKLTUW 8L WITH +55 82
#note HUTLIK(E) is also 48, but I prefer this play nonetheless. 
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINSS 10A CASEINS +68 149
#note "I saw 8's in this and it took almost 3 or 4 minutes just to find this, such is my ability to see 7's these days. 10B INCASES scores 7 more and wouldn't have given him so much back. I whiffed on it."
>Matt_Canik: KLLPRRU A7 PLU.K +39 121
>Jim_Burlant: AEEFRST C7 FEA.TERS +82 231
>Matt_Canik: ADELRRZ D4 RAZED +44 165
>Jim_Burlant: BDENOTV E1 VOTED +26 257
#note "Score-wise, any of my options score between 24 - 30 points and from that perspective this is as good as anything else. Q doesn't like this much, saying I should hold the V and play something at 3D like BOND or BOD. I saw the B hook on RAZED - I wanted to unload the V."
>Matt_Canik: BIJLRUU 2B BIJ.U +32 197
>Jim_Burlant: BEINOOT B12 BOO +20 277
#note "Hated what this did to the board given how promising my leave was, but I didn'tsee much else. Q also likes F4 BOO for 16, but this is best."
>Matt_Canik: ?ALMRRU 1A RAM +23 220
#note This was a really tough and important turn, I felt. Options to me seemed limited to MAUL 6I 26, RAM 1A 23, or BERM 16 ALRU?. I wanted to keep trying to score a lot, but I also wanted to hold well enough to bingo very soon. Sim likes MAUL by 1.5 points, but I stick by ram to keep J and K open better. 
>Jim_Burlant: MO 6N MO +21 298
#note "No 8's anywhere. Between board blindness to 3C and wanting to make sure that something in SH didn't come down at O1, this was my choice. Quackle doesn't like this at all, docking me nearly 10 (!!) points to 3B OM, but this choice kept this game from getting away from me right here."
>Matt_Canik: ?FILORU J1 FLUORI.s +70 290
#note I can't believe he just blocked FLOURISH. He had the entire board to play on, and he played there!?!?!?
I see the SWITH spot first, then worry about its validity for almost two minutes before deciding I couldn't chance it and had to take the safe choice. If I had had a second bingo lane that he couldn't block after another turn, I think I would have been confident enough to try SWITH. 
>Jim_Burlant: DEINRRT 1J .INDER +33 331
#note "And had he played at K1 for 10 more points, I'd be coming back with INTRUDER on row 3 for 70 and the game would almost be over. As for this choice - Q gives slight preference to DRIFTER 1G for 3 more, but in reality any of the row 1 plays - DRIFTER, REFIND, FRIEND, THIS, RIFTED, REDFIN - any of them are as good as any other. In retrospect this could have been a hair dangerous because of the X."
>Matt_Canik: EEGHIIO 3A HOG +31 321
#note This was another really hard play. I need to keep scoring desperately, but this holds EEII. I check the v:c ratio in the bag and it's quite consonant-heavy, so I thought this was a risk worth taking. 
>Jim_Burlant: DGILRTU 3I G.ILT +16 347
#note "Normally I'd want to unload the U. Q likes 4J OUTRIG, 12B BEDRUG (too risky given the crap that landed in my rack and the fact that some good tiles are still unseen), 4H GLOUT, and 3I GUILD. But with Q unseen and a board that could get Q-unfriendly in a hurry, I wanted to hold the U. This is a strong choice, but I should have played off the D instead for 2 more points. 55% to win."
>Matt_Canik: AEEIINQ 5C Q..I +14 335
#note The Q needs to be dumped badly, but I have to score points. I think this is a play I need to make. Quack favors exchanging 7 by a point. 
>Jim_Burlant: DEGLRSU F10 .U +2 349
#note "And now I completely throw the game away. I felt hamstrung and had no idea what was right here. If I opened up and landed a bunch of vowels while he had the X, I'd be dead; I was fixated on doing something about BIJOUX/XI or something like that. I didn't see BEDRUG, I didn't like 10I LUG because of what it did to the board, and none of my other options scored enough to justify turning the tiles in my mind - especially with all those unseen E's and/or the V in the bag. So I opted to fish off the U, look for an E or blank (a 5 in 14 shot given the unseen pool) so I could hopefully play LEDGERS on row 10 for the win. One other factor was in play: time mismanagement on my end. Because it took way too long to to find CASEINS, and trying to figure out what to do with all the no-go's, I was under 30 seconds. Best is BEDRUG 12B or E10 IGLU, neither of which I saw. Those both look a helluva lot better than this. This play, which essentially amounted to a passed turn, cost me the game."

I actually thought there was a decent chance he was trying to set up his X here, except the only play it set up was S(I)X, which I didn't think he'd set up since it burns the S. 
>Matt_Canik: AEEEIIN 5H EE.IE +10 345
#note I just didn't see AERIE for some ridiculous reason. 

I thought NU could have been an X-setup, but then I looked at the pool and saw the only thing it actually set up was S(I)X, so I felt safe. 
>Jim_Burlant: DEGLRSY G2 SLY +22 371
#note Now I'm down to 15 or 20 seconds. I wanted to make sure he couldn't hit me with BIJOUX/XI or something - pretty stupid considering the possbility of NIX F9 that my ill-conceived fish gave him. Best is apparently F4 GID. Surprsingly this isn't a bad choice, and it wins 58%. Given my next draw it wins 0.
>Matt_Canik: ?AAEINW 9K WANE +24 369
>Jim_Burlant: DEGRVX 10N DE +19 390
#note "Down to three seconds, and I ahdn't even figured out what I would do if the X was in the bag, so I didn't even see the obvous X dumps. Best is obviously D14 X, but courtesy of my misplaying the late game, it's just a handful of points of spread at this piont. Tip of the hat to Matt for staying in it and outplaying me late. I sure didn't deserve this one, given how poorly I played the late game."

Thanks, Jim, but it took a fair amount of luck on my end too.
