>Matthew_Ridout: APSZ H6 SPAZ +30 30
#note This is a memorable game.
>Avery_Mojica: AAGIPRU 6A PIRAGUA. +65 65
#note This is why. He hadn't seen this before, so if it got challenged off, I'm left with a pile of crap, and he can do a lot of things. And yet it's good. This is only the start of my revenge for Omaha. All in good fun, though.
>Matthew_Ridout: EW -  +0 30
>Avery_Mojica: ADNOSTU C6 .OTUNDAS +72 137
#note Sims equal to ASTOUND (I9), but this is a bit more defensive. 
>Matthew_Ridout: EW A6 .EW +24 54
>Avery_Mojica: ADDJNOR D2 JORD.N +30 167
#note I don't know why I liked this so much... It does sim clearly better than anything else (5 points up from JARGON, 2 game points less), but it doesn't look too special in most ways.
>Matthew_Ridout: CHT 12A CH.T +24 78
>Avery_Mojica: ABCDELY 3C C.LBY +32 199
#note Missed CYCLED (A10) which is the clear winner. This is second.
>Matthew_Ridout: AELOSTT 7H .ALETOTS +62 140
#note Held and released.
>Avery_Mojica: ?ADEINU I9 AUDIENt +71 270
#note I looked for so long and for some reason could not find (S)INUAtED or UNbIA(S)ED. I did find UNRAISED but doubted it too much. I had a new plan. If I played my AUDIENT, it opens up 2 triple lanes, and each has a possibility of a triple-triple. I probably liked this a lot more since I triple-tripled round one. It works out.
>Matthew_Ridout: IVW K5 VI.W +20 160
#note Because that's all he did.
>Avery_Mojica: EFGMORT O1 FORGET. +39 309
>Matthew_Ridout: FOO A12 .OOF +27 187
>Avery_Mojica: AEEIIMR 15D EMERI.I +27 336
#note This is another one of my favorite plays of the tournament. Two Is, two Es, and it ends with one of each. Awesome. AMIE H12 and AIRTIME 15F are a little better.
>Matthew_Ridout: AH 14E AH +30 217
>Avery_Mojica: AAGKLNU 12H K.ANG +30 366
#note DANK 5D and KA H12 are best.
>Matthew_Ridout: EEIINRT N5 RE.INITE +68 285
#note Another bingo I hadn't heard of at the time, but I was too far ahead to care about challenging.
>Avery_Mojica: ALNOOUY O12 LUNY +27 393
#note This looked great, but it sims terribly. If I was behind, maybe I would have chosen something else. But there isn't much bingo opportunity. And if he gets one, it won't be worth much.
>Matthew_Ridout: IQS E10 QIS +34 319
#note COLBYS is acceptable.
>Avery_Mojica: AILOOVX J7 .OX +34 427
#note Cute fit, sims best.
>Matthew_Ridout: ?BEEEMR 2G BERsEEM +67 386
#note Another bingo I hadn't heard of, but it was his out play, so why not challenge?
>Matthew_Ridout:  (ADEILOV) +22 408
