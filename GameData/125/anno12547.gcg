>Matthew_Larocque: AADIMTX 8H ADMIX +46 46
#note I figured he might not know the T hook.
>Richard_Charach: BGIR -  +0 0
#note He didn't know the word!
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEMOT M6 BOTA +24 70
#note TEABO(X). Just forgot it completely. Overlapping plays like AMBO score better here. It's unlikely that he will challenge the hook now.

>Matthew_Larocque: ILNORUW 10B WINO +20 270
#note Missed the longer plays such as UNWOR(N) and LOWIN(G). But I didn't really know the latter.
>Richard_Charach: IK M13 KI +26 185
>Matthew_Larocque: ALORRUZ L12 ZOA +34 304
#note I have a few Z spots - L(ABO)UR sims right up at the top. I missed that opportunity all game.

>Matthew_Larocque: EELRRUV --  -66 304
#note Rofl. It seemed like a good way to dump these letters! Ok ok... stupid play. I should value my turns a little more than I do at times like these.
>Richard_Charach: IIUU -IIUU +0 203
>Matthew_Larocque: EELRRUV 4G VELUR. +10 314
#note L(ABO)UR/ER still there, ELVER 10H.

>Matthew_Larocque: EILRTVW 2G V.EW +18 332
#note Come on, I know WIVERN. For style - I(N)V(I)TER or (ABO)RTIVE.
>Richard_Charach: EEP B10 .EEP +9 233
#note Hmm ok.
>Matthew_Larocque: ILLRTTU C12 LITU +18 350
#note I didn't think about the Q being out.
>Richard_Charach: ??ANQSU 15B Q.ANtUmS +98 331
#note Son of a..... I wasn't sure whether this was bad, but I really wanted to challenge. I was worried about losing my J spot. I should have been more worried about him bingoing out with PILOTED or POINTED!

#note He laughs when he plays this cause he knows it's just a nonsense last ditch play.

#note I wish I had known ARRI(S).

#note Due to some math errors, this was recorded as 418 - 332. Yes, he lost 15 points from math errors that neither of us noticed. *shrugs*
