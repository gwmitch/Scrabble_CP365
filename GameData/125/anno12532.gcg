#note Maybe DAVIT instead, hard to say. DAVIT leads to more open boards but AYE implies bingo-ish tiles, so maybe it's good to limit bingo lanes here.
>Lou: ?ENNTTU I1 UNTiNTE. +68 80
#note I held this for a while but eventually let it go... and strangely after the game Lou looked it up and told me it was good! UNTeNTED is good though.
>Rafi: EMNOORT 2G NO.METRO +82 92
#note Aside from being unsure of it's validity, having this higher scoring bingo is another reason I accepted UNTiNTED.

#note Lou took a long time on PEANS and ROOD, so I started to fast play him to put on the pressure.

#note ATWAIN (which i didn't see) is another good option, although it allows some bingoes to play. I also liked BRAWLIE because it set up an X spot, which Lou would have probably fished off last turn if he had it.

#note I had 17 minutes left on my clock for this play, and I ended up using about 13 or 14 of them. First of all I figured out how many bingoes were in the pool (I saw 7 racks that played, there are 8 in total). Then I completely botched the calculation for what Lou's chances were of actually having a bingo. I think I estimated about 20-25%, when in reality the number is 15%. There's also the X to worry about, and I didn't see N(O)IL up top. Lots of things to calculate here. If I play LEI parallel to BRAWLIE, then I lose to a bingo, but block the X spot, go ahead 40, and save NOIL for 25 with the valuable A behind it. That should win 85% of the time. My play, while only allowing bingoes 2.5% of the time, will often lose if I draw an I which will happen a good portion of the time. I chose this play because I didn't see NOIL, and because it forces Lou to find a win under time pressure (he was at around 2-3 minutes left) as opposed to simply bingoing out or dropping the X for 50. Not the best play, but a good idea - it would have been much better if I's weren't an issue.

#note As it turns out, I would have lost to a bingo if I didn't block.
