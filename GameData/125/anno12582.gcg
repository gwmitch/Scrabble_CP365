#note Botched this. I had banked C11 WEND and started to look for plays through the O in GOLDEST. Decided I didn't like the leave after LOWED, and wasn't nuts about ENDOW. So I put down WEND and realised it made EY*. Then I panicked or something and played this. Yeah. No. It's a pretty mediocre play here. E11 NEW sims better than I had expected. It gives so much back on the C column...

#note Missed A6 APNEIC, which definitely accomplishes more than my play.

#note A6 ARC is the other option. I eventually want to kill both of the high-scoring bingo lines. Which is more likely to beat me?

#note Kind of silly. I hadn't tracked the tiles in ARECA yet, so I saw 4 A's unseen and the threat of a bingo on row 15 felt possible. I wasn't worried about a smallish bingo from KIDS, but a bingo from the V could beat me. Maybe I should be killing that. Still, I don't think WORN is bad. I will still outrun most worst-case scenarios.
