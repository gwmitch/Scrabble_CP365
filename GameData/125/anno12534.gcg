>Rafi: AGGNOOU 15H .OG +4 348
#note Now i just start to get silly. For some reason I rejected AGOG, even though I have an O to block next turn. Scoring 4 points to block a weak lane (not many bingoes start with N) is pointless. I don't particularly like AGOG, but I think it's the best option at this point.

#note O(K)E and EAU are simming best. I like keeping the U for Q insurance with no U's left in the bag.
>Jerry: AEIMNOT 3F AMNIOTE +69 322
#note I learned a pretty valuable lesson here. I don't think Jerry would be fishing one tile to try to hit a blank bingo - that isn't conducive to winning. However, going for a natural with the chance to pick up the blank AFTERWARDS could theoretically win the game, and was a great strategy. I should have been conscious of this and blocked the best lane for naturals (AGOG 3 turns earlier) and continued scoring to outrun any blank bingo making VAUS.

#note OPED instead maybe.
>Jerry: ?ALOPYY L14 OY +23 345
#note Jerry said I blocked PLAYbOY over AMNIOTE! I was pretty flustered at this point, and despite being 99% that NOGGY was no good, I didn't want to risk losing the game because of it.
>Rafi: ADEEIPU M12 PIE +12 406
#note I was really flustered... I convinced myself that there was a slight chance PLAQUEY (instead of PLAGUEY) was good, and decided to block just in case. Very poorly played in the second half - I was fortunate to escape with a win.
