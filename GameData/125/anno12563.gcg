#note After I played CHARTING, Oliver just kinda sat back in his chair. After starting 2-0, he had dropped his next 8 or so games, and was clearly not in a playing mood. I didn't want to extend his agony, so I just played as fast as I could on most turns.

#note Hah. My brain is tricky. I see AEILNNR and the opportunity to score 31, but for some reason I can't find LINEAR/LARINE because I didn't think to play off AEILNR...

#note I really should have played WO, but I just wanted to play in this spot so bad. I know I cost myself a healthy bit of spread, bleh.
