>Avery_Mojica: ?ALMOOT 8D MOOLA +20 20
#note The only 7 in this rack is TOMBOLA, a word which I did not know. This is the best non-bingo.
>John_Dearchs: GPU 7C PUG +16 16
>Avery_Mojica: ?DEISTT I8 STInTED +67 87
#note TwISTED, SpITTED, and ShITTED fit at 9E very nicely. DoTIEST and DEnTIST are at I3 for 69 as well. ShITTED at I7 and TiDIEST at I3 are 68. And there's a bunch of 67s.
>John_Dearchs: AGW H13 WAG +29 45
>Avery_Mojica: AEGILOP 11D EPIGO.AL +90 177
#note EPIGON is a word... I could have sworn I saw this before.
>John_Dearchs: AINTW 12B WITAN +26 71
>Avery_Mojica: EMRSSTX 6D SEXT +36 213
#note Best play
>John_Dearchs: KO B12 .OK +20 91
>Avery_Mojica: BIMRRSY 10A BRIM +15 228
>John_Dearchs: EIORU A6 OURE.I +24 115
>Avery_Mojica: BENRSYY B5 BY +28 256
#note BONEY 13A!!! I made the mistake of thinking "I have an E... I can use it next turn under WOK.. for now I can play BY and I'll be OK!" Well screw that... that doesn't work.
>John_Dearchs: CEHT 15A TECH +50 165
#note That's why.
>Avery_Mojica: ENORRSY 12K ONERY +26 282
#note This ties equal to (T)ROY without any iterations. 200 Makes ONERY win by 0.6, with it keeping a slight lead the whole time.
>John_Dearchs: OSU 5E SOU +27 192
>Avery_Mojica: ADJNRRS M8 JARR.D +30 312
#note I wanted to keep ABY open for other use, and get rid of consonants. So basically I was hoping to get another A.
>John_Dearchs: ET 8M .ET +30 222
>Avery_Mojica: EFFLNNS 14D EFF +22 334
#note EFF sims 7th with no iterations, but it goes down after 200.  (SOU)FFLE is best, and that would easily be my choice, had I seen it. I was hopeful I guess.
>John_Dearchs: ?EILNOV 4G OLIViNE +73 295
#note NOVELIs(T) is best, this comes a bit down.
>Avery_Mojica: AACNNSU O12 .UCA +27 361
#note It prefers YUAN over YUCA, even with 500 iterations.
>John_Dearchs: ADE H1 DEA. +15 310
>Avery_Mojica: AINNQSV C9 Q. +21 382
#note I might have a chance with the E.
>John_Dearchs: E 5B .E +4 314
#note There are still better places to dump.
>Avery_Mojica: AINNRSV 2G V.IN +9 391
#note I was glad to see the 7-to-8 NIRVANAS, but was upset when I realized NOUT* wasn't a word. But he was close enough to make a bingo count for the game, so I figured I'd block.
>John_Dearchs: ADEIILN 1J INLAID +26 340
>Avery_Mojica: AHNRSZ 10F ZA +66 457
#note I kind of felt bad... But I had to do it.
>John_Dearchs: E F14 .E +5 345
#note Only WEE and EWE are better.
>John_Dearchs:  (HNRS) +14 359
