#note This was a prtty crucial position. I really wanted to try and block INN. The best I could see were the plays at 13C. IBIS, probably. But I really didn't want to get drawn into the cat-and-mouse game at this point. It seemed too early to try and lock things down, and there were going to be lines that are not closable. (That E at M3.) And IBIS obviously didn't kill INN entirely. I decided to just balance my rack. I dunno, this felt like a big error in hindsight.

#note Running low on time and have no idea what to do. I don't think I can outrun the unseen power tiles, so I try to open up a bingo lane. Quackle says to go for 12K OOPS. Just shows how losy my options were.

#note I think I just have to go for an out play next turn and hope to catch him with something. It could very well work.
