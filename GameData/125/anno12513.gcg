#note Maybe REUPTAKE, to open the board more, and because it is more likely to be challenged.

#note Uggh.  Missed TURNPIKE and ERUPTION.  luckily, this draws a challonge

#note Figured now was a good time to intentionally phony.  It worked, as she kibitzed "I'm not going to challenge this time"

>Noella_W: ?DEEGIW O1 WEDGIEs +101 408
#note She makes the blank an S, giving me a good hotspot
>E_Tran: EGLNNTW H1 GN.WN +39 387
#note Figured she might not know WEDGY compares, else she would think of WEDGIER.  also, she might not even have the T.  So, I want to dump my junk, and block the best hotspot.
>Noella_W: NQU 4A QU.N +46 454
>E_Tran: AEFLLTU 8L FLAT +69 456
#note Sim obviously likes FLAT.  But, if my instinct is right and she doesn't know WEDGIEST, I could consider LUV or something, and hope to bingo out, or cash in FLAT next turn.

>E_Tran: DEILOTU 15H OUTLIED +83 539
>E_Tran: DEILOTU --  -83 456
#note Thought there was a 2-5% chance OUTLIED was good.  Had to try, this being the last game, and spread not mattering.  Champ says I5 UTE, keeping DIOL at 15F or 14J.  If I do this, I can lose with a 504!
