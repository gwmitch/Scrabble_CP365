#note Damn, a 'perfect' game up till now, but there are several better plays here. JOE J10 allows the front hook while also leaving row 14 open, and the simple JO J10 gives a leave of EEILRS which works well with the T at B2 (lots of A's or E's unseen to deliver bingos).

#note Odd position. I had failed to realise that Rod didn't take the last tile from the bag after playing PURI, so he was actually facing FNU with the final E unseen. I couldn't see a good way to block ENUF (e.g. plays underlapping the Y tend to lose to NEF anyway), but if I had chosen something like LOONIE he would actually have lost the game, dumping FUN somewhere and then being forced to take the final tile while I played out.

#note A frustrating loss. Rod has eked out tiny wins over me on many occasions, and nearly did it in Bangkok earlier this year too (had he not left open a vital lane with about four overlaps for my out-bingo, which I'd need to check my scoresheets for).
