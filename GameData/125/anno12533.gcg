#note I exchanged holding an A here because there were 6 unseen Es. Quackle thinks it's the right thing to do.

>Matt_Canik: AEESTVZ 2F ZEE +35 370
#note With the S, the A, and the lack of scoring left in the pool, this gives me a good chance at outrunning him. Quackle also suggests AZ(O)TE and ZA(R)EE(BA). 
>Orry_Swift: DEEIILR 7B RI.E +8 356
#note When he played this, I assumed he had both Ds and the G, otherwise RIVET is too easy a block. He said he didn't care if I played RIVET because he still had the R to work with. 
>Matt_Canik: AAIISTV 3C VITA +25 395
#note Wow. AVIA(R)IST. I got so fixated on him hitting a bing here that I didn't consider my own. I chose VITA here because I figured I could outrun anything he played barring a bingo, which is extrememly unlikely after VITA (Quackle says ~4%) 

Even so, I should have seen AVIARIST. Bleh.
