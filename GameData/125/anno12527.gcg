#note Missed DICLINY!  Was trying to look for those long plays, too. My play is so bad; it keeps a horrible leave; doesn't score all that much; and it gives back overlaps at the C-line.  Need to look longer here for better plays

#note Chris' actual rack.  We talked about it post mortem.  If he saw my actual rack, I'd be screwed.

#note I'm short on vowels.  I have a Q with no A, I, or U.  My J only has one good spot to play.  So lucky, it stays open.
