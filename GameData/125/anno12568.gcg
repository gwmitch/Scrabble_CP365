>Jim_Burlant: AELOORY 8H LOOEY +24 24
#note Best - nothing else worth considering.
>Steve_Glass: APY 7G PAY +26 26
>Jim_Burlant: ABGLLRR K3 GARBL. +18 42
#note No really great options available - Q feels I should take the extra points with 9I BRR.  I didn't consider anything but a rack dump.
>Steve_Glass: EISW 9I WISE +41 67
>Jim_Burlant: AJLNRRV 10F JARL +37 79
#note This scores 37, and none of the other options scores more than 22 points.  This is best.
>Steve_Glass: ENNRU H10 .UNNER +21 88
>Jim_Burlant: EINNRRV 14B NERVIN. +24 103
#note  This is a very strong choice, but two slightly better plays were available:  INNERVE 14B (which doesn't put the vowel underneath the double-word at 13C) and RIVEN M9, which scores 27.   I couldn't think of INNERVE, and I didn't see RIVEN.  RIVEN wins the sim, and this sims roughly 3  points  down and wins 1-1/2% less often than RIVEN.
>Steve_Glass: CHW C12 CH.W +24 112
>Jim_Burlant: AAEORRT 3G ARRO.ATE +72 175
#note The only bingo.  75% to wiin.  When I put this down, I felt that a good draw could really break the game wide open in my favor.  Little did I know I was about to start struggling.
>Steve_Glass: EPZ 2L ZEP +49 161
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: DFIIIIU 12A FU.I +26 201
#note Dreadful leave or not, 26 points was just too much to pass up, though I was sure crossing my fingers I didn't draw another I.   Worst case, I figured I'd play for 26 and exchange on my next turn if the draw went south.  Q agrees - godawful DIII leave notwithstanding, this is best.
>Steve_Glass: X 4K .X +56 217
#note Again - ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: DGIIIIN -III +0 201
#note I thought about this and considering rack dumps like NIDING, BIDI, etc...and the II leave scared me away from them.  Q says I should also throw the D back into the bag, and a look at the pool suggests that Q is right - there are 3 D's unseen and I could use the extra turnover to go for one of those two blanks that are unseen.   Not quite 32% to win. 
>Steve_Glass: ACEOSTU 6B COTEAUS +74 291
>Steve_Glass: ACEOSTU --  -74 217
>Jim_Burlant: DGGIIKN M9 DIKING +39 240
#note Astonished that Steve would have confused that with COUTEAU.   I figured that, after I challenged his phony off, he'd remember the legitimate bingo and put it down.  I looked long and hard and really didn't have a viable block.  Re: this choice:  I wasn't sure whether ARROGATE was a verb or an adjective, I wasn't  sure of the hooks, (turns out it takes both the D and the S) and I wasn't about to chance playing for 0 with him being about to bingo.  While the O3 placement is definitely best, this is a good consolation prize, as it scores 39, takes out a bunch of lines, and turns 6 tiles with both blanks still unseen.  The pleasant surprise is that, in the two-ply sim, when simmed against his rack of ACEOSTU, it concedes barely 1-1/2 points of equity to the O3 placement despite scoring 11 fewer points on the scoreboard.
>Steve_Glass: ACEOSTU 15A CO. +26 243
#note Steve told me after the game he talked himself out of ACETOUS.  This was a HUGE break.
>Jim_Burlant: EGHIOOT 1M HOG +32 272
#note  Best optionaccording to the duck is apparently 14J HOGGET.  38 points or not, that looks a little dangerous given that I know he's close to a bingo.   Even when simmed against his remaining AESTU, the sim also likes 2H OOH for some idiotic reason - no thanks.  4C ( HOGTIE (the sim bronze medalist) looks reasonable. This scores well, but doesn't do a good job playing the vowel overloaded pool, which is why this wins 3% less often and sims 5 points down on HOGTIE.
>Steve_Glass: ADEISTU 4A DAUTIES +72 315
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEIOT A3 I.EATE +21 293
#note And a look at this draw makes it clear why I should have played more of my vowels off on the last turn.   I really don't have much choice - this is  clearly my best play.  18% to win, probably because both blanks are unseen.
>Steve_Glass: DFT B3 D.FT +22 337
>Jim_Burlant: EIINOQS L12 QI +46 339
#note The outlook has improved somewhat, but those unseen blanks still render my outlook bleak:  I've increased my winning chances to 31%.  
>Steve_Glass: ELV J2 V.LE +27 364
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIMNOS D2 MI.OgENS +60 399
#note Not knowing what was exactly in his rack, I wanted to make sure that I didn't give him a 3x3 line to work with.    Again, I wasn't sure what back hooks ARROGATE took, so I just wanted to bingo here.  Good thing I did this, too:  had I  dared to try SENtIMO or dOMINES down the O column, those would have lost as he'd have bingoed back with AUDITORS.  This decision won me the game.
>Steve_Glass: ?ADOSTU O3 SUDATOr +84 448
>Steve_Glass: ?ADOSTU --  -84 364
#note And after going well over on time, this comes down, only to be challenged off.
>Jim_Burlant: ABEMOT 11E MO +17 416
>Steve_Glass: ?ADOSTU O3 DOUbTS +32 396
>Jim_Burlant: ABET C7 BEAT +22 438
>Jim_Burlant:  (A) +2 440
#note Steve went nearly 5 minutes over on time.  Final score 440 - 346.
