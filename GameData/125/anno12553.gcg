>Sam_K: CGLNU 8D CLUNG +22 22
>Matt: AAEEFLS H3 LEAFA.ES +63 63
#note I was willing him to play a G, and I got lucky.
>Sam_K: AEHU E8 .EHUA +16 38
>Matt: AHIMNOT D11 MHO +30 93
>Sam_K: EI D7 I.E +7 45
>Matt: AGILNTT 6H .LATTING +66 159
#note Held and released.  
>Sam_K: AEEIORT C1 ETAERIO +69 114
>Matt: ?IKOQSU N2 QUOI. +28 187
#note Whiffed on QUOIST# for 50, but the next 3 plays all burn the blank for 72.  I need to stop focusing on bingoing with the blank, and looking for bingo-like scores with it when I have an additional power tile.  
>Sam_K: EIPRY O6 .RIPEY +36 150
#note Held, then remembered the silly spelling.  You do not want to be GRIPEY in any case.
>Matt: ?BFGKNS 4L KN.B +26 213
#note Quackle wants be to keep the N if I'm going to keep the G.  
>Sam_K: EIRRSST K5 S.IRRETS +82 232
#note Well I dodged a bullet.  TRESSIER for 131.  This is phony, but it looked familiar for some reason, maybe confusing it with STIRRES#.  
>Matt: ?AFGISU N8 AUF +33 246
>Sam_K: IVW 1A VI.W +42 274
#note Blocks the 3x3 just as I get my rack into shape.
>Matt: ?EEGILS A1 .ELIGErS +86 332
#note LEESInG# C9 is a cool fit.
>Sam_K: MOW F11 MOW +21 295
#note He played this to set up MOWA# and MOWN, since the S's are gone.  
>Matt: ACDNORZ C12 CZAR +61 393
#note Yeah I was pretty lucky this game.
>Sam_K: AOPV 15A PA.VO +42 337
>Matt: DDINORX O1 XI +38 431
#note The leave is not ideal, with two more D's unseen still, but the points are too good to pass up.  
>Sam_K: JT 10J J.T +26 363
>Matt: DDNOORY 14F NODDY +31 462
#note Row 14 is pretty much the last bingo lane, and putting all those consonants together makes it very unlikely that he'll underlap in response.  He'll have to find a 9 or 10 to go out, and that just didn't seem likely on this board.  
>Sam_K: ABDENNT 1A ....DATE +45 408
>Sam_K: ABDENNT --  -45 363
#note Insta-challenged this.  He confused it with VIEWDATA.  
>Matt: ?DEOOR 15J OROiDE +26 488
#note or ODOREd or OvERDO.  
>Matt:  (DATEBNN) +20 508
#note Since I can't add, I shorted myself 2 points in the final score, recorded at 506-363.  This was Sam's first loss of the tourney and put me in first place for the time being.
