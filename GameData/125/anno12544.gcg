>Jim_Burlant: AABEIWZ 8D BAIZA +38 38
#note No bingo prone leave available, and it's just not worth giving up the 8 points to keep AABE as opposed to EW.  This is best.
>Orry_Swift: FOOT E8 .FOOT +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEMNNW I5 NEWsMEN +84 122
#note This also plays on rows 9 and 7 for 65, but this is best.  84% to win.
>Orry_Swift: EJNOY H11 ENJOY +50 66
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGORT H1 TOGAE +23 145
#note This needs an R or a B to make an 8, and ABROGATE doesn't play.  This is a reasonable play, but it's not best - I rushed this turn and didn't look hard enough to find AGORA.  The sim confirms what I suspected at the time:  AGORA, which scores identically to this, keeps a more potent ET and is best.  This is a bronze medalist and it sims roughly 3 points behind and wins 1% less often than AGORA.  The other good choice is AGMA 9G.
>Orry_Swift: EPRV 10C PR.VE +18 84
>Jim_Burlant: AAEFORX J9 AX +54 199
#note Any number of 54-point plays, but this is best.  For reference, since the board position is more or less identical, the leave is the main consideration.  Keeping unique tiles instead of unbalanced leaves like OX and EX do, win 2% less often and sim 9 and 15 points down on this.
>Orry_Swift: EGRST 5E GER..TS +32 116
#note Nice play!
>Jim_Burlant: AEFIORR 3D FAIR.OER +64 263
#note The only bingo.  98% to win.
>Orry_Swift: BSV F2 V.B.S +20 136
>Jim_Burlant: AIILSTY 2J YA +28 291
#note The only 8 in this rack is SALINITY, and it doesn't play.  I spent a while on this and couldn't come up with an I dump that I liked.   Also - besides this being my highest scoring option, it prevents something big at 2J.  Q agrees with me - given my lead I can trade some leave for defense.  99% to win.
>Orry_Swift: CIORU 1K CURIO +29 165
>Jim_Burlant: IILOOST I13 OI +15 306
#note Anything is as good as anything according to the sim - nothing stands out.  That said, if I wanted to end this game more quickly, C10 POLIO probably should have been the play as it turns 2 more tiles and sets up my S.
>Orry_Swift: AEGL 4A GALE +24 189
#note Very smart play by Orry - for the lower division players reading this game, take a look at what he's doing.  While his outlook is bleak, he hasn't given up yet, and he's keeping whatever slim chances he has alive by peppering the board with more open lines than I can defend at any one time.  
>Jim_Burlant: ILOPSTU A1 PLU. +21 327
#note SLIPOUT doesn't play, and none of the 8's (POPULIST, UNSPOILT, and SLIPOUTS) DO, either.  I was going  to play POILU 4K until GALE came down, and my first priority was to take out the A column.  IT's ither this or PIGOUTS A2.
>Orry_Swift: ILNN 4K LINN +15 204
>Jim_Burlant: ?DIOSTU N4 .OcTUIDS +62 389
#note Sad, but true:  I missed the 7 in this rack (it would have played at O4 for 80) despite alphagramming every possible combo.  After the game, Orry's comment to me:  "Jim, what word in STUDIO and a blank do you know that starts with S?"  It took me nearly a minute to even realize what he was driving at!  <<face palm>>
>Orry_Swift: DD B4 .DD +9 213
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEEEH A6 EACH +30 419
#note Quackle says my NOCTUIDS misfire still won 100%, but Orry is still doing what he can to salvage some spread, and that means creating more open lines. ISATINE, INTAKES, etc. are all possible down the A column, so shutting that down was my first priority.  Quackle's preferred play here is utterly sick and I'd have never found it:  (B)E(R)DACHE D8 scores 46.  While it doesn't do anything about the A column, it turns out it would have blocked his next play.  
>Orry_Swift: EILNSUW 15A UNWISEL. +95 308
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIKMT M9 KEET +29 448
#note Setting up my out in two.  This is best - it blocks QI M9 and guarantees me outs on row 14 as well as at K7, so I'm going to get points for his H.
>Orry_Swift: AHIQRT 14D QI +24 332
