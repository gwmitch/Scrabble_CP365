>Jeff_Fiszbein: DKSUY K5 DUSKY +34 138
#note Jeff commented after the game that he wished I'd played CORRADEs because then he could've played DUCKY for one more point and kept his S.

>Jeff_Fiszbein: CDEGINO 5G DECO.ING +63 201
>Jason: AEIILRV 4A VIRELAI +81 269
#note "Hey, that had no home!" Jeff said. :D Between the draw into ILIA and being given the spot, as Conrad would say, "that was fortunate."
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DENORST 3G RODENTS +77 278
#note As was that.
>Jason: AEHNSTY 14E ASTHENY +69 338
#note As was this. Never considered KYTHE during the game. Looks better, though, esp. with EEEEIIIITTT out for an ANS leave. This may be my first equity hit of the game; in lockstep with Speedy throughout.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AMOR 15E ROAM +46 324
>Jason: BFLOOPU 8K .LOOF +39 377
#note "Nice little shootout going," I said after I confirmed the score. "Your bullet," Jeff commented.

>Jason: BGMNPTU 13I BUMP +29 406
>Jeff_Fiszbein: BEEIOQU 2J BE +22 388
#note Slick play from Jeff, setting up his O as plan B; which I thought was plan A.
>Jason: ?GIINTZ 1F GINZo +46 452
#note BZZT! Would you believe I saw ZIG at 2E and not 2F? Got obsessed with blocking QUOTA or QUOTE, thinking that even with the QU combo Jeff couldn't gain 64 points on me once that died. Still not sure how ZIG/ZIN/ZIT at 2F win <100% of the time.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EIIOQRU B10 QUI.ER +76 464
#note Jeff finds the R he fished for, and without a bingo in response because I burned my blank, I'm sunk. Nice job by Jeff to hang in and win a game in which I got both blanks, three bingos and averaged 50+ for the first nine turns.
>Jason: AEEINTT 9A TA +21 473
#note Played 9/10 turns spot-on, but as can happen in this goofy game, it was the one blunder that killed me. Still a fun game and a good teaching moment.
