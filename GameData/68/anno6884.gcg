>Evans_Clinchy: AEGILYY 8G YAY +18 18
#note The sim is very much opposed to the short opening. GAYLY is a solid eight points better. Yikes, bad start.
>Andrew_Solomon: IIII -IIII +0 0
>Evans_Clinchy: EEGGILZ 9F LEG +14 32
#note Setting up a lane to drop my Z with the GLEG hook. EGIZ is a more awkward leave than I realized, though, and I'm only scoring 14. Sim prefers LIEGE 9E.
>Andrew_Solomon: GHI E9 GHI +20 20
>Evans_Clinchy: AEGIJNZ 7H JAG +29 61
#note Or ZA in the same spot, which sets up another G hook. They're about equal.

>Evans_Clinchy: BDINORW B10 BR.WN +32 189
#note Down 58, I wanted a play that forked two lanes open. This does the trick; WIN or WON at 13B doesn't.
>Andrew_Solomon: OO C12 .OO +22 237
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DIKOOU C7 KUDO +20 209
#note Missing SKIDOO 15C, which burns the blank for an extra 30. Should I have played it if I'd seen it? It's definitely more of a sure thing, considering that IO? isn't the greatest of bingo leaves and MOO has so many hooks that line 15 isn't likely to stay open long. But this board has so many juicy spots to bingo that burning the blank for 50 doesn't feel right to me. It's a very close call. In any event, I didn't see SKIDOO, so I played this.

#note Ouch. QUOD D11. Bad time for a bad miss.

>Andrew_Solomon: DIV E5 VID +34 346
>Evans_Clinchy: ABINOUW 3I WA. +38 355
#note ADOWN 1A is probably a little better here. Taking out the triple seems like a more pressing need than grabbing this spot.

#note Yeah, this isn't a word. I figured he couldn't risk the game challenging, since it looked like a plausible adjective, sort of. Had to block SILTIER somehow, might as well choose a creative way. This keeps multiple spots to score 22 with PA.
>Andrew_Solomon: EIILRST M9 LISTER +24 429
#note Andrew's play is best here.
>Evans_Clinchy: AP -  +0 387
#note A wise man once said that "you play to win the game." I dunno, maybe BUNCO doesn't take an S?
