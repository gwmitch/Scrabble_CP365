#note after he chose dourines over urinose, I convinced myself into thinking GIZMO was -ES.

#note Sets up hooks and I totally miss EVICTOR several times. (he does too)
>Nathan_James: AEEGN L11 AGENE +28 213
>Matt_Canik: ELMPSST 5G L.MPET +20 169
#note I screw this up hard. I suck. SIMPLEST/MISSPELT. I know LIMPET sucks here too, I just totally brainfart and can't see anything else. I was kinda intrigued by the double overlap lane this set up though, especially sitting on SS. 
>Nathan_James: ??EHORU M5 sOUtHER +75 288
#note highest-scoring non-evictor bingo
>Matt_Canik: EORSSTY N10 STORY +27 196
#note I wasn't proud of the early game, but I like what I did from this point on. He blocked (R)OYSTERS and STOREYS, so I set myself up a lane that he likely won't block. STORE(WIDE) takes home style points but.... yeah.

>Matt_Canik: ABCLNPQ 7B CL.P +13 295
#note QAT 6B seems obvious but that leaves me with BCLNP and there's no way I'll be winning an endgame with that. This leaves a few Q spots, a vowel, and a possibility of something very nice.
