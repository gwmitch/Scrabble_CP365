>Jeremy: ?EFGLPU E7 P.GEFULs +76 76
#note I wasn't sure.  It's good.
>Matthew: AEORSTX 14E .TORAXES +82 160
>Jeremy: EIIMRYY H12 MI.Y +36 112
#note -2.6 13E (L)IMEY
>Matthew: NOOUV G6 VO.OUN +12 172
>Jeremy: CEIIRYZ 13L ICY +18 130
#note -11.5 K5 ICIER.  Yeah, I guess that hook should get killed.  I'm keeping a cleaner leave.  Maybe a bingo?
>Matthew: HO 12K OH +22 194
>Jeremy: DEINORZ K4 ZONED +43 173
#note -6.5 J10 ZIN.  Putting a Z where I did is kinda dumb.  Lots of potential plays here.
>Matthew: ?AEGLTV 11I VoLTAGE +81 275
>Jeremy: IJORRSU O7 JURI.S +42 215
>Matthew: EK 4K .EK +32 307
#note this was a really good move from Matthew.  Locks down the board.
>Jeremy: ABCEORS M1 BOC. +24 239
#note -2.1 G13 B(O)O.  If I listen to Quackle I have to bingo in the I column.
>Matthew: OW 1M .OW +24 331
#note Matthew told me if the B was one over he had WEBFED.  Awesome.
>Jeremy: AEEMQRS 12A MARQ.E +40 279
#note One of those times the Q doesn't slow me down and helps me open the board.
>Matthew: ADEEF A8 DEFA.E +36 367
>Jeremy: ELNRRST B11 R.N +7 286
#note -16.3 A8 (DEFAME)RS.  I didn't consider it.  :-(  11.17% to win vs. 4.15%  Ouch.
>Matthew: AEHINRS I2 HEARIN.S +65 432
>Jeremy: DELRSTW 3C WRESTL.D +76 362
#note -3.5 2L D(O)W.  My play supposedly wins 0.87% to D(O)W winning 0.98%.  Matthew suggested DEFAMERS for this play, which is a good idea, but it's deader than both other plays.
>Matthew: OPT 2L T.PO +25 457
>Jeremy: EIIILNT D1 LI.I +10 372
#note -9 I11 (V)IT(A).  Liz was heading out and wanted her clipboard back that I had borrowed.  Since it wasn't winnable I sped up the endgame and just went for an out in two.
>Matthew: AAIITU 1D .ITAI +15 472
>Jeremy: EINT B5 TINE +9 381
#note -2 13G T(I)NE.  -53.5 equity burn for the whole game.
>Jeremy:  (AU) +4 385
