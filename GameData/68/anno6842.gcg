>Winter: ABEHRSY 7H HERBY +23 23
#note Quackle hates HERBY, but I think it makes his bingo unlikely and forces him to open in order to score. Plus I've never played him and can't rule out the possibility that he might challenge.
>Jim_Nanavati: F I6 F.. +7 17
>Winter: AAAEOPS 8K AA +13 36
#note Clearly he wants to bingo but if I kill the B, it's unlikely. AE doesn't create a hook but leaves me a crappy rack. AA takes the S (and H and L), but how likely is that? And if he does bingo, with the better leave my chances of a counterplay with my S are better.
>Jim_Nanavati: AEMPRST M8 STAMPER +77 94
#note Okay, so he's got some luck in him , but if I get my comeback it's okay.
>Winter: AEOOPQS 15L PSOA +39 75
>Winter: AEOOPQS --  -39 36
#note But I get a crap rack, which plays into my weakness and causes me to not see PASEO. Yeah, but who got the easy rack here, huh?
>Jim_Nanavati: UX N10 XU +54 148
#note Goddamn it another luckbagging.
