#note Quackle prefers UT slightly.  Also, how did I get this far in Scrabble without knowing TAUTED is a word?

>Chris: EFJNNOO 2K JO.N +22 68
#note I debated for a long time whether to play this or ENJOIN, and then chose wrong.  The play I should have been giving my attention to, however, was N2 FOE which I considered but then rejected because of the leave.
>Wallace: IO 1N OI +8 114
>Chris: AEFGLNO L11 FOG +19 87
#note This or 10I OF(T), which I didn't think of.

#note Surprisingly, there were no bingos available here.

#note Best!

>Chris: ACELORT A8 CORELAT. +89 279
#note Aargh!  Missed RELOCATE for 6 more and an opener board.
>Wallace: Q 12G Q. +22 337
>Chris: EGIMRSU 13L .UM +12 291
#note Not too enthusiastic about this play, but I don't see any better ideas though.
>Wallace: AHY 14M HAY +31 368
#note The problem with GUM is he can score, set himself up, and then, after I hit my bingo, score again in the same spot.  Or, if I don't hit the bingo, he can close the board again and I'm back where I was before, only further behind.
>Chris: EEGIORS 15N GO +30 321
#note Drat.  I want to play 3I EGO to open the board, but I can't let him score here again, can I?
>Wallace: DIKN F7 DINK +26 394
>Chris: BEEEIRS D6 BEERIES. +72 393
#note Yesss!  He blocked the wrong spot.  I have a chance now!
>Wallace: VX 11C V.X +26 420
>Chris: EFNPUYZ E3 FUZE +36 429
#note For some reason, 6B FUB sims best, which makes no sense to me.  Quackle says my play is second best, along with G4 FUZE, which I liked because it threatened the B-Y hook and blocked BIOTITe, (which it turns out is the only bingo)--but it seemed to give back too many easy scoring opportunities.
>Wallace: ?BIIOTT G1 BIOTITe +61 481
#note Oh, so he did have it after all.
>Wallace:  (ANPRY) +20 501
#note If I had played FUZE in the other spot, I would have had PYRAN to go out in two places.
