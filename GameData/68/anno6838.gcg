#note Nice find
>Chris: AFGPQRU 7E QUAG +24 146
#note Quackle prefers 1M FAG by about 4%, but I still like the defensiveness of this play.

#note Trying to save 1J BARF for next turn while preventing the double-double threat.

>Chris: BFMR J1 B.RF +25 189
#note Forgot to write down my rack for this play.
>Geoff: ?IMTTUY C8 MaTU.ITY +74 199
#note Geoff later said he saw YTTrIUM, but not the spot for it.
>Chris: AIIMNNS O1 ISM +35 224
#note I want to leave the S spot open, but at the same time, I don't want to give up any easy points at 1M after his bing.  Quackle says fishing with 8A NIM is the way to go.  -7.5%
>Geoff: ?AADIRT 13G AIRDATe +71 270
>Chris: AGINNNZ 12K ZIN +40 264
#note Seems best to score less and keep the -G hook rather than risk a big comeback with the an S or the Y.  Quackle agrees, but then tells me I forgot about 15A ZAYIN.  -5%.
>Geoff: FO 15A FO. +27 297
>Chris: AEGNNOS N6 NONAGES +77 341
#note Opting for the safer of the two placements.
>Geoff: DELU O5 LUDE +26 323
>Chris: DDEIILY 8A LI.Y +39 380
>Geoff: EV 10L VE. +7 330
>Chris: CDDEEIW A6 WI.D +8 388
#note It seemed prudent to save an extra E for extra flexibility, as I'll probably have to block next turn.
>Geoff: IR K11 I..R +26 356
#note Excellent setup.  Geoff later told me the S was still in the bag, so he was drawing blind.
>Chris: ACDEEHW 14F CEDE +21 409
#note Not so good.  I should have been more concerned about plays going to the right of IZAR than to from the left.  14M WED is fine.  Quackle prefers to counterplay with WE at 6A or B5, which I never would have thought of.  I may have forgotten to track IZAR, which would explain why I felt I had to shut down the lane.
>Geoff: AEEHOST 15K SHOAT +50 406
#note SHOTE, followed by B5 AE scores three more, but isn't enough (Geoff thought SHOTE might be Collins only).  There is a trick than can allow him to tie if I'm not careful, but it's something of a tough find.

#note That was a thrill!
