>Dorcas_Alexander: AEINRZ C3 ZANIER +45 45
#note Uh-oh--I smell the luckbag coming.
>Winter: AABDFYY D2 FAY +39 65
#note I want to leave the O hook for volatility, and I want the greater chance at a bingo with the B, and I want a chance at the B at B6.
>Dorcas_Alexander: AAAAA -AAAAA +0 45
#note Maybe she's not going to luckbag me after all?
>Winter: ABBDTUY B4 BABY +42 107
>Dorcas_Alexander: CEIIR G6 IC.IER +16 61
#note Oh, maybe I won't get luckbagged after all.
>Winter: DDDSTTU A7 DUD +22 129
#note But if my racks will look like this, I'll be in trouble.
>Dorcas_Alexander: EIOSSV 11E VI.OSES +40 101
>Winter: CDMSSTT F10 M.DST +26 155
#note Caught a break being able to play, and I have the S.
>Dorcas_Alexander: AEEILMT K5 MEALIE.T +70 171
#note Still with the luckbaggery.
>Winter: ACEINST L4 CINEAST +85 240
#note Oh boy. I'm not sure about the S hook, but I'm sure Dorcas will let it go. However, why give her the easy E play. On the other hand, if I leave that spot, with two blanks unseen, her luckbag powers will come into play.

>Winter: EGLPQTU 6F Q. +31 271
#note Goddamn it!!!
>Dorcas_Alexander: ?HNNORU 15D UNsHORN +88 290
#note See, I knew she was going to get it.
>Winter: EGLOPTU 1C POULET +38 309
#note I'm still fine though, as luck as the bag doesn't fuck me for the rest of the game.
>Dorcas_Alexander: AGJ J4 JAG +28 318
>Winter: FGGNTWW H10 W.NT +16 325
#note Just like this--this is how I get fucked and lose to a scrub.
>Dorcas_Alexander: AAAEE -AAAEE +0 318
>Winter: ?FGGLRW 8J F..G +8 333
#note Didn't see GR(E)W until next turn, but it would have probably saved me from what came next, although with the blank I thought a win was almost a slam dunk.
>Dorcas_Alexander: AP 5G PA +19 337
>Winter: ?EEGLRW D6 GR.W +22 355
#note Now I'm feeling confident, finally.
>Dorcas_Alexander: NO 8J ....ON +30 367
#note And all of a sudden I have reason to worry.
>Winter: ?EEILRU E11 .IE +11 366
#note Shit. That 30 for FLAGON made a huge difference. With just 58 for a bingo, I'm only up 42. I see two possibilities to lose. EXORDIA, which is less likely, but also the simple possibility of drawing four tiles that I can't score with, and Dorcas managing to score enuf across to turns, plus catching 2-6 from my rack, to win. Quackle likes my thinking, but I didn't see how to score with the UE.
>Dorcas_Alexander: A 14F .A +7 374
>Winter: ?ELOORU 9A .O +3 369
#note The WORST possible draw!!! I play the odds, that she has the X.
