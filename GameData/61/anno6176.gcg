#note this is probably the time to exchange. the way i saw it was, FUNK keeping a crappy ETTU for 12, NETT an even worse leave but its 28, nothing else makes sense except maybe FET. quackle agrees with taking the points. but maybe against a human player i shouldn't. -1, FET

#note i've had just about enough of this, but it is a big mistake to not take FOE for 31 and keep scoring. maybe i'll draw a Q or something right?  -8

#note i didn't really consider not bingoing, but 13J GORE sims almost as well as the top scoring bingo, M6 REnEGaDO. i was wasting too much time here, EsTROGEn also is better than my move. -5
