>Ryan_Fischer: AEGKLLM 8H GLEAM +22 22
#note He's got me on spread, but I'm a game ahead, so winner takes the EB.  I didn't like this play, nice to see it's evaluated best.
>David_Moersdorf: AVWY 9K WAVY +26 26
#note A(GLEAM)/(GLEAM)Y.  I shoulda known the latter.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACIIKLU M9 .AKIL +24 46
#note Wow, LUCKIE without an R.  Means "an old woman."  This play was just okay.  Subpar leave for sure.
>David_Moersdorf: BERU 11J BUR.E +22 48
#note Start of my troubles.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACIIPU 13I PICU. +12 58
#note I got APERCULI*/PECULIAR confused with ACERVULI and so I couldn't find APICULI (APICULUS).  Tough find, but still.  I knew somewhere in the back of my mind I was missing something too.  So odd that I played PICUL twice tonight.  It was only close to being best once.
>David_Moersdorf: HINOR O11 RHINO +48 96
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AFIOPS -  +0 58
#note Ugh, it just looked so wrong.
>David_Moersdorf: EENV 14G EVEN +17 113
#note This play really bugged me.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AFIOPS N2 SAPOnIF. +80 138
#note On the other hand, I was so happy to pull this outta the aether.  Top 14k 8s.  Crazy I was able to find it.  He held, but didn't challenge.
>David_Moersdorf: DEOT O5 DOTE +36 149
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIITUY 3I YAUTI. +26 164
#note Happy little dump.
>David_Moersdorf: AJO L1 JA.O +38 187
#note It's downhill from here, all 'cause I challenged BURKER and missed APICULI.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIIMOS 9H OI +9 173
#note Couldn't have given me a T for MOIETIES.  Damn vowels.  At least I had the presence of mind to save the M instead of playing something like MI(L)E.
>David_Moersdorf: EEHIRST 15A HEISTER +85 272
#note That's why plays like that bug me so.  They leave too much to luck.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEFIMS 5H FEMES +32 205
#note I guess I shoulda played EF, but I didn't want to fish to EEIMS TWICE.
>David_Moersdorf: ABO 14A ABO +25 297
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIITZ 10F ZIT +36 241
#note No V for ACTIVIZE.
>David_Moersdorf: ?DEGNNR 6C GRiNNED +68 365
#note Last glimmer of hope out the window with that.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEINRU 11B CURIA +25 266
#note Missed CURARINE.  Wow.  Just don't ever remember seeing it.
>David_Moersdorf: DEGO D4 GO.ED +18 383
>Ryan_Fischer: AENNQSX E5 X.S +38 304
#note N(i)XE is a bit better.
>David_Moersdorf: DLLORTT C10 R.T +3 386
#note Blocked Q(U)A, not seeing QA(T).
>Ryan_Fischer: AENNQW E13 QA. +12 316

>Ryan_Fischer: ENNW 15J NEW +13 329
#note 7B WE(ES) 18
>David_Moersdorf: DL B7 D.L +4 405
#note Oh well, it wasn't meant to be.  For as many times as I've been over 4v7s, it never seems like enough.
