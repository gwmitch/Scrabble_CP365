#note I knew when I made this decision that Quackle might not approve. Passing up 37 to take 0 is usually incorrect early in the game. But I liked forcing Andrew to make a play on this board. As it turns out, the trade sims pretty close to QANATS. Earlier in the tournament, I might have taken the 37.

#note Don't need to blow up this rack. But I didn't see the best way to unload two N's: 12H NONE.

#note Nothing here is especially appealing. I didn't like LUX because I felt I had the upper hand (blank on my rack) and didn't feel like offering an easy score like that.

#note Considered fewer points for GAZAR, because I don't feel safe with that ZA floating in the triple lane.

>Tunnicliffe: ELORSUY 14E OY +27 349
#note Missed F4 YOU, but I kind of want a board that is volatile to nonbingos. Andrew is going to keep scoring, and I want to make sure there are lanes open for me, too. Keeping LR for LAZAR.
