#note Didn't see GELADA, but I don't like it much either. Prefer this over EGAD because of the QAD leave.

#note Doubt she has a blank or more than one S, so I went for turnover. Maybe I should have traded 7 instead. I was expecting ZONK, and figured I'd at least draw a nice overlap.
>Camela: DIKNO J7 ..ND +12 147
>Rafi: ELNORTY N7 .LOTY +19 269
#note Didn't think I could get away with WENDY. Not too concerned about her bingoing with the OKI leave.
>Camela: FIKO O8 OF +26 173
>Rafi: EILNPRS H7 ..P +7 276
#note Oops. Didn't know SCUTE. Even so BOP is a pretty weak play, probably should have played LISP/ZLOTYS for 36 instead.

#note I probably should have played QI/HI for 16. Every tile in the bag gives me a bingo, and the lane is virtually unblockable.
