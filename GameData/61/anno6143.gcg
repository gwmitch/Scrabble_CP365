>Verbie: ABBCNOT H4 BACON +24 24
#note -11 to BOBCAT, which I didn't see, and also -8 to CABOB which I couldn't convince myself of.
>N_Walton: AGIIMOU 8B MIAOUI.G +62 62
#note damndamndamn I get punished right away for floating than N!
>Verbie: AABDNST C3 TABAN.DS +78 102
#note I don't think I would have found the other playable bingo- CABSTAND for 7 less.
>N_Walton: ?AEFNPZ B2 FEZ +43 105
#note Obvious
>Verbie: EIIKTWY A1 KEY +41 143
#note - .6 to YEW, but the real star (by 7.4) is the ultracool BIKEWAY 5C 38.
>N_Walton: ?ALLNOP D4 POL +44 149
#note Noah decides to "double down" on a bingo, passing up E4 PLANOsOL 86.  Quackle understands, but still sees this play as -8.
>Verbie: IIOSTTW E2 WIST +39 182
#note Best of a bad lot.
>N_Walton: ?ALNNRS 10A eN.NARLS +61 210
#note NORLANdS or NONSoLAR E7 score 3 extra.  Also at 2 better: SCRANNeL 6G.
>Verbie: AIIOORT 1E TORII +23 205
#note I'm a bit surprised there was any play within a point or two here, but IMINO or MONITOR on line B are within a point.  But this does win the sim.
>N_Walton: DEGJNWX 5G J.WED +32 242
#note Next best is WAXED, by .7
>Verbie: AEFOORT 4H .AREFOOT +88 293
#note Get ready for an overload of awesomeness, starting now.  N's play completely fails to block!
>N_Walton: EGINQUX H10 .EQUIN +75 317
#note Yeah, raher obvious, just one little detail... (next is SEXING here 5.5 back)
>Verbie: AEINOTU 12G E.UATION +84 377
#note Yeah, that'll leave a mark.  Could I have used anything else?  Anything at all?
>N_Walton: EEEGGVX O1 VEX. +42 359
#note I might have panicked about the Gs and done VENGE N10 34, holding out on the X.  Sim actually likes that play better (by .3).  Have to decide between offense and defense, and N takes an open board concept.
>Verbie: AEHIMRV 3I HAREM +61 438
#note At this point I'm completely failing to not laugh.
>N_Walton: EEEGGLU K7 GUGLE. +16 375
#note Not as right to panic here- better to split the Gs with N10 LUNGEE 18 (by about 5.3)
>Verbie: CDIPRSV O12 SPIV +49 487
#note To be sure, if N plays LUNGEE, I'd still have DRIPS O8 52. But without that, it's only 46, and not as good as what actually transpired.  So Noah gets a refund on last turn's error.
>N_Walton: ?DEELOY 2E .YE +32 407
#note CP rates this -1.7 to J2 YARE... which Simmer calls a 10% to win (and nothing else does.)
>Verbie: CDHIRRT 14G D.TCH +17 504
#note Screwing up as many bingo lanes as I could, including OEIlLADE 14F and rELOANED 15C.
>N_Walton: ?ADEELO B6 DE.O. +25 432
#note I was trying not to focus on Noah's notation here, but I could see he was trying to find some crazy 9 or 10.  It wasn't there, and he went a minute overtime in the attempt.
>Verbie: IRR J2 R...R +9 513
#note Maybe should have done ITCH last turn and force a block of DORR M11?
>N_Walton: ?AEL 8K .LnAE +15 447
#note as mentioned, -10 for time.  Total equity lost: basically 20 each.
>N_Walton:  (I) +2 449
