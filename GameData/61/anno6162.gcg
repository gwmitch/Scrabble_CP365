>Jim_Burlant: ?IMNRTZ H4 RITZ. +18 18
#note After the game, I was shocked when Winter told me he played BYS because he had had no consonants in his rack at all.   I didn't like ditching the Z this cheap but felt that MN? was more bingo prone than RZ blank.  This choice sims second, roughly 2  points down on 7H MINT.
>Winter: TTWX 5F TW.XT +15 31
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCKMNR -BKM +0 18
#note Quackle also prefers tossing the N.   Maybe it would have helped, but given this board I kind of doubt it.
>Winter: EJS F2 JES. +27 58
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACCDNR F7 CARD +20 38
#note The first 7 choices, of which this is one, sim within 3  points of each other here.  F7 NARC wins the sim followed by 3C CANED and ACRED.

>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEINV H11 .IVAN +30 68
#note Arrrgh, the bane of the blank racks strikes again! Spent about 3 minutes on this turn.  Saw INACTIVE, VESICANT, VARIANCE, VERONICA...none of which played.  Only VIBRANCE or NAVICERT and VICENARY (the last of which I didn't know) would play.  Interstiingly , the best play here is H10 ADVICE keeping N?, which wins 36%.  This miss, combined with my next mistake, costs me the game.
>Winter: HNOPR 3B PHON.R +24 155
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEEOU 4H .OUE +15 83
#note I had held PHONER* but couldn't bring myself to challenge it.  G7 OBE, which I didn't look for, wins the sim with this play a credible second.  This choice wins 23%.
>Winter: AEGITY 3J GAIETY +26 181
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEGIR N1 CA.ERInG +74 157
#note L8 CARRIAGE is better, but I had to play what I could find.  Even if I found CARRIAGE (which wins 24% to this choice's 21), the game would have been over as he would have hit me with ERUPTION 15A on the next turn.  13H VICARAGE wins the sim btw.  But this choice turned a probable 100 to 150-point loss into a farce.
>Winter: EIOPRTU 1H OUTPRI.E +167 348
>Jim_Burlant: EELMMOW -  +0 157
#note When we got up to go to the adjudicator, Winter chuckled when I told him that for 167 points I would challenge REPAINTS.  I was pretty sure OUTPRICE was good, but I had to challenge - this was obvious.  Needless to say, I lost the challenge and the turn, and the only thing left to be decided was the final spread.
>Winter: BEEGILO O8 OBLIGEE +95 443
>Jim_Burlant: EELMMOW N13 MOW +24 181
#note Now I'm just moving tiles to end the game and not giving a crap about doing anything.  Needless to say, the game is offiicially over.  But if I'd still bothered to look for my best play, he might have "only" won by 250 or so.  Instead I let him hit a sustained run of scoring that has to be seen to be believed.

#note I was laughing and shaking my head in disbelief and even Winter said, "This is ridiculous."
