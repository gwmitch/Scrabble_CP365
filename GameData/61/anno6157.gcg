#note Lost challenge; thought it was an adjective.

#note GROANED has no anagrams.  D'oh.  I held, but I was gunshy versus him.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILOSU H12 ..LU +12 184
#note Praying for a J here.  He didn't deliver.  OUSEL H1 is interesting.  I figured TOLU would be way down, but couldn't figure what else to do.
>Brian_Galebach: GQU D1 QU.G +48 311
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILNOS 10E ANISOLE +72 256
#note Wow, did my draw save me.  I didn't even bother looking for other bingos, though there are a lot.  This is best, though.

>Ryan_Fischer: HIORSUW 15L WISH +50 352
#note With the ORU leave, I figure I can hit the Q next turn, which is why I gave up 5 points to play down low.  QURSH is fun but not worth it.  Also of note, SHOWIER 2x2.
>Brian_Galebach: EOT 12K TOE. +18 371
>Ryan_Fischer: EMOPRUV N6 POM +22 374
#note VUM is... okay.  Good to get rid of the V, but I need to hit that Q to win, I think.  I was gonna play prove until I saw I could play POM and fish for QUIVER/Y.
>Brian_Galebach: AEN M7 NAE +17 388
>Ryan_Fischer: CERUVWY 1D .UERY +51 425
#note WRY, too.  That Y was so very volatile since I played YOGEE and he played FLAVOR.  That neither got hit was surprising.
