>Cesar: EGNNOPT 8A GENTO. +24 171
#note this was an interesting dilemma. i was basically choosing between 4A PEON and GENTOO. i was leaning towards PEON because it scores more and has an arguably better leave, but it's going to be very tough for me to open the board after it. i realized i needed more volatility. it's fairly close but PEON is simming best; partly because he could have a big play up there too. and i did consider that as well. tough position, i think. -3

#note i couldn't think of a good enough phony bingo, and C2 IN seemed too scary. yuck at my phony 4, but i was pretty sure it was phony.

#note that was ridiculously fortunate. i didn't bother looking past cortex because i figured he hadn't seen laities the first time, but of course, CONTeXT is MUCH better -- 88% vs 45% win chance! must concentrate better in the future. -49

#note making the blank a G is probably better? i've never seen two moves sim identically before after 1000+ iterations (of course inferring AEILS)
