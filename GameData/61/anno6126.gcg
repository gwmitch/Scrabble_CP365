>Jim_Burlant: ?DHIINR 8G HID +14 14
#note Didn't know HIRUDIN, which is the only bingo in this rack.  Among non-bingo choices, 8E HIND wins with this choice coming in roughly 1/2 point behind it.
>Geoff_Tongue: CLRU F8 CURL +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: ?INNORX 7G OX +25 39
#note Sim winner; 7H XI also worth consideration.
>Geoff_Tongue: GIINSSU I8 .ISUSING +62 80
#note Best bingo would have been 12D ISSUING.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EINNOR 15G NE.RONIs +77 116
#note ENROBING 15B, NITROGEN 15D or RINGBONE 15F - these choices, along with this one, all sim within one point of each other for sim winner honors.  While NEGRONIS comes in 4th in the sim, it helped me out for reasons that Quackle could not anticipate.
>Geoff_Tongue: MNOO 14K NOMO +22 102
>Geoff_Tongue: MNOO --  -22 80
>Jim_Burlant: ACIJLRW N10 CRAWL. +32 148
#note And if I'd put down one of the other choices he might not have tried NOMO*.   This choice wins the sim, with N12 JAWS finishing second as a 3-1/2point dog.
>Geoff_Tongue: MNOO 6D MONO +14 94
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIJTY J6 JEED +42 190
#note Best.  JEE for 37 sims roughly 4-1/2 pts down, and nothing else is within 3 points of that.
>Geoff_Tongue: MOT K5 TOM +23 117
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIOTY L5 AYE +26 216
#note Quackle prefers 5D AYE by roughly one point over this.  I'm still at 88% winning chances according to the duck.
>Geoff_Tongue: BFU 5C FUB +28 145
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIOOT 4H IOTA +11 227
#note 11C AIOLI (which I didn't see) wins the sim.  This chloice comes in third, as roughly a 5-point dog.  Had I made the best play, this would have been a very different game.
>Geoff_Tongue: IQ 14F QI +33 178
>Jim_Burlant: DEHIOPV 4B POH +37 264
#note Despite the strong desire to get rid of the V, I made this play...and Quackle agrees, with this play winning the sim.  And I'm rewarded quite nicely on my next turn.
>Geoff_Tongue: AESTTTW 12A WATTEST +85 263
#note Even though the score is tied up (well, back within 1) the duck says Geoff still has only a 1 in 3 chance of winning this game.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEEIRV A7 REVIE.ED +95 359
#note I had never seen WATTEST and held it...but released the instant I saw what it gave me.  The duck says I'm at 94% winning chances with this play.  Incorrectly scored as 92.
>Geoff_Tongue: ?AEEGNR C8 NEGA.ERs +68 331
#note REGENTAL is best...but even that only sims at 11%.  Geoff is just under 11% with this play.
>Jim_Burlant: AELRUVZ M3 LUV +18 377
#note Despite giving up 25 points on the scoreboard, this play still sims second at 89% and only gives up 6 equity to M12 ZA 43, the sim winner.  I was more worried about unloading the rack-destroying UV combo.  The Z play could wait.
>Geoff_Tongue: AFY 3G FAY +28 359
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEGRZ B2 ZA. +28 405
#note Bit of a miss here.  Best is M12 ZA and I don't know why I missed that spot.
>Geoff_Tongue: IP 6A PI +24 383
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEGOR O11 EGO +18 423
#note If the duck is to be believed, this is only one of 3 plays that wins 100%, the other 2 being L9 REBEGAN and L9 BEGROAN.  I was getting very concerned about that S hook at 8L as I didn't have a block that didn't give up too many points.
>Geoff_Tongue: LN H2 N..L +4 387
>Jim_Burlant: ABEKR 11H B.RKA +22 445
>Geoff_Tongue: ADIST 1H STAID +39 426
#note Final score recorded as 442 - 428.
>Geoff_Tongue:  (E) +2 428
