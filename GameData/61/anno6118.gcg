#note He was originally considering IGAD 6C, which would have given me AR(D)RI H11. Hmm, this is OK enough, I guess...

#note Game-losing move. Was somehow too fixated on playing the V off, missing the much more superior FUD N10, which would have also served the purpose of blocking the J. It would also have kept a VEST.

#note In a tight situation, this move actually simulates the best. I was considering HIGHE(R) but it seemed to have a low chance of winning, especially if he had a Q play hooking the H and hitting the DWS. H(E)H 11K sims lower than GHEE but might leave the opponent a little more wary of the Q (and hence more prone to mistakes).
>Tony_Sim: ?GITUUW 12J GU.U +5 436
#note Can't remember if he was low on time here, but he didn't need an out-in-two. Playing TWI(G)s straight away would take out my H scoring spot, leaving me with nothing much to capitalise on.
>Toh_Weibin: EHILOQ J1 EH +28 475
#note Q stick! EH O2 is better by 2 points (as it blocks TWI(G)s and doesn't open WITe), but at this juncture, I can't win anyway. I'm wondering, though... what if I'd played H(E)H 11K the move before though?
