>Toh_Weibin: AFGJOTW 13C TOWAG. +24 24
#note The right move is GOWF G5 hands down. The move I choose is pretty ugly, considering the leave and the hopelessly-hopeful J setup. Moves like J(E)W 13G are easy to spot and better. Surprisingly, TOWAGE is 7th-8th?
>darrenkhoo: AGINOOW 14F WO. +30 100
>Toh_Weibin: EFHJRSU 11E JEH. +28 52
#note FRUSH/S(TOWAGE) B10. Wasn't too sure of the hook, but the score and the draw to a J should have prompted further action.
>darrenkhoo: AGINOTU I2 OUTGAIN +62 162
>Toh_Weibin: BFRRSUV 6F FUB.R +20 72
#note F(O)RB seems to simulate better here, probably because of the E draw and the open lines?

#note GILDSMEN
>Toh_Weibin: EEIILSY 12C EYE +37 195
#note Though this simulates better, I might have wanted to consider YE keeping the E and S for -IEST later. Not that it was really important with the open board, anyway.
>darrenkhoo: CEHOOST 1M .HO +35 331
>Toh_Weibin: CIIILNS 12H .INIC +16 211
#note SI(X)/S(TOWAGE) is marginally better. (D)INIC's OK for me, actually...
>darrenkhoo: CEFNOST 10F FE.ON +36 367
>Toh_Weibin: AAILMSV 14A MA +30 241
#note Awesome - I could have played MALVASI(AN) A8, giving me a chance to pull forward the turn after! To be honest, I didn't even see MALVASIA... only saw MAILVANS
>darrenkhoo: CRRRSTZ 6L R.Z +32 399

#note VESI(C)ULA. I'm losing it.
>darrenkhoo: CEPRRST G5 P.RR +10 409
>Toh_Weibin: AEEILNS L6 .ELIAN.ES +65 322
#note A consolation, but really not enough...

>Toh_Weibin: AEIOPTY 14J PO.EY +32 354
>darrenkhoo: BDEESTT 9K B.TE +7 435
#note Um.. not sure what he was thinking here. Block the Q spot (there's another at 15I) while opening for myself (BITE takes an R hook too)?
>Toh_Weibin: AAIIKRT O8 ARIKI +37 391
#note TRAIK is the best here, I'm just not sure of it. Other choices for me were KARAIT and this, ARIKI, and I calculated that ARIKI was about 2-3 points better.
