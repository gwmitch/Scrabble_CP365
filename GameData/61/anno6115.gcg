#note dammit cesar. i didn't want to make the board any more volatile than i needed to, but CLOZE not only scores 6 more but it keeps a (marginally?) better leave. i guess i just hate Us too much. i really shoulda considered the scores. then again, i'm playing to lose by 19 or less. -6

>Cesar: AFGNNSX 14L SANG +29 265
#note this was a lame mistake. i really wanted to cash the X for more, i also somehow counted SANG as 34 which i thought made it more palatable.. i should give myself 5 more points of equity, but i won't :P FANGA H11 sims best, keep the S! SANG is actually... pretty bad. -8

#note cash the dumb X already or play 11J EMIR? quackle likes EMIR! not sure what is right when i'm trying to lose by less than 20 though. -4.5

#note M1 (E)RR is what i would have played if i were just trying to win, but i realized this was too likely a lost game. i thought MIR gave me the best chances of losing by less than 20. note that the pool makes EMIR terrible now.

#note ok, so i figured out how to lose by 19,  and i patted myself on the back after seeing this. but this may be my STEEest move of the tournament; by missing REREMIND for the clear win, I stay at 1779; REREMIND would have put me at 1799, where I'd only TECHNICALLY be a STEE. i've even played REREMIND in club recently, within the last year. anyway, at least this play still won me the dumb tournament.
