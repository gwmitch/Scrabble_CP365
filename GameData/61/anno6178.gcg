>David_Gibson: EEIKNO 15G ENOKI +29 186
#note If I just enter ENOKI in Q, it suggests PINKO for him.  Add another E, it suggests PEKOE.

>Ryan_Fischer: DNORUWY --  -33 229
#note I've played UNARY before!  UNWARY would be even better, 'cept the Q's out.  I considered (P)ORNY, which he liked, or ROU(P)Y, but then settled on a phony.  Oops.  I just didn't like the leaves any of the real plays gave me, but he pointed out after PORNY I could come back with WUD C7.

#note My suspicion about the extra Es was right.

#note HYPHA?  Odd, I don't remember it.  Also of note, PH(R)ATRY
>David_Gibson: JO M7 JO +38 284
#note JO(B) for 43?  Maybe this creates a bit better lane, I don't know.
>Ryan_Fischer: EHILNXZ 10K .LEX +29 348
#note Seeing this draw, I thought I was in pretty good shape, but I chose wrong outta fear and faulty decision making.  Saw ZIN first of course, but thought it gave back too much.  Turns out he couldn't bingo with what he had.  Shoulda saved the X, not the Z.

>Ryan_Fischer: GHINRSZ K14 H. +5 353
#note Here, too, I overthought things.  Shoulda just taken the poins with (O)HS.

>Ryan_Fischer: GINRSZ 13I ZIG +30 383
>David_Gibson: OOQT I13 .O. +12 427
#note And the big epic failure of mine is I created a Q spot for him that he didn't see.
>Ryan_Fischer: NRS M10 .RNS +8 391
#note One second left.  The shortest path is often right.
