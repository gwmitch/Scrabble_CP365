#note I don't know why I was thinking QUIZZLER* might be good.

#note Aah. I didn't know KARROO was good with two R's. TROAK is really lousy.

#note I think I tend to panic too much and too soon. Bradley is one move from blocking the last decent bingo line, so I want to be a turn ahead. H1 WOVE or YOWE just don't make sense to me, because Brad blocks the bingo lanes and I lose. Simple as that. Yeah, I like my play.

#note Looks like Brad played this perfectly after about 7-8 minutes pondering the position. I think we figured that he only loses if I have FATALISM. This is why Bradley is not a STEE.

#note Not quite enough.
