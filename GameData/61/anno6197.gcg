#note Looking back, I'm surprised I did not trade here.
>Bob: AEEGINU G1 EUGENIA +67 246
>Dave: ELMOQRT 2F Q.OTE +36 222
#note Tough call.  The leave is nice after QI, but there are no guarantees of bingos on this board.  Meanwhile, this scores 5 more points and cuts down what he can do on row 1.  I considered QUOTER, but figured I'd rather save the hook for a little more punch.
>Bob: DEI K2 DIE +20 266
>Dave: ALMNRTY F9 N.TARY +51 273
#note Bob was impressed.
>Bob: FLO H1 L.OF +51 317
#note "I had to work harder for my 51 points than you did!"
>Dave: BDELMNN 5J BLEND +26 299
#note Both Bob and I completely blanked on the E hook on BLEND here.  There's a very nice play I did not see: LANDMEN 12E.
>Bob: EINTU N5 .UNITE +16 333
#note Of course these tiles should have been played at O1.
>Dave: DEEMNST O3 NESTED +46 345
#note And my play was METED O4.
>Bob: ARTY 12K TA.RY +30 363
>Dave: GIILMOS M1 LIMI.G +22 367
#note Quackle agrees that my best chance is to play long.  I need to go out quickly, and have to hope for a favorable draw.
>Bob: ?EHIIOP C2 HOPE +32 395
#note Better to block my out, but this is enough.
>Dave: ORSV 7A ROV.S +12 379
#note Five points better is OVERSAW in the same spot, but it's still not enough.
>Dave:  (II?) +4 383
