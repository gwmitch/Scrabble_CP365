#note Best.
>Mike_Baker: PZ M7 Z.P +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: AIILMNS 9B MISLAIN +66 136
#note Couldn't find any 8's (didn't know ALIENISM or MILESIAN).  Row 7 placement (which I didn't notice) sims 1 point better, most likely because he can't come back with something like SUQ or FAX at 8A.  But this wound up being better for me here, and you'll see why in a second.
>Mike_Baker: CILNOSU D3 UNCOIL. +20 47
#note After the game, Mike told me that this was his rack.  He either didn't know (or couldin't find) the 18000 probability SCULLION or CULLIONS, and my row 9 placement of MISLAIN kept him from back-hooking ZEP with UNCOILS.  He spent several minutes on this turn before giving up and and making this play.  Even his best play, E5 SCULLION 90, only wins 31%.  With this choice he's at 11%.
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEIRS 10F BE +23 159
#note Now it's my turn to not know the bingo in my rack.  AMBERIES plays at B8 for 86.  As non-bingo options go, this sims second best, with 7K BIZE beating this out by 3 points.  Not sure I agree with Quackle here.  Yes, I've got the S.   But why give him the chance to get back in the game when he's drawn 6 and SS?? are still unseen?  
>Mike_Baker: FIX C1 FIX +44 91
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEIRS 1C .REESIAs +83 242
#note Quackle, predictably, says I should take the extra points with any of the 2x2's available at 5D (CASImERE, CAuSERIE, CrEASIER), docking me roughly 2-1/2 points for this choice.  As awkward as the F is, I'd much rather ensure that he can't hit me with a 3x3; I'll gladly give up 3 scoreboard points for that, especially with this lead.   I'm pushing 97% winning chances now.

#note Best.
>Mike_Baker: AFO 12B OAF +26 145
>Jim_Burlant: DEGOOSV J5 OVE.DOGS +73 347
#note Was almost going to play VEG 13 A but was not happy with the leave when I started looking for better options.  Then I noticed the R in TETRODE, and the rest, as they say, is history.
>Mike_Baker: AK N6 KA +27 172
>Jim_Burlant: DDEEEGQ O7 GEED +31 378
#note Llike I told Mike, when it rains, it pours.  He opens a hook, I've got the low-prob tiles to take it right then and there.  This is best, and I'm at 99.97% winning chances.
>Mike_Baker: CENOT 13A CENTO +32 204
>Jim_Burlant: ADELMQW K3 MAW +26 404
#note After 1200 iterations 2-ply, this play takes over from A13 CWM to win the sim on a win percentage basis, despite giving up 6-1/2 points of valuation to it.
>Mike_Baker: ?INORST 3G STOR.INg +72 276
#note Other choices include 5A TRICORNS and H7 TENSIONER.
>Jim_Burlant: DEGLQRU 6B QU.D +34 438
#note Quackle likes a bunch of L1 Q plays, with L1 QUIRED 62 winning the sim.  Truthfully, I didn't look anywhere past QUOD 6B once I saw I could put the auto-pilot Q play down. While QUIRED is definitely the better play, I do have to wonder if the game ends as explosively for me if I put down QUIRED here.
>Mike_Baker: HI A13 .HI +24 300
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLRRT L2 L.GER +24 462
#note Too bad I didn't look for this spot last turn, eh?  Anyway - When the first 2 tiles came out of the bag as I and N, I had immediately castigated myself for not just fishing off the R and the G.   But this worked out very well.  Supposedly, a handful of plays "only" win 99.99%.  Honestly, given my lead, how does Mike have any chance at all?.  Sim winner here is H8 ENLARGER followed by L1 GAITER, N10 ARGLE, and this play.
>Mike_Baker: JLW 10I J.WL +14 314
>Jim_Burlant: AAINRTT N10 AT +9 471
#note At 5D this scores 7 more, but this still worked out quite nicely.
