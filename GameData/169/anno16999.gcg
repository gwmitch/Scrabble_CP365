#note I played it in the weird spot hoping to draw QI. should really just exchange and save myself the trouble.
>Ed: DGIIILR K5 DRI. +14 14
#note K8 PILI.  not sure why I thought keeping two Is was a good idea.  I wanted to keep the N open for a potential ING bingo
>JD: EEGOQRT L3 GREET +19 39
#note again, this would be  good time to exchange and move on

#note no zebrano spot
>Ed: AEEILNS 3F ENSILA.E +72 134
#note jesse: ed deliberately played here to create a counter-spot to the Z at 12H.
ed: yeah, probably poor logic.  i wasn't anticipating that playing from 2B will open up another scoring spot on row1.  

>JD: AAIMNOW 2B MIAOW +49 181
>Ed: EIIOSTY 1E YETI +32 166
#note no clue as to which spot to take. how would you decide?
>JD: AANORUY H12 .ANY +48 229
>Ed: EHIOOSS 1A OHO +27 193
#note OHO felt more defensive than OOH
>JD: ALNORTU 4C ULTRA +19 248
#note the circumstances encourage turnover

#note sweet

>Ed: ADFJRRV A10 FARD. +10 287
#note I missed M9 FREMD. this play is terrible.  I couldn't bear to leave colA open -- I saw too many possibilities.  I didn't see a way to open a counter spot, or a play that left a decent leave.  
>JD: ?AILNOW I11 ..W +22 306
>Ed: ADEJRTV I2 J.VED +21 308
#note N2 ADVERT.  I was guessing on ENSILAGED (to store in a silo).
>JD: ?AILNNO N3 sOLANIN +67 373
#note I thought SOLANIN was safer than NOMINAL but I should be concerned about the fact that I'm creating another great bingo lane to go along with the one on the left - his bingo percentage is 26% after SOLANIN versus 17% after nominal.
>Ed: ACORTTU O8 TAROC +38 346
#note i basically gave up at this point, but i should have considered opening up another lane.  Q says i have 22% of winning with 6F OUTDARE
>JD: ABCELSV B6 CLAVES +28 401
>Ed: ?EEGOTU -  +0 346
#note jesse: desperation challenge
ed: CLAVE (one of a pair of percussion sticks).  I was thinking maybe the plural of CLAVE is CLAVI, not CLAVES.  CLAVI is the plural of CLAVUS (horny thickening of the skin).  8A TAUTOG.
