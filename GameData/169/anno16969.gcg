#note (GO)OSANDER f7 is available. Not a word I know. 
>Jim_B: AEIRSTV -AE +0 6
>Arie: AEEHORS -EO +0 39
#note AE i9 is a possibility. At the moment I would prefer to force Jim to open up. 
>Jim_B: BINRSTV -B +0 6
>Arie: AEEHLRS I1 HEALERS +71 110
#note A questionable play. Misscored as 72.
>Jim_B: ?EGILNV 1H s.ELVING +212 218
>Arie: ADEFKTU 4H F.AKED +36 146
#note FLUKED is a huge improvement.

>Jim_B: AEELS O3 .EASEL +30 275
>Arie: GIJMOTU I9 GOMUTI +20 198
#note Possibly a bit aggressive even for this deficit. No other decent scoring/balancing plays are available. The J cannot be played without sacrifices in leave. I am not necessarily inferring an S from WEASEL. 
>Jim_B: INNOO H11 ONION +29 304
>Arie: AEFJMQS -FJQ +0 198
#note Missing JAMS j8 and similar plays. I have fallen into an unhelpful "bingo at all costs" mentality. 
>Jim_B: CDEHR 11E CHR..ED +60 364
>Arie: AEMPSWX J1 .X +50 248
#note Missing DONG(A) again for WAXES.

#note Held but released.
>Jim_B: AOP 14A APO +24 416
>Arie: BENPRST J10 ..B +13 361
#note Forms a playable bingo with 7/20 unseen tiles. Unfortunately the only real spot (N column) is easily blockable. But it is possible that Jim's block will be ineffective, and I have no other prospects.

>Jim_B: ACLT 13C TALC +22 454

#note Unfortunately YUTZ 13C got blocked and now I have no chance. 
>Jim_B: ?EIR N13 .It +26 480
#note Scored as 28. He could play out with fERIA etc. at 3E. 
>Arie: ITTY O14 TI +12 464
#note WEASEL(Y) and YA are improvements. Time pressure was to blame. 
>Jim_B: ER K13 .ER +6 486
#note Final score recorded as 498-465. Quite the game.
