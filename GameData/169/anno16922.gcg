#note FAIL.  This was an accident.  As soon as I hit my clock, I realized my mistake.  How embarassing.

#note I took about four minutes this turn.  I was looking for something through the E, but there's nothing.  I considered playing KAY, but passed it up.  My board vision sucks so I was completely blind to the big hook at 5H.
>Scott_Garner: ABU 15B B.AU +7 193
#note Scott took about as long as I did last turn.  I figure he's either about to triple-triple or his rack sucks.
>Tasha: AADGHOS D11 HAG +26 176
#note Okay, that's it.  I'm working on my board vision.  I made the right play, but it took way too long for me to see it.  I should be making plays like this in 3 seconds.

#note After I stopped looking for a place to play BLINDFOLD, I decided to block column B.  I was going to play FOD*, but I thankfully realized that's not a word at the last minute.

#note I almost missed this because I was so focused on blocking any bingos in the pool.  I wanted to play off two tiles (to leave one in the bag) that blocked the lower right hand side of the board.  So I settled with LEZ.  But then I noticed the open F.   Although it's unlikely he'll bingo to the F, I figure that lane was more dangerous than bingoing for chump change on row M or N so I decided to block that instead.   I was going to play FIZ but I eventually notice I have a bingo myself to the F.  So I decided its best to take out the F by playing FINALIZE instead of FIZ.
