>Tasha: ADEHKOR 8D KHEDA +36 36
#note BOOYAH!!  I finally started a massive study of the fives, yall! Better watch out!  Oh yeah:  Tasha's Endgame Misadventures Episode 13. 
>Josephine_Flowers: HU F6 HU. +14 14
#note KHEDA takes an H.
>Tasha: AELOQRS -OQ +0 36
#note I thought of just throwing in the Q, but AELRS looks better than AELORS to me.   In hindsight, though, I could literally bingo with half the pool with AELORS.  
>Josephine_Flowers: EFW 7H FEW +15 29
>Tasha: AELORST J6 O. +7 43
#note Passing up the bingo because of her last few turns.  I thought she a blank with a strong leave and didn't want to give her a shot at the triple-triple after a chump change bingo.  Maybe I should have played LO or OWL instead?  
>Josephine_Flowers: EGO 8J EGO +11 40
>Tasha: AELRSTX K4 LAX +29 72
#note Check out my mad drawing skills!
>Josephine_Flowers: II -II +0 40
>Tasha: ENORSTV I3 TROV. +22 94
#note Just ROVE maybe?  
>Josephine_Flowers: AEINSST M2 TISANES +71 111
#note Josephine has a nine to the triple here, but if you want to be uber-defensive, playing on column M or row 2 is where it's at.   She could have really screwed me over by bingoing on row 2 instead.
>Tasha: EINSTWY 2C WITNEYS +74 168
#note Man, it's a good thing I know the sevens or I would be in trouble here.  What would have happened if I didn't know WITNEYS?  ....I would have played L7 Y(O)W then drew JY.

#note E8 HOOF is better, but I missed it.  
>Josephine_Flowers: IR A3 .IR +7 208

>Tasha: ??ACELS 15I CALlErS +104 382
>Tasha: ??ACELS --  -104 278
#note Missed FIREPLACES.  And I looked for an extension of FIR too.
>Josephine_Flowers: ABEILRT N10 BAILE +46 340
>Josephine_Flowers: ABEILRT --  -46 294
#note She said she meant to play BAILER, but forgot to lay down the R.  Very Tasha-like.
>Tasha: ??ACELS 12H CLEAreS. +72 350
#note Normally, I would play on row 10, but I wanted to mess up her B play!  I'm hilarious!
>Josephine_Flowers: ABEILRT N10 BA.TE +44 338
#note And I suck.
>Tasha: ADENORU H12 .RUD +21 371
#note No, I didn't mess up here.   CRUD isn't even on the list, but I know I nailed it.  Only play that sims better than CRUD is playing to the H with HOUNDER and CURE.  HOUNDER can't be right becase it empties the bag and the pool isn't the prettiest.   CURE looks ok.  I didn't play the other words to the C because the pool is consonant heavy.  What are the chances that I'll draw EII or EIU?
>Josephine_Flowers: ILRTZ 14G L.TZ +33 371
>Tasha: AEEMMNO A3 ...EMAN +36 407
#note I was going back and forth between FIREMAN leaving EMO and FIREMEN leaving AMO.  But I realized it doesnt matter.   Both plays have more than one out and that's without her playing HIRING.  She plays HIRING and I can either play MOAN or MENO afterwards.  
>Josephine_Flowers: GIINPRU B6 RUN +15 386
#note After the game, Josephine told me she got fixated on the hot spot at column B  and 11J.  I wasn't even looking at those spots because I'm thinking she's going to play a 6 to the H.   I told her that if she plays short AND leaves column B alone then I will drop MM at B6 because I know she can't go out before me, but I wouldn't have played there otherwise.  I'm going out.
>Tasha: EMO E8 .OME +18 425
#note Best. :D
