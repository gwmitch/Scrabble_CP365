#note Playing for leave is pointless here because there's no real estate to put down a bingo. This is going to come down to just scoring as much as you can. Also after BA, opp probably doesn't have the J. ARCADIA empties, giving me a better chance than him for the J, as well as opening a good J spot. If it's in the bag, I'm really likely to win here.
