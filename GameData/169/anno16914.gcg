>Matt_Canik: DEEHILR 8D HEILED +28 28
#note Spoiler: This is going to be my third-highest score all game. 
>Dielle_Saldanha: AAB 7G ABA +18 18
>Matt_Canik: AAINORR 6H ORA +14 42
>Dielle_Saldanha: DFU 7C FUD +19 37
>Matt_Canik: AIIMNRW 5E WAIR +20 62
#note WI(DE) or WI(DE)R are much better plays. -4.5 
>Dielle_Saldanha: ITZ 5J ZIT +35 72
>Matt_Canik: EIMNNNT M5 INN +17 79
#note I saw TINMEN and backed out at the last second. -4.5
>Dielle_Saldanha: AW 6E AW +34 106
>Matt_Canik: EMNPRST N1 PERMS +32 111
#note Quackle prefers (I)MP for 13, but against a normal opponent that play has to be significantly weaker than it sims. It also likes M(AW) and P(ROBE) more. I just don't see the point in fishing here because Dielle is likely to block what I try and open and I'd have to pull a bingo starting with a vowel or an S. Into ENRST, that's not too likely. 
>Dielle_Saldanha: BOS 1L BO.S +33 139
>Matt_Canik: EGIMNNT 3I MINTE. +22 133
#note (AL)IGNMENT! (S)TEM is also better by a decent margin. Good lord I'm playing badly. 
>Dielle_Saldanha: ?EEGLTT 2C GaLETTE +63 202
>Matt_Canik: ADEGKNN D1 D.NK +20 153
#note NAKED 1B. I think I was so glad to see vowels here that I refused to give them up. 
>Dielle_Saldanha: DEU 1F DUE +23 225
>Matt_Canik: AEGINOV 6A AVO +19 172
#note I don't really know what else to do at this point. Board's going to shit. (N)OVA scores 2 more but really doesn't help my cause at all. If I don't play this and she has an S for 8M, I basically just lose. 
>Dielle_Saldanha: CCOT A4 CO.CT +36 261
>Matt_Canik: EGIJLNR E5 ....R +9 181
#note Just trying to get more space open here. I know I don't have an S but I'm going to have to pull really well to have any semblance of a chance. 
>Dielle_Saldanha: OXY B8 OXY +23 284
>Matt_Canik: AEGIJLN 7K JI. +10 191
#note Why didn't I plunk the J in J(AW)? I dunno. 
>Dielle_Saldanha: FO 8K OF +27 311
>Matt_Canik: AEEGILN N7 NEG +15 206
#note I've given up by now if you can't tell. 
>Dielle_Saldanha: HIT O6 HIT +36 347

>Dielle_Saldanha: V F4 V.. +9 356
>Matt_Canik: EIOQUUY 12A .OQUE +28 260
#note Don't even care. 2x2. I dare you. 
>Dielle_Saldanha: EGLNORS 10H LONGERS +69 425
#note Phew I guess. 
>Matt_Canik: ?EIPSUY F10 PUSsY +38 298
#note Definitely my sloppiest game of the tourney thus far. I'd like to blame a hangover but it's the afternoon. I could try to point the finger at a brain drain or something, but the reality is I'm just awful.
