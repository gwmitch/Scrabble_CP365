#note I liked not slotting the S in space, but turns out the U was the cure for what ailed him.

>dacrON: DENPSSV 10G V.ND +12 127
#note I like this play...? Actually, I was happy to make this play over V(E)EP in the same spot. Progress!
>Jesse: BEIILOT D4 BELO. +33 142
#note should play elbow!
>dacrON: EMPRSST 7C ...S +16 143
#note Considered adding the T on. I realized I was setting up P(SI), but it never occurred to me to play the P right then, which is obviously better. All it takes is one mistake.
>Jesse: AIIIINT I10 .I.I +19 161
#note Jesse had IIII here.
>dacrON: ELMPRST C11 M.L +10 153
#note Right idea, but too many points given back versus M(E)L.
>Jesse: AIINPTT 6F PAINT +26 187
#note Conrad: He wanted to block the additional lanes, knowing I had an S and a strong leave.  Jesse: the board is so open that I don't change his bingo percentage much but it is competitive with just playing PIT. playing PINTA instead of PITA drops his average per turn by 5 assuming ERST, presumably because I take out some bingos and 2x2s on column K.
>dacrON: EEOPRST J1 PROET.ES +62 215
#note Oddly enough, the T actually gave me a bingo.

>dacrON: EEGNNOR N6 GONE +22 265
#note Was between 14B GENRO, 8L G(I)EN, and 8J (S)ER(I)NG. Maybe I was getting too cute here...? Wins the sim, but I don't really know if that makes it right.
>Jesse: ADNNRUY O5 YARN +37 341
#note Jesse promptly exposed an N, lol.
>dacrON: ENRRRUX E3 REX +42 307
#note Close call with this and 14B RERUN I hated blocking the lane, but 42 points seemed like an awful lot, and I figured I'd at least have one more chance to bingo. I also thought I could draw a high scoring play at 14B, and get back in it if he made a dinky blocking play. That said, RERUN must be better - I can hopefully capitalize on the X spot next turn, and preserve the hook, and I should still have two lanes to bingo after that. Probably ill thought through, although I don't really know that it wins me any more games...thoughts?
>Jesse: AAADDNU L10 AUDAD +15 356
#note I take out his remaining two lanes but if he scores enough I could still be in trouble.
>dacrON: ACNRRUY 14B CARNY +42 349
#note Sure enough, if I can hit the Z, I can actually pull this game out. Unfortunately EEETU will not get that done.
>Jesse: AGHINOZ K11 NAZI +47 403
>dacrON: EEERTUU 15C REE +16 365
#note E(ID)ER is really hard to see. I was pretty sure I ad to block there, but I'd run out of time.
>Jesse: CGHO 13K ..G +26 429
>dacrON: ETUU 2F UTE +9 374
#note 5H TU(T)U is 3 better.
>Jesse: CHO C4 OH +23 452
#note J14 HO scores 5 more.
>dacrON: U 11B U. +4 378
#note oops! (L)U(V) is present for 7!
>dacrON:  (C) +6 384
#note If I played PS(I), perhaps this game goes differently. All in all, a decent effort.
