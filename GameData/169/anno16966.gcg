#note Want one of the eights -- if I'm going to win by 119, it'll be because I'm bagging him, and I want an opener board where my bingoes will play. Maybe SANTERIA is best for that reason as well, but def want one of the eights I think.

#note Hey, a bunny right off! Want to bingo as soon as possible -- open lanes, keep the board unclogged. Opening J6 for cheap points helps as well.

#note Dude, if you bingo, I'm not going to win by enough to win the tournament.

#note Worth noting that I completely blanked on the hook to RYE for this entire game.

#note It's about here that I think winning the tournament may be out of reach, and just need to win the game to ice second.

#note Playing off six keeping a blank always feels kind of badass.

>Spherulitic: ?ACHIUW A1 HAW +35 374
#note Q likes CUsHAW. Plays at B6 are right out as they give too much back. Opp has a mid-20s play on row 14, but it will give me row 15 back. If I play CUSHAW, 1) it empties, so he'll go out first; 2) he has a sweet lane to bing out; and 3) I'll be a tempo ahead but CUSHAW empties so he's pretty easily out in two with a 20-something play on row 15 to start. I guess 3G WHA (which I didn't really consider) takes out the only scoring spot for the outstanding H and may be better than A1 HAW. Of course if he has the H, then there might even be a biggish play on row 14. Hmm...
>Geoffrey_Newman: DN H3 N.D +4 364
#note He doesn't have the H, so he blocks my ECH.
