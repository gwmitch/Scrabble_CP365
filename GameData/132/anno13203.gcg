#note Quackle gives slight preference to  SPHENEs 8B for the extra 2 scoreboard points. I didn't know that word so PEaHENS was my choice.  That said, I don't think the extra two points for 8B SPHENES are worth putting the E at 8G.
>q: ABDLTUZ F8 .DZ +32 32
>Jim_Burlant: AGILNRT H1 TRIANGL. +80 158
#note Bingos all over the place (E1 TRIANGLE, J8 STARLING, H5 ALTERING, H7 RELATING, etc.) but this is best.  87% to win.
>q: ABIILTU 9B BUIL. +15 47
>Jim_Burlant: CDDIOTW 2G C.OWD +19 177
#note Wasn't quite sure what to do here.  Considered E5 DOWEL and this.  DOWEL doesn't open up a triple line but if opponent has the right counters it could give back just as much as this.  I chose this because  it does the best job clearing out the consonant overload.  Quackle agrees - it's eitther this or DOW(EL), and the sim indicates they're pretty much identically strong plays, with this getting a statistically insignificant margin.  92.5% to win.

#note Best bingo.  The other option:  TRIOXIDE N1 86.  97% to win.
>q: AEEILTY 5K YE +26 145
>Jim_Burlant: ADIOOQY 10K QAID +38 308
#note So fixated on the X I just put down that I forgot to look for potential backhooks to aDZE.  QAID also plays at 12C for 43. While this only gives up 5 scoreboard points to 12C QAID, both the sim and Championship Player make clear that, if I could play the right tiles and still make an only mediocre play, this was it.  If I had played at 12C, there are only 3 I's unseen with which opponent could hook the Q.  In comparison, there are 8 E's with wihch opponent can hook AX, as well as the juicy S hook I just opened up down the O column.    12C QAID definitely should have been the play, but I wind up benefitting.

>Jim_Burlant: AENOOPY O4 .OPEY +30 338
#note I didn't see the star equity play here (A11 YAPON), as the hot spots at 8A and the whole O column commanded my complete attention.   Having said that, this was one of those instances where I didn't mind trading equity for some peace of mind.   The only play I really had at 8A was PAY A6, and the ENOO leave was too yucky for me to consider it.  Especially when you consider that not only did ANIMATOR open up a 3x3, but my questionable placement of QAID on the previous turn had to be cleaned up.  With all that, I figured I should eliminate the 3x3 and reduce the threat of what opponent could do down the O column with an S.  Both the sim and championship player state that YAPON A11 47 is best...but that if you're going to choose defense, it's either this or O1 OPERON.  This is third in the sim, albeit at a huge equity deficit to YAPON.  I preferred this to OPERON since it scores 30 to operon's 27, and this  unloads the Y.  Also - I might normally want to hold the E, but with the bag less than half full and 6 E's still unseen, I'm not at all worried about unloading my E.  
>q: AEFFKTU A6 KAF +47 266
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEENNO C1 NEONAtE +68 406
#note Well, that certainly worked out, didn't it?   Any number of bingos available:  C1 ANEMONE, NOVENAE, and 6C ENNEAGON with varying placements of the blank.  Any of the C1 bingos are best here.  
>q: EFISTUU 7G U.U +14 280
>Jim_Burlant: GOOORTV 1A TO.G +21 427
#note Yuck!  Had to talk myself out of GONOV*, and it's a good thing I did.  Any number of 20-point plays available - E4 GROVEL, M1 GROTTO,  9L TOO, D8 PIVOT.  I just wanted to take out A1.  The sim indicates that, from a win percentage and scoring standpoint, anything is as good as anything else.  That said, this gives up roughly 3 points to E4 GROVEL (sim winner) and 2 points to M1 GROTTO.  I didn't see either of those.
>q: BEFISTW A11 BEFIT +47 327
>Jim_Burlant: GIMOORV 9L MOO +24 451
#note Played this to both balance the rack as well as set up a hook for the case I so I could do something with (MAX)I on the next turn.  Q agrees - it's best.  Q also likes N1 VROOM a lot - I don't.  Even if the win is a done deal by now, why give opponent a potential JA(V)A for 66 as a comeback?
>q: AJLRRSW C11 RAW +38 365
>Jim_Burlant: AGIORSV H10 V.RAGO +33 484
#note The only bingo I saw in the unseen pool was CHARNELS, and I was willing to gamble that opponent didn't have it.  Also - I was fixated on playing something starting in SI at 12K on the next turn.  I thought this took away opponent's most likely hot spot while preserving SI for the next turn.  Q just wants me to play SAVIOR O10 54 now and hates this.  I get my huge play on the next turn.
