>Ryan_Fischer: EEFHLOP 8E PELF +18 18
#note 8G FEH leaving ELOP is better.

>Dave_Leifer: DNOU 1D .OUND +27 45
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEELOS I2 ELODEAS +70 120
#note I thought this was the right play, but versus Dave, I'm not so sure?  Analysis?
>Dave_Leifer: IX J2 XI +52 97
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAIINNR -AIN +0 120
#note Dammit, so unlucky, and missed NA(O)I, which seems pretty obvious in hindsight.  Bad exchange in hindsight.
>Dave_Leifer: AGIILNW C4 WAILING +69 166
#note Le'dammit!
>Ryan_Fischer: AAINORU 5I .OURA +12 132
#note ANURIA is too volatile.  AU(D)IO is okay.
>Dave_Leifer: JOST N2 JOTS +29 195
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEINOR 4L AN.A +16 148
#note This shitty drawing is driving me nuts.  Thought about OA(T) but it just really cripples that part of the board.  AN(T)A isn't much better, admittedly.  I probably should've just taken the points with NORI.

#note #^&@)*(%&!
>Ryan_Fischer: EIMORSV A8 OVER +36 184
#note And my bingo doesn't fit. :/  Q says OM for 27.  Yuck.  VERMIS, I didn't know.  Plays for 49.
>Dave_Leifer: CEENRT 12A TENREC +27 263
#note Juuuust great.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIMRSW 6H M.W +29 213
#note Missed OVERTRIM or OVERTIME.
>Dave_Leifer: DHI F6 HI.D +33 296
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGIIRS F12 .IG +10 223
#note Missed OVERTIRE.  This is how I lost to Dave last time.  Let the board get too closed, then opened at an inopportune time.  Figured I had to, though.  Of note: TRUMPERIES.
>Dave_Leifer: CDIIN 14A DICIN. +20 316
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEIRS L4 ..EAE +6 229
#note #(^*@$%^!  (M)A(F)IA looks okay.
>Dave_Leifer: ??BIOPR K7 PROBIng +74 390
#note At least play PROBIty.  :P
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIRSU A14 .E +9 238
#note I don't know anymore.  I hate this game.
>Dave_Leifer: AYZ 12I ZA.Y +30 420
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFIRSU 8K ..FER +24 262
#note Open another lane and pray.
>Dave_Leifer: GT M3 G..T +18 438
>Ryan_Fischer: AISSTUY 15D TASSY +39 301
#note When all else fails, make up a word that really isn't that much greater a play 'cause you still can't play out as a result.  Yuck.  (It's TASSIE or TASS.)
