#note Tough call. WE was a good leave, but it looked a bit fishy and I felt Adam could block the FUNGI lanes after it. This left me with options no matter what. I still like it.

#note Tough, tough, position. Bingo lines are dwindling and I need to clean up my rack before I can bingo. And I am going to need more than a bingo to win. This play accomplishes almost none of what I need to do. The biggest issue here is that I've forgotten NAZIR. I should burn my blank with ZUPAN. Or play the clever 7L TUNS and go for a ZING bingo.

#note It felt likely that Adam played short avoid unseen drek. That's how I interpretted it, at least. If I were sharp on my fives, I'd realise he was maybe just blocking NAZIR. (He was doing both.) In any case, I dunno if I can afford to play scared at this score. Or can I? M3 ZO ties the game and puts the onus back on Adam to turn over tiles. I think I misevaluated my chances after TOPEE. And misevaluated just how often my rack was going to be total crap after this play.
