#note Just more endgame practice.  I hope I played a good endgame this time.  I played pretty quickly because I wanted to hurry up to get to the end.  I also can't find my scoresheet for this game and so I have to do this by memory.  I'm pretty sure I got everything right, though.

#note 9G NODI sims at the top.   I wanted to play DONNE, but didn't see the spot.  It plays at 6H.  Doh.  Anyways, this play sucks.  
>Al: DEW M3 WED +19 46
#note Oh, that isn't so bad.  Usually when I make mistakes like this, I get burned with plays like ZAX.

#note To my surprise, Al holds my play for a while, but lets it go.

#note Probably the most unusual play in the game.   I went back and forth between AGA or AG at K4, AG at 6G, AGA at 7A, and GAL at 7B, and what I eventually went with.  I played SPACIAL for the points, to turn over six tiles being both blanks are still out, and most importanly, the psychological factor (You have to know Al to understand) .   Al holds this play for about 2 seconds, then lets it go.   Anyways, top pay is E1 JACAL which I didn't even see.  I think had the score been different (or if I were playing someone else) I would have went with K4 AGA or AG.  Probably AGA, though.

#note J8 (T)UQUE. 14B VULGO.   I seriously need to work on looking at all spots on the board.  I went back and forth between B5 EQUAL or QUALE and 13C VAGUE.  I played QUALE just to be annoying and block any ING 8s on column A.   Now that I'm looking at this, I like VAGUE better.  I have two Us with a Q!  If I would have played AG A, I wouldn't have such a bad rack now.  And I STILL don't have a blank.
>Al: SSTT 13C T.TS +8 197
#note I lied.  THIS is the most unusual play of the game.  After the game, he said he had two T's and two S's.  This play reminds me of the time Andrew opened with SIS for six points and then bingoed the next turn with PARADOS (hooking the P to SIS).  Needless to say, I was highly suspicious and thought he had both blanks.  
>Tasha: AGGOUUV -GGOUUV +0 296
#note This rack is punishing me for not seeing JACAL.  And not playing AGA!  I just know it!  K4 OVA or K4 AVO.   Not that I would have played them had I seen them. 31 points or no, GGUU is horrible.

#note 6A AQUA.  Is it just me or am I sucking more than usual this game.?  
>Al: AEINRST 11F STAINER +69 279
#note Nice find.
>Tasha: ??ACEIU O1 ..UCAtIvE +89 395
#note Al and I coffee-house and joke around all the time during our games.  I let him know I had both blanks (the fact that I pulled them BOTH after a two-tile play is freaking HILARIOUS) and  I asked him if he'll challenge (ED)UCATIVE  if I were to play it and he just smiles.  Al suddenly notices that he had RETSINA at 5D the previous turn and so I decided to play my bingo while he's psychologically damaged.

#note Okay, this is pre-endgame, right?  I have nine minutes on my clock at this point.  And this play isn't on the list which caused me to freak out for a bit.   I've been practicing for a whole week and I STILL suck???  But it turns out that after I added it it's right behind sim winner N9 AX.
>Al: FILORV L10 F.IVOL +26 339
>Tasha: ADEFRUV 14I FAV.RED +32 463
#note This is starting to piss me off.  My play is bad because it gives him an out when he had none.  (And I tracked him correctly).   This is absolutely unacceptable.   I've been practicing for a week...and I still suck.

#note More practice, I suppose.  Let's see how I do in another week.
