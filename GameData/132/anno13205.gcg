>Kolton_Koehler: EGOQSSU 8H SQUEG +34 34
#note Quackles likes SQUEGS for 52. I like to get more value out of my S next turn.
>Jesse_Wornum: ?AEISTX M8 SEXTAIn +94 94
#note Nice opening draw.
>Kolton_Koehler: BEKOPRS 12L B.RK +30 64
#note Quackle likes taking the triple lane with REBOPS or POKERS for 53. 12L K(A)B is interesting. My choice is 4th.
>Jesse_Wornum: DOU O12 .UDO +27 121
>Kolton_Koehler: DEHOPRS 15H EPHODS +56 120
>Jesse_Wornum: AIL N9 LIA. +21 142
>Kolton_Koehler: ADEENNR H6 EN.NARED +60 180
#note Hate that I have to leave the triple lane open
>Jesse_Wornum: EINRRST 10C RESTR.IN +62 204
#note 11 bingos score more than this. L1 RESTRIN(G) for 70 is best
>Kolton_Koehler: AEJLOTT 6F JO. +26 206
>Jesse_Wornum: FFPU O6 PUFF +42 246
>Kolton_Koehler: AEEELTT F6 .EE +10 216
#note 13C TEATE(D) or ELATE(D) for 16 are the best plays here. Mine is near the bottom. I thought this would be okay since I already have the AJEE option.

#note And so does he
>Kolton_Koehler: AELNTTV K5 NAV.TTE +49 265

>Jesse_Wornum: CEIOV 13C VOICE. +26 308
>Kolton_Koehler: GGILRRT D3 GL.IR +12 277
#note This was risky. But I needed a big score and convinced myself that he didn't know GLAIRE or GLAIRY.
>Jesse_Wornum: ACY J4 CAY +31 339
>Kolton_Koehler: AGOOORT 3C A.OROT +16 293
#note Well he didn't know GLAIRY. Gonna try for turnover to get an E as well as open another lane.

>Kolton_Koehler: GMMOOTZ D12 Z.OM +36 329
#note What a great draw!
>Jesse_Wornum: ADE E12 A.DE +23 404
>Kolton_Koehler: BEGIMOT 15D ..T +5 334
#note Given what was left in the pool, the only bingo that I saw remaining was EMBO(W)ING [drawing the blank for (W)OMBIEsT, (I)MpETIGO, and M(I)sBEGOT are the other possible bingos]. So I dump the T and pray that my 3/8 chance of drawing it pays off.
>Jesse_Wornum: ?ILLNNU 2G N.LL +8 412
#note He knew better than to leave that lane open. haha. (top play is (I)NULINs)
