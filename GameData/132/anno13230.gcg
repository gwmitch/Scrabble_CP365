#note MIRV# 7J is way better. I saw it but didn't realize it scored 20. Definitely an improvement over this.

#note Huge, huge blunder. Missing ELVISH for 53 is bad, but this is especially bad because both C's are unseen, so I'm offering him an obvious 36+ if he has one. Even dinky little LEV M3, among many other things, is better than this.

#note The pool is fairly balanced/safe, so it's fine to turn over more tiles here. CLIT# J10 sims best, but I couldn't find it :-(

#note CP says SELL K2 wins 6/8 endgames, but I'm permuting them out and that doesn't appear to be true. Both of us were low on time, so I just slapped this down, blocking his possible OUTRATED and hoping maybe he'd be as confused as I was about the hooks for LENT -- LENTE*, LENTI#, LENTO.
