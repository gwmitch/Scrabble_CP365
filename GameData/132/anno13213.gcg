>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: OW 8G WO +10 10
>Jim_Burlant: DEHIMNZ I7 ZED +31 31
#note Considered this and MIZEN.  Despite the clunkiness of the leave, I wanted to keep the position more closed and force him to open.  This is best.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AB J6 BA +21 31
>Jim_Burlant: AAHIMNR 5I HAM +21 52
#note It was late (after 11 pm) and this is the sort of late-night mistake I'd like to think I'd not make in a tournament game; I saw this as an easy way to kill the 2x2 so I slapped this down way too quickly without looking for the best play.  Best is 7F HAMZA.    This is awful.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IJNOS H1 JOINS +48 79
#note Just desserts.
>Jim_Burlant: AAIINNR 1H .ARINA +14 66
#note Best is another hard-to-find play - 6I ABA - that I didn't see.  I saw this and felt my best course would be to dump the rack.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EGV L4 VEG +24 103
>Jim_Burlant: GIIMNWY 6J .I.GY +24 90
#note Well, I had to make at least one good play here.  This is best.  6J BIGWIG also worth consideration.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BE G3 BE +16 119
>Jim_Burlant: IMNNNPW N2 PINN. +20 110
#note Despite the points given up to WIMPY N2, I have to do something about the N overload.  It's either this or MINNY.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ISX O1 XIS +36 155
>Jim_Burlant: AEKMNOW F2 WOK +30 140
#note Either this or WOKE in the same location.  I wanted to hold onto my E.  Winning chances are notching up a hair - 37% winning chances.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DO 9G OD. +15 170
>Jim_Burlant: AEHLMNU 5A HUMANE +33 173
#note A little surprised by the sim results here.   I'm not so enamored of an ELMNU leave that I would only want to turn 2 tiles.  Q wants me to play M3 HA for 28. With 2 blanks unseen,  I'd rather turn some tiles, open up the left side of the board because I don't have an S (is the E hook on row 10 really going to stay alive very long?)  and try again.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACDESTT 10I SCATTED +82 252
>Jim_Burlant: EEELLOU A5 .OLE +21 194
#note Yuck.  Best are J10 COULEE and O10 DUELLO.  All I know is that, coming on the heels ofmy previous game with Sam, in which I was pretty much bagged from the word go, this draw definitely rattled me a bit. I can see the point of COULEE - 2 3x3's are already open, why not open a 3rd and balance the rackwhle I'm at it?  COULEE wins 8.4%; this wins 5.4.  Another good play, which I didn't know, is DUELLO O10.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: GQU D3 QU.G +28 280
>Jim_Burlant: EEILNTU O10 .ILUTE +24 218
#note Quackle says it's either this or DUNITE O10.  Takes out the other 3x3 and opens up the entire southeast quadrant.  This is bleak, but my only chances to come back hinge on my keeping the board alive, and this really gives me more lines to play with down in the southeast.  6.77% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?DEEOPS B8 DEPOSEs +83 363
>Jim_Burlant: AELNRTV 13A R.LEVANT +74 292
#note Or LEVANTER.  2.3% to win.  Looking bleak, right?
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: RU 10B .UR +5 368
>Jim_Burlant: FFILORR E8 ROLF +20 312
#note FLOUR B2 scores 24 but not too convinced I have a shot at this point.  I've just turned 7 tiles, came up empty, and as pooly as I've drawn for most of this game I'm expecting him to double-blank me.  Anyway - this is 25% to win...and watch what happens.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEEIRTT D10 .E +7 375
#note Sam told me post-mortem that this had been his rack.  What do you do if you're in this spot with this pool?  Not knowing his rack at the time I crossed my fingers he would either play something short to take out H15 and that he'd stay away from a 5 at L10 or M10.  My eyes got as big as golf balls when he put this down.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACFIIR 15H ARtIFIC. +98 410
#note  Kapow!!!!!
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEIORTT M8 RO.ATE +14 389
