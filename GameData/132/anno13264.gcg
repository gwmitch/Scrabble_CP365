#note 11L NAOI 18 (not 13K due to better snapbacks), 11K OI 10, M11 AGIO 10, 7G OI 9 and J10 IOTA 6 look like the most reasonable options. I don't like playing off IO much because it doesn't look like there is a lot of potential for eights. Even if I play at 7G he's often going to play on row 11 and block my AEGINR/AEINRT potential. NAOI gives him fewer scoring options than AGIO and IOTA, but also closes some spots rather than opening new ones. It still leaves a fairly open board though. I think I would take AGIO over IOTA due to points and SSSS?? out. I would lean toward AGIO over NAOI because of the way it opens the board. It's allows better scores for Matt but also opens the board quite well.

#note I like KYTE or TINKLY here to keep a more open board, and KYTE seems to do the best job. It's a tough play. Quackle is a big fan of my play but I'm not sure.

>whatnoloan: BEHOPWZ O1 POH +40 328
#note 4L WHIZ 58, 1L WHuP 45, and O1 POH 40 seem like the candidates here. WHIZ and POH have the advantage of not opening as much for him to do with a strong leave including an ES. I think I was too conservative here. POH doesn't score enough or keep much more than WHuP/WHIZ. The decision between those two is tough. Thoughts?

#note I really don't understand why I made this play. I think 4D DACE is right to score well and allow me to block GLIB if he doesn't bingo.

#note REG 4B appears best.
>whatnoloan: ACEENTU 4B TENACE +32 426
#note CETANE is better because I(N) is a worse blocking play than E(EL). I made some questionable plays this game which is why I wanted to look it over.
