#note I bingo about 33% after D1 WIG! Wow. Also, I get good intermediate plays like BAIZA/DOURA a lot.

#note Sim likes C2 BLIP. I don't see that accomplishing much unless I draw the case S for ZIGS. A lot of the iterations that are pumping up the value of that play result from plays that Jason is just not going to make a lot (N6 DOURA/AI, etc).

#note BLIP again, this time making a little more sense because shedding the B lets me bingo a lot more often.

#note Burned all my remaining time here. CP says that a lot of plays that don't empty the bag win 100 percent here. All I really had to do was ensure that I could withstand the nightmare scenario of DIAGNOSE/AGONISE, and playing KOBO does not do that. It should still win a lot though.
