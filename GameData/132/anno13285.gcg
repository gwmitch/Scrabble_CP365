#note a lot of moves here seem pretty lame. CUIF, this, and 1K UP all sim super closely. i suppose it's stylistic.

#note this move isn't very good. i was just going to play VROUW but was worried about a bingo that scored too much on row 13 -- saw TEENIER in particular. B12 TOFU looks best, but i did not actually figure out the unseen pool and don't think i could have been sure that there were absolutely no bingos with the U. (although pretty damn sure ...) VROUW will outrun TEENIER in any case and keep the F for scoring somewhere. i think so at least. (-16.5)
