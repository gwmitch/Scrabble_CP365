>Matthew_O'Connor: AEEIJKN H4 KANJI +42 42
#note Best by a large margin, but it took me a while to see this, most likely because I was mad at being 1-2.
>Mina_Le: ACLN 4D CLAN. +22 22
>Matthew_O'Connor: EEEOQRU F2 QU.ERE +37 79
#note I believe this was my rack. If it was, then quaere was best by a long shot
>Mina_Le: ORV 5H .RVO +14 36
>Matthew_O'Connor: ?EEOSTV 8A VETOES +46 125
#note Interesting position here. I figured vetoes would put me up a bingo and would give me a bingo sometime in the near future. Championship player agrees, but just barely, putting it .09 percentage points above devotes/kanjis (wasn't sure of kanjis the entire game)
>Mina_Le: DELNRRU C8 .RUNDLER +70 106
>Matthew_O'Connor: ?AEGIOU 12C .IAlOGUE +72 197
#note Only 72 point bingo. Championship player, however, prefers eulogiae on E8 by .16 percentage points, mostly because it basically undoes the forking of the board that trundler did.
>Mina_Le: IX B10 XI +52 158
>Matthew_O'Connor: EHM 15A HE.M +36 233
#note Don't remember the rack here
>Mina_Le: CLPT J10 CL.PT +17 175
>Matthew_O'Connor: ADINSTW 14A AW. +27 260
#note iI believe this was the rack here, but I could be wrong. I played awe relatively quickly without looking for some other possibilities in that place. Champion's favorite move is DAW/OD/lA/OW by .16 spread points over my move, most likely because DINST is a bit consonant heavy. Luckily I draw 2 vowels to it.
>Mina_Le: ABG 11E BAG +24 199
>Matthew_O'Connor: ADINOST 10E ODA +24 284
#note hahaha wow, I actually missed this with dialoged. This makes it the second best scoring play, and leaves it with a worse leave than some of the other plays. Championship player prefers OD to this by the slim margin of .12 spread points, and really berates ODA/LO/DIAlOGUED/PA in the sim, most likely because Mina can stage a comeback with some of the letters back in that spot.
>Mina_Le: APY H12 .APY +30 229
>Matthew_O'Connor: AINNRTT -  +0 284
#note I challenge, because I know gapiest is no good, but I'm wrong.
>Mina_Le: ?EFIOST L5 SOFTIEs +68 297
#note And now I'm in huge trouble
>Matthew_O'Connor: AILNRTT K12 RAIN +20 304
#note And then I miss TRAN(Q). Just terrible. This doesn't even show up on championship player's choices, and it sims as if it were about 20th.
>Mina_Le: AEHMN 8J AN.HEM +33 330
#note Also HETMAN, but this sims better
>Matthew_O'Connor: ILSTTTZ 14F ZI. +34 338
#note The only good scoring move, although it was very scary to play this. Quackle actually prefers TILTS M10, which I have no explanation for (it blocks but puts me behind, and forces me to draw another I to cash the Z). It also prefers tot to my play, with ZI(P) third.
>Mina_Le: DE 13A DE. +17 347
>Matthew_O'Connor: FGLSTTT 10J .L.FT +12 350
#note After an ugly FG draw, I'm left with few options. I have a few plays, and a bunch of exchanges to choose from. This is my only chance to exchange. My choice of cleft was based on Mina being able to outrun me way too easily if I were to eschew it. Oddly enough, CLEFT doesn't show on Championship Player's list, but CLEFTS does. Strange.
>Mina_Le: BDENRSU -  +0 347
#note This most likely cost her the game. Championship player recommends SUNDER/CLEFTS, and I would have challenged, putting her more in the lead. SUNDER gives her a 95.15 win percentage, as opposed to 26 percent for passing.
>Matthew_O'Connor: EGOOSTT 15K .OTES +18 368
#note Missing CLEFTS/STOOGE, I find another option that uses the triply. I know 6 of Mina's tiles and thus know she is unlikely to bingo. Thus, I make this play, take a 21 point play, and make it very hard for her to win.
>Mina_Le: BDENRSU N14 B. +8 355
#note Mina reverses course and fishes. Quackle recommends the fish of N(E), however.
>Matthew_O'Connor: GIIOOTW 13M WOG +19 387
#note This appears to lose with only one tile in the bag, and I believe I drew that tile. I don't know how to read quackle analysis with 1 in the bag, since it says 87.06 as opposed to 87.50. I liked how this grabbed a 32 point lead, and couldn't see a bingo for her. Thus, this play. Quackle says (PA)TIO 13J and TOW(IE) N4  win 100 percent of the time.
>Mina_Le: DENRSUY J2 NER.Y +21 376
#note But I draw the 1 tile that loses. Luckily, it is a tricky out in two that happens by playing SUR(G)E(S) which threatens DYN(E) in 2 spots for 16 and Y(O)ND for 17. Mina didn't know DYNE. The play I thought was correct was (L)YE at E4. (L)YE loses by 1 point after I play (J)OT, she plays R(O)UND, I play (Q)I, and she plays KANJI(S). This causes her to lose 410-411. Her play of NER(V)Y forces me to play accurately by playinh IF/IN instead of the immediate QI play to earn a 2 point win. Neither of us ended up playing accurately, and I won after a double error after this.
>Matthew_O'Connor: IIIOT G1 TI +13 400
#note This LOSES. She can now play FUD and set up an unblockable KANJIS, which wins her the game by 2 points. How can I be so stupid? Lucky she was an out in two robot and missed the tricky to spot (F)UD in time trouble.
>Mina_Le: DSU 6L .UDS +9 385
#note A lesson to us all. Don't always go out as fast as you can! There might be a good play lurking that can win you the game. A great game regardless, and a game that I was happy to be a part of and a game that helped Mina win the tuff luck prize.
