>Rafi: EGLLOOO 8G LOGO +10 10
#note Wasn't sure which placement was best, but knowing that I have LOGOMACHS/LOGOMACHY and LOGOPHILE in my head tipped the scales in favor of this placement. -TYPES, -GRAPH, -GRIPH, -GRAMS, and -RRHEA are the other extensions.
>Nigel_Peltier: ?DEILNS K5 ENISLeD +84 84
>Rafi: DEEELOO L10 DOOLEE +21 31
#note One point more on the left, but doesn't create an S lane which might come in handy later.
>Nigel_Peltier: DORX 15K R.DOX +39 123
>Rafi: AABEETY 14N YA +29 60
#note ABEET is a nice leave with two L's open! Very unfortunate to be at 15% win chances on turn 3.
>Nigel_Peltier: ?ADESTU H8 .UTDAtES +77 200
>Rafi: AABEERT 13B TRABEA.E +72 132
#note Despite the bingo coming back, I'm down to below 10% win chances.
>Nigel_Peltier: EJORT B10 JOT.ER +58 258
>Rafi: EMRRRUU 10B .URUM +20 152
#note Phoney. UR(A)RE is a decent option also, setting up a double-double that a -UM play might get lucky enough to hit. Down to 2% to win.
>Nigel_Peltier: AITTTV 5E VITTAT. +20 278
>Rafi: EEGINRR 15A E.RING +24 176
#note I was hoping to draw ZAS for a big ZA leaving ZED-S with ERS?? left over. Fishing is less viable because I have no lanes to work with unless I draw an S.
>Nigel_Peltier: AIIMNOV F4 V.M +14 292
>Rafi: EIINQRZ -INIQ +0 176
#note Again hoping for AS for ZA+ a bingo. Wish QI wasn't blocked as it also set up the Z!
>Nigel_Peltier: CEGKOS M5 GECKOS +20 312
>Rafi: BEINRWZ H1 ZIBE. +51 227
>Nigel_Peltier: AFIQ D6 FAQI. +27 339
>Rafi: ACHNRWW J10 WAW +36 263
#note If I'm going to win, CHNR is a good a leave as any here. I can't just hit a baby bingo... I need 90+ most likely!
>Nigel_Peltier: EFHIIIN 8M .IN +21 360
>Rafi: CFHINPR E9 F.N +17 280
#note Figured Nigel left IN + 3 one pointers. Seemed like Nigel not having the O was a reasonable chance, in which case PROCHEIN/PROCHAIN is actually hittable here! Also thought of fishing for LINCHPIN, but Nigel's play of KIN decreases the likelihood of I's and N's being drawable.
>Nigel_Peltier: AEN I1 ANE +22 382
>Rafi: CHILPRU 11E .UR. +9 289
#note Going for L(IN)CHPINS for 94! CEPHALIN is also available (didn't see it) but I did see PHENOLIC as a spread-cutting alternative. Also PHENYLIC! U(G)H going for REPLICON is also possible, but no way will it stay open, whereas LINCHPINS might!
>Nigel_Peltier: AEINOSY G11 .Y. +11 393
#note Nigel quickly slapped down RYA, going for SENOPIA/SAPONINE. Slick play!
>Rafi: CHIILPP C3 PILI +17 306
#note With under a minute on my clock, I find the best endgame.
>Nigel_Peltier: AEHINOS 2H ..HESION +38 431
#note And so does Nigel.
