>Chris_Tallman: CEEORRS 8G RESCORE +70 70
#note Rounds 5, 7, and 8 were uploaded by my opponents and I can't do 6, so I'll restart my Nationals annos with Round 9.

Spent a bit deciding on placement. Not sure if there's too much difference between a bunch of them - O on the star might be the most conventional maybe.
>Jason_Li: AFGINZ M7 F.AZING +50 50
#note Held this for a minute - couldn't remember whether FEAZE was a verb - but eventually decided Jason wouldn't phony here with this and let it go.
>Chris_Tallman: AELNOUU L11 LUAU +17 87
#note Debated between this and U(N)AU since I didn't like creating the LUAUS hook, but decided it wasn't worth it to sacrifice to play defense so early in what is virtually an even game here. 
>Jason_Li: NQRU H6 QU.RN +14 64
#note Jason has 3 more consonants a very high % of the time here, I think. 
>Chris_Tallman: EINOORW J8 .OWIER +19 106
#note I spent a long time here. I saw the sim's preferred WOOER L4, but decided on (C)OWIER finally to play 5 to maximize draws at blanks and hopefully play long-term defense (although this opens lines immediately). My idea is to play off of COWIER to block the 2 big S hooks eventually. Not sure what the right idea is here.
>Jason_Li: MNORU K4 UNMO.R +18 82
#note Jason seems to be struggling. All 4 U's gone already!  He opens the top a bit and also plays 5  for the critical s's/blanks.
>Chris_Tallman: EGLMNOW J2 GENOM +34 140
#note Thought about putting it on the other side of UNMOOR to avoid opening the 3 lane, but 6 points is far too much to sacfrifice with this many big lanes still open and not much of a lead.
>Jason_Li: INTT L1 TINT +16 98
>Chris_Tallman: ?BDEGLW N6 WED +31 171
#note Noticed BOWLEGGED if there were somehow disconnected letters available, but no :( lol ... Almost played GED to not give up easy access to the O1 triple lane, but again figured that it wasn't worth it with the other lanes still available.
>Jason_Li: APX F8 PAX +42 140
>Chris_Tallman: ?BGKLOT E9 KOB +33 204
>Jason_Li: ?ADEFTT O1 FlATTED +95 235
#note If I had done GED earlier he'd have still have DAFTEsT, so meh.
>Chris_Tallman: ?CGLLST -CGLL +0 204
#note Suddenly its not looking so good after my early advantage. Probably should have kept CST? instead of ST? here.
>Jason_Li: AYY I1 YAY +25 260
#note Setting up a scoring spot to counteract my impending bingo?
>Chris_Tallman: ?ADESST 15F SeDATES +80 284
#note Wow, the sim likes ATES H1 and it's not close at all! I considered it pretty strongly and I think it makes further sense to infer YAY didn't leave an S, probably, since if Jason is looking to bingo, he won't want to leave me that juicy spot, maybe? Further evidence of my reluctance to pass up bingoes in situations where its called for in tourney games...
>Jason_Li: BEIJ 14E JIBE +25 285
#note I was pretty damn happy to see the H1 spot left unmolested.
>Chris_Tallman: ADEILOO H1 ODEA +44 328
#note Boom! I have a pretty big advantage now if I can close that SKA/OKA spot.
>Jason_Li: AEELLOS -AEEL +0 285
#note Change 4
>Chris_Tallman: EGILNOV D7 VIOL +25 353
#note This is by far the easier lane to hit; no way am I playing VOILE/VOGIE and KOBO.
>Jason_Li: HIV 12G HIV. +11 296
#note Clever play by Jason, fishing for a bingo (can't remember what he said it was now) to the A
>Chris_Tallman: EGLNORT 4D GENO. +12 365
#note I decide to block the last lane just in case...
>Jason_Li: AHP 5E HAP +32 328
#note And he said he hit it! Cautiousness ftw :)
>Chris_Tallman: ACEILST N10 AT +20 385
#note This seems to be the best endgame by 8 points (?)
>Jason_Li: EIILR 13G ER +17 345
#note (V)ER(A) I12 for 8 more.
>Chris_Tallman: CEILS 12A CEILS +30 415
#note Left Jason with LII haha
>Chris_Tallman:  (IIL) +6 421
#note This seems to be a pretty well-played game by me other than SeDATES and possibly COWIER. More nationals games to follow in the coming ???? haha
