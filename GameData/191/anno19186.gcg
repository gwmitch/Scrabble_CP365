>Jim_Kramer: ENRW 8F WREN +14 14
>Chris_Tallman: AEIKPTX F8 .AX +29 29
#note As usual, tried to figure out how to keep the X, but it's clearly not worth it here.
>Jim_Kramer: BILR 7H BIRL +14 28
>Chris_Tallman: EIKPPST E9 KEP +33 62
#note Didn't know SKIPPET, which plays for 97!
>Jim_Kramer: COZ 6G COZ +31 59
>Chris_Tallman: AIIPSTV 12D VIA +22 84
#note Let's try again with PIST. PAVIS is 36, but this sims best (+1.5% over VITA). Underscored it by 2 though.
>Jim_Kramer: AAGINST L3 ANTISAG +75 134
>Chris_Tallman: ADFIPST M1 FID +20 104
#note FID/FAD flipflop but I prefer A to I since I'm scared of I duplication. 3K F(A)D is also an option I didn't consider.
>Jim_Kramer: ?DHNORU M8 HOUNDeR +81 215
#note Now I'm in a big hole...
>Chris_Tallman: AAOPSTW 15H WATAPS +53 157
>Jim_Kramer: AEGUV K1 VAGUE +29 244
>Chris_Tallman: EEGIOTY J2 YE +32 189
#note Wanted to keep a more balanced leave but the sim wants me to tack the T on; I guess GT antisynergy and just 4 points.
>Jim_Kramer: HINY 11J HIN.Y +22 266
#note Jim is slowly taking all the real estate and choking the board down. There's still some hope now, though, since SKA remains.
>Chris_Tallman: EEGIMOT 14E GEMOTE +24 213
#note This isn't a very good play. My reasoning is that I'll probably need the blank to win, so I wanted to maximize turnover. But if the KA hooks are blocked after this, there doesn't seem to be a way back into the game. I straight missed EMOTE(D) for 31, and maybe (F)OG M1 to open another lane and leave EEIMT is better.
>Jim_Kramer: ELMR 13H MERL +22 288
>Chris_Tallman: FILORST 2M .F +10 223
#note Didn't see FLIRT(Y) N6 for 36, which might be too many points to pass up. PLayed this because I felt the urgency to bingo right away, and figured this would create a distraction from the SKA line. I definitely like this over any of the other non-FLIRTY plays.
>Jim_Kramer: IL 1M .IL +23 311
#note Distraction successful. Now...
>Chris_Tallman: AILORST D3 TAILORS +73 296
#note I hit it! But I miss RIALTOS for 10 more... yikes.
>Jim_Kramer: JO C7 JO +36 347
#note So I draw COEDITS, and I'm still not too happy since I didn't draw the blank and am probably still in bad shape. Then this happens hahaha
>Chris_Tallman: CDEIOST B8 COEDITS +79 375
#note CESTOID avoids giving up huge Q spots, but Jim likely didn't keep the Q with JO. That's all armchair quarterbacking though, since all I was thinking was '**** Yeah, COEDITS!' lol
>Jim_Kramer: ?AEENRU 3A sAU.ERNE +66 413
#note Deceptively tough turn for Jim here. He'll lose if I have a 90+ point Q play at A12, but I don't think there's much he can do about it. He can play one of 2 bingos, sAU(T)ERNE A3 and URE(T)hANE A3. You might think throwing the U out there is bad defense against the Q, but as it happens..
>Chris_Tallman: BEIOOQU A1 BO.QUE +78 453
#note It would have not given me this and would have won! Sick!
>Jim_Kramer: DENT 5J N..TED +7 420
#note (U)NT(I)ED is 14.
>Jim_Kramer:  (OI) +4 424
#note Crazy comeback against a former national champion that I was proud of at the time. I think it's still really cool despite my mistakes. This put me 8-2 and on top of the world hehe :)
