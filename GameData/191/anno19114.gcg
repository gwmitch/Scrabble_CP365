#note Didn't think of the fact that JOE sets up SUQ. Still a close decision.

#note Actual rack, I think.

#note I keep RS and draw IIRRR. Lol.

>Richard_Spence: ABCILRS H1 BLA. +31 88
#note I wasn't 100% sure on SCRIBAL. BLA(H) is second best. Whoops.

#note (Q)I simulates slightly better.
>Noah: AEMMOOX 5K EXAM +43 236
#note I thought long and hard about playing ATOM, and maybe should've done it too. The X is a fine tile on this board, S is pretty likely for him, and an S lane seems to more games of less skill -- I want to make the game require more skill because I think I'm the better strategic player.

#note Not knowing/seeing TRAINFUL potentially cost me the game.
>Noah: EIIRSTY 15F RYE +33 349
#note 3 points seemed way more important than the R here. Am I wrong?
>Richard_Spence: ADEGNNN 15J NAN +14 368
>Noah: DIIKPST E3 KIP +34 383
#note Looked briefly for other options but I think I just have to play this and hope.
>Richard_Spence: ADEEGNT 4D G.. +8 376
#note Honestly, I should've played D(IT), hoping the opponent doesn't have an A.
>Noah: ADIOSTZ B11 ZI.S +30 413
#note Wanted to play DIETS 11C, which appears to be a bit better on spread, but I wasn't sure enough that it opened no 9s.
