>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIV J6 VIE +25 25
>Thomas_Reinke: AEGLRRT H5 TEG.LAR +8 28
#note I didn't know what to do here. Quackle doesn't care for this. That makes two of us.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IKNOO 11G K.OONI +20 45
#note I went to Estonia to spend the spare krooni I had sitting around and guess frickin' what? They don't even accept it! Supplanted by something called the "euro". So now I have like a bunch of krooni to wipe my heinie with I guess.
>Thomas_Reinke: EIMOQRT 12F QI +17 45
#note 10L QI is better partially because it blocks big J plays at J10.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: JTU 10J JUT +55 100
#note Yeah.
>Thomas_Reinke: AEEMORT 13G TOME +18 63

>Thomas_Reinke: EELNNNS M7 NENE +25 241

>Thomas_Reinke: ELMNPTW 3C P.W +16 293
#note PAWL opens up another line which I was trying to avoid. 2B WERT looks good.
