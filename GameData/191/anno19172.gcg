#note Mistake for sure. This rack is not good enough to justify a fishy play. My thought process was to quickly narrow it down to YE versus DELAY, and I chose YE because I didn't want to give him an easy 33 for ZULU. Of course I overlooked that there are plenty of other long openings that work better - LEADY scores 26, and if he plays ZULU after that, he only scores 13 and keeps the W with three random other tiles.

>Evans_Clinchy: ADEEKLN E4 KNA.ED +28 38
#note Oops, this isn't a word. It's also probably not as good a play as just KUE for the points and leave.

#note Didn't know OHONE#. That's obviously better.

#note Ouch, bad miss. COMPTING is there. I really suck.

>Evans_Clinchy: ABDEIQU I3 QUAI +27 255
#note QUEAN# 5A is a nice fit that I didn't spot, but this has the benefit of restricting future bingos in this area of the board.
>Wendell_Haynes: FGIS A1 GIFS +41 265
#note Uh, dictionary confusion? This is in the new TWL...
>Evans_Clinchy: ABDEIOW B2 DE.OB +43 298
>Wendell_Haynes: EEP B10 PEE +25 290
>Evans_Clinchy: ACEGITW C3 W.E +32 330
#note I saw WIG J2 and considered it - the TWIG hook is certainly tempting. Predictably, it's a play that Quackle loves. But do I really need to take the risk at this point? WOE is plenty of points and doesn't give back any dangerous openings.
>Wendell_Haynes: AY 12D AY +18 308
>Evans_Clinchy: AACGITT J2 CIG +26 356
#note Just scoring, not giving much back. Either CIG or GIT works fine.
>Wendell_Haynes: EE B14 EE +9 317
>Evans_Clinchy: AAIJORT K9 JA.IR +13 369
#note Nothing really stood out to me, so I just chose the option that blocked the most bingos.
>Wendell_Haynes: R C7 R.. +7 324
>Evans_Clinchy: AALNOST 8G ..A +6 375
#note Didn't feel like playing anything long here because 1) it might give him something back and 2) the pool's starting to look real weird. I realized this fish actually hits a lot of bingos, so I took a shot at it.
