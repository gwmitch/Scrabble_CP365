>Travis_Carlson: ADDILRU 8H DRUIDAL +72 72
>Richard_Spence: EHINTWY K6 WH.TEY +30 30
#note I wasn't really sure of DRUIDAL (I knew DRUIDIC). Maybe challenging then playing WHITY would be the best play.
>Travis_Carlson: ADGN J10 DANG +22 94
>Richard_Spence: IINPPSZ 7K .IP +21 51
#note Saving the Z, since ZI(N)S doesn't look that great.
>Travis_Carlson: AELV L10 VELA +27 121

>Travis_Carlson: IOOQRST -IOOQR +0 121
>Richard_Spence: ?AINPSU 10N PA +32 116
#note I didn't see any bingos, but PA looked alright. Turns out I missed (D)AUPhINS and PAULINS/SPINULA.
>Travis_Carlson: NRT 13J .R.NT +12 133
>Richard_Spence: ?AINSTU H1 SINUATe. +77 193
#note qUINTAS is far safer, but I went for points, which probably wasn't the best move. However (D)IANThUS is best.
>Travis_Carlson: EFIILMT 7A LIFETIM. +69 202
>Richard_Spence: EGIINSU A4 GUI.E +24 217
>Travis_Carlson: ABBHOOS 14D HABOOBS +81 283
#note Lucky draw...nice play though.

>Richard_Spence: AEELORY 15A RELAY +38 337
#note YORE sims a tad better.
>Travis_Carlson: NQU 2F QU.N +33 348
>Richard_Spence: CEJMORS D1 CORM +30 367
#note I didn't really like this play, given that the X is unseen. R(A)ME(T) is probably the best play, which I didn't see.
>Travis_Carlson: AKO 13C OAK +30 378
#note Missing O(A)K 6D 34.
>Richard_Spence: EJORSTX F5 EX.T +56 423
#note I didn't see (I)XOR(A) for 60, which would've been cute.
>Travis_Carlson: EITV 1A EVI.T +30 408
>Richard_Spence: EJOORRS 4G J.RORS +26 449
#note I played this turn really hastily, so I should've taken more time. But I was fairly sure there weren't any bingos through the N or S (GEODESIC doesn't fit).
