>Matt: AAIIMRT 8F AMI +10 10
#note I liked setting up my R in the 2x2 without giving back E and S hooks.  Lots of choices to consider, like MARIA, MATAI#, AMRITA, IMARI#.
>Adam: FILOOWY 9F WOOFY +31 31
#note Actualy rack.  He wisely thought that WOOFILY* was phony.  
>Matt: AEIRRST E2 TARSIER +70 80
#note No desire to open up a 3x3 against Adam this early.
>Adam: ?EEILPS 10A kELPIES +75 106
#note So many bingoes.  TARSIER looks like the wise choice now.  Of the choices given, EPhELIS# is pretty cool.
>Matt: ALSTUVW J6 WAV. +21 101
#note I debated between this and VATU.  VATU doesn't really give back all that much, and keeps the W for scoring next turn, where LSTU isn't spectacular, and it went wrong for me.
>Adam: AEEGIOX 2B AXI.E +28 134
#note Actual rack.  He eschewed GOX because of the 4 vowel leave, and OXGATE# is way too volatile, so he chose this play, even though EGO isn't great.  ORIXA# is another interesting play though, the leave is about equal and it hides the X from counter plays.  
>Matt: ELSTUUV 3A ULU +26 127
#note Ugh, seriously.  A bad rack, and tortured by the fact that VULTURES doesn't go down.  I want to keep the T for TAXITE later, even though the L goes better with the V.  Quackle also likes UT(A), but I don't like keeping UV even if it is with ELS.  
>Adam: EGHINOT C6 HOTE.ING +78 212
#note Also IGNO(RAMI)!  I was surprised to find out this is Collins-only, WTF OWL?
>Matt: EFOSTTV A2 T.FT +24 151
#note Too focused on cashing this hook.  I can play FET for 35 down low and keep the T for another turn.  Rightly eschewed STUFT*.  
>Adam: ADDENOR 1F ADORNED +85 297
#note Adam admitted he was a bit of a luckbox this game; he was a very gracious opponent.
>Matt: EKOPSSV K1 .VOKE +24 175
#note I missed what may be my only chance to ever play kOPEKS!  I got desperate to dump the V and K and try to bingo next turn.  kOPEKS for 42 is the right play, gotta keep scoring.
>Adam: ADEMTT L3 MATTED +40 337
>Matt: ABINPSS M2 ISBA +34 209
#note I liked this play, but the duck prefers NIkABS ever so slightly.  I need all the bingo lanes I can get at this point though, and ISBA keeps everything open.  
>Adam: EINNU 11G ENNUI +16 353
>Matt: ACGHNPS B6 CH +31 240
#note CHAPE scores 11 more, but plays off the case A and gives him an easy Q dump.  This slows the game down too.
>Adam: ABJ I5 JAB +27 380
>Matt: AGNOPQS 8A QA. +44 284
#note Yep I'll take this, and drawing an I will greatly improve my rack.
>Adam: LLU 8L .ULL +15 395
>Matt: GNOOPSY N6 PO.YGONS +74 358
#note This rack looked pretty horrible, and then he gave me an L and I realized what I had.  Maybe there's a miracle to be had?
>Adam: ?GIINRR 14C sIRRING +71 466
#note And the hopes are quickly dashed.  Also fIRRINGS#.  
>Matt: CDEEEOZ 12A ZO.ED +50 408
#note So I played 4 world class players during the day 3 morning session, drew 0 blanks, and managed to go 1-3.  That might be better than expected.  My spread is still in very good shape, if I can get on another winning streak.
