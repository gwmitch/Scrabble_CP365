>Jerry_Lerman: HMNOT 8D MONTH +26 26
>Chris_Tallman: AABDEIN 9C BADE +19 19
#note This was right after the game against Noah where I blew it in spectacular fashion and I was rattled. That's my excuse for this play. BAAED E7 looks good here. I spent like 4 minutes too lol.
>Jerry_Lerman: EIRZ D8 ..ZIER +34 60
#note Jerry has played this against me before in the first game I ever put up here :)
>Chris_Tallman: ABEIINX 10B BI.E +29 48
>Jerry_Lerman: RSU F6 RU..S +27 87
>Chris_Tallman: AAGINOX 11A GON.A +31 79
#note I was happy to score 31 and retain the X despite it not going anywhere on this board yet.
>Jerry_Lerman: ILWY 13C W.ILY +30 117
#note I held this and would challenge if it were many other opponents, I just thought Jerry never phonies, so I let it go with a wry smile :(
>Chris_Tallman: AEIORWX 6F .EWAX +31 110
#note Now I score 31 with the X hehe. I didn't like the high-ish scoring parallels this opens but I can often re-parallel anyway. 
>Jerry_Lerman: OORRSTU I1 OUTRO.RS +71 188
#note Oops, why did I slot that A haha
>Chris_Tallman: AEIKOPR A11 .OPIK +39 149
#note Thought a long time about playing P(O)KIER and taking out the scoring spot, but eventually decided to gamble and keep the far superior ARE leave and see what happens. I'm down and need some volatility, so I stand by it.
>Jerry_Lerman: EM J1 EM +22 210
#note Bullet - 0,  VictoryLap - 1
>Chris_Tallman: ADEGILT 12G AIGLET +21 170
#note I have a choice between making a fishy play and going for turnover and opt for the latter. Both options are simming pretty close. I wanted to make it as volatile as I could here.
>Jerry_Lerman: ACEV 4H C.AVE +26 236
#note This takes 4 back hooks and keeps this bord alive, so I was happy to see it come down.
>Chris_Tallman: ?DFFRTU 11K DUFF +30 200
#note My turnover strategy worked! Maybe DUFF for 27/CRAVED to avoid setting up a giant S hook. I do have a blank though, so idk.
>Jerry_Lerman: EHNOS O11 SHONE +48 284
#note Ouch lol
>Chris_Tallman: ?ADEORT 15A .ERATOiD +89 289
>Jerry_Lerman: V 1H V.. +18 302
#note Pretty scary play. Blocking the CRAVE hooks is now a big priority.
>Chris_Tallman: ACDNNST M2 CANT +23 312
#note  I thought CANT blocked off the most stuff, and if I use the L1-O1 spot eventually, I'll open a bingo line and he just fished off one tile. I did forgot that CRAVENS is good though.
>Jerry_Lerman: AEP K2 PA.E +25 327
>Chris_Tallman: DEIIJNS N13 JIN +35 347
#note Very happy to get this gimme play.
>Jerry_Lerman: GI 2M .IG +12 339
#note He has the blank for sure now, and this might prove tough to block...
>Chris_Tallman: DEIOQST N1 Q.S +14 361
#note I'm forced to give up my S to block this, pretty much.. QI is stupidly aggressive.
>Jerry_Lerman: ?ELY 6L LYE +18 357
#note If he gets an outplay making LYES, I probably can't block and I'll lose. I was in full manic mode at this point haha
>Chris_Tallman: ADIILOT 10H IDIOT +15 376
#note One of 6 winning plays, but -12 to TOLID(IN) and IDIOT 14H since they block his only outplay. I was just praying I didn't miss something for him at this point..
>Jerry_Lerman: ?ENRU 14I aNEUR.. +8 365
#note -1 to ENURe
>Jerry_Lerman:  (LA) +4 369
#note This put me at 9-3, and I'd be heading to board 1 next! Did I deserve to be there? Look over my preceding games and answer for yourself haha :)
