>Chris: EIKNO 8D KOINE +28 28
>Matt: EEHIMRY 9G YEH +28 28
#note Almost whiffed on that blasted NY# hook.  
>Chris: AIMUX 9C MIX +30 58
#note Originally put down AMU and then played this instead.  Fortunate choice for him.
>Matt: BEIMRSU 10I ERBIUMS +74 102
#note Didn't know IMBURSE# for sure.  ERBIUMS would have played over top AMU for 82, but would have given back a huge T hook.  Probably as dangerous as dangling an S.
>Chris: ?AORRTU O3 OUTRoAR. +74 132
#note dARTROUS# and TURBOcAR are the fun bingoes here.
>Matt: GIJNRUV 10B JUN +37 139
#note Ugly leave but the points seemed too good to pass up.  I didn't realize that JIVING scored just 1 less.  That's gotta be the play.
>Chris: CEFRW M9 C.RFEW +34 166
>Matt: AGILRVW 13G LAWGIV.R +70 209
#note Looks at rack: "He's not going to give me an E".  CURFEW comes down "OMIGOD# he gave me an E!".
>Chris: EEFIRTT 6H FRETTIE. +65 231
#note But my lead is short-lived.
>Matt: ADEHILQ H12 Q.DI +72 281
#note Not giving him the D in row 15.  
>Chris: ALOST 11A LOTAS +32 263
#note I knew I was in trouble after this play.  He is likely setting up another S and there is not much I can do t oblock it.
>Matt: DEHILLV M3 LIV.D +22 303
#note I make the rack balancing play.  I did think about JODEL#/JOLED#, but didn't like th eleave, plus it makes it slightly easier to cash KINAS. LIVED does score 30 and better obstructs row 12 plays, but HLL could end badly without vowels.  
>Chris: APT L2 TAP +20 283
#note A nice diversion.
>Matt: EGHLNOP E5 PHL.. +34 337
#note A tough rack to figure out.  PHO# scores 1 less and keeps a little better leave, especially with so many Os unseen.  
>Chris: EGST 12B GEST +47 330
#note Down comes the hammer.
>Matt: AAEEGNO 1L AEON +22 359
#note I'm paranoid about row 1 and can finally address it effectively.  GENOA scores 6 more, perhaps I should play that?
>Chris: IO F5 OI +15 345
#note Maybe IO# instead, to not give overlaps down column D?
>Matt: AAACEGU D4 AUA +17 376
#note Ugh, I don't know what I can do here to win.  GUAIAC will block the last good bingo lane, but he can still win a lot of endgames with the Z, E(GEST) hook, DE at 13C, etc.  Plus there's still the T in row 2 and E in column J.  I played this pretty quickly, but I think AUA# is fine.
>Chris: ?DEEINO 15C DEION.zE +59 404
#note So even if I block with GUAIAC, he still probably finds ObEDIENT up top.  
>Matt: AACEGNO N12 A.EG +25 401
#note BEYONDSZ is unseen to me.  So I have to find a block for SEZ#/SOZ# to have a chance, I think.  Happy to find AREG# which does the trick nicely. Champ Player suggests COAGENT is my best play, perhaps hoping the Z is in the bag and he somehow doesn't block?  But he has BY up there for a ton and I don't have a good backup ZA play.
>Chris: BDENOSZ C2 BEZ +39 443
#note He wasn't 100% that I had no other outs other than CYANO 14A, so he goes for the sure win in BEZ.
>Matt: ACNOY 14A CYANO +27 428
#note I fought pretty valiantly, but not enough to pull it out.  
>Matt:  (DNOS) +10 438
