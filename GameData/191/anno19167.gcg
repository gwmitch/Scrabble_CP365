#note The sim much prefers a more fishy play - IO# K10 is really creative, setting up multiple lines to hook the N and bingo. EINRU is a really solid leave when there are several floating consonants for eights along with the ample room for sevens. The 15 points is also not shabby.

#note Ick - a terrible play defensively. Gives back as many bingos as it blocks. There doesn't really exist an option here that controls the board the way I'd like to, so it's probably best to do something straightforward for points/leave. Sim suggests DICOTYL up top, which I sadly missed.

#note Just wanted to score, balance and not give much back, but I missed a better way. TWAE M11 is 6 extra points, and it's pretty harmless defensively. A potential bingo in line N isn't very likely, and I should be able to outrun anyway.

#note This is an okay block, as it takes out eights through the L and sevens hooking OLIVE. There's a way better play, though - slide it over to the right. OB# 4I. It's equally blocky, and it means that if he does bingo in line O, I get a high-scoring play making HOB. For example TITHE is 50 if I draw the T. This enables me to win a lot of close endgames even after he bingos. That's 94 percent to win the game; this is 77 percent. Huge difference.

#note Lucked out - he has no valid bingo and has to try a desperation phony.
