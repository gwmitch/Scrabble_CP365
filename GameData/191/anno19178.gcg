>Leslie_Charles: AOPU H5 OUPA +12 12
>Evans_Clinchy: CDDEIIK 6G D.CKIE +23 23
#note Sim says the straightforward KID I3 is fine. I got a little too greedy for points.
>Leslie_Charles: ADR 5K ARD +14 26
>Evans_Clinchy: DEIIOOR 4I OORIE +22 45
#note Pretty sure this is best. No sense in playing fishy on a weak board - this is better defensively than OROIDE 4J with a stronger leave than ERICOID I3.
>Leslie_Charles: ALTUV 3F VAULT +15 41
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEEHIZ 3M ZA +48 93
#note Wow, crazy - the sim recommends keeping the Z and waiting to open the board. APHID 7G is an awesome play that I overlooked. Score 42 now, hold the Z, wait to see if he opens the triple lane first.

>Leslie_Charles: ?IQ O1 QIs +44 147
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEHITY 9C DEITY +28 140
#note Didn't see the (COR)Y hook - some plays in that area like YEDE# are better.
>Leslie_Charles: BFLO 8A FLOB +46 193
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EEEHLX M8 .HEE +12 152
#note Going for the X setup. This sims decently, though it's a couple of points behind EX 2G, which opens a new line for a seven ending in any of LPSTY. Interesting.
>Leslie_Charles: AENO L10 EOAN +12 205
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ELMWXY 10B WEY +29 181
#note A couple of superior options here - SMARTINGLY#, which I didn't know, and WYE K11, which I didn't see.
>Leslie_Charles: EOP 7D OPE +17 222
>Evans_Clinchy: ?LMNORX N2 M.R +24 205
#note Quackle suggests MODERN C7, setting up the E that I don't have. Psych-ooooo.
>Leslie_Charles: AETW K10 TWAE +33 255
>Evans_Clinchy: ?LLNOTX 13I OL..T +12 217
#note I don't think any of Quackle's suggestions can open the board quite like this does. Very difficult to restrict bingos in both lines 12 and 14 after OLENT#.
>Leslie_Charles: AGI 5E AGI. +13 268
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DLNSUX I13 .X +9 226
#note All right, so I didn't know DOLENT# and thus didn't play DUX# for 40. But you could make the case that it's wrong! How am I supposed to win if I'm still behind and the only bingo lines are through an F or X? This is another difficult setup to block, so it gives me a shot.

#note I wasn't 1 million percent sure of DUCKIEST, so I played a safe endgame. Block LIEU and go from there.
