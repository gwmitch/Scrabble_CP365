>David: ACHTUW 8D WAUCHT +36 36
#note David was one of the nicest people I met and played at Nationals, which makes this game a bit forgivable.
>Matt: ADIINNR D8 .INNA +16 16
#note Didn't see INDRAWN/WINNARD#, and I didn't like playing IN for 6, even with that leave.  
>David: ?AEGNOX H8 .EXAGONs +110 146
#note What can you do but laugh?
>Matt: DIINORZ 10B ZI. +32 48
#note And WINNA blocked DORIZING#.  Without a G available to play too, I don't think I can leave INDRI and play ZO#.  I played up here to keep volatility.
>David: GO E10 GO +24 170
>Matt: DINOPRR 11G R.INDROP +72 120
#note Well I might have a chance if I can draw some goodies.
>David: IIM L9 MI.I +12 182
>Matt: BIKNTTV 13J VINT +21 141
#note Yuck.  At leats I can score with this dreck.
>David: HIL 9G H.IL +26 208
>Matt: ABDEKOT C9 B.OTA +32 173
#note I was happy to find this.  The leave isn't fantastic, but I'm staying within striking distance.
>David: EFFLLOS 15A SELLOFF. +92 300
#note Sheesh.  I thought OFFSELLS* was Collins but I appear to have been mistaken.  
>Matt: ?DDEEKT G13 KE. +28 201
>David: A 10G A. +18 318
#note Oh geez.  I think we discussed this latter and he mentioned his rack wasn't as strong as this would suggest.
>Matt: ?DDEERT O6 REDDEsT +88 289
>David: DEOSTV N2 STOVED +31 349
>Matt: AACEEJY 3J EJEC.A +30 319
#note JAYCEE# is a word and can be pluralized. I think this is better since it forks the board and creates a hotspot for the Y.
>David: QUY L1 QU.Y +52 401
#note Oh well.
>Matt: ABEIMWY K3 .AMB +35 354
#note I really struggled with this rack. The best scoring plays leave IW or IY.  This leave isn't any better but at least it keeps open that lane.  Maybe just play YEW or WEY#?
>David: AEEEGRT 2D ETAGERE +66 467
#note And that's that.
>Matt: EILOOWY 1H YOW +50 404
>David: AIPSSUU 5J U.S +22 489
#note PIUMS# leaves outs.
>Matt: EILNORR 7J REN +19 423
#note ROAN instead for 1 more, then I can do LIER next turn.
>David: AIPSU N9 AP.S +29 518
>Matt: ILOR 1A LOIR +18 441
#note Not much I could do there, keeping the spread under 100 is a moral victory.
>Matt:  (IU) +4 445
