#note With knowledge of Deen's case S, my half-bingo deficit looked pretty dire. So I was all set to throw down EARWEAR* and hope his rack was good enough to justify accepting it. When he only scored 8, it suddenly didn't seem necessary or advisable. But still, I'm in a bit of a bind. M11 WEAR is the obvious play, but if he has a 6 making WEARS, that's probably game over. So I took this placement because I just didn't know what else to do. I dunno. The other WEAR sims better by a point despite the potential for disaster. 6A AWARE sims best, which kind of makes sense.

#note Basically I want to draw the F and/or M and outscore him in the endgame. It's actually a pretty good shot.
