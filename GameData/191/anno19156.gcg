#note Maybe overly paranoid of QIS? I didn't spot 10F PRUTA, which looks great to accomplish that goal, undouble R's, score a couple more and dig a bit deeper for the blank. Other favored plays like UPDART are nice too, though I'd feel pretty stupid to get hit with QIS leaving one in the bag and just automatically lose, pretty much. I had a hard time sorting out the various likelihoods of Kolton having no goodies, having the Q and no ? and vice versa, and having both. Simulation hates PUS but CP likes it much better. Either way, I think I'd have played PRUTA if I saw it.

#note With six in the bag Kolton just played three tiles, so it looks to be pretty much 50-50 that he has the Q now - but he can actually retain/leave the Q a lot of the time after DAVY. DAVY looks solid with racks like AEIQTVY, for example. So his chances of having the Q post-DAVY are some difficult-to-determine amount greater than 50% from my POV. I think this knowledge should have swayed me to forgo my bingo and shoot for the outbingo. I also would need to draw letters that go out in a way that can't be blocked by simple QI 10G plays. Drawing a ?YE word would be great, threatening VIBRATORY (making VIBRATOR better than VARISTOR). Even though he's going to play more blockily* than Quackle might give him credit for, the board does have a lot of options now, and he can't block them all. As it was I was in a bit of trouble given the bag's contents of IQW, but as always, gotta do better evaluating these positions.
