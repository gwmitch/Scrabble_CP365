>Mack_Meller: AADEIIT -AII +0 0
#note Mack: I like this better than playing AI, since AI gives back large counterplays and keeps a slightly inferior leave while scoring only four points.
>dacrON: DEIKOUV 8D VIDEO +26 26
#note cBB: KUDO is worth considering, but I like this play ever so slightly more.
>Mack_Meller: AADEINT 7E AID +16 16
#note Mack: This play seemed like the best balance between scoring and fishing. Already down 26, I didn't want to make a 6-point play and put myself deeper into a hole, and this keeps a pretty good leave; Quackle is loving E7 AI for 2, but especially since Conrad is likely to play ultra-defensively after that I stand by AID.
>dacrON: EEKLNUV 9G LEKU +21 47
#note 9G VENUE is a good play, but I had a good read that Mack was sitting on something good, so I opted to give him fewer letters to work with. I don't like that he can bingo at 10B, but this will at least cut down on his bingoing.
>Mack_Meller: AEINORT 8J NORITE +23 39
#note Mack: This blows up the rack, but I am already down 30 on an increasingly tight board and would prefer an open board. Quackle, unsurprisingly, despises this, but I think it is OK. Also, (DEL)INEATOR would have been really sweet if DEL was one spot up! :)
>dacrON: ABEENVZ L7 B.AZEN +34 81
>Mack_Meller: ACEFIOO K11 FOE +24 63
#note Mack: FOCI/FICO are the other alternatives, but I didn't want to keep a leave consisting of only vowels and this minimizes counterplays significantly. cBB: We discussed this play briefly after the game - I definitely prefer FICO here.
>dacrON: EFGIPTV 10D FIVE +23 104
#note cBB: Couldn't decide if the EPV or GPT was worse. I just thought I could get out of GPT quicker, and take a couple of extra points.
>Mack_Meller: ACHIOOR N2 HARICO. +36 99
>dacrON: ?GIPPST 13F GaPPI.ST +98 202
#note cBB: I didn't notice this until he blocked ST(E)PPInG. Whew! BRAZENS was held for a bit, then released.
>Mack_Meller: ABCILOR 3G BRACIOL. +82 181
>dacrON: ?ALORSY H1 LO.Y +33 235
>Mack_Meller: EILNNRX H13 .IX +36 217
#note Mack: I hated this play since the leave is so ugly, but there really isn't much to do here. This way I stay within striking distance, and I at least open a lane that, while extremely hard to hit, could produce huge scores if I happen to luck out and pull XENOLITH or something later.
>dacrON: ?AIRSTW 4A STaIRWA. +82 317
>Mack_Meller: AELNNRW 4L WA.N +28 245
#note Mack: Matters are extremely bleak at this point, but this looks as good as it gets here, as it scores, cleans up the rack a bit, and doesn't close any lanes.

>dacrON: DMNOSTU O7 D.MOUNTS +65 424
>Mack_Meller: DEHLNNT C3 H.ND +14 280
#note Mack: Hoping maybe I can draw an outbingo on column B, which is not particulary easy for Conrad to block.

#note Happy to have played this game well to get back to 1-1 for the morning.
