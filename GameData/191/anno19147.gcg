>Matt: DIIOOTU 8H IDIOT +14 14
#note Maybe I should exchange, but what do you keep?  I figured I might as well score 14 for now.  
>Mpakaboari: ARRY L8 .ARRY +16 16
>Matt: ENNOOUX 10I OXE. +27 41
#note OXO 7I is 1 less, and a bit better leave.  
>Mpakaboari: ACLM 12H CALM. +15 31
>Matt: AILNNOU 7E UNNAIL +16 57
#note I don't like ALNU as a leave, Quackle does.  I want to dig for those S's and blanks.
>Mpakaboari: HTU H12 .HUT +27 58
>Mpakaboari: EKOT (challenge) +5 63
#note This looked totally unfamiliar to me, so I challenged at 5 points, plus the blank and S in hand.
>Matt: ?ENOSTW M2 nEWTONS +77 134
#note TWONEsS# does the same job but scores 4 more. Missed it.  But I played a science word so yay. 
>Mpakaboari: EKOT L1 KETO +39 102
>Matt: ?AFIQST E5 AQ.aFITS +126 260
>Matt: AIIORTU (challenge) +5 265
#note Luckbox.  At that score in Collins you have to challenge unless you're 100% on it.  
>Mpakaboari: EGNORSV 14C OVERS.NG +68 170
#note This is phony!  Why did I think this was good?  Sloppy.
>Matt: AIIORTU 6E .UIT +24 289
#note Right idea, but INIA keeps a more flexible leave.
>Mpakaboari: JOY 15A JOY +44 214
>Matt: AAEIORU 13G O.IA +20 309
>Mpakaboari: CERW 1H WREC. +42 256
>Matt: ADEERRU K1 .RUDE +28 337
#note There is no reason to play REDEAR N1 in this position.  
>Mpakaboari: BDLN 10C BL.ND +10 266
#note Misscored as 11.  Also plays 5 rows up for 4 more, but he might have been angling for an -ABLE bingo.
>Matt: AAEEGPR D1 AGAPE +20 357
#note PEAGE is fine, there are more E's to draw.
>Mpakaboari: AFGL 12A FLAG. +26 292
#note Ooh, F(REn)A scores 43!
>Matt: BDEEHRS D8 BE. +19 376
#note Blocking the Z spot.
>Mpakaboari: EIN N4 NIE +19 311
#note And this was misscored as 18 so we're all good.
>Matt: DEHRSVZ 3C H.ZED +40 416
#note Oh geez did I really whiff on ZEDS?  I didn't think to just dump the Z for 22, trying to draw for SHRIVED (didn't know SHROVED#).
>Mpakaboari: AEIIMOP J3 MAP +26 337
#note DOWN takes a back A in Collins, so PIMA O1 is best.
>Matt: IRSV 1A VIS. +21 437
#note Chickened out on RIVAS#.  
>Mpakaboari: EEIO 2F OE +11 348
>Matt: R K1 .....R +9 446
#note A little sloppy after AQUaFITS, but after a 5-game losing streak I'm not going to look this gift win in the mouth.  
>Matt:  (EI) +4 450
