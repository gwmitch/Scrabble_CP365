#note Keeping the Q isn't very thrilling here, but neither is CLNP for 7 less points.

#note I could also get that.

#note I noticed JA(BO)T as soon as I hit my clock - was so happy with this play I neglected to realize that he'd put the O where I needed it (I even saw the potential on his time)! One of my larger mistakes of the tournament.

>dacrON: ELOSUUX 2D LOX +54 305
#note Anyone have the balls to play 11J US(Q)UE? :) Regardless, I think that LOX is better than OX, but perhaps EXO(N) is worth it, given that we're headed to vowel city. I like blocking the big spot at F2, but a three vowel leave here is pretty silly.
