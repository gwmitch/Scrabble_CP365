#note Matt's exact rack. I think I would have played EF here.
>Rafi: AACEIOR E2 E.... +17 184
#note This was a tough play... I didn't want to play JIAO or AJAR to give up easy points. EPOXY seemed like the type of play that was more likely to induce a mistake, but maybe I'm sacrificing too much equity to do so? I know Matt left three consonants and didn't want to give up an easy scoring play on the triple with a counter. This seemed like a play that might give up equity in the short run for win % in the long run? Not sure if that's good reasoning though. Maybe I should just go with my other choice of AJAR.

>Rafi: AACIORY 15D A.ARIC +30 260
#note ORGIAC is another good option, as is CAIRNY. This sets up the Y if I draw the right tiles (something i didn't notice during the game) and sims best.

>Rafi: IOSTUUY A10 OUT.UY +36 296
#note Wasn't sure of OUTBUY and almost played just BUY. But OUTBUY is so much better, so I decided to trust my gut feeling that it was valid.

#note Had to make sure this didn't empty the bag before I played it, as a bingo out + QZ stick can lose.
