>Will_Anderson: GKOO 8G GOOK +18 18
#note Will: I might want to shift GOOK left one or two spots without an S or Y in hand.

>Will_Anderson: EILMNSU G6 LE.UMINS +64 82
>dacrON: AEINRRT 12A INERRA.T +70 94
#note Maybe should play for 68, but I'm pretty sure we're headed for an open board either way, which is, of course, not what I want against Will.
>Will_Anderson: ?BEFLRR A11 F.BRE +30 112
>dacrON: AEEEORW 11C WOE +23 117
#note cBB: I like this more than 14A (R)EWORE.
>Will_Anderson: ?LOORXY 10I ORYX +31 143
#note Will: Almost did OXO - would be nice to save the Y hook, and OXO does in fact bingo a bit more, but ORYX bingos a lot too. Pretty close
>dacrON: AAEEMRT L9 E.AM +26 143
#note cBB: Definite miss of TEAM(S) for 36 here. I wanted to set up an additional lane to go with my AERT leave. But TEAM(S) is a huge improvement.
>Will_Anderson: ?ILNOOT K2 LOTIONs +71 214
>dacrON: ?ADEFRT 2H ReF.ATED +88 231
#note cBB: I either missed or miscounted sTRAFED, which is obviously better here. yikes. I don't mind this volatility if I get to share in the benefits, but still, a silly mistake. 
>Will_Anderson: CCIORTW H1 C.OW +39 253
>dacrON: DEENPTU O2 .EPUTED +42 273
>Will_Anderson: CIQRSTU E5 SQUIRT.. +34 287
#note Will: SQUIRTER is not Quackle approved but I worry that part of the value of SUQ is cashing it with TIC so often, creating a scary board position. Fishing for big Q plays with COR pays off a lot but taking such a low score in a back-and-forth game seemed risky
>dacrON: AIILNSV M11 NIVAL +22 295
#note cBB: I wanted to dig into the bag here for the J or the Z, but I feel like I'm just giving Will too many options here. I think this play is too desparate - I'm not really losing at this point, it's an even game. I do like keeping the S for SQUIRTERS though.

>dacrON: ADEILPS C9 PE..D +28 390
>dacrON: ADEILPS --  -28 362
#note cBB: Uh, so yeah, I did that. I spent all my time searching for a win, but there's none to be had, and then I accidently play a phony. yikes.

>Will_Anderson: BEI 3B BI.E +12 453
>Will_Anderson:  (DEP) +12 465
#note cBB: This was a really hard game, especially for the first round of the day. I'm pretty sure Will outplayed me here, and I'm failing to understand why I opted for so much volatility this game - I felt like I was always losing, even though that wasn't happening until the very end...tough one - well played Will.
