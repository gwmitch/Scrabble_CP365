#note Not excited by this move, but what else? The BRINY path gets ugly fast sometimes.

#note J2 BEIGE turns more tiles to get that precious A and keeps QT for QAT/AVIRULENT, but introduces other situations where I get into trouble with the Q.

#note I thought this was a tough play, but it's not. ROWDY is easily best, and I missed it.
>Will_Anderson: AFGHIIL 6K .ALF +28 197
#note Really not sure about this play. I hated HALF's effect on the board but hoped to score nicely and maybe open with HAIRLINE plays next turn - Quackle likes hyper-aggro plays at N6 opening the triple lanes and setting up my F, but that seems unnecessary. B3 LAIGH seemed to get punished a lot as well. HALF is kind of a waiting move, hoping to get better ammunition to open the board more confidently later...
>Noah: ADEORWY H10 A.ROWY +39 264
#note Now I see ROWDY, but I played this because it seemed like opening the W was better than opening the D. This is indeed true, according to the sim's bingo percentage results.
>Will_Anderson: EGHIINN B3 NEIGH +24 221
#note The Quackly play of 14H WHINING helps Noah out way too much. I don't think I saw 12K REIGN, which also opens nicely and even keeps the H for miracle HAIRLINE draws, and I know for sure I missed 9J HAEING which score a bit better, but opens the triple lane in a way that's better for scoring than bingoing, which seems unideal. 
>Noah: DEMNORT 4A M.NTORED +82 346
>Will_Anderson: CEINOX 3H EXONIC +49 270
#note Need something pretty miraculous at this point so I grabbed at as many points as I could. Some bingos still fit atop EXONIC. Still, OXEN must be better to slow things down, retain letters that help my miracle bingos hit even harder, and preserve row 3 as a good bingo line. OXIM is okay too but shedding an extra consonant for 5 more points looks to be well worth it.

#note Spent a while trying to figure out if another play was better here, but wasn't sure. I wish I was better at these positions, as I had 15+ minutes for this play and still couldn't figure it out. Looking through the 8 different possible endgames for each play I can find on Quackle (TU(N), ITE(M), KE(N)T, Z(O)UK) seems to show that ZOUK is best by a bit. I guess to calculate this in games I just need to practice a lot more, get it really honed. I really shouldn't even be using Quackle as an aid here, but checking is even more tedious without a computer and I get lazy.
