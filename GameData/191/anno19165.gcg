>Jean_McArthur: ABORY H4 BOYAR +26 26
>Evans_Clinchy: BEFIKOV G5 BOKE +37 37
#note Sim slightly prefers FOB I5, which is creative - it sets up multiple high-scoring spots for the K (KAB and YOK).
>Jean_McArthur: JO F6 JO +61 87
>Evans_Clinchy: EEEFIMV 8E VE.. +17 54
#note Sims best - all the other options, like the various placements of EVE and VEE and FIVE, are way too susceptible to big counterplays.
>Jean_McArthur: GNS 5G ..NGS +16 103
>Evans_Clinchy: EEFIMTU E8 .ITE +14 68
#note I thought it was best to begin opening some bingo lines, but the sim disagrees - best appears to be FUGIE# F3, which keeps a nice leave and keeps her options constricted.
>Jean_McArthur: ACENRST 9H SCANTER +74 177
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EFIMMU 8M FUM +31 99
#note Ouch! A bingo miss. FERMIUMS. Tough word to find.

>Jean_McArthur: HRTW 15A THR.W +33 210
>Evans_Clinchy: DEIOOPR C11 DOP +28 204
#note The sim results are messy here, but a couple notable options appear better than DOP# - there's DOPER, which burns the E for an additional 5 points, and there's the fishier OOH B13, which keeps a solid DEIPR leave and makes it easier to bingo down line A.

>Jean_McArthur: GLU H12 GU.L +21 269
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AEILQR I3 QI. +26 296
#note Chose this over burning the blank now for EQUAL 15K for 71. Sim says I'm wrong and it's not even close. On second thought, I'm not sure why I passed up 71 points. I'm pretty confident I should win either way, since I've got AELR? and multiple strong places to bingo, but taking the points now does look better.
>Jean_McArthur: ACEFR 15K FACER +38 307
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AAELNR A8 LAcERAN. +74 370
#note Eh, it worked out fine.
>Jean_McArthur: IX J2 XI +36 343
>Evans_Clinchy: EHNOPUY 11I ONY +30 400
#note My objectives here were to score, block bingos in line 12 and keep the H for the hotspot at B10. ONY# isn't best, though - UEY# does the same thing with a better leave, and HEY is also an option. Doesn't keep the H, but it scores more and keeps the O for overlapping plays in line B.
>Jean_McArthur: AEILNTV B3 VENTAIL +66 409
>Evans_Clinchy: DDEHPTU 13G H.P +31 431
#note A bit of a mistake here. I'm supposed to empty the bag and maximize my chances at drawing an A or a Z. Those are the two key tiles here - the A is important for AVENTAIL, and the Z for scoring obviously. If she gets both of them, I'm in serious trouble, so I need to dig into the bag and find one. HUDUD# is better than HUP for this reason.
>Jean_McArthur: OU A4 OU +8 417
#note Jean doesn't have the Z, so she wisely blocks this hotspot for it.
>Evans_Clinchy: DDESTUZ K1 DUST. +27 458
#note I can't stop her big play hooking AVENTAIL, so I just need to score and outrun. This wins.
>Jean_McArthur: AEGIOS 2B AI +26 443

>Jean_McArthur: EGOS 1K .OGES +24 467
