>George_Macaulay: AQUY 8F QUAY +32 32
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIJLNT 9E JIN +25 25
#note It's close between keeping the D or tacking it on. The hook seemed unlikely to be blocked though as he will probably play vertically from the J.
>George_Macaulay: AIO E9 .IAO +22 54
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADLTT D9 DAL +20 45
#note I should play one of the TADs to undouble the Ts. D10 TAD only scores 2 less and has good defense.
>George_Macaulay: OU I8 .OU +7 61
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AARRTT J2 TARTARs +76 121
#note Not often you get to bingo with 3 sets of duplicates. I'm surprised I saw this, actually - easy to give up without even looking.
>George_Macaulay: CDEEIRT 4F REDI.ECT +76 137
>Matthew_Larocque: INRSSTU 12D S.U +16 137
#note I saw INCRUSTS but wasn't sure if it could be spelled that way. Yeah, my word knowledge has more holes than a fine meshed sieve >_> INTRUSTS also plays.
>George_Macaulay: FIOPV 2F PIVO. +16 153
#note I think he originally played FOP 3E, but changed his mind. I got lucky that he struggled with some back racks this game.
>Matthew_Larocque: HIINRST J10 HIN +27 164
#note Chose HIN because it sets up HINT/HINS and because there are 4 unseens Ns.
>George_Macaulay: DKP G1 P.K.D +17 170
#note Meanwhile George is forced to dump more clunky letters.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEIRST 13G ARIDEST +78 242
#note Simulation gives the edge to N1 DIASTER - I might play that if I was far behind, but not here.
>George_Macaulay: EEFLX 5B FLEXE. +36 206
#note A fellow player who was watching pointed out L8 FLEXE(S) after, but I think George needs to keep that S open while opening the board more with FLEXE(D).
>Matthew_Larocque: BELRSTW H12 B.EW +36 278
>George_Macaulay: OOUZ 12L OUZO +34 240
>Matthew_Larocque: AGLNRST 14A STRANGL. +78 356
#note Lucky that this fits, but I always get nervous throwing an S in prime TWS territory.
>George_Macaulay: EHT A12 HE.T +33 273
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEFMO 4A FOAM +41 397
>George_Macaulay: ?EINORS M2 IN.OnERS +68 341
#note George furiously wrote down about 50 racks/words, but he couldn't find the only 3x3 which is pretty tricky IMO. He spent a lot of time here and he must have forgot about hooking REDIRECT for more points. Also (W)INSOmER scores 83 - I didn't know the word myself.
>Matthew_Larocque: CEGIIMV O11 V.ICE +30 427
#note I saw 6C EMIC for 44, but thought VOICE was worth the sacrifice to dump CV and defend against a likely scoring chance for George. Simulation ranks VOGIE a little better, but prefers the points of EMIC. Champ likes MOVIE the best.
>George_Macaulay: BOW 8L B.OW +36 377
#note Considering this, perhaps I should have just taken the points.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEGLMN 3C GEL +21 448
#note I outsmarted myself here, not even aware that I was setting up EGAL/MEME for the out. But I think I would have chickened out on EGAL here, to be honest. Still working on cementing the fours, evidently.
>George_Macaulay: AGINY H1 A.I. +42 419
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMN B9 NEEM +15 463
#note 10 points less than the spot I set up. George must have been like, huh?
>Matthew_Larocque:  (GNY) +14 477
#note Only the second time I've won against George. A key win too, otherwise I would not have been in contention to win the tournament.
