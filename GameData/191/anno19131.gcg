#note There's a million E's unseen, but this play still looks like my best bet. Everything else scores crap or keeps crap. If he doesn't have the E I am golden.

#note F6 HOG may be better. To be honest I missed it. It's pretty close though.

#note Adam and Jason lectured me on making this play instead of the saner 14F SHE (which would have worked out much much much much much much much much much better). BUT SCREW YOU GUYS QUACKLE LIKES MY PLAY BEST!!!!! By "best", I mean like 0.5% better. But the point is that it was reasonable and SHOULD have worked! Obviously it was hard to defend it after what happened.

#note Fishing the E actually gives me the best chance at drawing a 7 that starts with S. (6 draws instead of 5). But Lloyd is surely going to block the spot. I regretted not fishing my Y at O5 since it reduced the score of Lloyd's blocking attempts.Though ICY is common. I don't know, is there a realistic way to win here?
