#note Curious placement. 
>Matt_Canik: EEMOTTU G6 MEOU +20 20
#note Spent 6 minutes on this rack trying to decide between MEOU G6 or MOTET or TOTEM or MOTE I6. Sim likes this best by 1%. Good call, Matt!

>Matt_Canik: ADEENTU 11D UN.A.TED +36 82
#note Yay!
>Kevin_Leeds: ADEINR K5 DRAINE. +18 109
#note I can't think of ANY situation where it's ok to play off ADEINR for 18 this early in a game. 
>Matt_Canik: AAEEGIO -AAEGIO +0 82
#note Elect to hold an E here because a bunch of vowels have already been played, only 4 are left in the bag.

>Kevin_Leeds: CLMO A8 CLOM. +33 168
>Matt_Canik: ?AEIIJY B9 AY +28 136
#note EIIJ? isnt yummy, but 28 points are. I can't get depserate and fall behind this early.

#note I thought for certain I missed a bingo here. I didn't. Cool. 
>Kevin_Leeds: ADEIOT B2 IODATE +20 235
#note He's in time trouble here, ~5min left. 
>Matt_Canik: ??ACIIR 13C sAtIRIC +79 269
#note Highest scoring by 5. 
>Kevin_Leeds: EGOPY A1 POGEY +50 285
>Matt_Canik: AANPSUV M2 .UV +14 283
#note This is just me being silly and pussing out on PAVANS. I like the AANPS leave a lot, but this is clearly a mistake. 
>Kevin_Leeds: FIRSZ 3F FRIZ.S +39 324
>Matt_Canik: AADHNPS H1 PH. +24 307
#note At this point, I'm losing by a wide enough margin that it looks like I need to play Q-stick, that's the only way I can come back. With what's in the pool, H2 is the ONLY Q spot. He just played 5 tiles, there's a good chance he has it now. And if he doesn't, there are 4 in the bag- only a 50% chance I draw it!

3000 iteration many-ply sim says PHI wins 73%, AHI same spot wins 67%, and anything else on the board wins 43% or less. This was the gamewinner here. 
>Kevin_Leeds: AELORSV 2G O. +7 331
#note He sighs loudly after playing this. Looks like he pulled the Q! It actually looks like VOLAR buils suck a large lead that he will outrun me even with the Q. Heh. 
>Matt_Canik: AADGNNS D4 DANGS +23 330
>Kevin_Leeds: AELQRSV 8J ..LER +6 337
#note He's over time and hasn't tracked. He tries to set up VAS, I guess. 
>Matt_Canik: ANW 7M WAN +21 351
#note Phew. gg.
