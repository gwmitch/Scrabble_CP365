#note I agreed to post this game despite it being my lowest score in over a year. Please note the kind of phoneys that Steve thinks he can get away with against me.

#note Phoney. I guess I decided I wanted to get rid of both of the I's at the risk of losing a turn.

#note The awesome draws continue. I missed 3K TIDED, which is the standout. I like this over the other plays that Quackle is rating slightly ahead.

#note TING in the same spot. No reason to hold onto the G.

#note I spent a while on this turn, trying to decide whether playing here or at B6 would give me a better shot at a bingo next turn. I decided that B6 would give only a marginally better shot at using the triple lane, while also restricting the letter I could use at D6, whereas it is likely that he'll be using the K at B6 (assuming he has it), which would still allow me to use the E, S, or T at D6.

#note Actual rack.
>Bill: EILSSTU 6B T. +4 250
#note I was initially going to just grab some points here, but I figured I'd take a shot at drawing SULLIES or SILENUS (or SULKIES, which I didn't know). I certainly did not expect this to be my last turn.
>trashman: ?AKLNRV A2 KLAVeRN +94 576
#note I know the word, but still, I have never been more surprised to see seven tiles go down. Nice finish.
