>Jim_Burlant: ?DEGORU 8D GROUtED +70 70
#note Best bingo is apparently ROUGHED 8F.  I wanted to put something other than an S out there. Don't know why I didn't make the blank a P, though.  Probably didn't spend enough time on this rack.
>Fran_Silver: IX 7G XI +35 35
>Jim_Burlant: AAEMOOT E7 A.OMA +14 84
#note There was exactly one good play in this rack:  E5 TEA(R)OOM scores 36, and I whiffed on it.  The rest of the options all suck.
>Fran_Silver: ADIV 6H DIVA +19 54
>Jim_Burlant: CELOOST L1 COOLEST +83 167
#note The only bingo.
>Fran_Silver: INY F10 YIN +31 85
>Jim_Burlant: BFMPRTU 1L .URF +27 194
#note Too much crap in the rack combined with nowhere to play BUMF or FRUMP caused brain overload.  Couldn't think of FEMUR 5k, but that's moot - sim indicates this is  best.
>Fran_Silver: FK 5K K.F +32 117
>Jim_Burlant: AABMPTT 5G BAM +15 209
#note No really good options; best play is apparently M1 UMP 26 - not that this is a great choice, but I really felt I needed to turn more than 2 tiles with this much crap in the rack.  Outside of UMP, nothing else available scores more than 18.
>Fran_Silver: AHW 3J WH.A +20 137
>Jim_Burlant: ADLPSTT -DPT +0 209
#note This isn't one of the original kibbitzer options but it sims wtihin 2 points and 2% winning chances of the sim winner, 11C PLAIT.  I didn't think it was worth it to potentially set up the S hook at H11, especially since the crap was making it into my racks and she was turning tiles and I wasn't.  Even though I had the S, I thought that PLAIT was a potential play-for-7-give-back-50 scenario - no thanks.  I also considered and rejected SPLAT N5 - I thought that was reckless.
>Fran_Silver: ABENSST M7 ABSENTS +75 212
#note Best bingo for Fran; this also plays at 13D for 68.  She's back to 42% winning chances.
>Jim_Burlant: AJLNSTU 11K JU. +20 229
#note This is what happens when you spend three consecutive games with racks that don't balance, exchanges that don't go well, and one difficult draw after another:  you get too protective of a rack that seems to be coming together (esp with 9E's and 6 I's unseen), and you don't find the best plays.  JUNTA 2F scores 37 and is clearly best.  This is weak.
>Fran_Silver: EE 8M .EE +15 227
>Jim_Burlant: ALLNSTW O1 .LAW +14 243
#note Nothing available above 20 points without burning the S.  This is another decent, but not great, choice.    13I WALL(s) is apparently the play.  My thinking at the time was that I could hook my S on row 13 and that I wanted to make it easier for myself to hit a 7 while I had to force her to find an 8.  Maybe I needed to reconsider that.  
>Fran_Silver: IQ 13K QI. +12 239
>Jim_Burlant: DIILNST D3 TIDIN. +18 261
#note You'll notice that this is the sixth straight turn I've gone without an E.  Again, no real standouts here. Maybe IDLING would have been better to set up another S hook?  I dunno.  Best is apparently 15J LID - I wanted to preseve my unique S hook, while LID also takes the back O.  This is mid-pack and wins 64%.  An E would be nice.
>Fran_Silver: ELPU C2 PULE +21 260
>Jim_Burlant: DHILOSY 9I HOY +25 286
#note No 8's play (would need an A, D, or M).  Finally I make a good play - this is best.  
>Fran_Silver: NR 11E ..RN +4 264
>Jim_Burlant: DGILNOS B1 DOG +22 308
#note You'll notice that, despite their prevalence in the pool, this is my EIGHTH straight rack without an E, and this was beginning to worry me.  As for this choice, the sim takes a little while to sort out, but this is best, and nothing else comes within 5 points.  I'm ostensibly 82% to win in a short sim, but that's about to change.
>Fran_Silver: EEENPRT B5 PRETEEN +69 333
#note Best bingo for Fran, the other being TERPENE for 67 in the same location.  She's 55% to win in a short sim.
>Jim_Burlant: GILNORS O7 R.SOLING +60 368
#note The only bingo, and it wins 60%.  but with my word knowledge (or lack thereof) my winning chances are about to drop to zero.
>Fran_Silver: ?AEIZ A11 AZInE +71 404
>Jim_Burlant: ACEITTV D11 CIVET +29 397
#note The  refrain longtime readers of this blog will be all too familiar with: you gotta know the bingo to play it.  All I saw was a no-go ACTIVATE in this rack; I had no idea there was a 7, CAVETTI, in it.  CAVETTI plays at 14E for  77 and is the only play that wins.  Everything else loses by 30.
