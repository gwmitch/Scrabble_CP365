#note I missed AENEOuS 9G. This at least seems second best, and it certainly controls the board more. Is the point sacrifice worth it? I think it might be. On the other hand, he's not down that much after this bingo, so maybe it isn't.
>Nigel_Peltier: MTU E10 MUT +20 50
>Noah: DILNSTT 13B DIST.NT +24 83
#note Not a good play. All I could think of were TILTED and TINTED, which take an S on front, but I think those are better anyway. The score isn't close enough to merit such drastic measures as DISTENT, especially since the S will often advantage me. Besides, I didn't know LITTEN or LINTED. I like LITTEN best just because it doesn't take any hooks. It accomplishes far more than DISTENT does.
>Nigel_Peltier: EFU D11 FU.E +26 76
>Noah: ABKLOOW 15A BOWL +39 122
#note Just didn't know LAWBOOK. KOTOW may also be better, though the FUSE hook is pretty big.
>Nigel_Peltier: DITY H11 DI.TY +30 106
>Noah: ACEIIKO 11H .ICKIE +26 148
#note Maybe it's better to do something like TIKI. This is pretty open all of a sudden, though it doesn't have to stay too open.
