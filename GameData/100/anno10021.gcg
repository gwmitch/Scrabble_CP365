>whatnoloan: EEFIQTY -FEIQY +0 16
#note FEY doesn't make sense. I don't want the Q here, and ERE doesn't imply great tiles. He might have a decent play on line 8, but I don't think it'd be enough to justify FEY. Besides, given ERE he often has FEYER anyway.

>whatnoloan: ABELNOO 10J ABOON +19 142
#note More open than something like OBIA, but not as reckless as something like ABALONE. Another option is ROBALO, which is reasonable but it seemed like parallel plays to it were more closing than parallel plays to ABOON, and would sometimes score a bit more. 
>squush: CDELOUU H1 CED.. +24 244
>whatnoloan: EHILOOT N2 OH +26 168
#note Keeps a reasonable leave, doesn't make the board easier to close or open scoring spots (OHO, HOOLIE, OOLITE), scores well so a bingo could put me very close.

#note Seems best to take this over JINN J2 because of the scoring opportunities, but this is too many points to sacrifice compared to JIN 6F, which I didn't notice.

#note As good as (AE)ROBaTS H8, the other star play. Good thing this was available, because the other is quite tough.
