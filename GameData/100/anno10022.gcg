#note FEVE(R) 9A might be the play here, keeping a better leave and still quite reasonable in terms of open bingo lanes. If he doesn't use the F, I could potentially open the top quadrant, or he might just do it for me.

#note There are way too many obstructive plays here that I just don't want anything to do with. Yet this is quite poor. Somehow, I missed VEG 3C, the star play.

#note Missed the singular play here which might be worthwhile: BEFOG.
