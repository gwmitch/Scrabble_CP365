#note DISGOWN# not a bingo, but good to know.
>Adam: ?AOPRUV E1 VAP.ROUs +74 184
>Jeremy: DGIIORS 1E .IGOR +27 172
#note DORISING# 10C.  Don't know that one, but I might have guess because I know DORISE and DORIZE. To become like the Dorians.  VIGOR and VOID are 21 points back, but okay misses.
>Adam: IKNT 8A TINK. +39 223

>Jeremy: CCEEIIT (challenge) +5 269
#note Took a chance on EXPIRANTS#.  Adam said had turned it down twice already so he might as well challenge.

#note I thought I would have missed something fancy here, but this is right.
>Adam: AY J10 YA +28 280
>Jeremy: ABCEHIT F4 .EB +26 316
#note A3 BATHETIC.  I don't remember that one.  I would have loved to play BIATCHES#+ from the CSW12 new words set.  WEB is the 2nd best, at 32 points back.

#note 012 DEAW# is best.  I talked myself out of the OUY leave, although I don't know what looked so much better about EAUY.  Just 4.2 points back and Quack says I'm still 67.24% to win.  There is still a blank and a couple of 10 point tiles unseen.
>Adam: OOZ 10B ZOO +37 400
>Jeremy: AELNRUY 2B YUL.N +24 438
#note YULAN doesn't make Quackle's suggestions, but sims to the top.  It's just a good idea blocking bingos in column A.
>Adam: EIMRRSU M12 MURE +22 422
#note Adam has no win, but his play sets me up.
