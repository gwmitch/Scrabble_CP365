>Noah: ?EGQTTU 8G TEG +8 8
#note Exchanging GT is definitely better, actually bingoing about twice as much as this. TEG looks 2nd best.
>Steve_Alexander: ?AEEINW 7A INWEAvE +67 67
>Noah: ?AQRTUW A4 QUo.T +69 77
#note I like this play because of its score, but Quackle prefers QUIT, QUIRT (and of course QUAInT, that's what should have played that) and even W(ET)!! I guess Quackle really wants to bingo, and those plays really help accomplish this, but there are no really amazing leaves here, so I prefer taking the points. 
>Steve_Alexander: DEHOUVV 4A .UOD +28 95
>Noah: ADNORSW 3C WORD +29 106
#note Whoops-missed ONWARDS.
>Steve_Alexander: CEHLTVV 9C VETCH +31 126
>Noah: AAINOSU E9 .AU +6 112
#note Quackle prefers U(R)SA (and I much prefer TAU to that) or NAOI, the star play, which I saw but rejected because I didn't really like keeping the U. I guess the points are way to strong though, and AINOS isn't THAT amazing anyway. NAOI is about 6 points better than this.

>Steve_Alexander: DLNNRRV D6 R.V.L +14 173
>Noah: DLNOORS 2J D.OOL +20 214
#note Ugh! Missed the ORATIONS here. ANY play with that is better than this.

>Noah: AIIINRS 1G INIA +15 229
>Steve_Alexander: ADELMNR M4 MANDREL +68 293
>Noah: EIIMPRS 8M .IP +15 244
#note Didn't know PRIMSIE or PISMIRE. Quackle prefers fishing off an I to this play, because EIMPRS is fantstic.
>Steve_Alexander: ABCEHKY O1 KYE +40 333
>Noah: EFIMPRS L9 FERMI +27 271
#note Quackle prefers a host of fishing plays, with (I)F N8 first (which is absolutely terrible, as it blocks a bingo lane and Steve is very good at defense) I guess I need to learn when to fish. REIF 2D was a pretty cool play, I thought (even thought it's 7th). It's pretty and sets up a P hook which will very likely yield big play there if the opponent doesn't play there. 
>Steve_Alexander: ABCEEHI K10 BAH +32 365
>Noah: GPSSTXY 14J XYSTS +73 344
>Steve_Alexander: CEEFIIN 15I FIE +20 385
#note I looked for extensions throughout the rest of the game. The only ones in front are ROO(FIE),STIF(FIE), and WAF(FIE).
>Noah: EEGLOPS J11 GO +15 359
#note EGO N4 is significantly better than anything else.
>Steve_Alexander: ACEINOU C9 .AU +9 394
#note While simulation values C9 VAU about 10pts less than 6J JOUNCE, it also ascribes it about .5% win advantage, probably for the reason I played it: Noah's likely having (or getting sooner) the TAU- hooks.  Neither I nor simulation accounted for revived extensibility of REVEL and resurrected S hook Noah's sharp eyes saw.
>Noah: EEILPRS D6 .....LER +25 384
#note Quackle is being silly tsk-tsk. Of course likese everything that fishes keeping EILPRS or EELPRS. But get real, if he sees me fishing, he'll certainly block the O line. I prefer my play to anything else because it scores and sets up the S hook for more scoring next turn. 
>Steve_Alexander: BCEINOO 13B BO.ONIC +24 418
#note CORBIE is certainly  best so as not to give me anything to work with. At the post-mortem, Steve said he realized how this play actually sucked.
>Noah: EEIPST 14A PIES +34 418
#note Whoops, TIPS is better for more more points and not givign opp more scoring opportunities. PEISE, which I didn't know, is also better here.
>Steve_Alexander: E A14 .E +12 430
>Steve_Alexander:  (ET) +4 434
