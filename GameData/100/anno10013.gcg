>Jim_Burlant: ABEGOTY 8G GOBY +20 20
#note Rushed.  BOGEY 8D is the sim winner.  Problem with the 8H placement is possible extensions like MEN, MAN, or ING.  This is actually not a bad play in the sim's eyes, but in retrospect it gives up a little bit too much on the scoreboard for the sake of leave.
>Carl_Davis: IR G6 RI. +5 5
>Jim_Burlant: AAABEMT 7I ABA +18 38
#note Again, too much rack grooming goiong on, though once again this isn't really awful per se. Best play per the sim is 5D AMEBA; this sims not roughly 2 points down despite giving up 7 on the scoreboard.
>Carl_Davis: EER 9H REE +20 25
#note Wasn't paying attention when this came down, and I only noticed ABE* after his hand was already in the bag drawing his next set of tiles.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEMTTT 5E MATTED +23 61
#note Much better at 6I for 36.
>Carl_Davis: ADELOPY -ADELO +0 25
>Jim_Burlant: EHIINST 10F HIT +17 78
#note Q prefers 4I HI, and it docks me a bit for breaking up too much of the rack.
>Carl_Davis: AANO 4C ANOA +14 39
>Jim_Burlant: EIINSTX 11E XI +23 101
#note Best.  Despite my blundering I'm winning 81%.
>Carl_Davis: GPU 12D GUP +29 68
>Carl_Davis: GPU --  -29 39
#note Really?  Are you kidding me?  At least I was paying attention when this came down.
>Jim_Burlant: EFHINST 4I HEFT +28 129
#note FISHNET!!!!  FISHNET 12D wins 97%; even this stupidity wins 87.  Play incorrectly scored as 27.
>Carl_Davis: AEGPPSU 12F PUG +16 55
>Jim_Burlant: IKNRSUY C3 K.URY +32 161
#note At least I could make one good play this game; this is best. 
>Carl_Davis: GMO 13G MOG +21 76
>Jim_Burlant: DIJNNRS K9 DJIN +29 190
#note Probably should have turned the other N, but I didn't want to give up the easy I back-hook.
>Carl_Davis: AE D7 AE +8 84
>Jim_Burlant: ?ILNRSU M2 INSULaR +73 263
#note Best.  Other bingo options are B7 RULINGS and B7 pURLINS.
>Carl_Davis: NU 8M .UN +9 93
>Jim_Burlant: EINOOQT J11 QI +24 287
#note Q prefers that I hold the Q and balance the rack with 13K NOTE.  Eh.  Unless I open up a 3x3, Carl will realistically need at least 3 bingos to win this game.  I can get away with the unbalanced rack and dispense with the Q here, especially since I'm consistently outscoring him on the non-bingo plays.
>Carl_Davis: CO J2 CO.. +13 106
>Jim_Burlant: EENOOST 10K .OE +10 297
>Carl_Davis: DEISZ N10 SIZED +47 153
>Jim_Burlant: ?CENOST H12 ..ON +15 312
#note No bingos play here.  Best is apparently 2J CONIC, but it doesn't really matter - the duck says I'm still 100% to win.
>Carl_Davis: LLW 2L W.LL +14 167
>Jim_Burlant: ?CELSTV 13M L.V +12 324
#note Too busy keeping my rack together.  LEV O13 is better.
>Carl_Davis: AINP O1 P.AIN +24 191
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEISTW -W +0 324
#note Q likes D2 WIN, but, even with T? in my rack, I didn't want to give him a triple line with the T unseen and him repeatedly fishing.  This isn't one of the original kibbitzer choices but it actually percolates to the top of the 2-ply sim.
>Carl_Davis: EEORRSV B7 REVERSO +68 259
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEIST 15B CISTEr.A +60 384
#note INSECTAN is the only bingo that plays to the N; I missed it. 
>Carl_Davis: ADEEFOW O12 A.OW +48 307
>Jim_Burlant: T 3I T. +10 394
#note Final score recorded as  409 - 307. 
>Jim_Burlant:  (DEEF) +16 410
