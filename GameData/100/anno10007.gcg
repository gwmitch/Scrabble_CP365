>k8: ABOPQUU I4 QUA. +14 170
#note mostly i did this 'cause i had the other U and figured i might get to score with the Q twice
>joey: AAEEOTT 12H .OTATE +19 167
>k8: ?BIOPSU B4 SUBtOPI. +71 241
#note my brain failed me here. it said: "SUBOPTIc can't be a word. Oh wait, look there's a C over there, I'm sure SUBtOPIC is a word. SUBTOPIA is a word too - hey we like that word. but now we're distracted by how cute a word it is, and we're not going to bother lookng for an A in a 2x2 lane." bad brain.
>joey: AACEEIV A1 CAVE +33 200
>k8: EEILORR A8 LO +16 257
#note this is dumb - there's only one more O, and the chances he's holding JO after CAVE seems kind of unlikely. RULIER is top pick.

>k8: EEIMNRR 11K M.R +20 277
#note missing the double double eremuri. i was too focused on blocking up power tile spots. also, joey wrote this down as 18.
>joey: DEEFRTZ N10 ZED +47 310
>k8: EEIKNRU 8L .IRK +30 307
#note this kept the possibility of queen on the next turn and kept him from playing down the O for a triple. MIKE keeping ENUR is a better way to do this.

#note okay, so here's the thing. i think it's 393-395 here, with him up by 2. so i dont' have to block his out - my play will still win by 1. he thinks it's 395-391 because of misadding MAR a couple turns ago. neither of us noticed the thing with my first turn til after the session was over. i have to hope that in a tournament, i wouldn't trust my math and i'd play RAJ.
