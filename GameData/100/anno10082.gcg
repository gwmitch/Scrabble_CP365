#note Difficult move, and I think I messed up. AY C3 is better than my play. I didn't want to play DAIRY E1 because of the triple opening and lack of good leave, I didn't want to play DAY C2 because I didn't want to sacrifice the good leave. I didn't want to play YO I7 because it didn't open me up at all for a bingo, and it closed 2 bingo lanes. At the time, I felt Y(E) C7 could not be adequately blocked unless Glenn plays a 6 or 7 letter word, or plays downward without hitting the double letter score, which would give me the triple word score.

#note Blocks a bingo lane. I don't need a great leave right now (P(O)L(E) would accomplish that).

#note I saw P(O)L(E)NTA, which scores a bunch (comparitvely) and keeps the balanced AN leave, but N(O)P(E) doesn't open up a triple word score (incidentally a bingo lane in this case). Note: I didn't know the word PONE. 
>Glenn_Mosher: AM E4 AM +20 250
>Jackson_Smylie: AAELNNT 14H ANT +8 283
#note Closes a bingo lane, keeps a balanced leave. If he plays along column K, he can't score much and it doesn't open up a bingo lane. If he plays a 6 along row 15, I can play a parallel and close al the bingo lanes. I didn't like the meager 8 points ANT had to offer, but I didn't see many other options. 
>Glenn_Mosher: EGHIRT 11F .IGHTER +22 272
>Jackson_Smylie: AEELLNS 14B LA. +11 294
#note LA(R) was by no means a great play. At this point, the score was close enough that he could easily outrun me, especially if he has the blank. LA(R) could give him an easy 3 tile play along row A (such as QAT or VAW) which could sew up the game. A play like ALE J12 is much better. 
>Glenn_Mosher: IO 15A OI +8 280
>Jackson_Smylie: EEFLNSU 12K FE +19 313
#note I really disagree with Quackle in this instance. It says FEU is best. With a ? out and 17 unseen tiles, I think that is really dangerous. If he has a D or a ?, he could easily hit a bingo or a big play along column N. An interesting play is ENUF L12. It scores 26 points, more than any other play. It doesn't really open the board much (the F and U are relatively hard to play through). FE put me up 33 points on a shut down board.

>Jackson_Smylie: CEILNSU 1F SINCE +25 338
#note Ugh. That's another phoney I played this game. I sincerely thought STIT was valid. The fact that I thought it was good made me almost certain he had the blank, as he would be opening himself up for a bingo. Glenn didn't hold. LEUCINS was unplayable. I was hoping he would set me up for a bingo.
