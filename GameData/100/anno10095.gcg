#note DNRTEU is actually a decent fish if I can open up the spot for it. 4C UN or F8 NU are interesting. I just can't imagine Larry not closing the new line, though. I kind of like 9I UT, which scores and keeps the good tiles. No need to panic with UU like I did. Though OUTRUN isn't bad.

#note I missed the bingo NONTIDAL. Quackle seems to like 10A ALIT or ADIT, but those seem ridiculous. I don't like DIN. I think if I had seen it, I would have taken the bingo and hoped to not get hit too hard on the triple. Just because this turn could be my last chance to bingo. I really wanted to set up a hook into the A-column, but Larry is sure to have an answer to it.

#note I spent too long on this rack before throwing down this insanely poor play when I realised I was under 2 minutes. More than a dozen plays are clearly better. N13 WIG, K2 WARK, K3 GRAIL, etc.

#note Now I am in serious time pressure and Larry is playing fast. VAGI in the same spot is better.

#note I was really happy to see SY come down, because...
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEGIKST 10K ...K +20 338
#note This is actually a pretty interesting position, but I didn't have time to give it the thought it required. N8 TSK is a big 49, which would make it a tight endgame. Quackle is saying 9L ZAG, which Larry can block. I dunno, I think I still like PERK here.
