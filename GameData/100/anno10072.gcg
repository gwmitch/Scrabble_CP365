#note  at F2, this is 6 more points. i could've used those points. i didn't take the time to count it out once i'd finally found the word.

#note Someday I'll remember that PECH takes the S.  Still, this was quite a bit better defensively so it might have been best anyway.
>k8: ?EIIRSU -IU +0 175
#note missed DIURESIS. i had hard finds this game. got the first one, but not the second one. sim likes TIL J13 a little better than this.

#note I gulp hard as I challenge this.  The decision was easier because it would have been too much to overcome.
>k8: DEGGNTU --  -74 315
#note NUGGETED# !  it's true i didn't know this from studying, but i wouldn't. i knew KIBBLED and MORSELED, so why not NUGGETED? stupid scrabble.

#note right idea, wrong execution. i couldn't remember for 100% sure whether PENGO was a word or just a nintendo game, and I didn't see PONGEE. the way it played out, PENGO and PONGEE would've won, and the good outplays would've been more apparent to me, I think.

>k8: DGIOR A5 DO +9 390
#note there are better sequences than what i did (i didn't see CWM so this is blocking WARM and leaving me RIG, RERIG and GRIG), but the best i have as far as i can tell is a one point loss.
