#note I'm surprised my bingo sims so much better than the other two available, both which block the triple lane but make a new opening at H1. Here I make three hot spots in total, which seems not so great since theoretically I should get one and he should get two.

#note The critical position imo. Don't mind burning the S with the pool but I take a poor leave in order to take out the top row. I guess USING/SUING is better.
