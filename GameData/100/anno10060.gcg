>Joey_Mallick: ?ACNRRU K1 CURRAN.s +80 202

#note Peter: Only bingo!
>Joey_Mallick: EELLOOV 1K .LOVE +33 235
#note Joey: VELOCE is just about as good.
>Peter_Schwartzman: AAMPQY N1 .AMPY +30 282
#note Peter: Why I didn't play QUAY...I'll never know!
>Joey_Mallick: ELMOSTW 5C .OW +26 261
#note Joey: Tough choice here. WON D4 might be a tad safer.
>Peter_Schwartzman: AAADFLQ 2J Q.A +34 316
>Joey_Mallick: ?BELMST 10I STuMBLE +74 335
#note Peter: Quackle says that 10I is a little better than 14F
>Peter_Schwartzman: AADEFLX O5 AXEL +38 354
#note Peter: Missed FARAD for the .... time!
EXON (D3) is an interesting 3rd according to Quackle.
>Joey_Mallick: EEHIIIR 14B HI.E +32 367
#note Joey: Lucky to have this available, but I was hoping to close off the big hotspot at 4a.
Peter: I love that Joey isn't complaining about draw...that is why he is the player that he is!
>Peter_Schwartzman: ADFOORW 4A WO.F +40 394
>Joey_Mallick: EIIORSS 13I OSIER +25 392
#note Joey: I could fish here, but the board wasn't very conducive for bingos. I needed a pretty miraculous final draw.
Peter: Quackle likes BI (M10) for 4 points (fishing is its game)! There isn't much here...playing IS/ZINEB opens up TRIPLE but leaves bingo lane...emptying the bag and still been down makes it tough to win
>Peter_Schwartzman: ADEIORT 2A DO.EAR +20 414
#note Peter: This final play is more complex than it seems...there are a ton of winning plays but Joey's rack is so good, he goes out if one doesn't block the 4K R. Also, as you know Joey plays very fast, so my clock is ticking down fast and I play DOGEAR with less than 20 seconds on clock and it was something I found at the last minute. If I had played my previous choice...I would lose. Wasn't 100% sure of TOGAED. Quackle likes DEAIR/QI at 3G since it blocks Joey's outplays.
>Joey_Mallick: AEILNS 4F NAILE.S +16 408
#note Joey: This is probably the least I'll ever score for this word.
Peter: When he plays out, I thought I had lost, since I miscounted the difference. This was my biggest tournament win to date...I dont' get to many tournaments and I had previously been turned to toast by most of the top players. This set me on a run that would include beating: Will Anderson (by 111), Edley (by 120), Marlon and Jason Li (503-461)! Confidence is something undervalued in Scrabble.
