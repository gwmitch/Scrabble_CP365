#note Missed MOTHRAS. No but seriously, interesting play. Maybe MHO here because a bingo on this board looks pretty attractive.

#note Joe seemed to have a strong rack, so I wanted to block. I'm not sure whether this is overkill. SEX is the high equity option, and (T)UX is a partial block. The problem with this is that he can still make waves, and even just outscore me since I have a crappy leave. Still, not sure what is right here.
>Joe_Miller: ISW N2 WIS +33 226
>Noah: AANNUVW -ANUVW +0 239
#note Now I'm really in trouble. This isn't even an awful draw, and further suggests that my last play might not have been that good. I figured TUX is going nowhere here, let's look for new tiles.
>Joe_Miller: ILN 1M LIN +16 242
>Noah: ADMNOOR 1H MANDO... +36 275
#note Wasn't sure what to play here, so I played this. But something like TAX or TAXON or NOM might be right, I don't know. He has a good rack probably.
>Joe_Miller: ?EIRSUU 2C UsURIES +64 306

#note I didn't think of SEXTO here, but VOE seems a bit too much anyway.

#note I was short on time here, but this seemed like a reasonably good play. Not sure here, what would you do?
>Joe_Miller: IP B14 PI +24 385
>Noah: ?AEGITW 15K TWIGs +42 388
#note GWInE is the only winning play. I think I would've seen it in a regular game, because I saw it right after the game. I unfortunately had to rush this play because the coffee shop was closing.
