#note the best play here is either AGENTIVE, which I chickened out of, or TZAR which I flat-out missed. Given the fishiness of her last play, I think TZAR is a better option than opening a bunch of lanes for 8s.

>JD: EENRTVX M2 VEXT +44 176
#note thought about VERTEX, didn't like blocking the IZARD hook on column M for potential bingos, but VERTEX jams up the board and gives back free points on column H.

#note painful play! after looking at lots of alternatives, I think the best choice here is just FIVE - the leave is poor but I definitely need new bingo lanes. tacking the R on now improves the leave a bit but also makes it a much worse lane for me.

#note no FOODLAND for me!
>CeLe: BEGNRRU 7B BEG.N +20 327
#note BURRING looks like a similar play with a much superior leave, but either play is good because they mostly block the I.
>JD: ADLLRTW 3A DAW. +31 297
#note I finally have a T for WOST! would rather leave that lane untouched for now, so no TRAWL.
>CeLe: ORRU 4A OR +13 340
>JD: EILLORT C10 .OLL +8 305
#note playing LO and keeping an L improves my bingo percentage, but adding a lane to the board is really important.
>CeLe: CNO 5A CON +18 358
>JD: AAEIPRT J6 .A. +18 323
#note fortunate to have some quick plays here, although keeping the P doesn't help because most bingos I could draw don't fit. quackle likes PA about even, there are 11 consonants versus 5 vowels left so AEIRT should fill in nicely.
>CeLe: EKY 12A YE.K +30 388
>JD: AEIPRTT G3 PAT +19 342
#note perhaps a play like TRIP or TAPE is right - leaving only one in the bag such that any bingo draw leads to a certain win for me. this way she can fish a tile and potentially win even if I bingo. But there's also the chance that she forgets the WOST hook, and ST- bingos on row 11 will be worth a lot.
>CeLe: ABEINRU L1 B. +7 395
#note tough play for cecilia running out of time - quackle doesn't want cecilia to block the Q spot at L1, claiming that it's a 33/36 win to play BE/BO versus a 30/36 win with BI. In actuality, her play would have won if she draws the T out of the bag instead of the Q, because she can Q-stick me. I don't know if I agree with championship player's analysis - I just played 3 tiles so there's a good chance I drew the Q, and blocking L1 prevents me from fishing and drawing a bingo that plays on row 11 and 14.
>JD: EIRSSTV 11H STRIVES +82 424
#note this is supposed to be 0/8 to win, versus 4/8 after LISTSERV or STIVERS - I chickened out of STIVERS and needed to get a play down fast because cecilia had 3 seconds left. in reality this is bad because it gives her huge Q plays, whereas STRIVES gives less and LISTSERV almost nothing at all.
>CeLe: AEINQRU M9 QU.EN +48 443
#note cecilia found QUEEN right away, but didn't get it down in time to avoid going over - so I had just enough spread to win.
