#note Confused about why this doesn't sim really well. The only way I can lose is A) if Mike bingos at E1 ending in A, after which he has to get extremely lucky once again to pull off the win. I can maximize my chances of avoiding that scenario by playing CI(G) or NO(G). Both of those are sort of risky though, as Mike can fork open the board (especially after NO(G)). The other way for me to lose is if Mike hits a 60-point play at D8, which is actually much more likely than him hitting a bingo ending in A, and also does not necessarily erase that risk, unless he needs to use the A in his Q play. This is possibly a scenario where Quackle is not only wrong, but dead wrong. It treats my play as an equity loss of 30 points, as it assumes that often enough, Mike will play something on the bottom left that opens a lane/scoring spot that my best static equity play next turn will not hit. My best play next turn after N(U), almost all of the time, will be SONIC/VOMITO, like it was this turn, but I will definitely not do that if Mike makes a play at, say, 12A. So, basically, playing at N2 is definitely not necessary this turn, although it is palatable to score so many points. But in the interest of winning this game, I must exercise patience.

#note Mike said he considered setting up his D with 11B J(I)N here. That would have been a very good play that is only blockable with two tiles: the last D and the O; via 12A underlaps. Unfortunately I had the case O, which might be something to infer from my play of V(O)M(I)T, and CO(D)E 12A would have come down in an instant. Mike had no chance here, no matter what he attempted to do.
