>Chris_Tallman: DEINRRU -RU +0 0
#note Exchanging just the R is better! ... both exchanges sim closely to URD and DURRIE in various placements... I think I like URD with the U on the star now but idk..
>Mike_Baker: AAGUV H4 GUAVA +22 22
#note Not giving me too much to work with, nice play. 
>Chris_Tallman: DEEINOR 4B ERODIN. +18 18
#note I saw 4G EGO for 4 (the sim winner), but it seemed too crazy for some reason. Blowing up the rack seemed wrong though, and it is. Forking the board with NEGROID if I'm going to do that is probably better than ERODING too - I remember thinking in terms of just his next play in a sort of defensive tunnel vision...
>Mike_Baker: HLOO 3B HOLO +28 50
>Chris_Tallman: BEFHNST 5B NEBS +34 52
#note Fishing is an option again here with F(OR)B, and F(A)B in either spot, creating another lane for EHNTS... But i didn't think that leave was potent enough to go for it. I was going to play the standard-ish BEN for 25, but convinced myself the S wasn't worth 9 points in this position, especially as i'm already keeping 3 consos. Not sure what to do here. 
>Mike_Baker: AAA -AAA +0 50
>Chris_Tallman: AFHIOTT 2A ATT +24 76
#note Saw OUTFIT and OUTHIT, but didn't want to give up floaters vs his exch 3 - the S(TORE) hook that ATT creates is a huge problem though. I should just play O(U)TFIT.
>Mike_Baker: AN 7H .AN +7 57
>Chris_Tallman: EFHILOY K4 HOLEY +29 105
#note Wasn't 100% sure on FOLEY and thought this prevented more bingoes than HOYLE... I also saw the hyper-defensive option FI(N)ELY for 22, and the results indicate that I should have. Not sure if this is a massive mistake or just a minor one...
>Mike_Baker: ?DEEINS L4 aNISEED +92 149
#note Got pwned :(
>Chris_Tallman: AEFIIRU M9 FEUAR +36 141
#note Q likes FERIA 2% more than this... I guess this gives up easy points at L12 - FERIA has all those hooks though and II > IU.. idk
>Mike_Baker: AJT M2 TAJ +32 181
>Chris_Tallman: EIIIRTW 2J WRI.E +32 173
#note WRITE is scary, wasn't sure of WITTER+, which is scary too. WI(DE) is an option too per Q but sacrificing to keep leaves like EIIRT is not generally my style
>Mike_Baker: AENSU O1 USNEA +27 208
>Chris_Tallman: DIIIMRT 10H TIMI..R +18 191
#note I missed MID(A)IR, but I like this better anyway.
>Mike_Baker: OOX 1H OXO +35 243
>Chris_Tallman: ?ADDFIY L12 FAY +30 221
#note NOOO DANDIFY for 92! I looked but only saw FADDILY*, which is phony (but might have gotten thru if it played?) lol :(
>Mike_Baker: EISTW 15H WITES +38 281
#note Was pretty tilted to see this play come down, but ofc we see now I deserved it
>Chris_Tallman: ?DDINTZ 11I DID +23 244
#note This play is crazy sauce.. was thinking about taking out this scoring spot and thenscoring with my Z, then sticking him with the Q by taking out I9 and outscoring when I should just play A1 ZA and go for a bingo.. I missed the L1 QI spot on this turn too
>Mike_Baker: CM A1 M.C +31 312
#note Nice spot of CHOLO here by Mike.. there goes the ZA spot I should have taken..
>Chris_Tallman: ?ABNTVZ I9 V.. +11 255
#note Going for BEZANTS for 93 with one of the 3 remaining E's!
>Mike_Baker: QU 6F QU. +32 344
>Chris_Tallman: ?ABCNTZ G8 ZA +23 278
#note Drawing the C and with Mike scoring an unexpectedly high 32, I was worried that if I fished for BEZANTS again with CODS or CON that a) Mike would outscore my bingo b) Mike would block the VID spot for sure. I had a better fish, BY K14, which gives 5 draws at ZINCATE/VIDE. Still though, I think Mike will block if i do that. I try to score a bit and set up another threat, but my leave is pretty horrible (CBNT?)... not playing ZA a few turns ago really hamstrung me this game.
>Mike_Baker: GKOO 14F GOOK +24 368
#note Still not blocking the VID line!
>Chris_Tallman: ?BCENPT N12 BEN +21 299
#note The first tile I drew was an E, so I'd have hit either fish // ragequit life //
>Mike_Baker: EEGLPR 12H LEG +19 387
>Chris_Tallman: ?CIIPRT 2E PIC +16 315
#note -3
>Mike_Baker: ELPR F9 PER +11 398
>Chris_Tallman: ?IRT 7C RoTI +15 330
#note Tough game with one big word knowledge error and one big strategic error (DID) and maybe others one with ERODING and HOLEY... still some interesting spots in this one. This put me 2-3, but I was about to rise...
