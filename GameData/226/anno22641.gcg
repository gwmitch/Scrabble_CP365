#note Peter always plays strong games against me! Thought about just xO, but doesn't hit enough bingos. Q agrees.
>Peter_Dolgenos: MUX 8G MUX +24 24
>JD: AAENRST 7A SANTERA +64 64
#note it never occurred to me to sacrifice 2 points to play SARMENTA because it opens the triple lane at H12 - but SANTERA at 7A is even more dangerous defensively, and SARMENTA also opens the board more and lets me score better next turn. Interesting sim result!

>JD: AEGLNOV 6G GLOVE +23 87
#note LOVAGE is much better at B9. didn't think of it
>Peter_Dolgenos: ADEERRT L3 RETREAD +78 141
>JD: AEHHNPS 6A .H +26 113
#note glad I thought of fishing the H - AEHNPS averages a potent 71 points per turn next turn and bingos 65% of the time!

#note didn't occur to me to hook thespians for 63 point! it is the case S so I can take that spot whenever I like, and WULL is an ugly leave, but still too much to pass up.

>JD: ILLORTU 1B .ILL +12 405
#note shutting down the last lanes, except for the Y which will be extremely tough for him to hit. also I have the last O so he can't draw JILLION.
>Peter_Dolgenos: I I8 .I +10 363
>JD: EGIORTU N1 GO. +14 419
#note I wasn't sure what he was fishing for, so blocked the Y to be safe. also played GOY to hold a U, but there aren't really any good spots where I can play the Q so maybe just GUY would've been smarter (saving possibility of JILLION also).

#note hoping to sneak my outplay of KURU by peter for extra spread.
