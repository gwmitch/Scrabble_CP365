>JD: BEENRTZ F12 .EZ +35 181
#note I dislike this play quite a bit in retrospect. the leave with REZ at 13B seemed weak, but here I close my best lane for no reason! this was a very costly choice.

>JD: BENPRRT 1K P.B +16 197
#note really just need points at this stage! should just play NERTZ.

>JD: DEEINTY A1 DYNE +33 258
#note wanted to open up the board more, but EDDY keeps a better leave and opens up a Y to try to hit - not great, but if I don't keep scoring, I will still be losing once I bingo.

>JD: EILNPTV 14J LIV.N +20 278
#note at this point I'm just trying to block. There are 4 hook letters to MEASURE and I have none of them.

>JD: ENPRSST O11 PREST +33 311
#note I can fish for a bingo with a play like SON at 5A, but it seems too easily blocked.
