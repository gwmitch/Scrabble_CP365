>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIRST D6 SE.TARIA +70 84
#note looks like my studying actually paid off this time. Played this because it seemed very slightly better given I knew the hook and I don't know if Norases remembered or knew it.
>Norases_Vesdapunt: FO C12 OF +22 115
#note too bad it was sort of blocked immediately.

cannot remember full rack

>Norases_Vesdapunt: ABGLN A6 BANG +28 330
#note Saint said he debated between BANG and BLAG here, and that BLAG would have worked out much better.

>Norases_Vesdapunt: AEHLNTU 1A HUL. +33 363
#note He would have had UNHATTE(D)!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEFHIR 4K .HIEF +34 411
#note Good thing I didn't pull the trigger on FI(C)HED! That may have gotten challenged off. I wonder if this is wrong. Given the junk in the pool, it's possible I should play short with 9G HI to maximize my chances of maintaining a balanced rack.
>Norases_Vesdapunt: AABT O1 ABA.T +30 393
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DDGGRT N6 GR.D +10 421
#note Looks like I should go for raw points and leave here with GR(A)D. I may lose if Norases has 6 more points with his Q at 10B rather than at N6. This game is very close.
>Norases_Vesdapunt: AEINQTT M3 Q. +22 415
#note very lucky he was U-less here
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DGPRTW 14F Wa.T +30 451
#note one of few 100% wins. Happy I didn't decide to score less with G10 W(A)PiT(I), as he will just score too much in the endgame.
>Norases_Vesdapunt: AEEINTT 10F ETA +26 441
#note Best play is 9G TIT, setting up A(R)ENE 10J. It gives him a fighting chance if I miss his out, since playing DUP B10 or GR(A)D 10B will be my first instinct.
>Joshua_Sokol: DGPRU B10 DUP +15 466
#note -3 to 12G P(E)D. Took the sure win.
>Norases_Vesdapunt: EINT 2F .EN +6 447
#note -5 to 10N EN. 
>Joshua_Sokol: GR 6D ..G +8 474
>Norases_Vesdapunt: IT 1G TI +14 461
#note I misread my 466 post-DUP as a 460, and Saint accepted the wrong scores as being good, so this seemed closer than it was.
>Norases_Vesdapunt:  (R) +2 463
