>Jerry_Lerman: FO 8H OF +10 10
>Chris_Tallman: AEHIIPZ 7G PHIZ +33 33
#note just PHI is simming better, but PHIZ is more defensive, and I put Jerry on a strong leave after OF.
>Jerry_Lerman: ELPRSTU H5 UP..LSTER +65 75
#note SPURTLE/HOE is better; more points and doesn't give back easy extensions for 45+, but still, sick find and all the style points for Jerry here!
>Chris_Tallman: ABEEIOW 11H .OWIE +16 49
#note Missed BAWTIE, TOWIE is a pretty clear #2 best play tho
>Jerry_Lerman: ?ER H5 .........ER +48 123
#note Luckbox
>Chris_Tallman: ABEMNOS M5 BEMOANS +74 123
#note AMBONES may be a tiny bit better but meh

#note MEWL blocked VODKA for a ton at L1, leaving me with a tough position. I put Jerry on strong range with MEWL, but maybe after BORT, he's just stuck with consonants. I considered playing VODKAS for 24 at B10, but the terrible IU leave isn't worth it and it doesn't block nearly as well as VOID does(blocking lanes to the D, E and S). I'm also leaving AK to score with the AVOID hook maybe. KUDO D12 doesn't block as much stuff, but sheds the U and leaves a manageable ADIV (it's simming best). I went for the super defensive option but idk...
>Jerry_Lerman: ?ADNNOT 5C NONAD.lT +66 233
#note My defense is for naught :(
>Chris_Tallman: ADEGKUU 4B KUDU +28 239
#note Instaplayed this, but DUKE for 7 more points is also worth consideration. 
>Jerry_Lerman: AJLR 3C JARL +49 282
#note Punished hard for that choice :|
>Chris_Tallman: AAEGIQR 15A QI +35 274
#note I am very very bad at scrabble.
>Jerry_Lerman: EX 6E EX +54 336
>Chris_Tallman: AAEGIRY 10B YEA +23 297
#note Didn't spot EY(R)A F13, although that blocks some of my lanes...
>Jerry_Lerman: ADII 13H .ADII +10 346
>Chris_Tallman: ACGGIRT L13 .GG +7 304
#note Felt I had to fish here, although maybe CITRAL or RICTAL to score 27 and open a new lane.. GG is just never bingoing though... I did see CIGGY B6, but wasn't sure on it - it's definitely the play.
>Jerry_Lerman: EIOV 15K O.IVE +27 373
#note This is a problem with IGG, he can play to the triple and block the O line.
>Chris_Tallman: ACIRT L3 CRA. +20 324
#note Don't have a full rack here
>Jerry_Lerman: AEHN 3I HAN.E +28 401
>Chris_Tallman: EINRTTY 11A NER.Y +29 353
#note Basically gave up and cut spread here; if I try to play something like YA J2 to set up the R he'll block easily. TREY for 33 up there will just get smashed by a counterplay, which wolud block in the process. Maybe TETRYL; opens the top lane and gives a chance at a miracle bingo on the F line if he blocks that? (i missed TETRYL)
>Jerry_Lerman: ?ELO N3 sLO.E. +27 428

#note I didn't mind losing this game, UPHOLSTER deserved the win even though it wasn't the best play lol
