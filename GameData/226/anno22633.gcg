>Chris_Guilbert: OPPR 8F PROP +16 16
>Joshua_Sokol: IKNOOOS F6 KO. +19 19
>Chris_Guilbert: DNTU 7H DUNT +14 30
>Joshua_Sokol: ILNNOOS 8K ONION +20 39
#note DUNT suggests one-pointers. I should therefore play short with 9H NO and not increase his chances of a bingo with ONION.
>Chris_Guilbert: EIIRTT L8 .ITTIER +14 44
>Joshua_Sokol: EGLLLSW N6 GL.W +12 51
#note 13K W(E)LL. This was bad. I don't know what I was thinking. I definitely completely missed A(GLOW) as an option.
>Chris_Guilbert: EEEEEEE -EEEEEEE +0 44
>Joshua_Sokol: AEJLLSU 14J JU.AL +56 107
#note JU(R)EL
>Chris_Guilbert: FX M13 F.X +36 80
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILSVV 11H VIVA. +22 129
#note I completely miss the R in PROP. And miss AGLOW.
>Chris_Guilbert: DILO 15G LIDO +24 104
>Joshua_Sokol: CELRSYZ 14F CEL +15 144
#note Missing AGLOW again. This was meant to seal the board, but AGLOW is there.
>Chris_Guilbert: IS 15M .IS +32 136
>Joshua_Sokol: QRSTUYZ I10 Q. +11 155
#note still bad.
>Chris_Guilbert: EEEEEEE -EEEEEEE +0 136
>Joshua_Sokol: ARSTUYZ 6F .RAY +23 178
#note missing AGLOW again, but this is probably better. No more lane there, and I didn't even notice I was blocking it. 
>Chris_Guilbert: ABEHR 7E B. +4 140
#note Chris was also missing AGLOW, and regretted this play, as he had 5K REHAB for 29.
>Joshua_Sokol: EOSSTUZ 9C TOUSE +20 198
#note Can't block, but this makes it tough. Wondered about adding the S for 6, but holding a case S is much more important than Quackle thinks on a closed board, as most working setups set up an S.
>Chris_Guilbert: ABEEHRS C5 BREA.HES +64 204
>Joshua_Sokol: AADISZ D1 ZAIDA +54 252
#note Wondered how sacrificing 15 points for 5J ZAIDA was worth it here. Retaining the case S and not opening scoring spots is huge. I actually regret not making the points sacrifice. That would have been very strategic!
>Chris_Guilbert: AEGU 1A GAU.E +45 249
#note how much is his rack scoring if I play 5J ZAIDA?! scored as 42.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?FIMNRS 3C M.SINFeR +76 328
#note Another points sacrifice I missed in 2B SN(A)RF. Damn.
>Chris_Guilbert: ACE H1 CA.E +30 279
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEMR 8A RE.M +34 362
#note Missed my rack, but I was trying to outrun at this point. Was going to be close!
>Chris_Guilbert: EIW J9 WI.E +25 304
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEHOTY 2F HE.TED +40 402
#note Calculated that this won, but 12A HO(S)EYED does better!
>Chris_Guilbert: ?AEGNOT O1 NEGATiO. +81 385
>Chris_Guilbert:  (NOY) +12 397
