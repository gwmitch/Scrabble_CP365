>Bruce_Ward: EFIRX 8H REFIX +46 46
>Chris_Tallman: ?JOOOUW 7I WOO +26 26
#note This rack is a JOOO... JOW for 36 leaving OOU? is.. not best! Looks like I made the right call here, hoping to score with the J later. 
>Bruce_Ward: AAA -AAA +0 46
>Chris_Tallman: ?AIJNOU 6F JIAO +33 59
#note I can burn the blank for PREFIXION or REGFIXING, but it's pretty clearly not worth it. Another good play :)
>Bruce_Ward: AEFL 5I LEAF +21 67
#note FLEA is 26 H5 with just those letters
>Chris_Tallman: ?AINNRU 4J NAIRU +24 83
#note Pretty handily winning the sim over REFIXiNG and any other plays
>Bruce_Ward: TTTU G2 TUTT. +6 73
#note Ouch..
>Chris_Tallman: ??AGNSU 8H .....iNG +54 137
#note Pretty handily winning the sim over any of the bingoes. Playing this game great so far!...
>Bruce_Ward: DELNPRS M6 SP.NDLER +78 151
#note 'Every play you make blocks me'... and then he plays this. I think he meant PREFIX/PEND or something, but PREFIXING is good hehe
>Chris_Tallman: ?AESSUV 14H SUAVESt +83 220
#note AVULSES for 95! Ofc the first turn I play a bingo I make my first mistake. Welcome to Chris Tallman scrabble :P

>Chris_Tallman: ADENSTV H1 VANE +31 309

>Bruce_Ward: BDEGY 9E GYBED +30 227
>Chris_Tallman: DIORSTW J1 DWI.. +17 326
#note I should maybe just use my S at O4... but that's not going anywhere. The only thing I saw with this play that could hurt me was DIQUAT and there aren't even any U's in the bag heh

>Bruce_Ward: NOY 15N OY +16 371
>Chris_Tallman: LT I11 T.L. +5 437
#note Despite that endgame (I think I was low on time to be fair), I really like how I played most of this game - it was a pretty fun one!
