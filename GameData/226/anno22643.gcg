>JD: DEEFRWY 8D WEEDY +32 32
>Kevin_Fraley: BEER D8 .EBER +20 20
>JD: DDEFRTZ 11C F.Z +30 62
#note debated REFED, FEZ for 42 or this - the other two options sim about 2 better.
>Kevin_Fraley: ?EGIOOS C2 GOOIESt +78 98
>JD: DDEIORT D1 DIED +27 89
#note close on a sim, I'm surprised I didn't play ODD but this is only a point worse. I thought it was 29 when I hit my clock so perhaps that contributed partially.
>Kevin_Fraley: GIMNNOO 9F MOONING +75 173
>JD: AEORRTU 1D .OURA +18 107
#note crushing swing! ORATURE fit if he plays MOON, but then he tacked on the -ING. FOUR keeps a slightly better leave, but I liked the easy bingo lane that DOURA opens (being down 84)

>Kevin_Fraley: AINV A1 VINA +32 264
>JD: AAINNRV 2H NAVARIN +88 309
#note what a draw! the newly TWL15-acceptable NAVARIN also fits at L1
>Kevin_Fraley: ALOW 1L ALOW +31 295
>JD: CHIIQRS 3G QI +24 333
#note major error on my part, I thought QI at 14A was too risky but I set up ICH for 64 for myself at a minimum!! surely that edge is worth gambling for in an even contest.
>Kevin_Fraley: FLU L4 FLU +23 318
>JD: ACHILRS 12H ARCHILS +79 412
#note lucky draw
>Kevin_Fraley: AAEGMNT N5 MAGNATE. +65 383
#note frustratingly for kevin, even if he draws the blank he won't have any chance of bingoing again! perhaps his best chance of winning is GASMAN setting up multiple high-scoring lanes?
>JD: CDIJOPY O4 JOY +30 442
>Kevin_Fraley: ?BEIRT H11 B..TE +21 404
#note challenging endgame, best is starting with ER at 10F and following with OBIT at O8. I actually saw this sequence over the board. he should play ER first to prevent me from playing PIC at 14H for 2 extra spread points.
>JD: CDIP E5 PIC. +16 458
