>Chris_Tallman: BEEGIRV 8D VERGE +26 26
#note VEGIE or GRIEVE... BR > BI. Both of us made lots of mistakes as seems standard in first games...
>Robin_Levin: ??EIOPR I2 PROtEId +68 68
#note Tons of 2x2's for 82 and ISOPRENE for 83 playable here. Still, karmicly punished for my poor opening play by getting immediately double-blanked!
>Chris_Tallman: ABBIMRS H4 BIB +22 48
#note Saw BARB(E), which scores the most, but BIB is 3% ahead of any other play on the sim, AMRS is just too strong.
>Robin_Levin: CFILO F7 F.OLIC +13 81
#note I was VERY happy to see this play, since it turned a frustrating rack into an easy one :)
>Chris_Tallman: AEEGMRS 11D RE.MAGES +94 142
>Robin_Levin: OOZ 10J ZOO +65 146
>Robin_Levin: OOZ --  -65 81
#note We've all been there...
>Chris_Tallman: AEGHNTU H10 N.UGHT +33 175
#note HUGE J10 wins a normal sim, but AUGHT and NAUGHT jump ahead with the opponent rack knowledge of ZOO. Wanted to block H12 in case she had a Z play there. Also, she's likely to play ZOO B10, leaving the J10 spot open for me next turn.
>Robin_Levin: OOZ 10B ZOO +34 115
>Chris_Tallman: AEEFMRT 12A FAME +32 207
#note Considered FE, and should have played it, AEMRT is a monster leave on this board and FE scores only 4 less. Missed the interesting option TEREFA(H) for 42 too. FAME was a pretty large mistake.
>Robin_Levin: DUW 10J WUD +30 145
>Chris_Tallman: AEHNRTY 13G A.ENTRY +26 233
#note Didn't know PHYTANE, looked for plays there though. I wanted to close the board a bit and keep my H for J2 and scoring in general. However, overlooked the simple ANY A13, which looks best even above PHYTANE. 
>Robin_Levin: ALX A12 .LAX +42 187
#note (FA)LX plays after ANY anyway I guess...
>Chris_Tallman: ADHILNV 5E INV..AL +36 269
#note Happy to find this, clear #1 play.
>Robin_Levin: ADEEORS 15C ROSEA.ED +60 247
#note There are no words as to why I didn't challenge this. 'I thought it might be new' is not good enough lol.
>Chris_Tallman: ADHIPTY J4 P.Y +39 308
#note DAY here for 2 less keeps a much more synergistic leave and is slightly better.
>Robin_Levin: IQ 4E QI +24 271
>Chris_Tallman: ADHIIJT L6 JIHA. +20 328
#note Saw JIHAD for 33, but that opened the board way too much for ths situation. I think the 13 point sacrifice is well worth it here.
>Robin_Levin: EINW 8K W.INE +33 304
>Chris_Tallman: DILNRTU O5 UND.RLIT +60 388
#note Took me about 2 minutes to realize I wasn't in a bad spot like I thought at first, because I simply just had a bingo. Easy game sometimes heh :|
>Robin_Levin: AT D6 TA. +6 310
>Chris_Tallman: ADEKOOS C2 SOAKED +33 421
#note Saw SPOOKED and O(I)K but there's no reason to do anything other than lock down the win here. 
>Robin_Levin: EIOSTTU 2I .OTTIES +22 332
>Chris_Tallman: CNO M5 CON. +19 440
>Chris_Tallman:  (U) +2 442
#note My usual first game success returns after a short hiatus in my past few tourneys :)
