#note Nasty turn. OI 2A and OOF B1 are winning the sim here. What do you think?

#note Third tough turn in a row. Was going between THUG, TRUG and GRUE but didn't think of the best play of GRR 10I!
>jerry_lerman: ELVY 10H LEVY +29 285
>cecilia: EMNRRRU -MURR +0 254
#note Very poor. There are a bunch of good options here that aren't exchanges, including MURR at 2E which I completely missed. The best play by far is RERUN in the same spot to set up my M. RERUN gives me a 1 in 3 chance to win, compared to 1 in 5 for my trade!

#note Got to hope the Q's friends come out of the bag. This is simming head and shoulders above anything else. QAT 2G doing terribly.
>jerry_lerman: AARRRSY B6 ARRAY +31 367
#note Jerry chickened out of ARRAYERS here. Many ply sim gives ARRAYERS a 78% chance at winning, 23% for ARRAY, and 30% for RAY (because of big Q plays at A4?)
>cecilia: ?AEGIMQ 1K MAQuI +55 412
#note I didn't realize this was the only win! AQuA at 9B is a tie.
>jerry_lerman: AORSU C10 SA.OUR +24 391
#note Fortunate to survive several poor midgame decisions.
