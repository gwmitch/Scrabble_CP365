>cesar: ACDEFHR 7H FAH +18 18
#note didn't realize the strength of the ACDEHR leave. maybe -F. I don't know if FA H7 is good because then where do I play my bingo? this is actually kind of hard. -7.5  FA instead of FAH is also significantly better. CH is a consonant basically.

>cesar: CDEEINR J4 INC. +15 33
#note 6I REC seems counterintuitive to me.. or RE. DREICH to open it up and score more. my play is a weaker version of it. -8

#note :|
>cesar: ADEGOOS N12 ODEA +22 294
#note 1A DOSAGE, go for the blank. i'm not in very good position here so i thought i would try to control the board against a lower-rated player. but even then he's a tempo ahead and with a blank he would likely win. -4.5
>alan_mason: PY 10B Y.P +16 305
>cesar: DEEGJOS M11 DO +17 311
#note i like 3C DOGE. i really wanted to save my J to score and also not give him any scoring spots. At this point I'm desperately trying to outscore him somehow. so -12 i guess but i see lots of bad things happening after doge too.
>alan_mason: AIIL 3C ILIA +10 315
#note luckily he opened it for me
>cesar: ?EEGJOS D1 JO.ES +40 351
#note and i drew a blank. this kind of luckbaggery was emblematic of the tourney. i played off the S so he can't pluralize it with ZEST or something.

#note horrible endgame misplay, missing a nice play by him. i had sanger at E10 or similar. -17
>alan_mason: BLRTU M11 ..UBT +32 371
#note at least i won, but played pretty badly and had to get super lucky. i started playing better later in the tournament, i promise :(
