#note the top-simming play is OBI, because it keeps the board tight and possibly sets up my X for next turn. but I like opening the board here against a lower-rated player, even though it gives up so many cheap points. perhaps OXHIDE at J1 is a better option that opens - didn't see it.

#note keep the blank or not? I liked that HOBBIT scored well and also opened a new lane that I might get to use the blank on, and I can also bingo to the D on column O for a lot of points. spread is important in an open. Quackle agrees with me by a full 7 points, which I didn't expect - the bingo gives back a lot of free points on row 15.

#note massive error - just PUTT on O12! much more volatile play than necessary for me with two esses left, although he may not know SCUP.

#note I didn't see JUPON at 13G (for some reason I got low on time) but this is a good time to shut down the bingo lanes on rows 1-2

#note sims pretty nicely although not static in top 15, since it doesn't open any new lanes. GOAL at B4 is basically the same thing but slightly more points.

#note a bit of a stumper of a move. no need to open lanes by playing down from the C. I precautionarily wanted to block bingos to the N on row 13, but apparently there are none. best is LAEVO at N7 leaving AELR and some chance of me pulling a bingo of my own. played it safe with clock running out.
