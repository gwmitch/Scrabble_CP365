#note CL: Was debating this vs. LAYUP - I think either is fine
>JD: AEGNOOS 9G AGO +21 21

>CeLe: AACIIRR L4 AIR +16 128
>JD: EINRTVZ 6I IZ.. +32 132
#note JD: the best play here is either AGENTIVE, which I chickened out of, or TZAR which I flat-out missed. Given the fishiness of her last play, I think TZAR is a better option than opening a bunch of lanes for 8s.
>CeLe: ACEGINR E4 RECANI.G +94 222
>JD: EENRTVX M2 VEXT +44 176
#note JD: thought about VERTEX, didn't like blocking the IZARD hook on column M for potential bingos, but VERTEX jams up the board and gives back free points on column H.
>CeLe: DEHLOOS H1 DHOLES +46 268
#note CL: sadly did not know SHOOLED
>JD: EIJNRTU D1 JUTE +42 218
>CeLe: DIIORUU 8A IODI. +21 289
#note CL: Considered trading here but decided this was worth it - quackle agrees
>JD: ADEILNR 2K .I.ER +22 240
#note JD: painful play! after looking at lots of alternatives, I think the best choice here is just FIVE - the leave is poor but I definitely need new bingo lanes. tacking the R on now improves the leave a bit but also makes it a much worse lane for me.
>CeLe: AEEIRUU O1 U.AEI +18 307
#note CL: Very lucky this bailed out my rack and allowed me to block the S hook
>JD: ADDFLNO 2B FO.ND +26 266
#note JD: no FOODLAND for me!
>CeLe: BEGNRRU 7B BEG.N +20 327
#note JD: BURRING looks like a similar play with a much superior leave, but either play is good because they mostly block the I. CL: I didn't see BURRING, which looks better by far because it allows 2 more chances at a T for 11I. I also strongly considered BRO, which doesn't sim as well as BURRING or BEGAN. Easy choices had allowed me to play reasonably quickly up to this point, but I spent too much time on this turn and the next two.
>JD: ADLLRTW 3A DAW. +31 297
#note JD: I finally have a T for WOST! would rather leave that lane untouched for now, so no TRAWL.
>CeLe: CENORRU 4A OR +13 340
#note CL: Too bad there's really no way to score or improve the board here, but this looks as good as anything. TOUR or TROU C10 is simming best but I don't like creating another lane
>JD: EILLORT C10 .OLL +8 305
#note JD: playing LO and keeping an L improves my bingo percentage, but adding a lane to the board is really important.
>CeLe: CEINORU 5A CON +18 358
#note CL: This actually sims best. Keeping vowels seemed fine given the pool, and with Q out I definitely didn't want to give up the U.
>JD: AAEIPRT J6 .A. +18 323
#note JD: fortunate to have some quick plays here, although keeping the P doesn't help because most bingos I could draw don't fit. quackle likes PA about even, there are 11 consonants versus 5 vowels left so AEIRT should fill in nicely.
>CeLe: EIKNRUY 12A YE.K +30 388
#note CL: With no T emerging I was really starting to sweat about 11I. This seemed like the best I could do under the circumstances.
>JD: AEIPRTT G3 PAT +19 342
#note perhaps a play like TRIP or TAPE is right - leaving only one in the bag such that any bingo draw leads to a certain win for me. this way she can fish a tile and potentially win even if I bingo. But there's also the chance that she forgets the WOST hook, and ST- bingos on row 11 will be worth a lot.
>CeLe: ABEINRU L1 B. +7 395
#note JD: tough play for cecilia running out of time - quackle doesn't want cecilia to block the Q spot at L1, claiming that it's a 33/36 win to play BE/BO versus a 30/36 win with BI. In actuality, her play would have won if she draws the T out of the bag instead of the Q, because she can Q-stick me. I don't know if I agree with championship player's analysis - I just played 3 tiles so there's a good chance I drew the Q, and blocking L1 prevents me from fishing and drawing a bingo that plays on row 11 and 14.
>JD: EIRSSTV 11H STRIVES +82 424
#note JD: this is supposed to be 0/8 to win, versus 4/8 after LISTSERV or STIVERS - I chickened out of STIVERS and needed to get a play down fast because cecilia had 3 seconds left. in reality this is bad because it gives her huge Q plays, whereas STRIVES gives less and LISTSERV almost nothing at all.
>CeLe: AEINQRU M9 QU.EN +48 443
#note JD: cecilia found QUEEN right away, but didn't get it down in time to avoid going over - so I had just enough spread to win. CL: Sooo sad. I totally could have gotten QUEEN down if I had just gone for it, but not being sure of the score, how much I needed or if there was anything better than QUEEN, that second of hesitation cost me the game and knocked me out of contention.
>JD: T 3G ..T +6 430
#note JD: phew!
>JD:  (AIR) +6 436
