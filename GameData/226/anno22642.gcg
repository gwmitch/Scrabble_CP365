>Leah_Kruley: AEOSZ 8D ZOEAS +48 48
>JD: CEJTTTU G7 T.J +19 19
#note slightly worse than TUT at 7G - ingenous play because it sets up TAJ/JE?. TAJ is only slightly worse.
>Leah_Kruley: EGMNR E7 M.NGER +18 66
>JD: CEERTTU 12A CUTE. +20 39
#note I had simply forgotten that CURETTE was a word! Massive miss. Failing that, CRUET or TRUCE is what I really should've played here, since it creates a good lane for my strong leave.

>Leah_Kruley: ADIOTYY -ADIOT +0 111
>JD: ACEORST H8 .O +11 58
#note I missed the ingenious fish of TOG at C12. actually I think I considered it but rejected it because I didn't think that ACERST would hit enough bingos afterwards. but JO has its own downside of giving up cheap points on column I. in retrospect, TOG seems worthwhile.

#note happy to find this, which I think is noticeably better than other options

>JD: EFILNRU A5 FLU +12 195
#note the board is really closed so bingo leaves are worth less than usual, and scoring plays more. hence quackle asses the best play to be URGE/HAZER which I did not spot.
>Leah_Kruley: X B11 X. +18 195
>JD: EEIINRS 9G ..INERIES +68 263
#note crazily, I draw 3 bingos on this closed board! unfortunately I chickened out of RESINIER$, which I thought was CSW15 but is in fact one of the rare TWL15-only words! repeat: collins players, do not play RESINIER*!
>Leah_Kruley: ADENOPS L4 PANDO.ES +74 269
#note fortunately for me she missed DAPSONES/SPADONES for more points, unfortunately for me, I made a pretty dire mistake...
>JD: ADHITTU -  +0 263
#note I have a solid play of DHUTIS available (and HIATUS, even better), but instead I made a very costly challenge. this is an elementary rack, I was just slightly pressured on time and didn't remember the APRONED/OPERAND/PADRONE/PANDORE set. yuck! win percentage drops from 60% to sub-20%, which is colossal
>Leah_Kruley: AGIV O5 VIGA. +27 296
>JD: ADHITTU N6 HAT.D +39 302
#note challenging is especially costly with the blank unseen, significantly cutting my chances of drawing it.
>Leah_Kruley: DOWY J6 DOW.Y +24 320
>JD: IOOTUWY K5 YOU +30 332
#note I was very low on time already and needed to get a quick play down - fortunately this was evident
>Leah_Kruley: MO F10 OM +15 335
>JD: BIIORTW M3 BOW +29 361
#note I gauged this position reasonably with my remaining time. I saw that I would lose if I drew the P, but that otherwise BOW gave me enough spread to win. In actuality, after BOW Leah wins almost every endgame with perfect play on her part, but the endgames in question are usually very complex, so I would have a very good chance of winning. however I can make my life easier by playing BROW now instead, which gets me a few extra spread points by dumping the R which won't help. actually BROW even allows for nice endgames like setting up TIBIA/LITAI if I draw an A.
>Leah_Kruley: ?AAEILN 3C .ALErIAN +61 396
#note leah had the one rack where I was basically sure to lose.
