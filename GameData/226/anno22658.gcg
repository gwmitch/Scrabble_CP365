>cecilia: EGINOTX 9G GOX +42 70
#note Wow I was so busy deciding between OX and GOX that I missed both TEXTING and BERTHING! OX sims nearly as well as TEXTING because it leaves BERTHING, which I wouldn't have been sure of.

>cecilia: BEIIMST --  -37 205
#note This was moronic. I was all ready to play BEMIST when I realized that MISBET was more defensive - yay! MIB 4J is another possibility.
