#note Yucky choice between VEGAN and VENTS. As ugly as VENTS is, I feared the board becoming too closed after VEGAN.

#note Not a great play. Maybe GET O13 or TEG M13? Is OGEE 012 worth blowing my Es for column C?

>cecilia: AAEEFIN C9 FAENA +33 401
#note Any ideas for what to do here? I hated playing FAENA - it basically negates all of my positional advantages by using my best lane and spending the As for A6 and the N for 15M - but I felt like I had to take the points or a bingo might not win it. Front runners in the sim are FAENA, TAENIA/TAENIAE from the T, and FATE F2.
