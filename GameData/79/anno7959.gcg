#note J6 WONNE(R) 19, D10 (U)NWON 18.  Don't know why I changed here.  The 3 Ns scared me off too easily.

#note SI(Z)E opens unnecessarily.  Fishing off an I at (X)I is 2nd.  NI(X)ES doesn't rank.

>Dave_Leifer: COW 2L COW +26 250
#note I should note that Dave spent a LOT of time early on in racks before DILATION, like URINE and BUNT.  He was really low and I was pushing him.

#note He told me he left a D.  Almost played DI.  Overscored this by 1, too!
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCIMQR A1 C.RB +33 307
#note 1D BARIC 49 if my rack is right.  I played too fast, just know this is about when I pulled the Q, and wanted to wait to cash in for some reason lost on me now.  I think because I had options and I couldn't use it on that turn.

#note C1 D(I)MLY 22 wins as does IMID, IDLY, MANY.  I can't believe I missed DIMLY. Considering all this, I'm glad I took the tie.
