#note ooh, didn't see ZOA. big miss.
>Ed: DEHNTU O7 HUNTED +49 79
>JD: ABGORSV 11K GROV. +18 46
#note GROVE is considerably more defensive than any other play available. my other choice of GOB sims basically even, or maybe a point better.
>Ed: EIILNOT H4 TOLI.INE +60 139
>JD: AABISTU L8 ..U.I +18 64
#note I liked that KAURI didn't block any of my lanes, as opposed to playing BUNA. ABULIA and VATU all sim pretty close.
>Ed: CDIMOQT G9 QI +44 183
>JD: AABESTW 6B WASTAB.E +73 137
#note I totally wasn't sure this was good.
>Ed: LOX -  +0 183
#note ed held for about 2 and a half minutes and then challenged. I didn't expect it to come back good.
>JD: AEEEGIT F10 AGEE +12 149
#note I thought I was being clever, but just GEE at that spot sims a bit better. VEGIE still wins the sim by a couple of points over my play though. I suppose I might've been a little too paranoid.

>Ed: AEMR 1K AME.R +27 250
#note this constrains his leave pretty sharply...no A, no O. probably another E.
>JD: FHINOTU 5C FOU +31 273
>Ed: AS 8A AS +18 268
>JD: EHILNRT 4D NTH +21 294
#note he must have a great leave after his last play. the only two plays I really considered at all were NTH and THERM. I guess I wanted to keep a really flexible rack so that I would be able to respond to a bingo. however quackle seems to suggest that I pretty much do that just by taking the points with HIT or fishing off the L or the H. that said I think the fishes don't work as well when you factor in how likely he is to bingo up top (probably 50%, I would say). With that in mind, options like TILTH or HIT look like the best option. I was worried about the dearth of vowels in the tile pool, but maybe excessively so.
>Ed: ADNR E10 RAND +25 293
>JD: EIILORY 4H .ROILI.E +18 312
#note first instinct was OILY at 2I to block the best lane but that seemed too risky itself. quackle comes up with a much better options - OILY at 14B. I think I missed the RANDY hook at the time. It sets up my R fantastically and gives me the possibility of countering a bingo. my play was to turn over some tiles and hope to outrun him by scoring down the road.
>Ed: ADEINPS 2E PANDIES +66 359
>JD: AFGOSWY 13I GAWSY +38 350
#note I was pretty sure gawsy was best, but FOGY wins the sim by a lot. it's very hard for him to use that spot to score and it sets me up well, although with his actual rack it would've helped him out...
>Ed: CCEEJLP K1 ..P.C +18 377
#note over the board, ed and I agree that he was basically screwed once had this draw. I suspect that he ends up winning this one had I played FOGY last turn. However, running championship player suggests that he actually has some good winning chances - quackle says he wins about 60% after PEEL, which he debated and passed up due to the wretched JCC leave. I liked his play over the board, but quackle says it wins 32%. overall, even though PEEL does set up a nice spot for one of his Cs, I kinda suspect that championship player isn't playing these endgames 100% right - things often end up going wrong when sticks are involved, I've noticed. what do you guys think?
>JD: ?EFORTY 1F FOE +34 384
#note under some time pressure I didn't see his best play of JIB, but this is actually still the best play supposedly. Tied with FOOTY and playing TRoY (my second play) first. I actually lose if I play TOY at 3M to block JIB.
>Ed: BCEEJLU M3 J.B +46 423

>JD:  (CEELU) +14 427
#note misscored as 431-423 at the time. at least the result didnt' change (somewhat of a tradition between me and ed)
