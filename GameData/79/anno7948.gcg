#note 7H WAB is much more defensive than BOW, i mean i understand, but not really. i'm surprised at the sim results. -4

>Me: AAEHSUU -AUU +0 24
#note i mean, seriously, the last move already sucked  having to choose to keep a U with two other vowels, i don't really need to draw another U.

#note missed a sick bingo that is very vaguely familiar. i should have studied the type 1 8s at some point. -15.

#note glad doesn't look like it scores that many points, i was surprised actually.

#note oh come on! why don't i ever get bingos with U and V in them?

#note i actually would love to calculate the probability of her drawing an X after her last move on the fly. i think it is something like 1 - (34/35)(33/34)...(28/29) = 20%. i can't remember if i read some way to approximate this quickly. in any case, i thought it would be closer to 45% so i was worried, but i was off by quite a bit.

#note nice lucky draw

>Me: CEEITWZ K11 C.EW +18 396
#note i kind of played this part of the game strangely. i wanted to block the Y, but i couldn't find enough points to do it and i wasn't even up by that much, she could get the X at L8 still or something like that. several plays sim closely, L6 TOW is the highest one, but i wasn't that worried about that spot with a one-tile draw. -1%

#note crazy draw. OX or this? quackle likes QI by a tiny margin.

#note clever quackle likes C2 HEX better, maybe going for ZIT at 15A or ZA or ZAG or something? -6
