#note Cool rack.  W(A)CKE looks better.  Totally forgot it.

>Ryan_Fischer: EEEISSY 14J EYES +22 184
#note Ooh, missed Y(W)IS 12L 36!  As I thought, (WATCH)EYE would be decent.  2nd staticly.  EYES/SWATCH is okay.  Mine sets up an X spot.  Oops.

#note 12J ENO(W) 26?

#note Best.

>Matthew_Bernardina: BDGINUX D10 BUNG +24 232
#note 2H (E)XUDING 36?  Pretty even game, kill the line?
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIJRS 8D J. +17 240
#note A play like this should set off sirens, which is why I didn't necessarily want to make it.  JAG or JIG instead?  This definitely sims well -- like 3 points better.
>Matthew_Bernardina: DFINNOX 15J FOX +48 280
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIORS 3G A.EROIDS +72 312
#note I think ROADIES gives back too much.  Hard to say.  I didn't want to play there, either way.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ADDILNN C13 AND +14 294
#note Good play.  Opens a line, has me worried.  I spend a good bit of time on my next turn.
>Ryan_Fischer: FGLLMOS B10 FLOG +21 333
#note Best, but I really had to think through the consequences.  Almost played GL(I)M.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACDILNR 1H .IRNDL +10 304
#note Champ says 13L D(E) 14 (accomplishes nothing, but leaves two lanes to hit).  Ditto with (I)D.  N2 A(S)DIC 28 scores, and I kinda like it.  He keeps in the game, and can still hit two lanes.  Problem with this play is it's giving up the rack building and surrendering a lane.  Fishing off the D allows CARLINE 3 ways.  4 8s through the D, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: ALMNORS A9 LOAM +23 356
#note ROAM is a bit better.  Oversight on my part about the R left in the bag.  Still, either one of these is a major winner.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACEIOTU 15A CO.A +24 328
#note 15A CO(D)EIA 35.  Of note: 5G (WATCH)OUT 16.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ENRRST N7 TRiES +27 383
