#note I'll clean it up later.

>Ryan_Fischer: AHNTUUX H4 TUX +30 62
#note Almost played (C)HAUNT.  Glad this was available.
>Rahn_McKeown: DEOO D8 .OOED +16 62
>Ryan_Fischer: AHMNNUV I3 VAN +14 76
#note Wish HANUMAN was available.  Didn't see (U)NHUMAN or MANHUN(T).  HAV(E)N is suicidal.  Had to play this to clean up and hope things improved.  Still didn't help I missed better stuff.
>Rahn_McKeown: AEIIMST C2 AMITIES +81 143
#note Aw.
>Ryan_Fischer: HKMNOUY B2 HOKUM +72 148
#note Yay!  One of my new favorite plays, but I can't believe I botched it.  I KNOW KHOUM, even looked for places to play it, but once I saw HOKUM played, I got way too excited and didn't think KHOUM would too.  Oh well.  -1

#note Lemme just say I really kinda love games like this where it's making board vision plays instead of just always bingo bango!
>Ryan_Fischer: CILNORR 1E .IRL +21 229
>Rahn_McKeown: F F1 .F +26 274
#note Tried to keep scoring and fake me out here as if he had a good rack.
>Ryan_Fischer: BCNNOOR F12 NOB +18 247
#note At this point, I had to risk it.  Either this or (UN)BORN.
>Rahn_McKeown: BILLRSW 15A BRILLS +33 307
#note Q says SWILL or SWIRL is better, but these close the board.  I had to hold this for a bit.  I always thought if BRILL being British slang for brilliant.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACNORRU A6 ARCO +25 272
#note B9 RANCOU(R) 22?  ACORN is a bit better than ARCO.  CRUO(R) of note, too.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEEINRU 5H ..DUE +12 284
#note It's kamikaze time!
>Rahn_McKeown: EEGNPUW L1 NGWE. +20 342
#note He put down PEWE(E) first but doubted it and didn't want to give that back, then considered WEEP before settling on this.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEINOR 2J DO.IE +22 306
#note 3L (W)O 10?  I just wanted to score, continue kamikaze, and get at those ees, blanks and eses!
>Rahn_McKeown: EEGPSU 1N PE +16 358
#note SEGUE, I think he decided, in postmortem, would be a decent play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ANORRT K5 .RiNATOR +64 370
#note Got lucky on that one!  Only bingo.  He was really disappointed not to see both blanks come out, 'cause he didn't have it.  I was playing like I didn't, but he read it as I did, he was playing like I did.
