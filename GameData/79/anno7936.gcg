>Carl: ?FILRTU 1H .IRThFUL +86 114
#note At the time, I wondered if TRAINFUL 5D was any better than this. Of course it is; why wouldn't it be? (-4)

>Eric_T: ?EHIINV 10H INHE.IVe +79 211
#note Helluva phony! I held briefly, but it seemed plausible. Besides, it might be disastrous to lose the challenge.

>Carl: AAAABIR 6E AA +17 345
#note I saw VARIA M10, but it looked pretty dangerous. Didn't think Eric would go for BAVARIA N8 either.
>Eric_T: ENRSSTU 11B UNRESTS +66 311
#note The game changed drastically with this play.
>Carl: AABIPRV 13K VAPI. +22 367
#note Despite my bingo-bango-bongo, things no longer look so good for me. I have no real scoring plays, nor any way to block the huge hotspot at B10. If Eric has the J or the Q, I could be in serious trouble.
>Eric_T: JOO C10 O.O +3 314
#note O NO is right. He took out QUARK and almost certainly has the J, or he wouldn't play something like this. I must block the lane at all costs.
>Carl: ABDKNQR B10 B.N +23 390
#note I want to keep the D in case I draw an I for QAID. 
>Eric_T: CT 7K T.C +17 331
>Carl: ADKLQRW -QW +0 390
#note Drat! He blocked me again. Now it's no guarantee that I'll get to play the Q at all. What surprises me is that my exchange (better than any other) sims so far behind plays like TAWED K7 or WAD 14L(??). These plays look terrible to me. Could my exchange really be (-15)?
>Eric_T: EGY O4 GEY +27 358
>Carl: AADKLOR A8 KOA +26 416
>Eric_T: O 8K O. +4 362
>Carl: ADILORU 14L LID +20 436
#note Drawing the U is a relief, but there's still lots to think about here. I decided on LID because it takes out QAT and ensures that I can't get stuck with the Q. I was on the right track, but keeping the L sims even better. (-4)
>Eric_T: AIIJNTW F2 JI. +27 389
>Carl: AOOQRU 4A QUA +26 462
#note As usual, I bollix up the endgame. Taking out Eric's out-play with QUA J15 is better. (-9)
>Eric_T: AINTW 15I WITAN +18 407
#note Between allowing the phony bingo, the questionable exchange, and the poor endgame, I lost over 100 points here. Simply unacceptable.
>Eric_T:  (OOR) +6 413
