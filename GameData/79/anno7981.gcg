#note Didn't know enwheeled!  WREN C8 also sims better, but I was hoping to close the board against Carl, because he knows so many words
>Carl_J.: AEGLRTT 4E AGL.TTER +68 182
>E._Tran: ?AEIMNW 5C MAW +26 132
#note And he takes me bingo spot.  Considered WISEMAN* 9F because it fit so nicely.
>Carl_J.: CEEIPSS L3 P.ECISES +63 245
>E._Tran: ?EHIINV 10H INHE.IVe +79 211
#note There are two actual bingoes that I didn't see: INVEIGHS, VIXENISH.
>Carl_J.: BDEOY O8 OB.YED +36 281
>E._Tran: ENOOSVZ 6L .OZ +34 245
#note He took my good spot for EVZONE.  My play sims better than the other spots for it.

#note If I exchange, I might be able to stick him with it.  Sim recommends ditching another S.

#note Carl correctly identified and blocked my setup.  On the bright side, I blocked his Q spot.  Maybe I was being too cute, and should take the points somewhere, like (R)IOJA.
>Carl_J.: BN B10 B.N +23 390
>E._Tran: ACGIJTT 7K T.C +17 331
#note Trying to kill Q spots, while scoring.  Also wanted to keep AJT for JOTA A7.  Was tempted to fish off the CI and go for GYTTJA.  
>Carl_J.: OQ -OQ +0 390
>E._Tran: AEGIJTY O4 GEY +27 358
#note A lot of interesting options now that I have the case E.  May GIT 14L.  Or just M13 AG/AY.  Or take the points with JAY O4.  Champ comes up with a different winner every sim.  Again, I wanted to keep AJT for JOTA.

#note Last ditch effort to Q stick.  Don't remember my whole rack.
