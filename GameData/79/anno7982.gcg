#note GRAVER looked a little too daring.. but I totally should.  I wasn't sure if it took an S, but I doubt Ed will challenge, or hook it himself.  Turns out GRAVERS of course good.

#note Silly Champ says my play win 94% of the time.  What's sad is that I know exactly whats in the bag. Should've just emptied the bag with JABIRU.  Had plenty of time, and didn't think of what he would do, and didn't consider his next play...

#note I looked at what he had left, and though CRAP.  Beautiful play by Ed.
