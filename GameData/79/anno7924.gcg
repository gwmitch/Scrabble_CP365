>Tunnicliffe: AIINPSX 8G PIX +24 24
#note I did not consider XI, which is extremely close to PIX. I think I would still choose PIX most of the time, though.
>Logan: EFY J6 FEY +33 33
>Tunnicliffe: AILNSTT 9H TI +15 39
#note I spent most of my time wrestling between TI and 9H ET. I didn't see 7H TAEL, which I like a lot. I'm not sure I'm a fan of LATI. But unloading the L definitely improves bingo chances, if only because keeping 5 consonants is going to fail too often.
>Logan: BEORR K3 BORER +21 54
>Tunnicliffe: ALNNRST -LN +0 39
#note Quackle doesn't like this. It likes L(O)RN. I realised ANRST was not 8 points better than ANST, but LORN makes the board so gross. I dunno. Quackle likes it. I wouldn't play something like NONART or TALON and give up on this rack just yet. But I guess I'm once again relying too heavily on a 4-consonant leave. And I'm underestimating the board volatility after LORN, since almost any play Adam makes will open more bingo lines.

>Logan: AAEQ 14K AQ.AE +28 108
>Tunnicliffe: AGNOOPV O11 GAN.V +30 138
#note The other option is L1 GOOP. I considered it, since I like opening more lines when I can't really exploit the ones already available. But I really didn't feel comfortable making the board more volatile. And the E floating there felt way to dangerous to leave open. 
>Logan: AIL 15J LAI. +19 127
>Tunnicliffe: ?AKOOOP L2 KOP +30 168
#note Quackle likes BOOK. I should note that the S hook is a poor reason to turn down BOOK, since KOP opens an even more dangerous spot most of the time. The leave is obviously bad, but Adam has definitely been improving his rack, and I think that's a good enough reason to play conservatively and turn down the equity.
>Logan: AEELRSS 10C EARLESS +72 199
>Tunnicliffe: ??AEOOS E6 SAlE.OOm +62 230
#note Racks like these are my waterloo. How much time can you spend trying to find the 2x2? There is only one. When my clock ticked down to 9:00 (oppo plays really fast), I gave up and slapped this down, knowing there would probably be a better play on row 7. Interestingly, the second-best play after the 2x2 is M3 OE. Makes sense, but I don't want to agonise over these blanks for another turn.
>Logan: EHWYZ C8 WH.EZY +56 255
>Tunnicliffe: ACGTUUU 12H CATGU. +24 254
#note With the unseen pool, it seemed possible Adam might be struggling with ugly tiles, too. So I decided to play though this. Quackle agrees.
>Logan: BDI M1 DIB +32 287
>Tunnicliffe: ELNNRUU H12 .URN +18 272
#note I whiffed on 10K UNAU, which looks really good. CURN opens another bingo lane, at least.
>Logan: MO 12C .O.M +30 317
>Tunnicliffe: ELLNTTU 2L ..LT +16 288
#note Or KILN, I guess. But this is the right idea.

>Tunnicliffe: CLNRTTU 13G C.T +12 337
#note This draws dead every time. TUT gives me a shot at UNICOLOR, which would be swiftly blocked.
