#note I saw G(U)M and D(U)MA but wanted to block.  I didn't want him hitting a good Z play or a bingo.  Hence, (S)ALT.  It's really such bullshit, pardon moi French, that things shook out the way it did, and it messed me up mentally for the next game too (gotta get that back in check).

#note RAAHHHOITHTHA~!!~@!  So.  Un.  Fair.  Funfair.  You ruffian!  And I'm helpless.  I saw MIBS after I hit my clock, but there's no win, no hope, no hope.  Besides COHOG, GLUE(Y), and KIWIS, I played pretty well, I think.  And those were marginal errors at best.  *cries*

#note Math dictates I had to challenge, 'cause he's going out and I have way too many points on my rack.  I was pretty sure it was good.  NITROGEN played too, apparently.
