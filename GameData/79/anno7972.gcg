#note Wasn't crazy about any of my options.  This is 2nd, BAILOR is 1st.  At least I can come back for PAN(BROIL).
>Steve_Bush: AEIIORY D5 ORI.I +7 7
#note He told me his rack here.  E6 AI(R)IER 12 is what Q wants.  This at least ranks, but gives a bit too much back for its leave.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEGIQU 4H QUI.E +48 433
#note M7 Q(U)EUEInG 106.  This is 3rd, but sims far back, bouncing between 3rd and 7th. Dumping IG or EG sims well if you don't see the bingo.
>Steve_Bush: GORSZ M1 GROSZ +45 299
#note Nice play, just unfortunate he had to empty the bag.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEGNV 14G D.GVANEs +90 523
#note And at 10 turns for me, 9 for him, I think that's the fastest I've finished a game, and I missed two bingos.
