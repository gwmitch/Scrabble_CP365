#note Haven't gotten to ECTOMERE yet.  MEOW is also a nice fit I didn't see.

#note Also missed FOREFEET.  Tough finds.  Hate closing the board, but I figure there are enough lines open, and I might be able to get a 9 down.

#note L10 TAPING is another nice fit.   I'm hoping he overlooks or doesn't know the hooks to this word, as Emil tends to play superfast.  I also considered phoneying with PAILINGS.  Hey -- It's a Calgary tournament.
>Emil_R.: ACESU A4 SAUCE +35 259
#note He lays this down in about 2 seconds.  x.x
>E._Tran: AAENOSV N13 OVA +15 229
#note Now I suck and forget the hook to SPILING.  This play just signals giving up.  AV(I)ON would otherwise be better.

>E._Tran: AEINOOS -OOI +0 229
#note Trying to prolong the game, and hit some sort of miracle bingo.  I do like (M)O(R)A, which I didn't see.  Again, board vision fail.
