#note quackle doesn't really like my move, and i wasn't overly fond of it myself. i didn't think of 12D PIA, only of PA for some reason. lame. -5.5

#note quackle likes my chances a bit better with 2L TOO, maybe because i keep ERE for scoring but have another chance at a bingo? i don't know. by equity it seems i'm off by 14, but by win% only by 0.1%, so i think i had the right idea.
