>moh: EIOORSS I8 .O +3 3
#note I7 O(L)IO sims just in front on my LO.
>jsp: ?DEENRT H8 .NDERsET +79 85
#note Among the best.
>moh: EEIORSS K8 SOIREES +68 71
#note I probably could have gotten a challenge with (R)OSERIES :-). SOIREES sims best.
>jsp: CDEGNSV 11D VENG.D +22 107
#note Quackle likes the extra points 12J V(E)NGED 26.
>moh: ABELNPQ 10J Q. +31 102
#note Best.
>jsp: ACEFIST D6 FACTI.E +36 143
#note I didn't even think about challenging FACTIVE*. I've read about factive* verbs as I'm sure you have; it sure would have been a nice challenge though. An unchallenged FACTIVE sims better than any legal word; C10 FACE is best among non-phonies. 
>moh: AABELNP C10 BAAL +30 132
#note Quackle likes BANAL over BAAL in the same spot.
>jsp: AHIRSSV L12 SHIV +39 182

#note Best.
>jsp: IIORSTX 15C TRIO +14 237
#note The sim winner is interesting: D2 XI 13. It totally kills the board for non-blank bingos, but, holding the last S, you still have nice bingo lanes to G8 and 12L. It also sets up a nice hotspot for your S at 4D if you don't draw bingos (e.g., F(OI)ST would be 44 if you draw an F). Your TRIO holds up pretty well, placing fifth in the sim.
>moh: ABHIPTT 14K ..TH +14 216
#note Somehow I decided that my ticket back into this game was a big play to A4 with my P, a play I needed to draw to. But SITH was the wrong way to go about the task; B12 TAB accomplishes the same thing better.
>jsp: IINRSUX E4 XIS +31 268
#note Best.
>moh: ABIMOPT A1 ATOP +35 251
#note I was set on putting the P at A4 before I drew and never looked elsewhere. The best play, by far, was 15L (V)AMP 42. And if I play to A4, why not TAMP? Bad play.
>jsp: AGILNRU 15L .IAL +28 296
#note The sim here seems wrong. It suggests 13J L(EH)UA 25, and then (V)AIR instead of VIAL. I don't see why.
>moh: ABCIMNO F2 COIN +23 274
#note COIN is essentially tied with several other plays at the top (3E AB, F2 CAIN, E9 OB(E)).
>jsp: GNORTUW B1 WO +19 315
#note 3F (O)UTGROWN 80!
>moh: AABEIMZ B12 MAE +17 291
#note Here I had a chance to open things up a bit and score well, but it was a tricky find: 10A IM(BI)BE 28. Best is 10C (BI)MA 
>jsp: DEGNRTU A13 GNU +18 333
#note Best.
>moh: ABGIRYZ 3C .RA. +17 308
#note J12 BY 21 is probably best, but it's a tough position. 
>jsp: ADEEMRT 2F .REMATED +65 398
#note Best.
>moh: ?BFGIYZ 1H FeZ +71 379
#note I might've missed my only chance to play F(E)zZY (at H1 for 87). There's no way to win, but FEZZY makes it close. My FeZ is next best.
>jsp: ELNORUW 1L WORN +45 443
#note Best.
>moh: BGIY F9 YI. +8 387
#note Quackle says its best to play 3J GIB. I blocked your LUNE, but we both missed your other out play: K2 (T)ULE.
