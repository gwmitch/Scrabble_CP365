>Pete_Zeigler: GHILOOU 8D GHOUL +22 22
#note PZ: I suppose I should learn some 5s one of these days.
>Jason: BDFNRSY F7 F.RBY +19 19
#note JI: Duck likes holding back the Y, which I considered. (-3.9)
>Pete_Zeigler: ?AEFGIO 12B FOGIE +32 54
#note PZ:  Passed on the the bingoes.  And Duck agrees, OMG.  I'm not a moron.  Shortly after I hit the clock on this play, I entered into a food coma for the next 20 minutes or so... I lost the ability to anagram.
>Jason: DHJNRST C11 J.HN +28 47
>Pete_Zeigler: ?ABEEOT E11 B.O +24 78
#note PZ: I didn't see a thing. Fortunately, duck says passing the bingo is again correct.  FOE is the right play, BENZOATE the best bingo.
>Jason: ADEIRST 15C STAIDER +92 139
#note JI: Kiddies, take note. This is how you get to 1900: Draw AEI into DRST.
#note PZ: So much for bingoing first...
>Pete_Zeigler: ?AEEELT B12 .EE +21 99
#note PZ: Yes, laugh at me... my food coma rendered ELEVATE unseeable... but it sims just a hair better than my play.  Wow, I feel stupid now.
>Jason: CIINRUZ H12 ZIN. +23 162
#note JI: Tough call. Duck likes CURIN(G) and CUIN(G) better ... I suppose turnover and keeping a power tile is preferred here. (-2.5)
>Pete_Zeigler: ?ADELTY 13G Y.D +13 112
#note PZ:  and here, I suck.  More accurately, I panic... I'm down under 10 minutes already, I have IDEALITY on the board, and I freeze... I forget if I'm remembering it right.  and of course, I don't see ADEPTLY.  Now, I'm fishing poorly, time stuck, and Jason knows I have the blank.  I feel dead already.
>Jason: ACDIRUW 11H AURIC +28 190
>Pete_Zeigler: ?AELOTU J5 OUTLEA.n +61 173
#note PZ: Missing a bunch of better ones, and thinking I'm misremembering an anagram to COPULATE.  I may never eat mid tourney again.  Trust me, the rest of my day was far better.
>Jason: DEOSTWX K4 OX +36 226
#note JI: A handful of preferred plays, including (C)ODEX. (-6.1)
>Pete_Zeigler: ACELNSU 3I LACUNES +82 255
#note PZ: at this point, time is already a factor for me.   If I took a minute, I'd have found the better scoring anagrams... and been under 4 minutes with half the tiles unseen.  The easy rack here saved me.
>Jason: DEKLSTW O1 DE.K +42 268
>Pete_Zeigler: AAEMNRW N1 AW. +25 280
#note PZ: LAWMAN or LAWMEN would rock... but since sixes are still largely a fictional construct for me, AWE is next best.
>Jason: ELSSTVW M1 WE.T +20 288
#note JI: By far my most difficult decision yet. I debated between this and (C)LEWS, and naturally didn't pick Q's choice. This doesn't even finish on the top 10 in sim. (-7.9)
>Pete_Zeigler: AEEGMNR 2C GERMANE +68 348
#note PZ:  Hooray fish!  only playable.
>Jason: EIILSSV D1 V.IL +22 310
#note Or (C)IVIL. This worked out best, as it blocked Pete's bingo. (-2.6)
>Pete_Zeigler: DENOPRT 1G POD +32 380
#note PZ: another easy best play... the bag took mercy on my rushed panicky soul.
>Jason: ?EINSST 5B TISaNES +70 380
#note JI: One of those "take your pick" instances. And since Pete was in time trouble, I took the first thing I saw that didn't slot vowels. Missing the 71-point SIN(U)aTES at 6G. (-0.9)
>Pete_Zeigler: EINORTV 8J .OVIER +39 419
>Pete_Zeigler: EINORTV --  -39 380
#note PZ: Desperation and time trouble.  about 98% its no good.  Hoped he'd either open a line for me or accept to dump the Q and let me win the race out.  The simple VOICE wins nearly 70%.
>Jason: AAIOQRT 6I Q.AI +26 406
#note JI: This play seemed simple: Score, leave one in the bag. Imagine my surprise when I inputted Pete's rack, simmed, and Q(U)A was given a 69.8% chance to win opposed to this at 40.8%. (-5.9)
>Pete_Zeigler: EINORTV L8 EVI.TOR +26 406
#note PZ: INVOICE is the best play, which is beyond my pay grade.  EVICTOR has some slight winning chances. I was just playing here... I was time stuck, and had almost given up.  VOICE/VOICER are better.
>Jason: AAMOPRT 14F MO. +28 434
#note JI: Missing the three better winning plays: PA(R)AMO, PA(R)ROT and MO(R)TAR. (-11.0)
>Pete_Zeigler: IN 3F IN +13 419
#note PZ: and I rightfully lose, and it holds up on recount.
>Pete_Zeigler:  (AAPRT) +14 433
