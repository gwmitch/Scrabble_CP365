>jsp: AEMRRYY 8D MARRY +26 26
#note 8F EYRY 20 sims best.
>moh: HLOOOSS 7D OHO +17 17
#note 7C OOH 16 is a bit better (avoiding the F6 opening).
>jsp: ?AELTVY E7 ..LVE +22 48
#note oVATELY was the only bingo, hooking the Y on top or below.
>moh: DELNOSS 12C OLDNESS +81 98
#note Sadly, I was unsure of LESSONED. My play was best, but I should know a word like LESSONED by now.
>jsp: ?ADOSTY H12 .TAY +21 69
#note Your STAY is best. 
>moh: ?AABENT B9 ANTBEAr +81 179
#note ANTBEAR sims best. Also available was ABEyANT.
>jsp: ?DEFOST A3 DEFrOST +85 154
#note Your DEFrOST is in a dead heat with FOnDEST for best. Both give you about a 25% chance of winning.
>moh: CGLMNOO 6F MONGOL +28 207
#note The top three plays (my MONGOL, 15A G(R)OOM, and 6F COLOG) are all essentially tied.
>jsp: EEEHKOW 15A K.EWE +45 199
#note Great play. I'm not sure I see K(R)EWE.
>moh: ACIPUVW 5J WAP +25 232
#note Your consecutive 3W plays, combined with my ugly rack, have shifted this game quickly. 13A P(E)W is a little better than WAP, which is next best. 
>jsp: AEHIIOT H1 ETHIO. +30 229
#note Either ETHION or 4L OHIA is best. Quackle likes OHIA, but I'm not sure I like opening the 3x3 up at this point.
>moh: CEIIUUV 2F CU.IE +15 247
#note The all-star play was 2D UVEI(T)IC 20. CUTIE sims next best.
>jsp: ADEINUX 1J ADIEUX +47 276
#note Clearly best, for your fifth 3W play in a row. Now I'm on the ropes.
>moh: EFIIIUV -FIIIUV +0 247
#note My exchange is best. Wow, what an ugly series of draws. It's painful just to replay.
>jsp: EINORTZ 14E NOT.RIZE +73 349
#note Best again--you're playing some pretty nice Scrabble during this stretch. Quantifying the situation is interesting: when I played ANTBEAR four (of my) plays ago, I was about a 9-1 favorite. NOTARIZE makes you better than a 9-1 favorite. 
>moh: AAENPRT 11I APTERAN +70 317
#note APTERAN* was basically a free try, since no other play gives me any reasonable expectation of winning. Still, even APTERAN* only wins about 5% of the time when you don't challenge. 
>jsp: BGGIJQR O8 BRI.G +30 379
#note L8 JIB(E)R 44 wins more than 90% of the time Your BRI(N)G wins about 80% of the time.
>moh: ACILUUV C3 AULIC +32 349
#note Another seriously crappy rack (not that yours is great at this point). AULIC is best.
>jsp: GIJNQRS 9A ..J +18 397
#note You know how tricky this endgame was. I was shocked to find that Quackle's top pick doesn't get rid of the J or the Q. L10 G(E)NR(E) is best, neutralizing the big plays I had to the corner and guranteeing you a big Q play on your next turn (QIS at either D2 or M3).
>moh: DEFIIUV 4K DUI +20 369
#note I overhtought this one: the best play is FIVE to the corner (although maybe there's something in favor of making you worry that I'm up to something brilliant--I always tell new players at my club that in unwinnable games, always give your opponent a chance to screw up). 
>jsp: GINQRS 14E ........RS +38 435
>jsp: GINQRS --  -38 397
#note Quackle's top picks all block FIVE (L10 G(E)NR(E), M10 G(R)INS, etc.). Genre ensures that you go out next play with a big Q play, and they block my FIVER plan.
