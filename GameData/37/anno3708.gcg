#note ooh.. this isn't the first time i've missed the ANEW hook. i'm working on a tool to study/practice hooks, btw. the other placement of TUFTY sims better than mine, but the play is J8 WYTE. (-7.5)

#note i insta-challenged, not sure if lewis thought he could get this by me or just got confused..

#note sadly chickened out on ZONER. hey, not looking at anything more than esoteric 7s in the year will catch up to me, but i'll get back to studying soon. i don't think ordinarily zoner would be great, but i know he has zoeal there. (-9.5)

#note  i didn't think it was worth the extra 9 points to play this on 11K, but quackle doesn't think it's close. thoughts? (-7) seems about right, the cost of opening a triple is just 2 ?

#note i was scared of the three Ss and two blanks at this point until i realized i had the only Es.  quackle lkes G1 LODE, which i actually think is pretty clever given the pool and my tiles, but i'm not one to take risks with possibly $200 on the line. so my play is paranoid, i guess. (-10)

#note there's the blank and s! my paranoid placement doesn't help, but he could bingo out with risottos if i place it at M1! i don't get it. it likes it there better. (-8?)
