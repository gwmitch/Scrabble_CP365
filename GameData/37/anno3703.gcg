>Piengkamol: MNOW 8G MOWN +18 18
>Jeffrey_: ?EHLLRS 9B SHeLLER +71 71
#note best spot, only binger
>Piengkamol: BGNU D8 B.GUN +20 38
#note great defense with the past participles...
>Jeffrey_: ?BEIINR B2 BINaRIE. +72 143
#note the only other 8 worth considering is BRIoNIE(S) and I certainly would have chosen it for the better D value, just didn't spend much time looking for another...lesser 7s from 10H = BrINIER, BRINIEs.  Wait, WTF? 12B RE(N)mINBI?  That's a word? (Challenge!) Chinese $ I guess.  The duck's Champ player thinks BRIoNIE(S) is a hair ahead -.01
>Piengkamol: AXZ A1 ZAX +70 108
#note ah yeh, BRIoNIE(S) would have been better indeed.  Of course, then the 4A response would be elevated too...
>Jeffrey_: DEFIKMT 8A F.E. +32 175
#note My play was #2 behind 11C K(U)FI -4.41
>Piengkamol: OPW E11 POW +26 134
>Jeffrey_: DIIKLMT J6 MI.K +16 191
#note Duck wants 10H TIKI or KI(N)D in the spot I used -3.32
>Piengkamol: DEOT 10H TOED +23 157
>Jeffrey_: ADIJLTU K5 JUT +26 217
#note best
>Piengkamol: ADIOSTU 14B OUTSAID +79 236
#note Funny, second time this tourney for this one against me.  My opp. just doubled her chances of winning, from 25% to 50%
>Jeffrey_: AADEFIL H12 FA.E +36 253
#note best
>Piengkamol: GIP 15A GIP +24 260
>Jeffrey_: DEGILNU 15H .UGLENID +83 336
#note I first started to mourn no home for my orphan, then 'hey, wait a minute...' I wasn't entirely sure it was good, frankly, without the certainty that alphagram drilling provides (in prob. drills currently I am up to 2K and this is 3K+).  
>Piengkamol: AE 14N AE +11 271
#note she may regret this since it's in her best interests to keep the board open.  I probably would have done 14N for the same points
>Jeffrey_: AACEINS C1 CASA +39 375
#note I was a bit reluctant to give up an S but for 30+ points I couldn't keep it.  My play was best although the duck thinks C2 ASEA wins a bit more often, win % =97 at this point
>Piengkamol: OTT L4 TOT +20 291
>Jeffrey_: EIINORY D4 YIN +24 399
#note I knew this decision wasn't best, but liked it better than 12H (F)IERY or D4 YO.  The duck wants (C)OINER (it wins more often?) opening up a slutty 7 lane?  no thanks, duck. M4 OYER I may have played if I had seen it, but I'm not crazy about a IIN leave -5.99
>Piengkamol: DIQ 13G Q.DI +47 338
#note ah, (F)IERY would have prevented that, and restricted M column bingos to boot.  Hindsight is 40/20
>Jeffrey_: EINOORR M3 ROE +18 417
#note best for win %- ditches doubles (and prevents them considering I will probably draw an E
>Piengkamol: AEORT 1C .OATER +27 365
#note In here shoes, I may have held out hope for another bingo there, but 27 points is pretty good and she has -ED for potential
>Jeffrey_: ACHINOR O8 INARCH.. +51 468
#note best and seals the deal.
>Piengkamol: AELRSVV N1 AVERS +32 397
#note best, although at this point it's for spread.
>Jeffrey_: EEOY 1N .E +6 474
#note ...so I tracked properly and checked.  she threatens L(A)V and so of course the best move is to play there.  Q agrees.
>Piengkamol: LV 3M ..V +6 403
#note only V spot
>Jeffrey_: EOY N10 YO +28 502
#note YO or YE best
>Piengkamol: L J12 L. +2 405
>Piengkamol:  (E) +2 407
#note In what might be a personal tourney best, under 14 points lost here.  Blanks do tend to make for easier decisions, but I'm glad not to have missed any bingos too.  I took down an NSC Div. champion!
