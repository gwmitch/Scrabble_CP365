#note ES is better than AES in general. This would probably fly as an opening rack exchange, but not here so much. No consonants to play through. Just trade AIIOO.

#note This or AA. This is the type of decision that is affected by the strength of your opponent, but I'm still not sure *how*. I'm of two minds here: 1) I'm the favorite in this game, so I shouldn't open it up to luck and should play AA. 2) I'm the favorite in this game, so I want an open board, which I can better take advantage of. Which mind is correct?

#note Had you given me AADEEERT as an alphagram, I would have gotten it instantly. Yet I didn't even look through the A here, and whiffed on DEAERATE for three more. Bad miss. Luckily it wasn't a triple-triple.
