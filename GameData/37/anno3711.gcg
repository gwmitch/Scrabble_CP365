>Jason: EEFNOQR -EFOQ +0 0
#note Duck likes keeping ER. I won't quibble with that. (-0.2)
>Steve_Krieger: HILRW H4 WHIRL +30 30
>Jason: AEELNOR G7 OE +8 8
#note Glad Q doesn't hate this play as much as I did shortly after hitting my clock. Blowing it up with AREOLE is preferred, though. (-5.2)
>Steve_Krieger: BLOW F8 BOWL +22 52
>Jason: AAEJLNR 3G RAJ +31 39
#note Duh. JAR sets up the -L back hook and there's a lot better chance he has an A than an L or S. (-0.4)
>Steve_Krieger: DG 6G D.G +9 61
>Jason: AAEILNS 3G ...A +11 50
#note Wow, do I not know how to fish. Staticly fine, but way behind AA at J2. (-8.4)
>Steve_Krieger: EMRTU 2J MUTER +36 97
>Jason: AAEILNS 5H .A +8 58
#note Again, watch my play go down, down, down in sim. Blowing it up with LIANA at 1H is Q's pick. (-12.8)
>Steve_Krieger: ENOSSV 11E S.OVENS +40 137
#note I think Steve told me his leave here, but I forgot. R, maybe?
>Jason: AEILNSZ K4 LAZINES. +84 142
#note That S prevented me from going batty over my failures in fishing.
>Steve_Krieger: AITX 1I TAXI +29 166
>Jason: ?CEEPTT 2A PECTaTE +76 218
#note 58 points through five turns, then turns of 84 and 76. Gotta love Scrabble.
>Steve_Krieger: NU 1A UN +20 186
>Jason: EEGHINN 3M HEN +24 242
#note I wasn't enamored with this play when I made it, but Duck concurs.
>Steve_Krieger: AY L5 YA +21 207
>Jason: ACEGINT 8J I.CAGE +36 278
#note Tough call. Steve's played off two tiles on two straight turns. I hated opening the board, but felt any bingo by him would bring us to even, me with tempo and a better-than-average leave. With no rack inferences, Q likes this play.
>Steve_Krieger: FK M7 K.F +19 226
>Jason: AIMNOTV N6 VI.A +27 305
#note I think now we can assume that ? or S is on Steve's rack. Chose this over (V)OMIT for defense. This annotation stuff isn't nearly as much fun when Q keeps agreeing with me. :)
>Steve_Krieger: FO 1N OF +18 244
>Jason: ?EMNOOT 10D MO. +10 315
#note Things started to go south here. This was, I think, my losing play. Not upset about not seeing (C)ONTEMpO or (T)ENOTOMy ... but (V)ENOM puts me up 94, and it's hard to see me losing, even giving Steve the S. However, Quackle gives me a 98% chance of winning after MO(W). I see Quackle doesn't have the "I'm playing my Daddy" feature yet. (-25.7)
>Steve_Krieger: GI H11 .IG +8 252
>Jason: ?ELNOQT 7J Q. +22 337
#note Gah! I hated the "timeout" I had to take for the Q play here. Sure enough, it bit me in the rear. Still at a 98% chance to win, though.
>Steve_Krieger: BR O7 R.B +20 272
>Jason: ?ELNOTU C2 .UT +10 347
#note I spent a long time looking for bingoes. Missed one, but I'd bet only about 50 people in the NSA would see it. (Hint: It makes the blank a J.) Maybe (C)LOUT's a better non-bingo, but I don't think this is a bad play. (-19.9)
>Steve_Krieger: DEIORST 14H STEROID +78 350
#note OK, my plan is working out. He bingoes...
>Jason: ?DELNOU B4 UNOiLED +65 412
#note ...I bingo back along the better line I created, giving myself a 90+% chance to win (UNLOvED is 14 better, though)...
>Steve_Krieger: ADENOPR A9 PADRONE +90 440
#note That wasn't part of the plan. I saw we'd worked our way through the clunk, but the unseen IIY looked like potential bingo stoppage. But when the first two I looked at were YI, I knew I was in trouble. (shrugs) What can you say? Yeah, this loss is on operator error, but when I made my last play, Steve was a 10-1 shot. Guess it was just his day.
