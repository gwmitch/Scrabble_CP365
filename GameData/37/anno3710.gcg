>George_Viebranz: EHNORRT 8G NORTHER +72 72
#note I joked after the game that George was showing me complete lack of respect by not playing it at 8H and trying to turn it into a "who can get luckier?" game. :)
>Jason: AAEIIOQ J6 QA. +32 32
#note I had a feeling before the game that I would get outdrawn here. This opening sequence did little to assuage those fears.
>George_Viebranz: KMOS N6 MOSK +27 99
>Jason: AEEIIMO -AEIIOM +0 32
#note Missing (H)OMIE. (-9.7)
>George_Viebranz: BOX O5 BOX +25 124
>Jason: CDEEEIL O2 ICE... +18 50
#note Maybe it was silly to stop the four-letter BOX extensions.
>George_Viebranz: AEY O9 AYE +12 136
>Jason: DEEIIIL K8 .ILI +14 64
>George_Viebranz: ENNTU 10F TUNNE. +10 146
>Jason: DEEEFHI K3 DEFI +27 91
#note At this point, I'm fairly pleased. Not a lot has gone right, but I've played OK and am still within bingo range.
>George_Viebranz: DIMRT 4G MITR.D +20 166
>Jason: AEEHLTU 3C LEHUA +23 114
#note Very close between this and HUE(D) at 3H. I felt like going for turnover and open-age was the way to play. This is Q's pick.
>George_Viebranz: DEEY D3 .YED +16 182
>Jason: EFJLNTV 5C J.FE +28 142
#note Close between this and FELT at E5. This lags just behind. (-1.3)
>George_Viebranz: ATZ J1 TZA. +36 218
>Jason: ?LNOSTV C5 .OLT +15 157
#note I considered VOLaNTS/(HILI)S*, but I almost never play intentional phonies; plus, I didn't think George would buy it and it's not like I was in desperation mode yet. Given the situation, he might've let it go. Duck really likes VOL(T) at 1G, which would've prevented the impending sh*tfest. I felt like opening another lane on a tight board while keeping decently was the way to go. (-17.6)
>George_Viebranz: AILRRSU 1C RURALIS. +77 295
#note Held.
>Jason: ?ENSSVV -  +0 157
#note And challenged. This is an interesting situation for somebody at 2-0, +300. Do I play VE(T)S and its 1.3% win chances, just trying to limit spread since my spread's so good? I just don't like playing that way. I didn't know it, and even though I thought there was like a 90% chance it was good, I felt like I had to. Even if I win just 1/3 of that 10%, it beats 1.3%. (-38.8)

>Jason: ?NNOPSV -NPV +0 181
#note PONS at 12L leads in valuation. (-6.7)
>George_Viebranz: AARU 11C AURA +10 362
>Jason: ?EINOSW N11 WO +10 191
#note Missing the four-overlap WINESOp. (-30.4)
>George_Viebranz: ?EGINOW 13I WENdIGO +85 447
#note I had to chuckle at the fact that George's rack was WIGEON? while mine was WI?EONS.
>Jason: ?BEIINS 14C StIBINE +69 260
#note Pulling the V here was kind of the coup de grace. Now I know how most of my opponents have felt this year.
>George_Viebranz: AACNOPT 12F NAP +11 458
#note There are a few better endgames (we found one five better in the post-mortem), but I think George was shortish on time.
>Jason: V -  +0 260
>George_Viebranz: ACOT 15H AT +18 476
#note Best.
>Jason: V -  +0 260
>George_Viebranz: CO L2 CO. +10 486
#note To paraphrase a Pianow line earlier that morning: "Don't bet on me when I'm outplayed and outdrawn."
>George_Viebranz:  (V) +8 494
