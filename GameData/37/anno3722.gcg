>Naween_Fernando: AEIINXY 8D XENIA +40 40
#note The 40-point play is evidently best despite the rotten leave, which hurts the equity by less than 1.5 points.
>David_Eldar: AAOSSVV I5 VAVS +27 27
#note Shame there was no R floated for VAVASSOR or VAVASORS. Clearing up the duplicates and disposing of the V's is indicated, and David's choice is best - XENIA taking both L and S.
>Naween_Fernando: EHIPSWY 7B WHEY +31 71
#note Once again an R would have paid dividends, but no such luck. A few different tactical approaches can be taken here - dump a couple of tiles and hope for bingos (e.g. 6H YAW), score a bit more and provide a more restricted S hook (e.g. WEEPY E7, which takes the front S), or turn over a few tiles and score well (e.g. WINEY F6, VIEWY 5I or WHINEY F5, which actually sims best - but it's hard to be sure whether that form is valid as well as WHINY). Naween's choice also scores 31, but doesn't fare quite so well in the sim - perhaps because the overlap plays on row 6 are facilitated.
>David_Eldar: ?AEINOS 9A AzIONES +79 106
#note David does well to look beyond the numerous V-bingos on offer (not to mention WOMANISE, which offers the Britney -R extension as well as D and S), finding the second-highest score. ANOREXIES would have been a fun find but is only fractionally better.
>Naween_Fernando: ABIIKPS 8A KI +41 112
#note This position looks tailor-made for a dump of KI at 8A, and Naween duly colonises the spot. Worth a look is BI in the same spot - it scores twelve less, but the synergy of the rack leave appears stronger.
>David_Eldar: HINNOPR 10F PHON +32 138
#note David's is clearly best, scoring well and clearing the duplicate N.
>Naween_Fernando: ABEIOPS 11H BOEP +22 134
#note It's worth noting the end-hooks to PHON, namely E, O, S and Y. This gives a chance to score reasonably and manufacture a strong leave, e.g. OBA, BOI or OBIA using the PHONO hook. A more subtle find is PAV 7G, the BEIOS leave combining well with some of the tiles in the bag - but adding the E to make PAVE is frowned upon by the simulation software. 
>David_Eldar: EILNORZ 6I .ZO +32 170
#note All the good plays triple the Z somehow in row 6. David's point in choosing AZO was to set up his N, and it's hard to argue with although the sim marginally favours LAZO.
>Naween_Fernando: ?AIIJRS 5K JAI +38 172
#note AZO was vulnerable to this kind of response, and JAI is perfect to score well and retain a great leave.
>David_Eldar: AEIILNR 12G AIRLINE +81 251
#note The bingo plays in several places, but this maximises the overlaps.
>Naween_Fernando: ?AEIRSY 13B RImAYES +79 251
#note Looks like a strong rack, but the bingos are hard to come by unless you are on top of the 'new' Collins words (the only 'old' one being the tough YERSINIA M1). Naween makes no mistake. RIMAYE is helpfully defined in Zyzzyva as "a bergschrund" (it does go on to specify that it is a form of crevasse).
>David_Eldar: EEGTTUU 12A TEGU +19 270
#note Not pleasant to see a rack like this when your opponent has drawn level. Once again disposing of duplicates makes sense, with the 12A position just beating 14C in the sim. Plays such as TUTU or GUE 13K are not too bad.
>Naween_Fernando: BCDDMTT M11 D.BT +14 265
#note This one is even worse, with hardly any reasonable plays available. It's either DEBT or change, and Naween makes the bold choice (at least DCMT has the makings of an acceptable rack). It's the only play with (just barely) positive equity, and while he may be opening the TWS, at least there were S-hooks on the board already.
>David_Eldar: AEOTTUW 7H A.OW +36 306
#note There's not much to choose between AVOW 7H and VAWTE 7I - it seems to me that the OTU rack leave of the latter is slightly more flexible. VOW and VAW in the same spot are pretty strong as well.
>Naween_Fernando: CCDMTTU C3 DUTC. +22 287
#note At least we have one vowel this time, and while DICTUM M4 does surprisingly well in the sim despite the potential Q-whammy, it looks best to play onto the H in column C. There are actually three options, CUTCH, DUTCH or MUTCH.
>David_Eldar: DEERTTU 14B ETUDE +38 344
#note The earlier DEBT having blocked UTTERED N8, David does well to find this pleasant multiple overlap; nothing else scores more than low 20's. The move also has a prophylactic effect on the DEBT hook, with row 15 now more likely to be occupied by a survivable short word than a bingo.
>Naween_Fernando: CLMMSTU 15H MULCTS +41 328
#note From a revanchist viewpoint it makes sense to colonise column 15 before David can, and MULCTS certainly scores well (it also beats STUMM 8K in the sim). An alternative strategy is to open up another front while retaining the S, and in fact MULCT or CULM N3 perform strongly. I'd still go for MULCTS however.
>David_Eldar: AFGOORT D1 FROG +33 377
#note I think from David's point of view it is best to keep scoring here, with FROG looking better than FOOT in the same location. 
>Naween_Fernando: DEEIMRR 1D .IRMED +36 364
#note Naween is still a vital tempo behind and has to keep piling on the points. The danger of drawing the Q is looming, but I would still play FIRMED rather than FREMD as proposed by the simulation.
>David_Eldar: AAGLOOT N2 GOAL +21 398
#note There are now three in the bag, but it isn't worth making a two-tile move with threats such as FENNIER, FERLIER, REFINER darkening the skies (all of which play from 2H or N6). GOAL appears the best way of killing them off.
>Naween_Fernando: EEFINQR O1 QI +36 400
#note Naween knows that David is left with ALNORT, but although he cannot play out there are just too many places to score. In fact Naween can get within seven points by disposing of EEFNR first and following up with QI at O1 or N10; this is achievable with FINEER M4, a difficult find indeed.
>David_Eldar: ALNORT L2 TOR.N +23 421
#note LORAN/JOWL earns 32 points, but the intended sequence with TORAN is actually slightly better (finishing with TORANA/AVOWAL). 
>Naween_Fernando: EEFNR N10 FERE +30 430
#note Best
>David_Eldar: AL 8K LA +17 438
#note At the last minute David decides to play safe, but has guaranteed the win. A very solid game on both sides, with David in particular hardly putting a foot wrong.
>David_Eldar:  (N) +2 440
