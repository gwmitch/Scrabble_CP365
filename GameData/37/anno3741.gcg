>moh: ?AHJOTT 8G JOT +20 20
#note TAJ sims ahead of JOT, but I stand by JOT.
>jsp: EFIMNOS 9G OF +21 21
#note Best.
>moh: ?AEFHKT J6 KHAF +35 55
#note Quackle likes 10F KEF 39. It's close, and I'm not sure what I think between the two plays.
>jsp: EILMNQS K5 QI +28 49
#note Best.
>moh: ?AEEHNT 10A mETHANE +73 128
#note pHENATE in the same place is a little better, putting the H on the 3L.
>jsp: CEELMNS 11D EMES +38 87
#note Best.
>moh: ADMRTUW 12A WARM +42 170
#note Best.
>jsp: CLNNRTW A8 CW. +21 108
#note Tough draw. Revenge of the all-consonant leave. B9 R(E)C(A)NT sims best, followed by an exchange, and then your CW(M).
>moh: AADDLTU K9 ADULT +17 187
#note A bunch of plays are tied at the top, and ADULT is among them.
>jsp: ?ILNNRT L4 LINT +26 134
#note LINN is a bit better in the same place, but that's splitting hairs.
>moh: AADIOOV 12H VOI.A +24 211
#note Best.
>jsp: ?GNNRVZ -GNNV +0 134
#note It's an obvious exchange, but tricky to decide what to keep. Your choice sims best.
>moh: ACDDEOO A12 .OOD +24 235
#note Best.
>jsp: ?EIRSXZ 8L SIZE +48 182
#note Best.
>moh: ACDEIII H12 .ICE +27 262
#note Best.

>jsp: ?DEEGRX B12 .XE +33 215
#note Best.
>moh: AABDIIR N5 BAI.A +18 280
#note Best.

#note Best.
>moh: DEIILRR O1 RI.DER +36 316
#note Best.
>jsp: EGNSUVY 4F ENVY +21 321
#note ENVY holds up well in the sim. DUGS or DEVS, both at 10K are also attractive.
>moh: EEILNNR 5B LINER +12 328
#note This was a terrible play. The unseen pool is ugly, so why draw so many? 13D EN sims best.
>jsp: GIOPSSU 10K .UPS +28 349
#note The best plays all play in the spot you took: DUGS, DOGS, DUPS, DUOS are all about the same in terms of win %.
>moh: ELNOTUU 7I U. +9 337
#note Despite how close the score is, I felt like I needed a bingo since I could not score at all. Unfortunately, most of the decent plays blocked bingo lanes, but my fish was pretty lame. D1 UNTU(N)E sims best.
>jsp: AGIOPST N1 OP. +20 369
#note OPE doesn't quite win the sim, but the sim does not take into account my fish. Given my fish, I think OPE is best, killing the bingos to the R.
>moh: ELNOOTU J1 OU. +5 342
#note My play actually gives me the best chance of any play here (almost 40%). But I need a bingo draw.
>jsp: AAGIRST A1 TAIGAS +33 402
#note Congrats.
>moh: ELNNOTY 1H LO.NY +36 378
#note Best.
