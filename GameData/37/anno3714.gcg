>Pete_Zeigler: EHINOTT 8H THIO +14 14
#note PZ: There are about 20 justifiable plays in this position.  HOTTIE wins sim, but I was superfancy going to attempt the cute extensions later on.
>Jason: BGIIUVY 7K BUY +16 16
#note JI: Duck likes IVY at 9K, which I considered. Stopping the (THIO)NATE extension, maybe? (-2.9)
>Pete_Zeigler: ?EENORT H8 .ENORiTE +74 88
#note PZ: Missing the two cooler bingoes TRECENTO and ENTREPOT, but TENORITE works just fine.
>Jason: EGIIORV M3 IVOR. +22 38
#note JI: Duck likes VIGO(R), which would've just given Pete another spot for his bingo. (-1.2)
>Pete_Zeigler: CDEGNOR 13C RECOD.NG +78 166
#note PZ: When playng a 1900, brainless bingoes come in handy.
#note JI: That's "former 1900" to you. I remember my immediate reaction, esp. given my rack, was "(bleep) this (bleep)." Then I remembered I needed to win to stay at 1900, this game might have BAT Premier ramifications, and that I owed it to myself to keep fighting and give everything I had. 
>Jason: EGIIJNU E10 JUI.E +28 66
#note JI: Gutsy, but best.
>Pete_Zeigler: AACEIPX F13 .X +50 216
#note PZ: Best, and brainless again.
#note JI: I briefly considered resigning here. :)  
>Jason: GIILLNT D12 T.LL +24 90
#note JI: A few plays close here, most in that spot. EL, TEL, etc.
>Pete_Zeigler: AACEEIP C13 .IA +16 232
#note PZ: Here, I get fishy... my reticence to try the P(RECODING) Hook I was only 80% on costs me.  Failing that hook, AECIA 12J is a strong play I missed.
>Jason: ADGIINO 6E GONIDIA +68 158
#note JI: The disconnected nine available would've been cool. Being mortal, I make the second-best play. (-5.1)
>Pete_Zeigler: AACEEEP 12J APACE +21 253
#note PZ: I was very unsure as to the propriety of this play at the time, and even in post-mortem.  The top three plays are all very close in valuation and win %, clearly better than all other options, and APACE is one of them.  PEAGE seems to have the slightest of edges, while AREAE wins on style points while trailing just slightly per Duck.
>Jason: AEEELQT 5D QAT +32 190
#note JI: Gotta love the leave. But I'm within 63, and seeing a ray of hope.
>Pete_Zeigler: AEEERST 14H .EETERS +26 279
#note PZ: Missing the ridic hi prob bingo, which had I saw, I may well have incorrectly passed up.  I was getting way too defensive too early.  I wanted to kill the 15 row and the N column hotspots.  TEE 14H is clearly better.
>Jason: EEELOPZ N10 ZE. +32 222
#note JI: POLE, 13L, would've been sweet. Didn't see it. (-14.4)
>Pete_Zeigler: AABOOSW O8 OBA +26 305
#note PZ: wins sim.  I deserved this rack, after my last bonehead play.  
>Jason: EEILMOP 11J MOL +27 249
#note JI: Keeping the P for the RECODING front hook. An S and I can score big. Q says to ditch it with POM or MOP in this spot. (-6.6)
>Pete_Zeigler: AAOSSSW 15J SOS +17 322
#note PZ: I stand by this play, regardless of sim or common sense.  The board wasn't S friendly, and the 15L spot scared me to death.  I took a while on this play, and when I saw what was unseen, I knew I had to block.  
>Jason: EEEHIPR 15A HE.. +21 270
#note JI: My immediate reaction was to strangle Pete after SOS. The 1-2 punch of blocking HEIR for 46 and knowing that I had no chance of drawing an S was tough to take. Duck says PEH at G9 is the better play. (-1.2)
>Pete_Zeigler: AADMSUW G9 WAD +25 347
#note PZ: Duck goes WUD by a hair... I chose to undouble the A, and keep a potential SUQ in play.
>Jason: ?EEINPR 3H PINER.Es +60 330
#note JI: Didn't know the bingo through the P (REPLEVIN), which gives me about a 20% chance of winning. This checks in at about 10%. A play like NEEP at F8 would've been better, too. (-16.5)  
#note PZ: I don't know if I could have passed up the bingo, but EN f10 looks kinda sweet too.
>Pete_Zeigler: AGIMSUW O1 WA. +15 362
#note PZ: With the K unseen, the odds of me leaving the O4 spot available were zero.  I considered WUSS instead, which duck prefers, and it and  UMIAQ win sim, which seemed far more volatile than I was looking for.  I still felt in control, and UMIAQ cedes that control.
>Jason: DFLNTUV 4I FUD +17 347
#note JI: Best in valuation, but V(I)D at I2, apparently hoping for a miracle A draw, gives me the best chance at winning by far.
>Pete_Zeigler: GIKMSUY H1 KI. +27 389
#note PZ: Duck chooses MU 13L, which I didn't see.  JUICES is a cool play.  My play is fairly pedestrian.  I figured it sets up a number of reasonable out in two sequences, and as long as I don't get stuck with big tiles, I'm gonna pull it out.
>Jason: AILNNTV 10G ..VIL +26 373
#note JI: Happy to see this. Best, although I thought about playing something else first, hoping Pete wouldn't see this, trying to bait him into a mistake or something.
>Pete_Zeigler: FGMRSUY 7B GYMS +18 407
#note PZ: Best, and seals the win, while leaving an out and other scoring options.    
>Jason: ANNT 6A NA +9 382
#note JI: Seeing FRU(G), missing Pete's other out. (-7.0)
>Pete_Zeigler: FRU 2N F. +20 427
#note PZ: Screwed up my math here.  I thought FA was better than the out, becuz I missed the potential of NTH.
>Jason: NT 5L N.T +3 385
#note JI: Missing NT(H). (-3.0)
>Jason:  (RU) +4 389
