#note IDIOT is an aggressive play I didn't really look at. Had I thought about it more, I probably would have played it. I did think there was a chance my opponent didn't know PILIS, though.
>Debbie_Stegman: INUZ 6D UNZI. +36 58

#note She held PILIS.

#note The choice between EQUID and FEN is interesting, even though I didn't consider FEN at all during the game. Against this opponent I think I should have played FEN, but against top-flight opponents I like EQUID. Either way, EQUID wasn't a huge mistake, but FEN would have definitely been a better option.

#note This sims best, but Quackle presents another aggressive option of Ex. FNV. I still like my play better, though. Seems like too many points to sacrifice for this leave with only 60-point alleys open.

#note Despite seeing NELSONs, I was inclined to challenge because I lost to Early on the phony. Not mad about this challenge. 
>Debbie_Stegman: OX B1 OX +38 297
#note I can't see myself doing that.
>Sam: CDNRRSU M9 CRUDS +36 220
>Sam: CDNRRSU --  -36 184
#note I guess because of SELFS. Good challenge by Debbie.
>Debbie_Stegman: EV J11 VE. +6 303
>Sam: CDNRRSU 7H .NCUR +8 192
#note I was somewhat on tilt at this point, apparently. CURS I3 looks much better.
>Debbie_Stegman: BEMMU L2 BUMME. +24 327
>Sam: BDJRSSW 3K J.S +20 212
#note I really like SOW G12 here. When Debbie makes a likely block, look for JABBED/JIBED/JABBER 2J. Otherwise, just work towards something big w/ the SOWS hook.

#note At least it would have been best if it were good. Thought it was. And yeah, I know Darin True.
