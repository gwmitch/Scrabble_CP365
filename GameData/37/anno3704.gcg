>Florence: BEW 8G WEB +16 16
>Jeffrey_: DEEGJOR G6 JE. +14 14
#note JO 8F best here, -4.26
>Florence: ACELNRS J2 LANCERS +72 88
>Jeffrey_: DEGIOOR 1H DOGIE +35 49
#note I was so psyched to have a hook that I forgot to look for bingos (sigh).  -34.4 for missing GOOD(L)IER and RODEOI(N)G.  I suppose the latter is a bit harder to find, but considering I was thinking 'too bad GOODIER* then the L infix is not difficult
>Florence: IV 7E VI. +6 94
>Jeffrey_: INNOORY 5J .ONY +18 67
#note I'm not up on my NOOY words- RO(N)YON best one row up H5 YOR(E) nice too -7.34
>Florence: AZ I3 ZA +44 138
>Jeffrey_: ?DIINOR 2B DINItRO +67 134
#note my choice second to NO(N)rIGID L3 -.6
>Florence: IPX 1A PIX +48 186
>Jeffrey_: AAGLOUV E7 .ULVA +22 156
#note with the crap I had, I knew the word had to be best but Q likes the E4 placement?   I didn't, considering the greater possibility of 8A plays...-5
>Florence: ARW M2 WAR. +20 206
>Jeffrey_: AAGOSTT H4 TAO +17 173
#note GOA N1 better?  I wouldn't play that.  TO(N)GA L3 I should have - 9
>Florence: HO L3 HO. +21 227
>Jeffrey_: AAFGLST 12A FLATS +36 209
#note Great Spaghetti!  Did I really play a T when I could have played a G?  Ugh.-11.3 I deserve the thwack. Also thwacked forgetting one of the other hooks.  FLAG 12D best
>Florence: FNSU A8 SNUF. +33 260
>Jeffrey_: AADEGMN H8 .NDAMAGE +95 304
#note she didn't even BAT an eye when I put this down- a little disappointing...if I had kept the T then (E)MANATED, which has is far less challenge-able.  Best and only- I finally edge up over 50% to 68?
>Florence: QT C11 Q.T +24 284
>Jeffrey_: ?BEIIOT 10E .OI. +10 314
#note B6 BIO best -6  Q likes the board-opener 10H (D)OBIE too.  I don't
>Florence: ELO D2 .OEL +8 292
#note she briefly transposed the tiles here, making (N)EOL*, and afterwards I said 'I almost thought I was going to get a free turn there.'
>Jeffrey_: ?BDEITU 13G D.UBIEsT +76 390
#note highest win%- this got me a hold then a release (in the game, I mean, sheesh*!) this spot beats two rows up, h(A)BITUDE (which I knew but may not have found) and I(M)BrUTED one row up (would have found) but is worse D.  
>Florence: EGK L12 G.EK +28 320
>Jeffrey_: EEHIMPT 15L .EMP +36 426
#note somehow even plays like (K)EPT have a higher win% (95 vs 91 because it keeps HM combo?) HEMPIE C4 would be coolest if I had known it, but HEMPIER is just beyond the 1/2 way mark on the 7s. -7  
>Florence: ACENRTU 15A UNCREAT. +83 403
#note I didn't really expect this but it doesn't matter at this point.  In retrospect, none of the row 15 plays were worth making to block anyhow.  (My opp almost took Gibson out in Charlotte, so she certainly has skills)
>Jeffrey_: EHIORTY J10 HER.Y +29 455
#note I saw YO(G)H but chickened out on it for some reason.  I certainly saw YEH/HEY/HOY N1 but I just didn't want to give her the corner.  It turns out I shouldn't have worried. -10
>Florence: EIRS C1 ..S +24 427
>Jeffrey_: IOT N10 TOI. +6 461
#note best, just under 95 points total loss, says champ
>Jeffrey_:  (EIR) +6 467
