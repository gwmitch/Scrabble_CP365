#note very close with JEW. is the J THAT bad. haha.

>Cesar: AEJNNTV 11H N.NJA +24 50
#note another unintuitive move for me. i like ninja much better because it doesn't give him an easy comeback, but does that mean i'm not playing aggressive again? JIVE just seems dumb, but how can it win by so much? guess the V blows. (-6)
>Carl: ?DEHIRY 12B HYdRIDE +81 126
>Cesar: AEFIMTV E8 FIVE. +22 72
#note will cesar ever pick the best move? stay tuned... but i'm not off by too much. FAVA makes sense, though, i  do agree here. (-1)
>Carl: UX 12L XU +36 162
>Cesar: AGHKMNT 5K M.NK +20 92
#note getting worried now... quackle likes taking it easy with 5I MAKO or going all out with F11 MINK. MONK is too nuts because i really need to draw well.. i think (-6)

#note gah

#note that seems like it's gonna work for carl..
>Cesar: DEIILOU 5C U.OILED +16 188
#note i don't think i have a choice. is C4 OILED really better? maybe it is after his fish two. (-1.5)
>Carl: AEINORT 3A AER.TION +68 293
#note this is also an interesting placement. carl likes keeping it volatile.

>Cesar: AEMPSTT 15H TEMPT +36 314
#note i thought so... i knew STAMP would sim best. is ZA just not a worry here? i'm not used to such volatile board.  15E TEAM is another good play. (-8)

#note guess i can start getting desperate

>Cesar: ABCGLOS --  -38 328
#note woulda been nice to have beclogs.. what's not nice is playing this dumb play. with B11 CHAD i have a surprising 7.63% chance to win. (-7.63) but carl isn't quackle, i don't see how i could ever win against a human opponent even with CHAD.
