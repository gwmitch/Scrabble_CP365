>moh: AANOOPS 8H APO +10 10
#note Quacker likes APO as much as anything. Surprisingly, exchanging [AOOP] or [AO] also sims well.
>jsp: ?ABEMOR 7H MOB +21 21
#note You deserve to be tsksked. EMBARgO, BROMAtE, and the more difficult jEROB(O)AM are findable. They're not gimmes, but I suspect you usually bingo in situations like this. Your MOB is the best non-bingo.
>moh: AENOSSY 9G OY +14 24
#note I was hoping for SOY(B)EANS for NOSE(G)AYS, but no such luck (I didn't see the (C)YANOSES possibility). I didn't mind fishing to AENSS, but Quackle prefers plays like 9F NOSEY, 9H YEA, and 9H YEAN.
>jsp: ?AAELRS 10D AERiALS +70 91
#note A ton of options (LAAgERS, ARAbLES, EARLApS, AREoLAS,...). Yours is among the better options.
>moh: AEENSSU K1 UNEASES +72 96
#note The only bingo.
>jsp: EEEIRUV 1H REV.E +27 118
#note I10 (L)IEVE sims well, but spidey Scrabble senses tell me it just has to be REV(U)E.
>moh: EGHOSXY 11C HEX +46 142
#note Best.
>jsp: EIIIKRU -IIIU +0 118
#note Best.
>moh: ACGOSUY 4H YUC.S +28 170
#note YUG(A)S in the same spot is an improvement. Another decent option is 4I GU(A)CO 16. All of the reasonable options are pretty close.
>jsp: CEFINOR 2C COINFER +68 186
#note That, or its obvious anagram, is best.
>moh: AEGHOTW 1D WHO +29 199
#note My play sims about even with the cool C2 (C)OWHAGE 36.
>jsp: FIIITUZ -FIIU +0 186
#note It's worth playing C2 (C)UIF 18 instead of exchanging.
>moh: AEEGGLT 5E AGLET +19 218
#note I'm not too thrilled about Quackle's suggestion of 3E TEAL. Keeping two Gs sounds like trouble to me. E1 (HI)GGLE is a decent option, too.
>jsp: IIKRTTZ 6B ZITI +35 221
#note Best.
>moh: AEEFGIN 7C FINE +25 243
#note 11H NAIF 28 is best. It wins 5% more often than my play.
>jsp: ?KNQRTT -KNQT +0 221
#note Quackle says to play either (WO)NK or (WO)RK at D1. With the blank, though, an exchange seems reasonable.
>moh: AEEGLNO 4B GOAL +14 257
#note 3D GEE 20 sims best.
>jsp: ?ORRTTU C11 .URT +14 235
#note Best.
>moh: EEEGLNN B12 NEE +14 271
#note Partial block, plus setting up a -G word to A12. Seems like it has to be right.
>jsp: ?ADORTV 3G AD +19 254
#note The V(EX)T spot you soon found was best here.
>moh: BDEGILN 15A ED +14 285
#note I wanted a play like A8 BEING, but somehow missed it! Ugh!
>jsp: ?NORTUV E9 V..T +14 268
#note It's close, but Quackle prefers just V(EX).
>moh: ABGILNT A7 BALING +39 324
#note Had you played Quackle's suggestion of VEX last play, I'd now be playing TABLING and ending this game! My BALING sims best, winning almost 90% of the time.
>jsp: ?INOPRU 12E .ROUPINg +70 338
#note The only bingo.
>moh: IJMQTTW 14A W.. +11 335
#note A nice game until this point. A ridiculous draw gives me zero chance of winning.
>jsp: DDIIKOR 9J DIRK +21 359
#note DIRK or DORK.
>moh: AIJMQTT H12 .T +2 337
#note I missed (R)AJ here.
>jsp: DIO F12 .ID +8 367
