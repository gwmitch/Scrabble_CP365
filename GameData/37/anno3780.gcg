#note A terrible miss of GEEZ. I need to get better at not missing such obvious stuff.
>Chris_Cree: JO I6 JO. +12 12
>Noah: EEEGLLN I6 ...GLE +17 43
#note Surprised about Quackle's clear pick of LE(Z). Sure, the NGLE combination is good, but it doesn't really do much on this board. I don't know what to make of LEZ. JOGGLE does give a lot of comeback.

#note Siming 7th out of a host of options. I know I need to close the board here, but I wasn't sure how to do it. Quackle says plays to the C and RUINER/INURE/URINE are best here. URANIC, which I thought of, but was unsure of, sims best. JURA is great at bingoing, but maybe gives away too much. I think I got a little too into bingoing sometimes in this game, and that made it a lot closer than it would've been.

>Noah: AEINORU K4 OU. +6 197
#note I figured this was a mistake, but decided that, since I had no clue what to do in this position, I would continue on with my strategy from last turn. REUNION/ANEURIN, which were strong considerations of mine,probably should've been played. I think this is a pretty terrible play.

>Noah: AAEINOR 9G AN.ORA. +23 220
#note Awful. AEONIAN looks way beter, as do things like NORIA.

#note Missing the obvious MY hook, which is not very good at all. Quackle doesn't hate this play, though, putting it similarly with FEM or FIRM. 
>Chris_Cree: ?EKNOST 11B KEySTON. +79 296
#note Wouldn't have happened if I had played FEM!

#note I think this was his exact rack. He considered this or AKEES, mostly. He liked the way this gave him options next turn, and it seems alright to me. Quackle likes TOEA, I guess to block.
