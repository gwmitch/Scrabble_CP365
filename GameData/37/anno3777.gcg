>Verbie: ?EFNOUZ H5 FUZE +32 32
#note D'oh.  UNFrOZE H7 106!
>Joey: ADEGLNS 9C SLANGED +81 81
>Verbie: ?AINORS 10H SOpRANI +79 111
#note I get a 50% equity rebate on my miss.
>Joey: CEELNST L7 CLE.NEST +72 153
#note I didn't look long enough to play through consonants.  LECTERNS K5 is 18 more.
>Verbie: AEEOOPY F6 PEO.Y +24 135
#note POESY 13I or POOFY 5E (-2)
>Joey: ?EPRTTT 8L .EPT +18 171
>Verbie: ADEIKOR 14H KERA.OID +80 215
>Joey: ?ILNRTT 15G LIT +29 200
#note The bingos don't score enough to leave this open.  Hopefully I get at least one vowel back.
>Verbie: AADIISY O12 DI.Y +33 248
#note I would have done DYADS had I seen it, but this is better by a couple.
>Joey: ?GINNRT 5H .RoNTING +72 272
>Verbie: AAEEISU -AAEIU +0 248
#note Better to play through with EAU 4L 14.  (-11)  But with so few small consonants unseen (DGLNRT-ish)  I feel compelled to race for them.
>Joey: AGHRTTV 13I VAT. +25 297
>Verbie: ACDEELS C3 DECLAS.E +74 322
#note CADELLES in the D line scores the same, is probably better on defense, and a weaker opponent might challenge.
>Joey: AGHMRVW E7 WH.M +29 326
#note Not terribly worried about the O hook, since even a worst case scenario like JO would give me a solid response.
>Verbie: AEFMOOW 11D WO +36 358
#note Curiously, when I told Noah Walton about this play, he hadn't known of WHAMO.  He does now.  I was originally going to do WOOF D1.  Should have stayed with it (-10)
>Joey: ABGRTVX 4B V.XT +28 354
>Verbie: AEEFMOU 12A FAME +36 394
#note Yeah, FUME (-4).  I saw the Q lurking in the unseen and maybe panicked a bit...
>Joey: ABGORRU 13B RUB +28 382
#note Close call here.  BOURG gets rid of the U too, which is important with two remaining.  ROB gives me a chance at QUART L1.
>Verbie: AEJOQRU L1 QUAR. +48 442
#note Now I wish I had that U back.  But even then I'd still be in a bind here.
>Joey: AGHIIOR E1 AIR.H +16 398
#note Not exactly sure what I was hoping to accomplish, other than him being unable to shut down every bingo lane, but the pool was pretty bad.  Might as well wave the white flag with HOURI 2J.
>Verbie: BEJNOOO 1D B.NJO +51 493
#note Another reason to opt for HOURI.
>Joey: AGIIIOU 1L .UAI +39 437
#note Amazingly I can keep the I (or G) for next turn and he can't do a thing about it.  Not enough to win, but still a fun one.
>Verbie: EEOO 7H .OO +13 506
#note DORE or DERE 3C (-1)
>Joey: GIIO G1 .IG +13 450
