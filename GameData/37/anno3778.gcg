>Pete: ?DHILMU 8D HUMID +30 30
#note I chickened on HUMIDLy.  I thought there was no way it could be good.  It is.  
>Brian_Bowman: ADGLOP 7G LAPDOG +20 20
>Pete: ?ILRSVW K5 VR.W +20 50
#note Easy best play.
>Brian_Bowman: ?EIPSTT M2 PiETIST +80 100
#note SPITTLE is better by two points, but I blanked on PIETIST.  Fortunately, I wasn't so stupid as to challenge.  I hate my brain sometimes.
>Pete: ?AEFILS E4 FISt.LAE +90 140
#note Slightly better than the other 2X2.  The 9 would have been sweet.
>Brian_Bowman: BDILN F10 BLIND +30 130
>Pete: IMNNUUY D11 MINNY +33 173
#note MUNI is clear best, but when I play someone as strog as Bowman, I feel pressure to keep scoring and not open triple lines willy-nilly.  still a major error to keep the two U's
>Brian_Bowman: AQT 6B QAT. +33 163
>Pete: EEIOSUU B6 .UEUE +16 189
#note Either this or a big exchange.  I didn't like opening the line, but the sheer mass of vowels (and 2 Us) actually rendered it less dangerous than otherwise.  Wins sim by a decent margin over exchanging to ES.
>Brian_Bowman: COR 15A COR. +27 190
>Pete: BIKOOSY D1 KOBO +40 229
#note I miss the better placement at L1 that scores 1 more point and is more defensive.
>Brian_Bowman: CIR 1A RIC. +30 220
>Pete: AADEISY L4 YA +26 255
#note Duck likes burning the E for 3 more with AYE by a hair... I get way too protective of Es... especially with a bunch available.
>Brian_Bowman: IX C12 XI +31 251
>Pete: ADEIOSU -IOU +0 255
#note I miss the nine here with ABOIDEAUS.  My exchange is idiotic.
>Brian_Bowman: AAN A8 ANA +19 270
>Pete: AADEESW 8M .AW +18 273
#note Duck likes WEEPS.  I feel like Brian's close to bigoing, and I don't want to burn my S or close a line.
>Brian_Bowman: E 6J E. +9 279
#note Yeah, he's close.
>Pete: ADEEJLS 2J JEE.S +60 333
#note can't pass up the points now.  
>Brian_Bowman: AEENRST N8 .RSENATE +70 349
#note NEARLIEST G3 would have been unreal, though ARSENATE does sim better.  
>Pete: ADEEGLO O12 EGAD +38 371
#note best.  the only option I considered. I wanted to take bingoes out of play... so I think. 
>Brian_Bowman: FHO M11 FOH +40 389
>Pete: ELOORTZ B13 ZO. +36 407
#note RETOOLED for 30 is actually the biggest winner.  ZOO is next.  I did note the spot along the bottom row... 
>Brian_Bowman: GINORTV 3G VIGOR +26 415
>Pete: ELORTTU 15G ROULETT.. +83 490
#note And this is my only win.  As Bowman was deciding on the prior play, I was rearranging my tiles, and saw that I was an E short of ROULETTE.  Thankfully, I remembered the hook, and saw the spot.  It survived the obligatory challenge, and I pull a miracle out of my a$$ against a far better player.
