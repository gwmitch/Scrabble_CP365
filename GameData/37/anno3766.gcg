>Noah_Walton: ADGKNRT E4 KART.D +25 89
#note Noah: I was pretty sure I missed KARTED or KARTING before. Turns out it was KARTING, which is a sport, and thus takes an S. But KARTED is not good.       Conrad: I was fairly inclined to thinking it was phoney, but given my rack I didnt really want to risk it. Maybe in a different situation (note to self, your instinct is USUALLY FUCKING RIGHT. so LISTEN TO IT!!!!)

>Noah_Walton: EORSSTU M3 STOURES +75 232
>dacrON: AAAIMRZ K4 MIRZA +37 252
#note Conrad: oh right that spot...oops     Noah: We concentrated on that spot the entire time, except for this turn I guess. ZARIBA is pretty cool.
>Noah_Walton: EFGGINX 14A FIX +43 275
>dacrON: ?AAENNT 15A AN +26 278
#note  Conrad: obviously I saw the bingos. I wasn't expecting to get big-nowed on the next turn. I figured I would be the one doing the nowing with my leave of AENT? The bingoes are lame here.

#note Conrad: idk REALIA, but I have both of the As, so yeah...I don't see a major best play here, I'm in a hole no matter what I play...
>Noah_Walton: DEEILSU 4K .U.E +12 392
#note Noah: I was happy about this play.
>dacrON: AEILOTW A5 WEAL +37 425
#note Conrad: I'm fucked. lol.
>Noah_Walton: CDEILLS O4 SLICED +38 430
#note Noah: HUGE NOW! I thought about fishing, briefly, but only fishing off the C. Playing COX bingos with 7/9 of the pool. However, with a fish, Conrad is almost certain to block said bingos. Conrad: (Sees the play) DAMNIT!

>Noah_Walton:  (I) +2 454
#note Noah: Well, I played everything perfectly until SLICED, but SLICED was a big, big now, soooo. Oh well, I really enjoyed this game anyways.      Conrad: mine mine mine, blanks blanks blanks. I blame Cesar for me missing MARIA - MARIA DOESNT EXIST! SHE IS MANJEETA!
