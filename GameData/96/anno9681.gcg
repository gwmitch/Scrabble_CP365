>Danny: AEILNRT 8C RELIANT +66 66
>James: ABBLLTY F7 B.LBY +18 18
#note I think I was going for a leave.  but regardless, a 16 point difference is a bit much to take. 
>Danny: CDDEIIN -CDDEII +0 66
>James: ?AEELOT C6 AE.OLiTE +68 86
#note I think CORELATE C7 is better - it doesn't leave any easy parallel playbacks as opposed to AREOLATE or AEROLITE, but I could only see AEROLITE. The games started too early. 
>Danny: AENRSUV I4 VAUN.ERS +63 129
>James: ACEMRUV B2 CREAM +40 126
#note I just wanted to take the easy scoring spot, but UV is such a bad leave. Quackle favors MAUVE E11 to get a better leave and points, or MAUVE 5H to be more defensive. That being said, MAUVE E11 is far favored, then VUM B4 (which figures). 
>Danny: AIOPT A5 PATIO +30 159
>James: EFIRUVW 5H W.IVER +24 150
#note In a game like this, I prefer to play open, because I am down and because I think my word knowledge will help. Quackle likes SWIVE 11I or VIEWY 11B; both work, because it's not like mine leaves much better of a leave. 
>Danny: JW L4 J.W +26 185
>James: AFFNPUY B11 PUFFY +42 192
#note I played this too fast and didn't think about PUFF, which I may have played thinking about it since it gives me a decent chance on the next turn. Quackle does favor PUFFY though. 
>Danny: EH D12 EH +25 210
>James: ?ADLNTU H11 ADULT +26 218
#note Best. 
>Danny: OX G12 OX +37 247
>James: ?ADENNO E1 NONiDEA. +70 288
#note I prefer this over LENTANDO 14H because the N at that position isn't as dangerous to me as the O otherwise. Also, it blocks up SCREAM at B1. Quackle seems to agree with me. 
>Danny: EHS F2 HES +30 277
#note Strong inference that another S is left on Danny's rack on this turn, given the play. 
>James: IINOQUZ D4 QI +47 335
#note Best. 
>Danny: AEGIIOS -AEG +0 277
>James: DIKNOUZ J11 KIND +20 355
#note I was ust in the mood to start blocking the board, while saving up for OYEZ 15A. Quackle likes KUDO J11, which is a better leave overall. 
>Danny: CEOORST N5 SCOOTER +80 357
>James: GIMORUZ 8L ZO.M +75 430
#note Well, my try didn't work completely but I'm not complaining. 
>Danny: DEEIIOS -  +0 357
#note Danny played a phony but I forget what. 
>James: AGGIIRU 14A I. +5 435
#note I know it didn't include a T. As such, I decided to go for a fish to see if I could get ZIGGURAT L8. 
>Danny: EI 3A I.E +6 363
>James: ADGGIRU 14J .RUID +14 449
#note Hm. Maybe I should've fished more. 
>Danny: AEGINOT 11H ...OI +18 381
