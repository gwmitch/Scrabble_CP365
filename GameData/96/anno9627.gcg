#note Apparently ADEI is better than IP? I like this anyway because it is opener.

>Noah: DEIIMPR K7 .IMPIER +24 173
#note I liked this play, because it was open against a less open player. Unfortunately, I didn't think of the D(WELT) hook, which might make IMP a better play than I thought. Still, I liked this play. I like GIMPED even better, but I was unsure of that, unfortunately.

#note Lester's rack. He had a tough time deciding between this and HEIR, and regretted this with hindsight. Seems a fine play, though.

#note I wondered what the right decision was here. This seemed good, scoring well and keeping something for scoring. He will likely be able to go out in two after this, but I couldn't find anything that would give reliable out-in-ones. Quackle suggests KY(E), YO(M), and (QUOIT)ED, which might be alright, though I'm not sure, this seems fine to me.
>Lester: AEFIPRR C12 FRAP +29 363
#note Best is PAR(L)E, a cute setup that gives two nice spots for his remaining tiles.

#note Missed ES(P)Y.
