#note This seemed like a good start to blocking the board. I don't know if it is better to go down with STELeNE. Even though the E is better to end with, I think STELeNE makes it less easy for him to set up simple S hooks.

#note Maybe SAW? I guess it begins a staircase that could close the board, but I'm not sure how easy that will be to maintain.

#note First of all, no insane stuff like VIOLONE. But more seriously, I played this because it seemed to set up a good scoring spot. Another idea I didn't see was EOLIAN in either spot. I like it at N10, as I will still withstand E bingos, especially since I probably get a good score if he does play to the E. But EO is much more unbalanced than O, so EOLIAN is better.
