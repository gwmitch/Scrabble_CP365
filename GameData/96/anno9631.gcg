>Matthew_Larocque: EEHIPPV 8H VEEP +18 18
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 2, Game 2. Q likes the 8G placement, or playing HIVE at 8G. I guess I liked HIP better than EPP as a leave.
>Ruth_Hamilton: FOU K8 .OUF +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: ADHIOPU L10 PAID +23 41
#note I know I saw APHID on my rack, why didn't I play it for 31? Q also likes AUDIO L11, but that's only 19 points to open up the TWS.
>Ruth_Hamilton: IIM 13J MI.I +14 32
>Matthew_Larocque: DHNNOTU J8 .DH +34 75
#note I was hoping I'd draw another D!
>Ruth_Hamilton: ASUV N10 VAUS +23 55
#note Bit early to screw this board up isn't it?
>Matthew_Larocque: NNOTTTU 12G UNTO +9 84
#note Nice rack. I was torn on this one. Out of the scoring options this does best, but exchanges take the top 3 sim spots.
>Ruth_Hamilton: ABESU L4 BEAUS +27 82
#note "Us and esses huh?"
>Matthew_Larocque: DINRSTT 5K T.D +8 92
#note TRID(E)NTS or STRID(E)NT are obviously the plays here....I should have looked for that instead of settling on this fishing play so quickly.
>Ruth_Hamilton: EGHIW 13C WEIGH +41 123
>Matthew_Larocque: EINRRST D7 TERRIN.S +68 160
#note Q likes REINT(E)RS, but that's just asking for a JAW(S) or ZEK(S) to come down.  Or a 3x3.
>Ruth_Hamilton: EITX E5 EXIT +26 149
>Matthew_Larocque: AALOORW B12 WAR +25 185
#note I was debating whether to leave this spot and try to get a better play, but ended up just taking it out now. RAW defends the bottom, but makes it easier to bingo cause it can end in E. Q likes WOA(D). I can't let her get something like ZETAS/A(WEIGH) though.
>Ruth_Hamilton: EFM 15A FEM +31 180
>Matthew_Larocque: AJLLOOR 10B JA.L +27 212
>Ruth_Hamilton: BDILN D1 BLIND +25 205
>Matthew_Larocque: AILOORT F1 OORALI +25 237
#note This worked out pretty good!
>Ruth_Hamilton: GLNO 1C O.L.NG +27 232
>Matthew_Larocque: EGKOOQT M2 GOO. +16 253
#note Have to take out the TED S hook. GO(D)ET scores 25, didn't know it.
>Ruth_Hamilton: ACY 2K CA.Y +20 252
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEKQTZ 3C Q. +22 275
>Ruth_Hamilton: EY C8 YE. +16 268
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEKSTZ A11 ZA +18 293
#note I was too eager to get rid of the Z here. TASK F8 is really nice and I don't have to worry about getting Z stuck. Then again I didn't even see (G)EEZ so who knows....
>Ruth_Hamilton: CI 5I CI... +8 276
>Matthew_Larocque: EEKORST G4 REST +22 315
#note "I needed to do something like that!"
>Ruth_Hamilton: ??AEENT H1 .ENT +10 286
>Matthew_Larocque: EKNOR J4 K.R +9 324
#note E(BO)OK. (C)OK(E). Or even KE(I)R.... :/
>Ruth_Hamilton: ??AE 14H EAst +7 293
#note OMG double blanked! 
>Ruth_Hamilton:  (ENO) +6 299
#note Where's the prize for lowest win? I earned something here!
