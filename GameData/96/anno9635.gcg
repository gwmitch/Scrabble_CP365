#note I don't know HOW I missed YAHOO for 51.  That M blank was really giving me trouble, and I kept trying to hit the sweet spot with the Y, not realizing it may not be necessary.
>Ryan_Fischer: AHOOTVY D4 ATO.Y +28 56
#note I don't know HOW I missed YAHOO for 51.  So fixated on hitting the sweet spot with the Y, not realizing it may not be necessary.

#note C1 POILU 18?  Note: this pluralizes to -S or -ES.
>John_Luebkemann: DENNOPR N10 DONNER +31 153
#note I KNEW DONNER was bogus, but it's so hard to challenge Looby.  Almost as scary as challenging Gibson, and he's only ever played one phony on me.  I held, but couldn't quite challenge.  I "knew" it was bogus 'cause I'd tried to play it before, somewhere, and either had it challenged off, got away with it, or had someone play it on me as a bingo and let it go and learned the hard way.  Maybe on ISC or something.  I pointed out PERNOD as an option here.  DONNE would have been fine for his purposes here, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEORT E9 OCREATE +70 160
#note From closed to wide open in two turns!  CAROTE(N)E is safer, but boring, and I need volatiliy VS John even though he loves it too.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEIQTT 13H EQuITA.T +102 262
#note What fortune.  Now watch me blow it in spectacular fashion.
>John_Luebkemann: AFL 15L FA.L +33 219
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEISUY D12 YAU. +32 294
#note All I have to do is play something on column O and he's pretty much sunk.  But instead I take the equity play Static picks, being incredibly greedy, and pay for it.  Oh boy, do I pay.  The funny thing is, Champ says my play is 90% to win, ADIEUS is 87%, and YAUDS, what I thought I should have played, is 85%.  I still think this was a big mistake.
>John_Luebkemann: AELNOST O4 TOLANES +78 297
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGIOSV J10 VOG.ED +20 314
#note Especially 'cause I didn't even hit, and blocked a couple lanes in the process.  E1 VIDEO 24, maybe?  Nah, too volatile.
>John_Luebkemann: DEEIMNR 4A REM.INED +64 361
#note :(
>Ryan_Fischer: EILRSXZ H12 Z.R. +23 337
#note Thought about setting up IL(E)X -> SILEX, but figured he's got an S too, and I'd need a bingo starting in S with a Z, which is a miracle.  So, figured I'd dump the X and hope to get a big X play along row 3, or under on row 5, as luck would have it.  F2 ZI(N) is nicer than I thought it would be, 24% says Champ.  G3 L(E)X is even better than my ILEX idea, even though there are a lot of Is unseen.  That's odd, and I think it's noise, 'cause he'd definitely cash.  My play is, at least, 3rd.
>John_Luebkemann: IKS H1 SKI. +27 388
#note Definitely gutsy of him.  He must know something I don't.
>Ryan_Fischer: EHIILSX 5A EXI.S +43 380
#note Wow, this is brilliant: It still loses, but playing H(I)LI first sets up (K)EX for a crapload and prevents his coming brilliant play.  I still get EXI(T)S down low if he plays BICES to block or something.  He doesn't NEED to block, though, says Champ.
>John_Luebkemann: ABCEIOS L1 BOSCA.E +45 433
#note Brilliant.
>Ryan_Fischer: HIL 3G H.LI +21 401
#note Fun game, but just one dumb mistake is all it takes.
