#note What would you do here? Of course, there is a good assortment of plays with strong bingo leaves, but maybe that's not what we want to go for here? THEOR(B)O is an interesting option, for example. And should I play this, or maybe OH(M) or OH?

#note CAY and DECAY are also good plays.

#note I also considered T(W)INY, but liked the points here.

#note CCDEIILO looked familiar, but I do not know CLEIDOIC. Ah well. In the nonbingo department, this seems alright, but I didn't think to play OLEIC or AUXINIC to try to block the dangerous AUXIN hook. It seems like she has some good tiles, at this point. Maybe I'm wrong, though.

#note Downright silly. I unfortunately missed the spot for SEEP L12, trying to play quickly. I was low on time at this point :/.

>Noah: EEPRSST J14 PE +23 326
#note Something keeping two vowels, like DEEP, may be better.

>Noah: DEPRRSS N11 REPR. +14 360
#note I wanted to go out as fast as possible. Quackle says this always wins, but suggests D(IT), SPR(IT), or PR(O), which seem quite reasonable.
