>James: DEEEHIL 8D HEILED +28 28
#note Best. 
>Jerry: FGKMOPR 7C FORK +28 28
>James: BCEHLRX E6 B..ECH +26 54
#note Best - scores well and is nicely defensive too. 
>Jerry: AEEGMPQ -EGQ +0 28
#note Simming shows my exchange was unnecessary. PEG or MEG at 7H worth 15 points was 7 - 9 points better than trading.
>James: ?BDILRX 6B XI +30 84
#note Best. 
>Jerry: AEMNPRS H2 PRENAM.S +63 91
#note I chose the PRENAMES that didn't expose the S. The simulator advises that the better choice was either SPEARMEN at H6 or PRENAMES at H6. It turns out that opening the S would have helped me next turn.
>James: ?BDGLRS 4C BLuDG.RS +72 156
#note Best.
>Jerry: AEGINTU -  +0 91
#note Lost a turn challenging this. (I haven't read Harry Potter!)
>James: ?AALOOQ -ALOOQ +0 156
#note Wasn't too sure what to exchange - exchanging AOOQ may have been a better idea though, considering that I just played 6 consonants (so I can hold an okay one this time). As it is, Quackle likes exchanging AOQ and AOOQ most. 
>Jerry: AEGINTU -U +0 91
#note Major inference of a bingo coming up. 
>James: ?AAIORT I7 A.O +14 170
#note Missed rADIATOR I6. I can't really believe I did. And I chickened out on ATROPhIA 2D. Beyond that, ADO is fairly okay given the leave. 
>Jerry: AEGINST 11E .EATINGS +74 165
#note This phony could have set me down for 3 straight zeroes! If it's allowed to stay on the board, though, my winning chances were 35% versus 30% for the real bingos GAHNITES, SEATING and TEASING
>James: ?AAINRT 2B ANTIRA.e +72 242
#note Top scoring, but not the top for defense. That would go to  cANTRAIP. An interesting alternative is AN 5D, which I completely missed! AN actually wins the most according to Quackle, probably because I hold the blank and the probability of other bingos after my second is fairly low. 
>Jerry: IILNOOU 3C OI +17 182
#note After Hhis bingo and the disappearance of the last blank, my winning chances drop to about 20%.
I Wish I'd had the nerve to play NOO(N) and UNBREECH. I saw it - and it turns out to simulate best. Instead, I settled for 17 points - the best choice that doesn't involve UNBREECH.
>James: AENORTU 1I OUTEARN +75 317
#note Best. 
>Jerry: ILNOUVY 10D I.Y +29 211
>James: DOQTUWZ 6H .DZ +39 356
#note I liked this play best - it scores well, leaves me a QU combo that I can hopefully use at L8 down (QUEST?), and doesn't open up anything new. 
>Jerry: LNNOOUV -LNOOUV +0 211
#note NOON or NO leaves me 0.4% winning chances...but that presumes that I know UNBREECH well enough to risk it. I did not. Instead I trade 6 of these lovely tiles...which sims a bit less than VULGO - the best non 'unbreech' play.
>James: MOQTUVW L8 VOW. +14 370
#note I liked this play the most. Almost all plays are close to guaranteeing a win but this really hepls to cut down on some of the potential bingo lanes for Jerry. It also keeps the useful QU combo. 
>Jerry: AEEFINT M9 FE +23 234
>James: ALMOQTU N4 LOQUAT +41 411
#note Best. 
>Jerry: AEEINOT H11 .ENIA +18 252
>James: DEILMPS 15B MISPLE.D +64 475
#note Missed IMPLEADS 15C.
