#note Missed GARPIKE 8G for 4 more. 
>Mike: AANNOOR -AANN +0 0
>James: DEEGQTX 9C DEX +26 108
#note I liked this. If I drew an A I could get QAT. I also had QI H7 in case as well. Quackle was torn between DEX, QAT E7, exch GQ, GED 9C, and TAXED E7. 
>Mike: AERY 7C YARE +28 28
>James: AEGNQTZ 6B QAT +43 151
#note Best. 
>Mike: CELY F4 CEL..Y +28 56
>James: BEEGMNZ 5E M.ZE +30 181
#note Chickened out of MEZE 5C. I keep screwing up - I knwo ECOLE is no good but I keep thinking ETAPE isn't either. Now I should hpoefully remember this. 
>Mike: CNTT H7 T.NCT +7 63
>James: BEEGINO H1 BEIG. +30 211
#note BOGIE 4H is a nicer play... 1 less but EN is a better leave, especially since no O has been played. 
>Mike: NOS I3 NOS +26 89
>James: EHLNOOO J2 ONO +12 223
#note I like ONO because it starts to block up places a little (the B, PARKINGS). Quackle likes HOOT 11Eor COHO 10H but I think NOS also infers an S is out, which I am reacting somewhat against. My goal is just to win games anyway. 
>Mike: AEHLNRS 11F EN.HRALS +72 161
>James: EHIILOO 10H .OOL +19 242
#note Bad miss - HOOLIE L8 is a better, more balanced leave, which also scores better. 
>Mike: IJMS M9 JI.MS +44 205
>James: EEHIIOS 12C HOISE +20 262
#note I'm trying to block the board up... though LEI L11 is far better, and I can see why. 
>Mike: AEGINNT 2A ANTIGEN. +72 277
#note Rats. 
>James: BEFFIIU 1A FIE +37 299
#note I like FIE more than my other plays because my F works well at D1. Quackle likes BIFF 13B most, because it scores well, but it also lets Mike play at the triple first. 
>Mike: ADIOU N5 AUDIO +17 294
#note I couldn't really figure out how to work against this. 
>James: BDFIRUV O9 BURD +21 320
#note What to do here? Mike having DEW O8 on its own is bad, but him having that would let him play it elsewhere (13B, etc). Quackle likes BIRD 13B, probably because of the points, but I think my play isn't too horrible. 
>Mike: AEILT O1 TELIA +20 314
>James: ADEFIVW D1 F.VE +42 362
#note Well, time to use this again. Having the W isn't a bad tile now, because of WAW 13B or WAW 13G if necessary. 
>Mike: ?AORRUV 1M OU. +3 317
>James: ADIPRWW 2L WIP. +28 390
>Mike: ?AERTUV 13B VARs +25 342
>James: ADRW 13G WARD +23 413
#note When you get lucky, you don't need to play well in order to win. 
>James:  (ETU) +6 419
