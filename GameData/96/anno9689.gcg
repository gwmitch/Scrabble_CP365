>James: ?DIIPUV 8G VID +14 14
#note I couldn't decide if VID was worth playing or if I should exchange and hold DI? or IP?. In the end, I picked the points. Quackle agrees, albeit slightly, indicating that I wasn't far off. 
>Maddy: AFIT F6 FIAT +23 23
>James: ?ILLPRU E8 PULL +25 39
#note I missed PILULaR E8/7H. Morning games are always hard. PURL and PULL trail markedly behind. 
>Maddy: CEGKO E2 GECKO +29 52
>James: ?IIIJRT -IIJ +0 39
#note Holding onto IRT? works, because of the inherent synergy or TRI-. 
>Maddy: NTW 3D W.NT +8 60
>James: ?AIIMRT 4G AIRTIMe +70 109
#note Best - points and decent position. 
>Maddy: AOT 3K TAO +14 74
>James: CEGIJLL 10B JIL. +27 136
#note JIG 2M is a really nice play, truth be known. It's hard to use the G for anything high-scoring, period, and there aren't anymore Ls aside from the ones I have. Quackle likes JIG most. 
>Maddy: AINNZ C9 Z.NNIA +50 124
>James: CEGILOS 2B CLO. +19 155
#note Missed COSIE 15A as well. That was definitely the stand-out. COSEC 4A, or even OGAM L1 make good sence for leaves. CLOG 2B was half-borne out of being not sure what to do. 
>Maddy: DVY 14B D.VY +22 146
>James: BEGIORS 12A BO.G +20 175
#note Best. 
>Maddy: AEEG 15E AGEE +20 166
>James: EEEIORS 5J OE +12 187
#note There's a lot of decent spots to bingo at this point and I have a decent leave so why not? SSS? is still unseen, indicating there's a high probability I'll see Maddy play a bingo. 
>Maddy: HOS 15A HOS +37 203
>James: DEEINRS 14H RESINED +72 259
#note Quackle and I both like RESINED over the other bingos. The reasons are fairly simple - no easy scoring to the triple word using 15L, and the S isn't stuck out for easy counterplays. 
>Maddy: BERTU 13K TUBER +29 232
>James: AEENOUY 6I OY +27 286
#note ECLOGUE 2A is a really cute play but I didn't see that. OY scores well and favors me, though AY was also worth considering because three As were unseen as opposed to one O. Quackle likes NAY and ANY 6H as well, though I thought having the consonant was useful in my case. 
>Maddy: EFIMR O8 FIRME. +36 268
>James: AEENRUU K10 AUN..E +12 298
#note I really wasn't sure what to do here. Nothing was great from my perspective. AUNTIE was picked to block up some bingos and to give me a U to play against the Q later. That's why I favored it over AURUM 11K. 

Quackle likes UREA N6 (also blocks up spots) but also favors AUNTIE most. I'm surprised personally. 
>Maddy: AWX J9 WAX +28 296
>James: EEOPRSU 4C PE. +26 324
#note PEC was to help set up a possible SUQ B4 to give me a good lead in the future. Of course, I have a SUQ play at N4, and one that is never going to be touched if I play PEERED N9. Given that, it sounds like a good play to me, though it gives more volatility for an SC- bingo at B1. 

Quackle much favors PEERED, and I can see why now. 
>Maddy: ?DEHIRT 15N HE +22 318
#note Missing EH 1C is probably not a big problem but it's something she should've taken into account. 
>James: EORRSSU 7I USERS +19 343
#note SOUR apparently wins more than USERS but I'm not 100% sure. I just took USERS to score more and gamble against the Q. 
>Maddy: ?ADINQT 13F QAID +25 343
>James: ?OR M11 RO..s +11 354
>James:  (ANT) +6 360
