#note Best. 
>Roy: UX 7C XU +19 41
>James: AEEEILO 6F .EALIE +10 84
#note I missed OLEIC G4. Otherwise, I would've picked that over MEALIE. 
>Roy: ADMNORS L6 RODSMAN +83 124
>James: ?EEJOOS 8L .OJO +36 120
#note Best. 
>Roy: AEHVY K11 HEAVY +40 164
>James: BEE 9C BEE. +16 136
#note I missed FEEBLEST and BEETLERS 4B, BEERIEST/BEEFIEST J2 and TEREBENES 12F. This was a bad play by far. Quackle likes TEE 6A first (among the non-bingo plays), which makes sense, because it gives me the best chance at a 3-3.
>Roy: LRU 15H RUL. +21 185
>James: ?EFKRST J2 FoRK.EST +72 208
#note I missed FARTLEKS 4B for 16 more! It's definitely a better play. 
>Roy: ADEINNR 14B NARDINE +72 257
>James: DIORUUZ 15A OUD +17 225
#note I have no clue how I missed ZOOID. Sigh, I really missed a lot this game. 
>Roy: DEFOW 3I W.OFED +32 289
>James: IIIPRUZ 2M PIU +20 245
#note I missed VIZIR 14K, thinking I was about dead. PIU I thought was decently defensive, at least. 
>Roy: IQ 13F QI +26 315
>James: EHIIRVZ 10B HI +17 262
#note Time to get desperate, I think
>Roy: AGNOT A7 TANGO +25 340
>James: AAEIRVZ 6B ZA +40 302
#note Best. I was hoping that maybe he'd miss me drawing for a certain spot. 
>Roy: LOT O7 L.OT +4 344
#note Roy was very distracted by the last potential bingo lane...
>James: AAEEIRV 4H VE.IER +48 350
#note And missed this. It's hard to figure out what he should've done but it sounds like he had the letters for LORN 1L, which I'd take in a heartbeat since a bingo isn't fatal to him most of the time. 
>Roy: IINT N10 INTI +10 354
>James: AAEGSSY 14J A.GAS +36 386
#note Lucking out at the end to win... sometimes if you don't play the game right, so long as you show up at the right time you'll win. 
>Roy: BNORT B2 BORT. +32 386
