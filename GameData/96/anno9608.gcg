#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird, 1 Game 1. I'm uploading these games for you Norma!

Anyways, lots of vowels to chuck here. I have the blank on my opening rack though yay!
>Ruth_Hamilton: EEFM 8E FEME +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEHINR 7B sHRINED +80 80
#note I always relish the chance to make a neat overlap, and this is pretty defensive to boot. I missed (E)NRiCHED for 83 though. There's also (E)pHEDRIN for 89! This sims just behind those 2.
>Ruth_Hamilton: JNTUU B3 UNJU.T +14 32
#note Good dump...
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEOTUZ A8 AZO +42 122
#note Oops, of course I know AZOTE. Not a massive error but it's probably right to grab 9 more points.
>Ruth_Hamilton: BEI 5B .IBE +26 58
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEIOTU 9H ETUI +9 131
#note Well, this was pretty hard. I didn't want to play it at B10, too easy for her to take the TWS. But, Quackle still likes it better by a small amount. CU(B)E(R) was the highest scoring play here and takes the crown in the sim.
>Ruth_Hamilton: CDEOR B10 DECOR +31 89
#note At least she didn't have the X or a five with one of the 4 pointers!
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEIMOX A1 COX +45 176
#note Ouch, OXIME for 68 - that's a pretty bad miss. I did see MOXIE for 49 too at 8K just as I'm entering this game into Quackle - missed it totally in the tournament.
>Ruth_Hamilton: AILMRST L7 MISTRAL +75 164
#note She had MISTR(I)AL for 90! That might have swung the game in a different direction. RAMTILS also overlaps under DEE, that's stylish too.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEGIRV 13B .VERBIG +28 204
#note Haha. I missed a bingo here - the definition is "an excess of words". Unfortunately I don't have enough excess words to nail some of these trickier bingos :/ Anyways, this does good in the sim but my win chances are understandably a lot lower than VERBI(A)GE. Also, I wrote down 28 but mistakenly added 38 to my score :S She never said anything about it.
>Ruth_Hamilton: EGY H12 E.GY +30 194
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEENOU M12 EAU +12 216
#note Argh. I forgot about AENEOUS. Which is like a combination of AEONIAN and AQUEOUS. Confusing words with similar spellings. And EUpNOEA. Really blanking out on these vowel bingos. I should have saw those pretty fast.
>Ruth_Hamilton: OW K11 OW +20 214
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEHLNO M2 ENHALOs +76 292
#note I saw this pretty much immediately - I tried to find other stuff but I didn't know CHALONE or ANETHOL. Other words here include MANHOLE and HALOGEN. 89 points from the C for (C)HALONEs.
>Ruth_Hamilton: DDEFIN 2H DEFIN.D +40 254
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEKPST 1G KEP +40 332
#note I didn't know KAPA with just one P. I saw APEAK but not the placing for 44 points - too focused on that TWS. I would have played KAPA here for sure if I knew it.
>Ruth_Hamilton: QS 14L S.Q +34 288
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAORST L1 A.OA +22 354
#note I thought this was a good vowel dump - however, there's an even better spot to dump AOA for 34 points! 
>Ruth_Hamilton: IPSW O12 WISP +52 340
#note ouchers
>Matthew_Larocque: AIORSTY 12D YO +22 376
#note Time to go fishing.... for a bingo that won't play anywhere! Even so, playing off YO here seems like a no brainer.
>Ruth_Hamilton: LV J8 L.V +14 354
>Matthew_Larocque: AAILRST 11E TAIL +24 400
#note Right, LATRIAS. I always forget that anagram of LARIATS. I seemed to get a lot of "cute" plays in my games with Ruth so they kind of stood out in that way. This play takes the cake pretty handily in the sim - even over that neat A(N)TA spot.
>Ruth_Hamilton: AINNOTT 4D ANOINT +24 378
>Matthew_Larocque: AGRRS J4 SAG +15 415
#note My time was almost out (shocking); I knew there was better plays. But, SKEP is a new one to remember!
>Ruth_Hamilton: T 12J T... +7 385
