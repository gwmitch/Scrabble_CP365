>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?EENSVY 8F SEVENtY +82 82
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 1, Game 2. Siri tells me that I shouldn't beat my host. I tell him he had his chances to beat me in the practice games last night!
>Matthew_Larocque: BCFGIIO 9D COIF +24 24
#note Quackle likes it on top slightly better.... I figured he would conveniently have the Q for Q(IS) if I did that haha.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BEU D9 .UBE +16 98
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDGINS 13B SABING +33 57
#note SABING is actually a phony, SABEING is the only way to spell it. This play is kind of bad... I saw B(E)ADINGS but wasn't sure at all. I missed D(E)BASING altogether. I can also score 36 with these letters through the blank T. I admit I should have kept the S here and just played DAB or something.... thankfully I drew another S though.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IJN B10 JIN. +27 125
>Matthew_Larocque: DHNORRS I7 H.RD +13 70
#note HORN(Y) is more points, but I need some S hooks to get back in the game.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AIIL 11D .IALI +14 139
>Matthew_Larocque: ENORSTX 11A X. +9 79
#note Eh... OX/OY or OX/YO are probably better than this dump. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AEKP L4 PEAK. +28 167
>Matthew_Larocque: EMNORST 6C MENTORS +70 149
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ENOTY 12H TONEY +21 188
>Matthew_Larocque: ACGILWZ 11K WAG +29 178
#note Hmm... LAWI(N)G keeping the C for next turn... never sure if set-ups like that are worth it.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ADERT 13I RATED +31 219
>Matthew_Larocque: CHILNVZ D4 CH.Z +36 214
#note The other spot for this sims a tiny bit better...
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AELPR M2 PEARL +22 241
>Matthew_Larocque: AAILNOV 5C O.IA +24 238
#note Tight race, several good plays here. A(N)A scores the most, but there's only 1 A left unseen so I chose to keep one.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DOQU 4F QUOD +27 268
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILNRV N1 VIRL +29 267
#note I took a while on this turn. I'm starting to close in so I just need to keep hammering good scores. I saw this and didn't hesitate. Quackle likes VIN(O) for 21.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EEW O4 EWE +14 282
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILMNS 14H LAM +25 292
#note Strange that I didn't recognize MALINES as a bingo.... not even a slight inkling, I should know that one for sure! There's kind of a hidden bingo line here that I didn't see right away (and Siri likely didn't see it either). MALINES plays there. My play was admittedly stupid, but it scored and I wasn't seeing much of anything else.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DORT 15F TROD +26 308
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEINOS I3 I. +4 296
#note Again, I wouldn't catch the spot to bingo until after this - which would end up being the crucial find to nab victory.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: T 3H T. +4 312
#note Siri blocks, and the other spot dawns on me.....
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEINOS N6 AtONIES +74 370
#note "Nice letters, but nice play!" I missed it the first couple times, but eventually stumbled into victory.... I'll take it!
