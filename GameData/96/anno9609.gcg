>Noah: ?AAEELS J5 A.E +8 189
#note Spent too much time looking for a bingo here, and then I had to rush when looking for other plays. Both spots for A(N)SAE are pretty appetizing.

>Noah: ?AAELSU E1 ASExUAL +69 258
#note I saw cAESU(R)AL, but not soon enough. This was hurried, since my time was low.

#note I also considered REAL, keeping the valuable O tile, but I thought this was more defensive. I didn't see VIVIDER, but I think I still like this.
