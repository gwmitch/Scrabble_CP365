>James: EGRRRSU 8H URGER +14 14
#note I think this is better than exchanging GRRU. 14 points and ERS held isn't too much better than RS at this point. 

Quackle agrees though it likes exchanging R as well. I didn't think EGRRSU had so many potential bingos but I guess it must. 

Elizabeth held URGER for some time. 
>Elizabeth: AJ J6 JA. +27 27
>James: ?DNNRSU 7F DUN +7 21
#note Missed UNROUNDS H8. Without the bingos, the rack is hard to really take much from, though JUN seems to be a good next choice that won't use up the S. 
>Elizabeth: ABO K4 ABO +19 46
>James: ?ENRSSU M2 iNSURES +71 92
#note UNDRESS or RUNLESS M3 both are a little better, for the 2 points. 
>Elizabeth: AEORTT 8A ROTATE +24 70
>James: ADEEEOX L1 AXED +44 136
#note Chickened out of EXED L1. 
>Elizabeth: DHNO 1H HOND. +27 97
>James: EEOOSTT 6D TOO +11 147
#note Somehow, I thought EEST was a slightly better leave than EOST (hence, TOO over TOE). They're really even. Quackle likes EXIT 2K, probably for the points. 
>Elizabeth: ABILO 5A ABOIL +20 117
>James: CEEEIST 2F CEE +16 163
#note Had I played TOE, I would've had a chance at ESOTERIC/COTERIES too. However, this is the best overall now. 
>Elizabeth: GIIV A1 VIGI. +30 147
>James: EIKNSTT A7 T.INKETS +63 226
#note Best. 
>Elizabeth: HMO 3G MHO +28 175
>James: EPRTUYY 14A .YRUPY +44 270
#note Best. 
>Elizabeth: ACE 15F ACE +20 195
>James: AAEMTVW 14H WAVE +23 293
#note I picked WAVE to help get rid of a lot of the bingo lanes (14H, the Rs at I8 and potentially L8, etc). Quackle favors it most too. 
>Elizabeth: IQS L12 QIS +35 230
>James: AAIMOTZ M11 ZIT +39 332
#note ZOA 13G is more defensive in blocking 12A, and gives a better leave, but point plays are worth it at this point too. Either way, I'm not likely to lose if I play this carefully.
