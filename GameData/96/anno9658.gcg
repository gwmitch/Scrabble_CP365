#note That's indicative of the kind of game it will be.
>Brett_Haughney: ACEIOTZ 11E AZO.C +32 44
#note Actual rack.  AZOTEMIC/METAZOIC.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CDGRRS E9 CR.G +7 72
#note Setting up the S if things don't pan out.
>Brett_Haughney: AEI 6G A.IE +8 52
>Ryan_Fischer: ??ADORS 8A ROADS +32 104
#note I figured I could do better even if I do find tSARDOm for 81.  That, DhoORAS, and AccORDS are the only 3 plays Champ likes better than this.  Besides, here I open up several lanes, including two TWSes, that'll help me score more.
>Brett_Haughney: UUU -UUU +0 52
>Ryan_Fischer: ??BFTVY -BFVY +0 104
#note Okay, so it wasn't too smart.  I didn't want to use one blank for only 27, so I figured I'd have to throw back.  T(O)BY wasn't worth it 'cause it'd just kill the lines I created and FV?? isn't going anywhere, especially with that O and A gone.

#note Of course then I might not draw that.
>Brett_Haughney: EINNPST 4F .PINNETS +72 174
#note This is Collins.  Just TENPINS in ours.  (Also PINNETS in Collins.)
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEKQRU H1 QUA. +39 334
#note Fun rack.  Too bad it wasn't worth it to play a more interesting option.
>Brett_Haughney: BUY M2 BU.Y +18 192
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEKRSX K3 K.X +28 362
#note Okay, EX should have been obvious.  I guess I wanted to lose the K a little too much here.
