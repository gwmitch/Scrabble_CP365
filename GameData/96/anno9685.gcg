>James: ACDHILS 8D CHILD +28 28
#note A tie betweed CHILD and LAICH 8H. They both score well, though CHILD can allow an E hook while LAICH allows an S. I liked CHILD because it didn't put a vowel next to a DWS. 
>Alex: ENZ F6 ZE.N +33 33
>James: AACPRSW 10B WRAPS +36 64
#note Tricky rack. I liked WRAPS for its scoring and its ability to close the board a little, but WHAPS E7 is 3 less and CAR is not a bad leave at all. That being said, Quackle likes WHAP E7 most! I guess it likes my chances having the S first before Alex. 
>Alex: EKORR B10 .ORKER +26 59
>James: ACEINOS I2 ACINOSE +75 139
#note I missed DIOCESAN. 
>Alex: IQ H4 QI +44 103
>James: ADEFMNX 15A F.AMED +45 184
#note Missed AXEMAN 2I, though I preferred to hold onto the X and get rid of a 3-3 spot. FREMD 15A is also worth considering. Quackle evaluates AXEMAN, FREMD and FRAMED as about equal. 
>Alex: AEEILRT H8 .ETAILER +80 183
>James: EGLNTUX J1 EX +50 234
#note Best. 
>Alex: BGI 12A B.IG +20 203
>James: AGLNOTU 13B .NOUT +25 259
#note Best, but AUTOWORKER B6 is  cute. 
>Alex: AJR G5 JAR. +36 239
>James: ABGILOU 5G ...GO +26 285
#note I like JINGO, because it leaves me with ABULIC D3 at the very worst next turn most likely. ABOULIC D2 is also favored well, because it cleares out the rack most. 
>Alex: MO H1 OM +24 263
>James: ABHILOU J5 .HI +30 315
#note This time, Quackle likes ABOULIC more than GHI. It figures because the H is likely to be used in the next turns somehow. Also, the presenceof both blanks in the bag indicates that a chance of Alex bingoing is quite high. 
>Alex: DENRY 4K NERDY +28 291
>James: ABLOOTU O1 BUO. +27 342
#note Best. 
>Alex: ELUV 11G V.LUE +16 307
>James: ADILOST L11 DOIT +20 362
#note I was going for a defense play, and this seemed quite good in blocking up while leaving me with a decent shot at a future play.
