>Noah: AOPTVXY 8G POXY +32 32
#note Or VOX. Somewhat tough decision, but I thought this was harder to overlap and she might not see EPOXY--it's always hard for me to find, but maybe I'm being too egotistical here. I noticed that often a VOX overlap will give me a play too, but ultimately opted for this. PYX is also an interesting idea, as it provides least comeback, but also keeps the worst leave.
>Irene_Averell: EJO F6 JOE +43 43
>Noah: AENNNTV -NNV +0 32
#note I considered play through, especially since she might not know (NOVENA)E, but I liked dumping ultimately.
>Irene_Averell: GRTU 7D GR.UT +14 57
>Noah: ?AEENOT D3 ElON.ATE +68 100
>Irene_Averell: ERU 9H RUE +22 79
>Noah: DEEFIIN 11D DEFI +26 126
#note I saw some overlaps at E3, but not FIE, which I like best.
>Irene_Averell: FLOW 10J WOLF +35 114
>Noah: AAEINOR L8 EO.IAN +14 140
#note Didn't want to open cheap spots, and liked the lanes this kept open, and preferred AR to AIN and AEIN. All these factors made this the play.

>Irene_Averell: EISSZ N10 SIZES +45 184
>Noah: IIKRSTW 10B WI.R +17 249
#note Okay, I was sure WIER was a word. I liked this because TWIER seemed less likely a word for her to find than SKIER.

>Irene_Averell: BNO 8L .BON +18 229
>Noah: BDEGHIV 14A .HIV +20 375
#note G(I)BED is a good play here. No VIG C1 for me--I just need to win the game to win the tourney.
>Irene_Averell: ALP 3C P..AL +16 245
>Noah: BDEGNOR 14G G.BED +27 402
#note I like B(A)G here. Blocks lanes and still keeps some good scoring potential down on row 14.
>Irene_Averell: CRU M5 CUR. +9 254
>Noah: ADNORTU O11 DATO +25 427
#note I didn't think of it until later, but TOU(C)AN seems a reasonable play. It leaves one in the bag and blocks a couple lanes. It's okay though: I win no matter what.
>Irene_Averell: IL 6B LI. +5 259
