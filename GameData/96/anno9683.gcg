>Denver: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>James: EIRSTVZ 9F RITZ +38 38
#note Best - the score makes it worth is. And ESV isn't bad if one looks to block up the board, which may occur. 
>Denver: BEEGIS 10B BEIGES +33 55
>James: AADEOSV 10I AVO +25 63
#note Best. 
>Denver: ?ALORTT C5 TOTAL.Rs +59 114
#note Phony and I wasn't sure. I also saw many other better scoring plays and thought whatever. 
>James: AADENSY B5 AY +28 91
#note Quackle prefers YA B6 slightly, probably because of its slight extra defense. I'm not sure why I didn't pick it this time. 
>Denver: UX 11K XU +36 150
>James: ADENOSU B9 A.OUND +23 114
#note Best. I wasn't sure if he'd know ABOUNDS, so I thought it worth it to play for sure. 
>Denver: EIU 7B E.UI +10 160
>James: ?EEEEFS D3 FEE +15 129
#note Maybe playing FEE 9K for 5 more is better, but I thought it may lead to too much playback for its worth. I did miss the standout FUSEE 12A though. 
>Denver: AIMN A12 MAIN +39 199
>James: ?AEERRS L7 ERAS.REs +73 202
#note This, TREASURE, etc, are all about even. 
>Denver: OOW 3A WOO. +20 219
>James: AEEINRS 12A ...E +10 212
#note Time to fish... there's a few spots so why not? Quackle also proposes NEW or NEWER A1 for the points/leave tradeoff as considerations, too. 
>Denver: ACDENST M1 DECANTS +75 294
>James: ACEINRS 5A C...NARIES +74 286
#note Best and I'm happy. 
>Denver: DEGIR 1H RIDGE. +30 324
>James: GHJKNOW 4L H.WK +38 324
#note This is a play that I was having trouble on. If I play JOW, maybe I'd get stuck with a pile of consonants again. If I play HAWK, he's likely to get a lot back. Maybe play GAWK and hold the H to play at 6F? However, JOW is most favored and I think I realize why - HAWK is just not likely to be played at. I also was wondering if HAW 4L is worth playing because he has nothing to hook off it. However, it looks obvious eough that he'd block, but then I could get JOW off next turn without a problem. If I get lucky, I could also get JOKEY or JOKED 13I as well. 

Quackle likes HAW most, then JOW, and not by small margins. Maybe I should've played the first. 
>Denver: FLO O1 FOL. +33 357
>James: GJNOOTU A1 JO. +39 363
#note I had JOW again but Quackle favors JUST 14J quite a bit mroe, which I like as well. The reason being that Denver has no Os and it's really not going to factor into his decisions to block. 
>Denver: MPV 9K V.MP +27 384
>James: GLNNOTU B1 ON. +19 382
#note It's very hard to figure out a win now. SUNG, I suppose, gives me some shots at drawing bingos and maybe a draw at something else but I'm not seeing what. I just went for points, but that is not looking to win at all. F2 TUNA is also looked at, but I know that won't win given that it will give the bottom right corner back to Denvery to play at. 
>Denver: BHILPTY M13 HIP +27 411
>James: EGLLNTU O1 ....TUNE +45 427
>James: EGLLNTU --  -45 382
#note I got desperate but even if he let it go, he'd still win. 
>Denver: ABDITY 4G ABY +25 436
>James: EGLLNTU 6F GENT +30 412
>Denver: DIT E12 DIT +11 447
>Denver:  (LLU) +6 453
#note Oh well - I deserved to lose.
