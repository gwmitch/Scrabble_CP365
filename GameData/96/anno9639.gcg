>Nigel_Richards: DIRUZ H4 DURZI +34 34
>Toh_Weibin: CEIIKQR 5G Q.ICK +40 40
#note Other options were QUICKIE and QUICKER. I thought that this was the best option as it is only vulnerable to an S hook...
>Nigel_Richards: EISTW L1 WITES +45 79
#note ..which he had, being Nigel.
>Toh_Weibin: BEIIPRY J2 PRI.Y +26 66
#note This might have been a mistake - I did see the highest win% move (PIETY) but rejected it because of the slightly better defense of this move and the IE leave which could possibly play through the Z. Playing defensive in this stage is probably not what I want, though.
>Nigel_Richards: EELMSUV 8C EMULS.VE +66 145
>Toh_Weibin: BEEEIOY 7B OBEY +28 94
#note Unfortunately, this move was pretty much forced, killing off 3-4 of my best bingo lines.

>Toh_Weibin: AEEEIRX 1L .EXE +42 136
>Nigel_Richards: ?AAMNOR O1 .MANAtOR +80 256
>Toh_Weibin: AEIJORS N5 JA +23 159
#note This was a difficult move and I spent a lot of time thinking it through - JAI has the best equity but it leaves a rather closed board. Not really what I want when I'm 120 down. JO N3 or N7 are worth considering, but I didn't like keeping 5 tiles which didn't hook in front of OR. In the end, I decided to take the worse leave and hope for the best.
>Nigel_Richards: AIN 2J .A.NI. +40 296
#note Cute play with 3 1-pointers. Wonder if I would have seen that.
>Toh_Weibin: DEIORST N8 EDITORS +72 231
#note A good draw kept the hope alive.
>Nigel_Richards: AOPU M10 OUPA +24 320
#note Looked like an obvious blocking move to me.
>Toh_Weibin: ?AHILOT O11 ALTHO +44 275
#note I didn't look hard for a bingo after spotting the 4-tile overlap ALTHO. Turns out there is one, but missing the bingo is better anyway in this instance (especially since you don't know what Nigel is planning down the TWS with OUPA).
>Nigel_Richards: AEO 3I O.A.E +20 340
>Toh_Weibin: ?CEGIIO F8 .OGICIzE +64 339
#note Minor error here - LOGICIsE might have given me an easier line to bingo through. Rather minor, since he is likely to play through the E anyway.
>Nigel_Richards: ADEHLR 15C HED.RAL +36 376
>Toh_Weibin: BEGLNST 13B BELT.NGS +76 415
#note I thought this was the biggest error of the game - and to be honest I wasn't even 100% sure of BELTINGS (I didn't manage to reach that when doing my last-minute high probability revision, embarrassingly enough). The best move, of course, is the double-double BL(I)NGEST...
>Nigel_Richards: EINRTV 11E V.TRINE +40 416
#note .. which prevents this.
>Toh_Weibin: AFGNNTW 12A FAW +22 437
#note Thankfully, I drew the right tiles to pull this win off.
