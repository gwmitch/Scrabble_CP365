#note It's funny how the 5 point challenge rule sometimes brings you to challenge things you never would have in double challenge.  Of course there was a time when I knew this word cold, but I guess I got a little senile.  Once doubt crept in, I couldn't resist challenging at these stakes.

#note DUNLIN 10E is a very nice play that I missed.

#note Didn't really know URANINS yet, even though I did get it correct once 11 days before this game was played, Zyzzyva tells me.  That would have helped.

#note Sam didn't like this play, and maybe he's right.  But I can't score much more anyway, and it seemed silly to just let him have row 1 unobstructed.

#note Quackle likes MIRV, but that looks like it could be asking for trouble with so few vowels left.
>Sam_Rosin: BIOTU 12K OUBIT +28 319
#note Nice play from Sam.
>Dave_Koenig: ANPUVVY N11 V.NY +20 401
#note Looking back at this, I feel like I have to play the way I did.  I'm still a heavy favorite to win, but there is a lot of junk out and there's a good chance of getting hurt by a heavy vowelless rack.  VAUNTY scores a lot more, but it burns valuable vowels, especially the U which looks like it will be the only way to play this Q.  I can't justify NAVVY 6G either, which leaves open huge possibilities of bingos on the N or O columns or QAIDS N10 for him.  Behold the last three tiles I draw at the World Championship.

#note I didn't think Sam was phonying here, but I wasn't sure of the word, and after my draw I saw I was dead in the water if the bingo stayed, so I had to challenge.  We both play the endgame perfectly after this.
