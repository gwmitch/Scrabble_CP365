#note I'm not sure what to think of this play. On one hand, it keeps a bad leave. On the other, it denies Ben of scoring spots. But I think it is better to do YE I5 here, because Ben doesn't seem to have scoring tiles, he seems to have bingo tiles.

#note I didn't give this play much thought, but perhaps I should have. The obvious problem with this play is that it closes up the bottom right quadrant pretty well. There are still some other lanes open, but they're certainly closeable. I could play something like NAIF 4D, closing scoring spots and also lanes, but not amazing lanes. On the other hand, I think it's probably not wise to do that. I could play WAFF at I9, which is quite reasonable indeed. It preserves a line down column K, and opens a scoring spot, but there are already a fair amount of those on this board, so I don't think that's so bad. I think I might be a fan of WAFF's aggressive quality, but then again maybe not. Difficult play, and I don't feel like Quackle is all that useful here, considering that this play involves long-term board dynamical concerns.

#note I could play RIVEN, but that seemed quite unsatisfying given my position.
>Ben_Dweck: AEGL C3 GA.EL +36 213
#note On the other hand, RIVEN does do a good job of blocking troublesome plays like this. Also, we misscored this as 38 instead of 36.

#note I could also preserve my S here with FUNK. But there are a lot of esses and a blank out, and I should at least stay within a bingo.
