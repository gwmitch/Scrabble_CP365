#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 2, Game 3. I bumbled my way to first place in the first early bird, gained 80 rating points. Breached the "expert" barrier. So now I have to play like an expert to maintain it. LOL! Yeah no.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: OSX J8 SOX +34 34
>Matthew_Larocque: DHIMOOS K9 HIM +30 44
#note Neat - OOM(P)H for 28.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ADEINRT H8 .RDINATE +80 114
>Matthew_Larocque: DOOORRS I12 ODOR +18 62
#note Best of a bad bunch. SORDOR plays for 30 if I knew that word, but I think keeping the S here is pretty important.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: FO G12 OF +23 137
>Matthew_Larocque: CLORRSS L8 COS +24 86
#note ORS J13 is a lot better, I know FADO of course but miss it as a hook often.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AY J14 YA +30 167
>Matthew_Larocque: CEILRRS G5 CRI. +9 95
#note Yeah... this board is awful, not much choice but to get some letters down to play through. I thought SCRIB might be a word if I was really desperate. I was considering CRIE(D) for the same reason. Simulation says (C)RIS and (COS)IER give an 18% chance to salvage this mess.

#note 3 eights using the C are availible here for 74 - I wouldn't have been sure on any of them though! And thankfully I didn't blow my turn trying *S(CRIB).

>Matthew_Larocque: BDEEIRT --  -63 159
#note Fatal error. I sounded the word in my head - knew I was on to something. "Is BESTRY a word? What would that even mean?" At any rate, I still had a chance to win if I didn't bingo right this turn. Poor judgement and too hasty - I don't need to take a desperate risk like this.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?EGNSTV N4 VE.TiNGS +65 254
#note If I spell my bingo correctly, then what does he do with this rack? Scored as 66.
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEEIRT -  +0 159
#note More poor judgement, challenge out of frustration even though I'm pretty sure this is fine. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EHNW O11 HEWN +16 270
#note Did he pass on WEN(C)H or miss it?
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEEIRT 4L DI.E +18 177
#note I feel pretty screwed and I wasted most of my clock after a mere 7 turns. Time to play speed scrabble for the last half of the game!

#note What are the chances he'll have a word ending in F? Or even have the F?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AFIL 1A ALIF +54 400
#note Might as well make it a glorious crash and burn!

#note I guess the good thing about getting slaughtered is you can play made-up words and your opponent will prolly leave it unless they're positive they can challenge it off.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?ADEMRU A9 M.RAUDE +33 457
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?ADEMRU --  -33 424
#note Interesting.... he had a goldmine of good plays including 149 points for a 3x3. And a dozen 30+ pointers at least. Who would have expected a fabrication? At least I felt a little less foolish for losing this game!
