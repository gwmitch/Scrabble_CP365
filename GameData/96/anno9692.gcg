#note Best. JAUP 8F/8G is probably somewhat close to equal, because leaving a J next to a DLS is likely equal to leaving a vowel. 
>Kenji: ?EEILNT I2 LENITEs +71 71
#note Maybe ALIENATE H8 for 3 more. 
>James: DEOSTTU 9F TOD +20 46
#note OUTSIDE 5E appealed but I thought holding ESTU was a little better. Pity TESTUDO didn't fit. Quackle likes JUT or JOT G8 more, perhaps because of the opening effect, but I think a few points is worth it.

#note And the game's about even again, or rather, fairly straight forward. It's hard to develop the game much once the CALORIZE spot is used.

>Kenji: IRY H12 .IRY +30 290
>James: ABDIMNN 13C INDAM.N +31 326
#note Best. Notice that most of the moves here are a matter of seeing them, but there's very little debate on what's best. 
>Kenji: ALUV 1K VUL.A +36 326

#note Best. 
>Kenji: AAEGR H1 GARA.E +36 362
>James: EEIILRT 11K IR. +19 374
#note Apparently TILE 12A is the best play, which does make some sense, because there's nothing much Kenji can do with a T in that lane given what's in the bag (TOFF is about the best option and he has to have just the right tiles to do that). I picked IRE since it looked like the bag was running low on tiles, so holding onto a few Es (perhaps play LYE 15G if necessary) may be useful. 
>Kenji: FX 2G F..X +30 392
>James: AEEILOT 7B T.EE +20 394
#note I really don't know why OE wins at a 58% clip, while TYEE 7B doesn't. My thought is that Kenji, if he has the Q, will play QIS 4B or QI C12, dependent on what he got stuck with. If he plays QIS, with AILO to draw into the bag, so long as I draw something high-scoring, I should be fine in the end. To note, when Kenji played FALX, he also overdrew, allowing me to put the K back in the bag when seeing an N and an O as well. 

Also, if the Q is in the bag, I threaten QI 8A as well as 12C, which will give me a good leg up in the end. Kenji can only have one vowel, which means that maybe he'll go out in two, but even if he does, the odds of him scoring enough to beat me aren't that high.
