>James: ABEEGOR 8D BARGE +22 22
#note Quackle likes BORAGE 8D or even 8C. 8C I didn't consider, though it is a nice leave and a decent defensive position; I thought of BARGE as a decent scorer with a more defensive position than others. That being said, perhaps the 4 points is a better idea to play BORAGE 8D. Quackle favors BORAGE and BARGEE 8D, the former by a notable margin. 
>Stu: LOTUY E7 L.YOUT +18 18
>James: ADDEOQU F5 ADO.ED +30 52
#note Best - holding onto QU is useful because it is, after all, QU, and QUOTED 12B may invite playback along the 13B horizontal. That being said, QUOTED is still second best by Quackle's estimation, though I kind of like ROD F8 to hold better overall letters. 
>Stu: EGNOOTU 7H OUTGONE +62 80
>James: JLNOQRU 5E J.RL +22 74
#note Tricky play. Quackle likes JEON N6 most, probably for the 5 extra points, no matter the potential risks (as an 8L play is risky enough as it is). I wasn't sure what to do and picked JARL because 1) it leaves the QU with the N, which can lead to some decent plays and 2) the extra L placed on JAR eliminates a lot of possible playback on it, and possibly could give a draw for QUOLL next turn too. 
>Stu: EEGINU M2 GENUI.E +16 96
>James: AENNOQU 12A QUAN. +48 122
#note Best. Having seen the other three Us played, QUANT isn't likely to be played on to the triple unless a blank is used. 
>Stu: EY D8 .EY +21 117
>James: EFNOOSW 8L W.NS +44 166
#note Another tricky play. I picked WENS because I had the F for playing at N6, and its score was 8 above anything else. However, WIFE 6L does score well on its own and leaves better letters. Quackle likes WIFE by quite a margin, and small wonder. I think I got tunnel vision about having the other F. Quackle even likes FENS 8L too, indicating how weak the F is as a leftover letter on this board if I can't play it where I want to. 
>Stu: AEHV 4I HAVE. +22 139
>James: ACEFOOS 3G COOF +24 190
#note Okay, holding onto the F didn't really work much, but at least it gets out of my hand this turn. Best by a good margin. 
>Stu: BM 6L M.B +32 171
>James: ACEKMSW B10 WA.KS +40 230
#note I missed WACKES O1. After that, WAUKS B10 is best. 
>Stu: ?AEIORS O8 .OlARISE +74 245
>James: CDELMNZ I6 C.D +16 246
#note Given the large number of Is, I was hoping to draw MIZENS 14J. Even if Stu plays to the S, I am likely to draw an I and potentially get a decent other play. Quackle likes MED or MEN N13 most, because of the points and likelihood to potentially get an A to play ZA M12. 
>Stu: DHIIPSX -DHIIPS +0 245
>James: AEILMNZ 15H MELANIZ. +110 356
#note So helpful to be lucky. 
>Stu: AEEIRST 13E SERIATE +69 314
>James: DINOPTV A7 VINO +26 382
#note After this, it's very hard for Stu to win. The board is fairly dead and I have a D for SERIATED.
