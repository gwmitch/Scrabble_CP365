#note Seems reasonable. Opens up a bingo lane that is harder to close than some opened by other plays.

#note I thought this was great because it set up QI. But I always forget about the word APOD. This isn't smart given there are 7 As left.

#note Again, I could play AX 7B, but that seems to make things more difficult. Maybe I should just take those points, but I think this is fine.

#note I thought this would be a reasonable play. One factor in my decision was that she didn't challenge HIGHT, yet said aloud that she didn't know HIGHT. So I thought this wasn't a bad try. Guess I was wrong.
