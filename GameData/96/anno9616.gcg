>Matthew_Larocque: ?AGILTV H7 VIG +14 14
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 1, Game 6. I was 5-0, but if I was bound to lose a game, Juraj would probably get me. My record against him was 1-7 so... it would take a lot of luck to win. Or something completely unexpected! No bingos here, this is good and defensive while setting me up.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DEL 8G D.EL +5 5
#note I think he spent around the range of 5 minutes before doing this. Odd play...
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AKLMRT 10G TALK +26 40
#note Maybe LARK or MARK, but really, it's miniscule.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IIIUUUU -IIIUUUU +0 5
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BEMRUW -BMUW +0 40
#note UMBER? is actually deceptively synergistic, but look at this board....
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?BEINRW 11B BRoWNIE +83 88
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?BEINRW --  -83 5
#note I thought for a bit but VIGAE just didn't look right.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EILORR K2 LORRIEs +67 107
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EILORR --  -67 40
#note Yay I got a bingo! What DIEL doesn't take an S?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?BEINRW J3 BRoWN.I.E +75 80
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?BEINRW --  -75 5
#note And much chuckling ensued. Followed by another walk to the word judge. I think I did more walking than sitting this game!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EILORR -OR +0 40
#note *Examines score sheet*
"Just to be clear... we've had 5 turns with no score, right?"

Oh snap
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIJLRU (EILORR?) +-6 34
#note He loses 11 points although this isn't showing correctly.
