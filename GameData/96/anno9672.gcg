#note He laid down BEND at first, but had misgivings.

#note Should I open this hook? I thought it was okay to do.

#note Type a note Neither of us knew HORNINGS. To be more precise, I thought it was phoney and he wasn't sure.!

#note Silly. I was pretty sure this was no good...I saw UNPOTTEd. This may be due to tiredness, or just really wanting to play the *perfect* play that scores the best, closes most dangerous spots etc. I am a bit too controlling, wanting to always win 100% which is obviously not possible.

#note I figured this was best because it set up a good scoring spot for me in case he tries to set up a bingo. On the other hand, a row fourteen play makes it impossible for him to get a viable bingo.

#note I was tired and lazy after 7 games, so I played this instantly. I'm blocking his spot and keeping two great plays in reserve, right? Wrong! After I played this, I soon noticed RA(R)EFY 2A.

#note Luckily for me, David was tired too.
