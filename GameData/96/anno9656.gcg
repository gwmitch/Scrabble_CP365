#note His actual rack.  Most viable plays put the Z or blank E in a bad spot.  There's a bingo not worth playing.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEIOP E11 OPE +27 83
#note E10 EIDE 31 is what I like.  Saw EPODE, gives too much back.  Played short with OPE to save the consonant.
>Tim_Michaels: AD 10B DA. +29 75
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEEIN I6 DEI.N +18 101
#note Not too good.  F10 IDEA 24 is okay.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEIORTV 4D DEVI.TOR +74 235
#note But wait!
>Tim_Michaels: ETW 5J WET +21 281
#note Worried about the S and Y hooks...
>Ryan_Fischer: AELLQSU 1K EQUAL +100 335
#note But couldn't have foreseen that.
>Tim_Michaels: ENRU 5C RUNE +28 309
>Ryan_Fischer: EHLMOSS L4 S.EM +38 373
#note Figured this would give less back and give me the option of the S hook.

>Tim_Michaels: MU 8M .UM +21 356
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEKORS N4 OAK +34 455
#note Well, I had to do some math to make sure I could outrun the bingos 'cause I sure don't think I could have stopped them.
>Tim_Michaels: ADIIRST 14E DIARIST +69 425
#note Oh well.
