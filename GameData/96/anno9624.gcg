>Dave_Koenig: EJNQRTU -QJ +0 35
#note QUERN$ L8 for 58 is by far the best play.  I had no idea PERVE was good.  Without it, I struggled to find anything to do on this board with the Q or J.

>Dave_Koenig: AEINORT 5H ANTI.ERO +72 121
#note Given my large deficit and his seven tile draw, it seemed best to bingo this way.

>Dave_Koenig: IINORUV 12H VIR.IN +28 238
#note VIRINO 4D is a nice play, though I can't complain about how my choice worked out.

>Sherwin_Rodrigues: AAIOR D8 .OARIA +30 374
>Dave_Koenig: AFJLOTX 13L FOX +35 345
#note I missed FALAJ 13C, which looks best.  I need to shed two of the high point tiles to give myself the best chance to keep scoring and bingo soon.  FOX$ holds the J for C13 and the L for ZOARIAL$ while also setting up the FOXY$ hook if I can draw the Y.  My comeback chances are looking up...
>Sherwin_Rodrigues: ?BENNOU A1 dUBONNE. +80 454
#note ...until this.
>Dave_Koenig: AEGJLLT C13 JAG +40 385
#note I had JETLAG$ at C10 or 14A for a lot of points, but they empty the bag and give me no chance to win.  The same is true of fishing the L to draw an S for JETLAGS$ in two places.  The only hope is to make a big scoring J play and then to bingo.
>Sherwin_Rodrigues: AEEINST 15A SA.ENITE +140 594
#note Ouch.
>Dave_Koenig: EGILLTY O13 YET +35 420
#note I couldn't remember if it was GYTE or TYGE*, so I went with the safe word.
