#note Missed ALE(U)RONE, dammit.  No excuses left for what happens next.  Painful.  Game over after turn one.  It's been way too long since I've seen this one.
>Robin_LaPrelle: EGP 9G PEG +20 34
>Ryan_Fischer: AEELMRS F5 LAM. +18 32
#note Wow, now I REALLY have no excuse for losing: I missed G7 S(UP)ERMALE 65!
>Robin_LaPrelle: ?ADEEIT 10A IDEATEs +67 101
#note 5D D(EL)InEATE 68 is 1 more.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIIORS 7H OI +6 38
#note ...and on that farm.  (I don't know why I didn't play this for 1 more point in either of two spots.  I think I thought this place would make it easier to bingo.
>Robin_LaPrelle: AGJU D3 JUGA +31 132
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIRSS 3B RA.ES +24 62
#note Champ says 2D AE 15 is 15%.  Only 2-ply.  Meh.  Maybe 4-ply is better here.  I don't know what to do here.  RA(J)ES might be too much.
>Robin_LaPrelle: FOXY 6H FOXY +42 174
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIISSU B1 AU.IS +10 72
#note Champ likes this best.  Fork the board in two volatile places, hope something good happens.  (Spoiler: it doesn't.)
>Robin_LaPrelle: ACGILNR B7 CRA.LING +74 248
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEIIOS -EEIIO +0 72
#note Yes, yes, your farm is great, but I don't want any part of it.
>Robin_LaPrelle: Z 1A Z. +33 281
>Ryan_Fischer: EFHLORS D9 H.LF +20 92
#note HORNFELS (sticky) and HORSEFLY are the 8s.  Saw the latter, wished that Y was elsewhere.  Champ likes HO(Y) or FO(Y), but it's pretty hopeless.
>Robin_LaPrelle: AEILPST 2E PALIEST +71 352
>Ryan_Fischer: BBEEORS 5J EBB +37 129
#note 1F REBBE 50.  I saw BORES, thought it'd be better to take 37 and another hook.  Didn't remember REBBE, anyway.
>Robin_LaPrelle: NVY H1 V.NY +42 394
#note Aw.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEENORS 3K ONCE +14 143
#note No NECROSE ENCORES.  No nothing.  I guess fishing might help.  My play is just so bad.  Gives up too much, leaves too much to chance again.
>Robin_LaPrelle: OTT O1 TOT +16 410
>Ryan_Fischer: EIMORRS 1D MOR +16 159
#note Up here to account for two spots for the Q.
>Robin_LaPrelle: ?ADINTU L3 .U. +10 420
#note Ruh-oh.

>Robin_LaPrelle: ?ADIINT N1 ID.ATINg +78 498
>Ryan_Fischer: EORRSVW 8L WO. +9 212
#note IDEATION prevents this, though Champ doesn't like it anyway.  It likes 10I OVER 18.
>Robin_LaPrelle: DEI E10 .IED +19 517
>Ryan_Fischer: EKORRSV O8 SOKE +42 254
#note Couldn't think of SERVO.  Aw.
