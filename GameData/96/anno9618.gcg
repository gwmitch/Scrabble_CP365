>Wayne_Clifford: EMMO 8E MEMO +16 16
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 1, Game 5. I had some bad games in the last tournament where I played Wayne so I was looking for a big win. 
>Matthew_Larocque: FOSSTTV 9F SOFT +21 21
#note Wasn't positive on TOFT - which is a bit better than SOFT here.
>Wayne_Clifford: ANQR I9 .RANQ +24 40
>Matthew_Larocque: EORSTTV F5 VOT.. +10 31
#note I was strongly considering T(A)V since I'm holding an S and it's almost unblockable. Unless he has an S or blank... I decided to hold off on being super aggressive.
>Wayne_Clifford: EEFLNT 11E ENFL.TE +40 80
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEERST K5 DESERT.D +70 101
#note Hahaha... I so knew that was garbage. Too bad I didn't see REDDEST or knew TEDDERS, otherwise I could challenge and then bingo anyways. As it was, I saw this play and let him have the 40 points.
>Wayne_Clifford: IPY J6 YIP +35 115
>Matthew_Larocque: AADNOUW L10 ADOWN +38 139
>Matthew_Larocque: AADNOUW --  -38 101
#note Well, since he probably had no idea if his play was good or not, I thought I could throw this down. The classic dilemma of wether or not to challenge your own word.
>Wayne_Clifford: EZ G11 .EZ +25 140
#note Good call Wayne.... bah
>Matthew_Larocque: AADNOUW 12A WOUND +29 130
>Wayne_Clifford: CLOS B10 CO.LS +26 166
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEEES 5E A.E +12 142
#note EA(V)E..... of course
>Wayne_Clifford: ?CEKR 8J ..CKER +51 217
#note He showed me a blank at first.... then opted for this
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEISV O8 .EAdVISE +92 234
#note And then we have this.... a semi-plausible word that took balls to play after I already lost my turn hooking the phony he played. I only saw AdVISEE, but I felt like the extra 15 points would be necessary to make a successful comeback. He didn't even flinch! The best valid bingos are VASElIK(E) M2 and VESIcAE D1 for 82 points each. I still can't believe I got away with this....
>Wayne_Clifford: IY 10A I.Y +8 225
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGHLOT D4 GHAT +26 260
#note He's trying to build a bingo looks like - better screw up that easy hook! Didn't know GALAH. Quackle likes OATH I4 but there's so many ways for that to go wrong with the J, Bees Gees an H and a Dee still around.
>Wayne_Clifford: HI N10 HI +27 252
>Matthew_Larocque: AILNOOT A12 .AIL +25 285
#note LATINO and ALOIN (which I forgot was a word) hook to make (HAVE)N here. But, that could be dangerous for a few extra points.
>Wayne_Clifford: GU C8 GU. +8 260
>Matthew_Larocque: BNNOORT H1 BORON +35 320
#note Well, he fished again for minimal points. I don't mind putting the B up there since a big share of B bingos end in -ABLE. He probably won't be scoring much if he does bingo.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?AAEINR 2B AERAtI.N +64 324
#note His highest scoring option is (R)AINwEAR for 66. I added 66 to his score for some reason so it didn't matter!
>Matthew_Larocque: BDIINTX 3A NIX +40 360
#note Quackle also likes DIXIT(S) but I don't want to give him access to the TWS like that.
>Wayne_Clifford: AJ 8A JA. +33 357
>Matthew_Larocque: BDGILRT 14K GILD. +14 374
#note I never know what to do in endgames... this does ok in the sim though. Quackle likes BRIDG(E) dumping all the clunk. I think I can only go out if I draw a U or I to BRT.
>Wayne_Clifford: AEIOPUW L4 PEW +28 385
>Matthew_Larocque: BRTU N4 BRUT. +9 383
#note There's 2 outs but I didn't even know the word that lets me play out in the other spot lol.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AIOU) +8 391
#note 391 - 387 was recorded. I'm thinking that phony was the most points I've gotten away with in a tournament or club game. And one of several phonies that probably changed the outcome of the game in these tournaments.
