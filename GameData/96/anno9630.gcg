>Andrew_Fisher: BEFILRS 8D FIBRE +28 28
#note There's little in it, but simulation shows a slight preference for FIB centrally, with BRIEF then marginally favoured over FIBRE. I'd always go for the score.
>Adam_Logan: ?BEINOO 7E BOONIEs +73 73
>Andrew_Fisher: EILNOSZ 8J SOZINE +78 106
#note Also LOZENS, but keeping the consonant is better. Adam rued his choice, though maintaining his play was still best, but if he had hooked BOONIES/FIBRES I would have had LIONIZES for 118.
>Adam_Logan: IQ 7M QI +44 117
>Andrew_Fisher: AAJLOPW 6F JO +56 162
>Adam_Logan: EHORT L8 .EROTH +36 153
>Andrew_Fisher: AAALPSW K10 ALAAP +27 189
#note AWA K10 leaps out, but I wanted to play more boldly and give myself a possible SW- word from 15K. A sim gives the nod to AWA, but again not much in it
>Adam_Logan: TUX J4 TUX.. +28 181
>Andrew_Fisher: CDEIISW 15G WEIDS +35 224
#note A bit less swashbuckling here, deciding to colonise the S-hook although I could have just dumped WEID for 37 at M11
>Adam_Logan: ATTW M12 TAWT +29 210
>Andrew_Fisher: ACEIMRY 14B MYRICA +43 267
>Adam_Logan: ?EGMNPS 4G EMP.iNGS +80 290
>Andrew_Fisher: EFIKORR 3A FORKIER +83 350
#note Adam gives me a comeback opportunity, though still maintaining that his choice is better than PIGMENTS (it probably is, just)
>Adam_Logan: AAINRST O7 S.ATRAIN +71 361
>Andrew_Fisher: ADDEIUV A1 VI.DA +42 392
>Adam_Logan: ELNU 13A LUNE +24 385
>Andrew_Fisher: DEEGOTU 2F OUTEDGE +72 464
#note Deep thought from Adam before playing LUNE. I think he was close to bingoing, though I was still wary of high-scoring Y plays on the top row making YU if I played this one tile further west
>Adam_Logan: ACELLUY 1L YALE +42 427
#note YUCA works out a little better for him
>Andrew_Fisher: DEGHNOV 12D HOVED +40 504
>Adam_Logan: CLU A10 CUL. +7 434
