>James: EEINOTU 8H OUT +6 6
#note I should've exchanged - EOU looks good or EIOU. OUT is a bit troublesome but I was looking for an open board. 
>Richard: ADEINOV 9B NAEVOID +66 66
>James: EENNRTT C6 TEN.NTER +68 74
>James: EENNRTT --  -68 6
#note Somehow I thought my play was a word for a second and shrugged. In future games, I play a lot mroe cautiously, and maybe this kind of idiocy was why. 
>Richard: COY 8A COY +31 97
>James: EENNRTT E9 .ENT +14 20
#note Quackle plrefers playing for points because it pretty much sees the game as a hopeless proposition unless I score a lot and get lucky (hence TERN 10A or RENNET 7C being most suggested) but I thought it worth it to try and play out the other way. 
>Richard: H 10E .H +26 123
>James: ?EMNNRT 7F REMNaNT +70 90
#note Best. 
>Richard: ACEIRSV M1 VARICES +86 209
>James: AEIISTU 1M .IA +18 108
#note After this, I am in a bad position. Quackle suggests UVEA 1L to score more and hopefully catch up. 
>Richard: DW 2L W.D +20 229
>James: EEILSTU 12D U.E +6 114
#note Nothing scores a lot - quackle suggests LUCE 5K but I think I'm pretty much out. 
>Richard: EIR 10H IRE +12 241
>James: AEIILST 13F LAITIES +61 175
>Richard: DEEILNS 14B ENSILED +80 321
>James: DEHOPRT 4H TROPH.ED +84 259
>Richard: IJL H1 JIL. +33 354
>James: AFOORUX 15A OXO +41 300
#note Quackle also suggests FAX 12H which may be a good idea, since it gives me a chance at FIDO plays. 
>Richard: BPRU 12K BURP +24 378
>James: AAFFRUY O4 .AFFY +45 345
#note I should've tried BURPY and YAFF or something, but after the TENANTER debacle thought to stay with the standards. 
>Richard: AEKST 15H SKATE +42 420
>James: AGGMNRU N12 .UG +12 357
#note Try for a desperation bingo or an ION? 
>Richard: ?AELQ 6B QuALE +39 459
#note Nicely done, Dick Strick! 
>James: AGMNORZ J2 ZO.N +33 390
