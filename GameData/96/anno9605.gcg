#note (EX)ILIAN. Wanted to fish here, but I don't really see how. I'd rather take out the triple and preserve the VIZIRS hook.

#note This play is really tough. I think I somehow spaced on the best one, though. I thought of WEN, but not WENT! I just can't play WEB here, so that's why I decided to cash the SE here. WENT is definitely best though - another example of being off my game.
