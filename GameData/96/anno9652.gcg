>Matthew_Larocque: EIIOSTV 8G VIE +12 12
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 2, Game 5. Q pegs Exch. IOV about equal to this - but I don't think TISE is a good enough combo to jusitfy scoring 0 here.... toss in an N or an R at least.
>Mike_Ryan: CMW J7 CWM +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: IIKNOST 10F KINOS +34 46
#note Felt like burning the S was the only realistic option - I did miss IKON K9, but 14 extra points isn't bad and it's still early.
>Mike_Ryan: ITZ 11E ZIT +32 52
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEIOT H10 .IDATE +40 86
#note Pretty satisfied I found this - it's the best play by far.
>Mike_Ryan: AHM G13 HAM +27 79
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGNOQR 14F Q.. +32 118
>Mike_Ryan: AELRV 12B VELAR +34 113
#note I held this :/ I thought it was supposed to be an adjective for VELA.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGNOR B10 GO.ERN +28 146
#note NOG 13C performs a bit better in the sim. What's the worst that could happen playing GO(V)ERN?
>Mike_Ryan: DL C11 D.L +15 128
#note Not this, that's for sure.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGOTT A8 GOAT +22 168
#note TOE A13 provides a good leave, but that 15A TWS isn't very dangerous unless he has an unlikely O(N)YX. This scores okay and keeps the board unwieldly for him to score with.
>Mike_Ryan: NU 8A .UN +4 132
#note the plot thickens
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEEET A13 BEE +28 196
#note Well - terrible draw... tough decision to make now. I can attempt to block with BEE(N) or BE(N)E but that doesn't guarantee anything. I think I just needed to take the points and gamble that he missed.
>Mike_Ryan: ?DGLORS C2 GOLDuR.S +72 204
#note Nice word, held, saw he had LODGeRS so he must have been sure this was fine.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEELOST I12 OE +13 209
#note So, I'm groaning in my mind since OLEATES doesn't play now. I totally missed what I COULD play now - a word I've played before! :/ This also blocks his next play. Game losing mistake.
>Mike_Ryan: OX B5 OX +52 256
>Matthew_Larocque: AELPPST A1 LEAPT +34 243
#note Sim says play PALPS for 40. I know esses don't do much on this board but still - its only 6 extra points.
>Mike_Ryan: EIOU 4C .OUIE +10 266
>Matthew_Larocque: ABIOPSW H1 WABS +37 280
#note Now the sim says play WAB 3G for 13 fewer points....
>Mike_Ryan: ITY 9J .ITY +13 279
#note Mike's probably got the blank....
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIJNOP F2 JO.NED +32 312
#note I thought about P(U)NJI too, also thought about JO(Y) to block the T, but he still has the A in WABS to bingo through. Simulation has P(U)NJI J(U)PON and my play really close together with P(U)NJI having the edge for top play.
>Mike_Ryan: ?EFIRSU L2 FUrRIES. +72 351
#note Eh well..... maybe I can still pull it out if he draws crap!
>Matthew_Larocque: AHIINPT M2 AH +25 337
#note I was going to play PAH but I figured leaving 1 in the bag was my only hope to win...
>Mike_Ryan: CFU 5J CU.F +18 369
>Matthew_Larocque: EIINPRT 1M PIN +23 360
#note Odd results.... sim says PER PER or PEN instead. Why keep 2 Is for? This lets me play (DO)TIER next turn to go out. Champ agrees with me.
>Mike_Ryan: AANRY I2 AY +22 391
#note Y(U)AN, kind of tricky.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIRT 12H ..TIER +14 374
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ANR) +6 380
#note Tough loss, but I needed to find (D)ESOLATE.
