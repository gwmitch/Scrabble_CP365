>Matthew_Larocque: AINOPST H8 OP +8 8
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 1, Game 7. This was the first opponent I've never played before, so I didn't know what style of play to expect. Anyways, this is a good rack, too bad it doesn't have any bingos! I never thought about Exch. O, which is just below OP here.

#note "Well that wasn't so ugly afterall!"
>Betty_Cornelison: ADEPV 10E PAVED +18 41
>Matthew_Larocque: ABGINST 11D GIB +24 68
#note Quackle says GAB or TAB instead but it's pretty close.

#note I hate when fishing fails!
>Betty_Cornelison: N E10 ..N +5 78
>Matthew_Larocque: AIMNNST 10K MAN +12 93
#note I laughed at her play because I was planning to make the exact same play! Time to open more hooks incase she nails the one she just created.
>Betty_Cornelison: ?EHINSZ N9 ZENItHS +98 176
#note :(
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIINST 15K AGI.T +24 117
#note Very frustrating... still have nothing! Quackle says fish off the I for 5. I dunno, I'm kind of forced to take out the S here just to ensure I don't get blown out of the water.
>Betty_Cornelison: AY O8 YA +26 202
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEINST 13B ENTASIA +72 189
#note Finally... TAENIAS for 74 in the same spot sims a tad better. Thought maybe she'd be unsure of PINA or something... but that's always poor logic to justify a play.
>Betty_Cornelison: KT 12M K.T +8 210
#note hm... what's she doing
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEHRUV B9 CURV.D +28 217
#note Time to clog it up after that last weird play! CUV(E)E is 4 extra points though.
>Betty_Cornelison: MO 9B .OM +8 218
>Betty_Cornelison: MO --  -8 210
#note Heh - I said "hold" and she conceded her turn right away. 
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEGHRT A14 EH +18 235
#note Score points and keep it clogged now....Q wants GHEE 4K but what if she has JABS or something... I'd rather not find out!
>Betty_Cornelison: OT 9B .OT +6 216
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGLORT 12D E.OL +24 259
#note I was so happy with this find that I missed what the point of her (C)OT play was - not that I could block it, but it certainly caught me off guard.
>Betty_Cornelison: MNOSTU A4 MOUNTS +39 255
>Matthew_Larocque: EGJRRRT 8C JET +23 282
#note Now I'm in a real pickle... this lands about 3rd despite the godawful leave.  I didn't see (U)RGER which gives about 44.5% chance to win.
>Betty_Cornelison: BELO F5 LOBE +19 274
>Matthew_Larocque: CEGRRRW B2 GREW +25 307
#note Don't think I should risk CREW instead
>Betty_Cornelison: EU J11 .EU +6 280
#note (N)U(K)E would have probably guaranteed her the win with how it played out.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACILORR 5D CO.LAR +16 323
#note Really couldn't decide what the right thing to do was here. Blocking KIT would have accomplished more than this random play!
>Betty_Cornelison: ASW L12 SWA. +32 312
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILOOR D3 LO.I +12 335
#note Pretty sure this was my rack - had LOIR for sure and 3 of OAIR. Anyways, this play sims WAY better than anything else. She can probably get some kind of RE bingo with the R.
>Betty_Cornelison: ?DEEFIR 4H FED +22 334
>Matthew_Larocque: AIORR 7L ROAR +11 346
#note This is the first fatal mistake I made. The extremely bad part is I SAW THE WINNING PLAY. My tracking is never accurate so I can't believe I trusted it here. I suddenly forgot she even had the blank, and thought she had RINE. I didn't see where she could go out, so I played this thinking I could play (W)I(T) next turn. Nevermind that she might take the spot, playing (W)I(T) is mathmatically superior. Like, there is no debate, IT IS SUPERIOR. Because it WINS THE GAME and my fail play doesn't! I could have went 8-0 but I had to fail at least one game I guess.
