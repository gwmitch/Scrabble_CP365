>cesar: ADIIIOV J8 .OVID +19 19
#note i had a few racks today with this situation -- you score just enough to keep a terrible leave. do you score or do you trade? i'm never quite sure what to do. 19 points seemed like enough. quackle likes -IIIOV by 0.5. my internal valuator is almost calibrated! (-0.5)
>roy: AEG 10H GA.E +8 34
>cesar: AAEFIIM G9 MAFIA +23 42
#note what do you do against a human? open the board? i'm willing to bet ME(D)IA would be played by most experts. MAFIA does sim best, but i'm probably not taking his last move into account.
>roy: ?AEGTWY 13B GATEW.Ys +78 112
#note not again, i said to myself. i am pretty sure all of my opponents today blank-bingoed somewhere in the first two or three turns. what a tough tournament this has been!
>cesar: BEEHILT B10 BLI.HT +36 78
#note time to switch to hyper aggressive mode. crap. BILGE sims best; BLIGHT is probably overdoing it. (-2)
>roy: MX 11I M.X +46 158
>cesar: AEEENRS D7 SERENA.E +68 146
#note well at least i got that. now i'm all caught up :P
>roy: ?CLORST M5 CORSLeT +73 231
>roy: ?CLORST --  -73 158
#note i challenged it off after holding for about 3-4 minutes. UPBYE is an adverb.
>cesar: AENNORR E10 NON. +16 162
#note i stongly considered the ridiculous YO but it didn't seem like i coud draw much there anyway. quackle likes balancing my rack with NARY. i was unfortunately not focused enough to do that after dropping two games in a row... EN blocks the bingos but looks so terrible that i can't imagine that being the right play. is it? (-18) to NARY. NARY also blocks high scoring bingos but allows SECTORAL.
>roy: ?CLORST L3 COuLT.RS +78 236
#note yeah, my move was rotten. i shouldn't have let him play this. i didn't see it but didn't look too closely, saw things like corselet.
>cesar: AEINPRR 3I PRI.ER +26 188
#note i don't know if hyper aggressive mode works well here. quackle likes the more sober and reasonable YAR. i also wanted to play that, but in situations like this, i am bad at quantifying which play has a less miniscule chance of winning. (-6)

#note after laying this down i thought to myself "i need a miracle". 
>roy: AEORSTU 4A OU.RATES +70 427
#note he immediately lays this down. i could not stop myself from muttering 'unbelievable' unfortunately. :(
>cesar: EFHIKOQ E3 H. +5 336
#note a miracle has happened!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EF 3F is better. (-6)
