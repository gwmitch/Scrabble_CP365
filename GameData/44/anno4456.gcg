#note I just instinctively threw down the highest-scoring Q play I could find. That's a significant mistake. EVITED J5, keeping QI on the rack, is best. VIDE 13J is better, DIVE 6J is better, just dropping the Q above the I in IMPI is better. I really suck at knowing when to play ugly tiles like the Q.

#note Quackle likes trading to keep E, trading to keep EN, playing VENUE, and playing this. (Statically, ONE 15F is good, but I can't imagine what would happen with that EEUV leave down the road. Bad things.) I like the idea of scoring 21 here to get back in the game -- sure, I have to bingo, but maybe that can wait until after I block the triple? I still like this play. The sim thinks it's close.

#note Oops, FORESTAL doubles the F and scores 8 more. Stupid miss.

#note Okay, I'm sorry. I must strenuously object to Quackle telling me to make a lower-scoring play keeping the S. Why do I want the S on this board? Bingoing looks unlikely, pluralizing anything for any significant number of points looks unlikely as well. I think my only shot is to score a lot more than him and hope to outrun. I'm pretty confident this is the play -- I don't like OOH or OHO in the N6 hotspot.

>Bruce_Shuman: DEHOTUU E4 HOTE. +18 351
#note This is what lost Bruce the game, I think -- if he starts playing off U's (there are two more in the bag, mind you), he might have a shot at staying ahead. The two best options are UH A14 (scores 17, takes out a triple, gets rid of one U, leaves one in the bag) and DUEL E5 (scores 12, gets rid of one U, sets up a huge H play with which to outrun me).
>Evans_Clinchy: AEFLNRR F2 FRENA +29 352
#note Wow. This is a huge mistake -- Bruce can actually win the game by playing AHED 4D and blocking my one outplay (HERL).
>Bruce_Shuman: ADUUUU B6 DU. +8 359
#note ...and he doesn't see it. I'm so lucky.
