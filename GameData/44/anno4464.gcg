>Quackle: IKLRUXY 7E LUX +40 40
>Geoff: DDENRWY E7 ..WNY +22 48
#note Took a while on this move..(LA)WNY wins the sim by a surprising lot. DDER is a much better leave than the competing 20ish plays offer, true. Considered DRY(LA)ND and (LA)RDY as well.
>Quackle: ?ABIKRY D11 KIRBY +45 85
>Geoff: DDEILPR 15A DID. +27 75
#note DIDY or PILY same spot...
>Quackle: ?ADELRT A8 TReADLE. +83 168
>Geoff: EELNOPR C12 PE +16 91
#note Another blah fishing play. Okay, F11 ELOPE for 23. I should take more points than I do.
>Quackle: AIMQSTU B6 QUA +34 202
>Geoff: AEELNOR 5B ANOLE +23 114
#note Quackle likes F10 OE. Okay, maybe LEARN plus C at H8 leads to something good. ANOLE is second, about 3 points back.

#note This is going well...AE wins, what else am I gonna do?
>Quackle: IJRSSTU I4 JURISTS +77 324
>Geoff: AAEEINR 4I .ANE +22 176
#note Saw IN(J)ERA# right away, but wanted to keep one of either N or R. Not much difference between these or any sane play here...nothing to say beyond this point, really.
