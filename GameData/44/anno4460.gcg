>Kurt_Davies: CDORW 8D CROWD +28 28
>Evans_Clinchy: FGJNOPQ -FGJNOPQ +0 0
#note Ugh... really, keep NG? What if I don't draw an I? Doesn't it suck then? Didn't feel like taking the risk. Trade seven.
>Kurt_Davies: ?AEMRTU H8 .RUMbEAT +80 108
#note MATURERS = 86
>Evans_Clinchy: ABDEEGO 7E EGO +16 16
#note Seems right given the situation. Doesn't turn over too many tiles, doesn't block up too many bingo lanes. Gotta bingo soon.
>Kurt_Davies: DLOP 6G PLOD +19 127
>Evans_Clinchy: ABDEGII 5I BIG +19 35
#note Missing ABIDE. But how good is the GI leave if there are no N's to bingo through? I dunno, I think this is a close call.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?EEHIRR L9 HERRIEs +77 216
#note I'm supposed to pass up the bingos and play HIREE. Why didn't I think of this? The plus to this play, though, is it creates some volatility -- the C hook on HERRIES can get me a ton of points. Gimme a break, I'm trying to win the tournament here. Gotta go all out.

>Kurt_Davies: ABIORRS M4 BARRIOS +69 326
#note Scrabble makes me sad.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEITTTY K9 TYE +28 279
>Kurt_Davies: EE 7L E.E +3 329
#note Yeah, he saw the CHERRIES possibility too. Shocker.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAHILTT L1 HILA +30 309
#note HAET 14J is the volatility play here -- maybe I can draw an S and jump back into this thing. HILA is sort of useless -- it scores 30, but he can easily score 30 right back, and the leave's not that amazing. Meh.
>Kurt_Davies: ALU 1L .ULA +21 350
>Evans_Clinchy: ACETTUV 2K V.TAE +24 333
#note Wow. I missed EXUVIA, EXUVIAE and EXUVIATE. Sick spot. How unfortunate that I didn't see it.
>Kurt_Davies: ENP F10 PEN +34 384
>Evans_Clinchy: CDEETUU 14J DU. +17 350
#note I'm hoping to block QI and Q-stick him. Maybe, just MAYBE I have a shot at stealing this one if the bag has an I, but no Q. ERUCT 12K, though, might be th better blocking play.
>Kurt_Davies: IMOOQSV C2 QI. +24 408
#note Yeah, it didn't work.
>Evans_Clinchy: CEENTUY 6M .YE +27 377
#note ERUCT 12K is definitely best now. He's going to score as much as possible with his clunky tiles (think MOOS 11C), and then I have a pretty YEN I8 outplay. In reality, I didn't see the CROWDY hook. Oh well.
>Kurt_Davies: MOOSV O4 VO. +10 418
#note Meh... just take the points and play MOOS. Plenty of V spots out there.
>Evans_Clinchy: CENTU C11 TUN +12 389
#note Time trouble... STILL not seeing ERUCT!
>Kurt_Davies: MOS B12 MOS +17 435
>Kurt_Davies:  (CE) +8 443
