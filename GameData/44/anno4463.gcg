>Quackle: ?ADHORT 7H AH +26 40
>Geoff: AAEIIPS 6I AIA +15 40
#note Same play at 10I (making HOYA instead of AHOY) sets up my S better, perhaps. Definitely worth it to go with AIA# over AI, I think.
>Quackle: ?DNORRT H5 DR...NRoOT +65 105
#note Um, yeah, that will do...funny Quackle artifact that the blank is on H12 instead of H13.
>Geoff: EEFILPS 15D FILES +72 112
#note Sim agrees that FILES is better than the bingo (or FLIPS, PELFS, etc.)
>Quackle: FINORTU 5K FOU +22 127
>Geoff: EHLNPTU G13 HU. +21 133
#note 5C UPHEL(D) or N1 PENULT, both of which I should have seen. HU(E) isn't horrible, but I agree it's a little too fishy.
>Quackle: ADEINRT M2 DAT.RINE +72 199
>Geoff: ELNPQTZ E14 Q. +11 144
#note Maybe I wasn't patient enough; could have taken points with ZEP L1 (Quackle's preference) or other choices, or exchanging.

>Quackle: EGIMNST 13G ..ING +26 322
>Geoff: ABIIRRT 5C BRAIR. +18 274
#note Yeah, too much. I felt the need to open up, saw BRIARD, remembered BRAIRD#, which looks a little better, and jumped on it. But why not keep a better leave with BIRD, BRAID, RABID etc. in the same spot? Little things...
>Quackle: EEKMSTU 4D EEK +26 348
>Geoff: ?DIISTV 10F VI. +20 294
#note Gah, DIV(ER)SITy. Didn't look long enough at the blank as a Y. Didn't cost me but a few points of equity, but still, the miss changed the complexion of the game enough to hurt.
>Quackle: EMMSTUY 14K SUMY +32 380
>Geoff: ?DIILST 3A DITS +13 307
#note Hoping that Quackle is led off course by its kibitzer and somehow allows me a 3x3, heh. IDL(ER) D1 does that as well and preserves better stuff. Bah, I'm drawing dead by this point anyway.
>Quackle: CEEEIMT A1 ME.IC +33 413
>Geoff: ?AEILRW C5 .RAWLIEr +64 371
#note Lazy; pretty clear in retrospect that I should have forgone the bingo and fished the W. Nothing wins anyway, but I'm guaranteed an outbingo with 5 of 8 remaining tiles.
