>Webster_Phillips: IRSTVYY -IRSTVY +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: CEFOPTV 8D COVET +26 26
#note Best.
>Webster_Phillips: EMRV E7 V.MER +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: AADEFNP 7G FAD +24 50
#note Lots of good choices in this position, in which 4 more choices sim within 2 points of the sim winner, 9G FA.  This is one of those choices.  9G FAD sims 1.6 pts better than this - I guess to prevent any comebacks if he has an H.
>Webster_Phillips: FZ 10D F.Z +35 55
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHNOP 9G HEAP +30 80
#note Two plays stand out here:  J7 OPAH 25, and this choice, with nothing else simming within 4 points.  OPAH and HEAP toggle back and forth, and after 1500 2-ply iterations they're still dead even.
>Webster_Phillips: ENW 10I WEN +19 74
>Jim_Burlant: AANORSU 11J AURA +17 97
#note Didn't know RUANA, which would have played at 11G and is the best play.   Other choices are all 11I and 11 J plays (ANOA, ANA, and this choice).  
>Webster_Phillips: HLLRT M8 THR.LL +26 100
>Jim_Burlant: ENOSSSW 8L S.OW +24 121
#note Best.  Nothing else sims within 5 points.
>Webster_Phillips: BIO 6H BIO +16 116
>Jim_Burlant: ENNORSS 12C NOS +17 138
#note Whoops, had no idea there was an 8 from the W, WORNNESS.  (That's p > 17000 btw!) Ouch.  As non-bingo options go, J9 PEAN, 12H RONNE(L)S and this choice fare best.
>Webster_Phillips: AIIN 5E INIA +15 131
>Jim_Burlant: EINRSST 14G INSERTS +69 207
#note Quackle favors SINTERS and ESTRINS by roughly 3 points over this choice.  But the 7's are the only playable bingos here.
>Webster_Phillips: ??DEIIL 15A DaILIEs +72 203
#note Well, I don't feel bad now -  15B MIDLIFE or 15B MIDLINE are Webster's best choices, even better than O8 WIELDIER or O8 WIELDING.  Webster is at 33%.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEGJN 5J JADE +33 240
#note 5J JAG wins by 1.1 ponts over JEED, with this choice 0.8 pts behind JEED.  I'm at 66%.
>Webster_Phillips: AKO 13G KOA +29 232
>Jim_Burlant: EGIMNNY 4K YIN +25 265
#note A bad miss - couldn't think of MINNY or MINGY 4K.  And this costs me the game, as you'll see in a couple of turns.
>Webster_Phillips: IQ 4E QI +24 256
>Jim_Burlant: EGGMNOP 13B MOP +22 287
#note What's my biggest threat here?  I was sure that his last play of QI had effectively shut row 3 down, and I saw a 40-point X play on row 13 as my biggest remaining threat.  Quackle agrees in principle, even if it doesn't like my choice (POEM 14B wins).  The only plays that would have saved me, as you'll see in a moment, were 3L MOG and 3L GONG.
>Webster_Phillips: ELORTTY 3F LOTTERY +78 334
#note My winning chances have dropped from 65% to not even 20 now.  Ouch.  Play incorrectly scored as 77.
>Jim_Burlant: DEGGNTU H1 GU. +12 299
#note 12H EGG wins, but this simes in a virtual dead heat with 7G FADGE.  I felt my only hope was to open a bingo line and pray for the miracle row 1 bingo.
>Webster_Phillips: EX 6M EX +28 362
>Jim_Burlant: DEEGNOT 11A EGO +7 306
#note Opening another line, since the extra points for FADGE aren't going to help me if he makes a cheap play on row 1.  This isn't one of the original quackle choices, but this wins the 2-ply sim hands down.
>Webster_Phillips: BCEGIRU A8 CUB.R +30 392
>Jim_Burlant: ADEENTU -  +0 306
#note Confused this with the phony CONER*.  <<Lost challenge>>
>Webster_Phillips: AGI 12I AG +13 405
>Jim_Burlant: ADEENTU 1F UN.ATED +11 317
>Webster_Phillips: I N8 .I +7 412
>Webster_Phillips:  (E) +2 414
#note Final score recorded as 413 - 317.
