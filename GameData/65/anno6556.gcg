>Marlon_Hill: DGHIT 8D DIGHT +24 24
>Evans_Clinchy: BEGHIMS 9G MIB +25 25
#note MIG seems close. EGHS is a decent leave though, I'll roll with it and take a couple extra points.
>Marlon_Hill: ?ACEIIP D3 EPICe.IA +74 98
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEGHNS C9 HANGS +37 62
#note In hindsight, it looks pretty weak to blow up this rack for just 37. Fishing off EH might be a really good idea, even if Marlon would likely call me a knucklehead for it.
>Marlon_Hill: AAJR 12A JA.RA +42 140
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEEFSS A12 .EFE +42 104
#note Considered JADE since this is a considerably F-friendly board, but took the points instead. The 11E spot isn't likely to stay open long.
>Marlon_Hill: ?LLNOTZ 5C Z.LL +26 166
>Evans_Clinchy: AADNSSW 3C W.ASANDS +80 184
#note Phew, good thing this stayed open.
>Marlon_Hill: ?ANORRT 13E gRANTOR +59 225
>Evans_Clinchy: ACDIOUV H1 VI.CA +39 223
#note Heh. VINCA through the N on the triple is both the best and second-best play here.
>Marlon_Hill: AEEENTT 11E TENET +14 239
>Evans_Clinchy: DIMOQTU 10H MOD +21 244
#note Quackle likes QUIP 4A. Typical. It's a volatile play -- I'm scoring 40, and considering the pool, Marlon could easily hit me back for 42 with QUEER or QUEEN or QUEUE or something. I opted to hold onto my QU- and wait for something safer, and MOD has the benefit of taking my I hook. The only problem is it also takes an E, which I can probably infer from TENET that Marlon has. Maybe I should just stop overthinking this and take QUIP.
>Marlon_Hill: AELX 14I AXEL +56 295
>Evans_Clinchy: FILQSTU 15D QUILTS +78 322
#note This elicited a very loud noise from Marlon.
>Marlon_Hill: EGOR 12J GORE +24 319
>Evans_Clinchy: EFNNOOY 11K FOY +39 361
#note Blanks (both his) and esses (all mine) are gone, so this lane is effectively shot.
>Marlon_Hill: BRU M9 BU..R +26 345
>Evans_Clinchy: DENNOTV 15L OVEN +27 388
#note And now the pool just keeps getting uglier. Yikes.
>Marlon_Hill: EY 14N YE +22 367
>Evans_Clinchy: DNPRTUW B7 TUP +13 401
#note This is really cruel. I'm opening a triple lane that given the pool, he can't possibly use -- he can only block it. And there's actually a decent chance of me drawing REWIDEN, which would play in two spots (including this one for 103).
>Marlon_Hill: I 7B .I. +3 370
#note Clever block, but as luck would have it, my outbingo plays elsewhere.
>Evans_Clinchy: DEINORW 1G O.ERWIND +66 467
#note And thus our back-and-forth nailbiter of a game becomes a 119-point blowout. Having your opponent draw four turns of complete garbage sure does help.
