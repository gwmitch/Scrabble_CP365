>Seth_Lipkin: ?FLMSXZ -FLMZ +0 0
>Evans_Clinchy: ADGIIMP 8E PIMA +16 16
#note This play is pretty bad. In addition to being weak defensively compared to GIP, it also keeps a DGI leave that's really hit-or-miss. If I don't draw an N soon, this gets ugly.
>Seth_Lipkin: EX 9G EX +24 24
>Evans_Clinchy: DEGIINT 10C IGNITED +76 92
#note Of course I get the lucky draw to bail me out.
>Seth_Lipkin: ??DEGIS 11H DESIGns +79 103
>Evans_Clinchy: ACEINNP N4 PINNACE. +65 157
#note Seth was chastising himself for giving me an S to work with, but he had no way of knowing I'd lucked into another bingo. To his credit, he found the highest-scoring play with his blanks.
>Seth_Lipkin: OY O7 OY +32 135
>Evans_Clinchy: EFLRSVW C9 W.VER +30 187
#note FIVER is stronger defensively, but I wanted no part of the uglier leave.
>Seth_Lipkin: HOU 4L OU.H +26 161
>Evans_Clinchy: AFHJLLS B12 HAJ +33 220
#note This is an aggressive play with five T's and two S's besides my own still unseen. Perhaps a safer option is FALL 7H. But I didn't want to cling too long to a J that might be a liability on this board. Let's roll the dice with HAJ.
>Seth_Lipkin: EFI 15A FIE +32 193
>Evans_Clinchy: FLLNSTU A8 FULLS +34 254
#note Better take the spot now before Seth jumps on it.
>Seth_Lipkin: AKUW 7C WAUK +25 218
>Evans_Clinchy: ELNORRT L8 LON.ER +16 270
#note He's within striking distance with a bingo on his rack. I've got a rack full of useless one-pointers. This is the pivotal turn of the game, and I sadly have no idea what to do here. Quackle is telling me that the best option here is to play at 7H with the TAXED/RAXED hook -- TORN, ROTL, TORR, etc. That's a way to score and balance without hoping any crazy bingo lanes. Good thought, but unfortunately for me it wouldn't do anything to prevent what happens next.
>Seth_Lipkin: ABEEINS 5F BEANIES +70 288
#note Uh oh.
>Evans_Clinchy: ARRRTTV H1 TART.R +21 291
#note This is what I want -- points, ditching the duplicated consonants, opening a few bingo lanes. Maybe I can win this thing after all.
>Seth_Lipkin: BGILOOT 2C OBLIG.TO +65 353
#note Or maybe not.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAAMRTV O1 AMA. +27 318
#note Had to clean up the garbage and score a little to stay alive. This seems as good as anything.
>Seth_Lipkin: CDU 13J CU.D +14 367
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEORTV M13 .E +3 321
#note This play is part fish, part diversion. Seth just blocked OVERRATE through the R in line 13, so I've got to create another bingo lane. Obviously, Seth will have to block. But when he does, I could possibly hit OVERTART 4A if I draw an R. Not likely, but at least it's a prayer.
>Seth_Lipkin: DINQRTZ 15M NIT +13 380
>Evans_Clinchy: AEOORTV 2N O. +8 329
#note One more shot at OVERTART...
>Seth_Lipkin: DEOQRYZ 1A ZED +42 422
>Evans_Clinchy: AEORSTV 3F TO.AS +18 347
#note Going for the Q-stick here, taking out both spots.
>Seth_Lipkin: OQRY D2 .OY +16 438
>Evans_Clinchy: ERV 4A VER. +14 361
#note Couldn't find a way to slowplay out and milk the Q-stick. OBLIGATOR does it.
