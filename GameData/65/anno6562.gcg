#note BRUGH is also a good option, but I like my move, which angles for either the BUNCHIER or BUNCHING extension.

#note Much better than XU because I set up a second spot for the X.

#note At this point I felt like I had been doing everything I could with my racks but was still falling hopelessly behind.  Now I had a rack I couldn't score with... w-w-wait a minute!

#note This move sent a strong signal to me.  He must have something close to a bingo rack, probably with the blank.  Furthermore, he doesn't have the Z, as otherwise he surely would have played it at 3C.  So I made a play which scored well and set up nice spot for the Z, hoping to draw it.
