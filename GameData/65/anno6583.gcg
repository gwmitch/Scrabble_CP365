>Jim_Burlant: EHISTUW 8D WHITE +30 30
#note WITHE wins by a hair, with nothing else simming within 3 points of this choice..
>Lester_Schoenbrun: IJNO 9C JOIN +31 31
>Jim_Burlant: ADLNSTU H2 UNSALT.D +60 90
#note The only playable bingo.  
>Lester_Schoenbrun: AK 10F KA +33 64
>Jim_Burlant: CDIOTUZ 5H .ZOIC +32 122
#note 7F DITZ and 5D ZODIAC are the star plays here.  This choice is mediocre due to vowel placement.
>Lester_Schoenbrun: AW 6H .AW +38 102
>Jim_Burlant: DEFTTUY 11C DUTY +27 149
#note Couldn't think of TUFTY, which defintely would have been best.
>Lester_Schoenbrun: IOQT 2G Q.OIT +16 118
>Jim_Burlant: BEFNRST 12A FRET +29 178
#note Quackle recommends a fish with J1 FIB; this play sims second, roughly 4 points down.
>Lester_Schoenbrun: ELX A12 .LEX +42 160
>Jim_Burlant: BDEEENS 13C BEE +25 203
#note Had no idea there was a 7, BENDEES, in this rack.  
>Lester_Schoenbrun: HPU 1J HUP +18 178
>Jim_Burlant: ADEENNS 3J DEAN +20 223
#note I'll give myself a pass for not knownig BENDEES on the last turn, but this is pretty sad.  I saw ENSNARED and ADENINES but missed the high-prob 7 in here, which is the only playable bingo.   As non-bingo plays go, this is pretty solid, winning 75%.  But really, there's no excuse for missing ENNEADS I9.
>Lester_Schoenbrun: DGO I8 DOG +23 201
>Jim_Burlant: EEFLNST 11I ELF +18 241
#note Best.
>Lester_Schoenbrun: AALV 4D LAVA. +16 217
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEENST G6 BE. +18 259
#note I only saw BENNETS and ABSENTER with this rack and couldn't find SUBTEEN or BENE(F)iTS.  Surprisingly, I don't take a big hit at all for this miss, and shockingly, this sims best, at a higher winning percentage than any of the bingos and at near- equivalent valuation.  I'm at 92% right now.
>Lester_Schoenbrun: AIV 5C VIA +18 235
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEMNST H11 SCENT +37 296
#note No playable bingos here, and this sims best.  I'm at 94%, though that's about to shrink pretty quickly.  
>Lester_Schoenbrun: AEORSSU L7 AROUSES +74 309
#note Despite his lead, Lester is only at 47% winning chances.  But given my next rack, his chances reduce quite drastically.
>Jim_Burlant: ??MMNOR 4L ROM +22 318
#note Would never have found any of the bingos ( MOTORMEN, MOTORMAN, or MORTMAIN) but those are not the best plays since they only score 60 with both blanks.  This play wins the sim at 92%.
>Lester_Schoenbrun: NRY 7K N.RY +8 317
>Jim_Burlant: ??GGMNO 6N MO +23 341
#note N6 GYM is Quackle's preference becaus it's obviously wanting me to fish for the bingo.  I'd rather just outrun him since he's drowning in 1-point tiles.  I also want to keep the row 15 threat alive so he has to block, which he probably won't be able to do while scoring enough to keep up with me.  I definitely don't want to play long here given those 4 unseen I's.
>Lester_Schoenbrun: IIR J11 .IRI +6 323
>Jim_Burlant: ??EGGNP G13 PiE +17 358
#note Forgot the P back-hook to ROM; only remembered the S.  Doh!  O1 plays (NEeP, GooP, etc.) all score 35 compared to 17 for this, but it's just spread at this point - with that collection of vowels, Lester can't win.  Play misscored as 16.
>Lester_Schoenbrun: AEIIOR 13J .O.IER +12 335
>Jim_Burlant: ?GGN 9K G.NGs +7 365
#note Couldn't remember if NOGG took the S and wasn't willing to chance it for 1 more point.  9H DOGGONE is the best play here.
>Jim_Burlant:  (AI) +4 369
#note Final score recorded as 368 - 335.
