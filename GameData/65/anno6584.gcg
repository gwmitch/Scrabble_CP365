#note Dave: "Total brain freeze here.  I overlooked the FIDGETY hook, but even without that I had better choices.  But I was rewarded for my suboptimal choice."

>Joey: ?ALNNTU G3 UNTAN.Le +61 196
#note I didn't see NONADULT.  Also available was the safer UNDULANT.

#note Lots of appetizing choices here on a now ridiculously open board.  ABSINTH 15H takes away most of the hotspots.  As it turns out, he would have had BASTE O11 for a ton.
>Dave: ABEEINT 15J .ABINE +33 311
>Joey: ABNOUUV 15A BUN.A +30 335
#note Or BUOY.  Saving the O for OPACIFIED wasn't a bad idea though.
>Dave: AEEILTX O7 LATEXE. +45 356
#note "I liked this both to take away O8 and to give myself the best chance to pick up some stuff that would play with the I from O1."
>Joey: EHIOOUV L8 HOOVE. +32 367
>Dave: DIJKMNR 6D R.J. +26 382
#note "I was pretty sure DINKUM was the right play, if it was good.  But I wasn't sure if it was good."
>Joey: ILOOOTU C12 LOI. +18 385
#note I confess to actually not remembering OPACIFIED, just like I did in game #2984.  But it wouldn't have allowed a little last minute drama.
>Dave: DEGIKMN B9 KING +17 399
>Joey: AOOTU E2 OUT........ +18 403
#note The only way I can win is if Dave challenges and it's good.  Dave pauses clock and we go over to Zyzzyva.  The first half of my wish comes true....
>Joey: AOOTU --  -18 385
#note But not the second half.  The phoney died a hero, though.  I still think OUTGNAWN is less plausible than this.
