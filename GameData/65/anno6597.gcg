#note This is awful!  I was so focused on the "cute" play of GAMINESS, I missed out on BOSKAGES for 107.  
>Ian: DIPT H12 DIPT +32 108
>Laurie: AAEEEEP -AEEE +0 80
#note Not sure why I thought it would be a good idea to keep two vowels.  It wasn't.  J4 EPEE  is another alternative

>Ian: ?DHILNU C5 UNH.ILeD +66 252
#note B1 HUDDLING and HURDLING score 12 more.  DUNGHILL is also a valid word that would play.

>Ian: ETU D12 UTE +18 339
>Laurie: AEGNRTU 6I .UG +8 238
