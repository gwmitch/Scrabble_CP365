>Cheryl_Tyler: EORRTUV 8D TROUVER +72 72
#note Had no idea if this was good, and didn't want to chance losing my bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEGIO D4 GODE.IAs +68 68
#note I haven't studied my back-hooks to phony 7's yet, so I didn't now the E back hook to TROUVER.  This limited me to E column bingos.
>Cheryl_Tyler: EFIN C10 FINE +20 92
>Jim_Burlant: ELNNSTU K2 TUNNELS +75 143
>Jim_Burlant: ELNNSTU --  -75 68
#note Again, not knowing the back hook kills me.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AIP C2 PIA +13 105
>Jim_Burlant: ELNNSTU F4 UNST.LEN +62 130
#note Hey, I thought this was good.  This sims at 56%, but TUNNELS K4 wins 63.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AGIO B3 AGIO +14 119
>Jim_Burlant: BFGHKQS -BFGKQ +0 130
#note Yikes.  Best exchange, K(E)F for 19 coughs up huge points in the sim.  
>Cheryl_Tyler: ?DEEORU K6 OvERDUE +75 194
#note Or UrODELE.
>Jim_Burlant: EEHMRST A5 THERMES +93 223
#note Best bingo, with a bonus.  This play wins 58%.
>Cheryl_Tyler: ACNORUW -  +0 194
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: ADELNNU L4 DUN +10 233
#note Arrgh.  Yet another bingo I don't know makes it into my racks. Sigh.  This is weak.  In the absence of any good plays, take away a potential J  bomb.  12G UNANELED wins 93%.  This play wins 70.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AGNPR L11 PRANG +28 222
>Jim_Burlant: AELLMNS 15L .LAM +21 254
#note Didn't know legman; I thought that was 2 words. This play sims well, within 1 point of LEGMAN, the sim winner.
>Cheryl_Tyler: EJST 14A JEST +30 252
>Jim_Burlant: CELNRSW J3 CLEW +31 285
#note Best, winning 71%.  But my winning chances are about to take a dive.
>Cheryl_Tyler: OX 15A OX +63 315
#note Ouch.  Cheryl is back at 61%.
>Jim_Burlant: BINORSV M1 VINO +17 302
#note Maybe a panic move, but I felt like I had to open something up here and unload the V asap.  Quackle says M11 ORB is best - looks right.
>Cheryl_Tyler: BI B12 IB.. +19 334
>Jim_Burlant: ABIQRSZ 14N ZA +48 350
#note Didn't know ZARIBA, which would have played at N10 for 74.   Predictably, in the absence of knowing ZARIBA, Quackle says I should unload the Q, but I felt that 48 points were too many to turn down with Q plays available at D1 and 2L.  I also considered IZARS 15D, but wanted to hold onto my I for a potential Q play.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AY M12 AY +23 357
>Jim_Burlant: BCEIQRS N10 QIS +36 386
#note Hmm.   Sim winner is to pass up the extra 11 points with QI D1.  I figured her odds of really hurting me were slim if something had to end in I, IT, or ID.  I figured wrong.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AOOTT 2C .OTATO +10 367
#note The bad rack forces a tough choice for her.
>Jim_Burlant: BCDEEIR 1F BED +33 419
#note H1 CORBIE, 1H BICE and H1 BODICE (all of which I didn't even look for) win 100%.  This play still wins 84.
