>Jim_Burlant: AEEINTY 8F AYE +12 12
#note Quackle prefers 8H YE, 8D YENTA, and 8G YE, but this is really more style preference than a clear-cut issue of right/wrong; the sim winner only sims 2-1/2 points ahead of this. 
>Jeff_Widergren: AEEOPQR -AEEOPQ +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: AACEINT G7 A. +6 18
#note Best.  G8 YA and H7 AE also worth consideration.
>Jeff_Widergren: AHJ 6E HAJ +28 28
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINOT 5C ICON +24 42
#note Didn't know CENTAI, which would have played at A1 for 41 and certainly made this a different game.    Apparently, the best non CENTAI choice is E5 OH, but I felt that I should try to at least score something and leave a good combo; I wasn't going to keep fishing.   Despite the difference in score, I "only" give up 6-1/2 points here to CENTAI.
>Jeff_Widergren: AEINSST H8 .TESIANS +77 105
>Jim_Burlant: ABDENTW 11D BAWD. +22 64
#note I didn't like any of the options in this position.  I didn't like this play but felt I wasn't going to get anywhere fishing, which is Quackle's preference.  Sim winner here is 13G WAB, and quackle docks me 7 points again.
>Jeff_Widergren: ?DEGOST 13B GODETi.S +70 175
#note 14A STEGoDON is Jeff's best bingo.  No matter, I'm in serious trouble now.
>Jim_Burlant: EENTUUV -EUUV +0 64
#note Whoops.  A bunch of row 12 plays score quite nicely here; I was too blinded by the UUV combo to even look for a play that didn't unload the V and a U. NEVE or tune 12C would have been huge.  Having said that - 12C TUNE wins the sim, and that doesn't even win 8%.
>Jeff_Widergren: DIQU 15D QUID. +25 200
>Jim_Burlant: EGINRRT 10H .R +2 66
#note My STRINGER bingo was blocked and I couldn't think of RETIRING.  Safe to say that, between his hot start and the awkward draws, I'm seriously rattled.  Anyway - RETIRING wins 11% if I wake up and find it.  I've played myself down to 3% here.

#note This is beyond pathetic; didn't occur to me that WIKIUP took a back S.

#note I finally wake up, but way too late to do anything but hopefully close some spread.
