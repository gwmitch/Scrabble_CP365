>Carl_Johnson: ?CEIMV 8G VIM +16 16
#note Carl told me after the game that he felt that maybe he had misplayed his opening rack and that he should have put down VICE since he had the blank. I don't recall what his 7th tile was.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AADEIT G2 ADApTI.E +65 65
#note Best choice here is G6 DI(V)AgATE, which I didn't know.  This choice sims 2-1/2 points down.
>Carl_Johnson: ?CELNPR 4A PReCLE.N +80 96
>Jim_Burlant: BDEFIOS F2 FO. +30 95
#note Best, winning 49%.  FIE in the same location also worth consideration.
>Carl_Johnson: AFOV C1 FOV.A +20 116
>Jim_Burlant: BDEEIKS A4 .IKED +36 131
#note Best.  1A KEF also worth consideration.
>Carl_Johnson: IQS J6 QIS +41 157
>Jim_Burlant: BEEEINS 6A .NEE +21 152
#note  I considered F9 BEE and this.  I felt F9 BEE would be reckless.  If I were trailing big, I'd open with F9 BEE.  But H2 BENE is clearly best; I just missed it.  While more of an equity slip than a blunder, this still probably wound up delaying my next bingo by at least 1, if not 2, more turns.  Maybe a game changer, maybe not.
>Carl_Johnson: NO H1 ON +12 169
>Jim_Burlant: ABEISTY 2B B.Y +16 168
#note 4 plays sim interchangeably here:  1A BEFIT, this choice, 2B YOB, and F9 BY.  It didn't occur to me to look for scoring plays that didn't unload the Y.  I felt F9 BY was needlessly reckless, and this play gives up less than 1 point to BEFIT after 1600+ 2-ply iterations.  Footnote:  if I had made the right play of BENE on the previous turn, my rack here is AEINSTY and I would fish off the Y at 2B.
>Carl_Johnson: BENS I1 NEBS +30 199
>Jim_Burlant: AAEISTY 1C .AY +16 184
#note Best.  Still sitting at 45% winning chances.  Not to belabor the point, but...had I played BENE 2 turns ago I'd either be sitting on AEINSTY and fish off the Y again...or I'd bingo with AMENTIAS I7 if I had drawn the A.  In any event I'd still be working on a SATINE rack.
>Carl_Johnson: EH 7I H.E +21 220
>Jim_Burlant: AEIRSTU -U +0 184
#note Arrrgh - I was hoping he'd play in the K column so I could play MURIATES J8, but so much for that.  Anyway -  I disagree with Quackle here.  Quackle, predictably, says I should fish with 6F UT or 8A DUI.  I didn't consider the latter (I'm not breaking up SATIRE that cheap), and I rejected UT for a simple reason:   I'm sitting on the S, why would I take away possible bingos down the E column for only 4 points?  I asked Carl about this position after the game and he agreed with my choice.  Short term this worked, but longer-term, I paid for it.
>Carl_Johnson: DHLO L4 HOLD +24 244
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIRST E6 SERIATE +73 257
#note Best bingo; I'm at 42%.
>Carl_Johnson: IX F10 XI +52 296
#note Hmmm.  For this particular game my exchange/bingo didn't work out; had I fished with UT and hit EATERIES he might have hit something for 30 with the X, but certainly not this.  But I'd still make the same plays again.
>Jim_Burlant: CMOOPUU M2 COMP +31 288
#note Chickened out on COMPO, which would have scored 35.  Sim winner is actually K3 CUM.   Is OOPU really superior to OUU?  Sim winner of K3 CUM sims at 20%.  This choice sims at 17, roughly 5 points down.  Regardless, given my next draw it really wouldn't have mattered what I put down. 
>Carl_Johnson: EJ 12C JE. +20 316
>Jim_Burlant: AORUUUU -OUUUU +0 288
#note This isn't a quackle-generated rack; this is the actual draw from the bag.  Could I have had a worse draw than this from this pool?  I'm down to 16-1/2% now...but Carl's next rack will probably make that 0.
>Carl_Johnson: DEINORS 13B SORDINE +97 413
#note 13C ORDINES scores 99.  Regardless, it's safe to say this one's pretty much over but for the final score now.
>Jim_Burlant: AAIRRTT 14A AIT +20 308
#note Best.  Just trying to keep hope alive.  Carl told me after the game this play had him nervous, as he had nothing to block anything I was trying to set up.
>Carl_Johnson: LU H12 L.U +4 417
>Jim_Burlant: AGGRRTU 15A GRAT +41 349
#note Apparently N5 TRUG wins the sim at 1% with this play coming in at 0.38%.  No matter, Carl complimented me on this for the nice setup.  
>Carl_Johnson: W 5K W.. +16 433

>Carl_Johnson: GO 6L .OG +19 452
>Jim_Burlant: AAGRUUZ N6 .AZAR +17 386
#note I thought there might be a play coming at O8, so I sacrificed a few scoreboard points to block that.  Turns out I guessed wrong.
