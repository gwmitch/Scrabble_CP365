#note Well, this is pretty interesting. Top of the sim is COWP 8F (why the vowel opening?) then POW/WOP which are justifiable. Why my move is 7th is something I can't really answer. I reckon it's the poor defense and the not-so-strong-though-synergistic leave that makes my play weak. Don't ask me why COWP in that position is the best though.

#note Best Speedy Player-wise, but on a sim, this is about 6th - losing to moves like PAIOC(K) 10E, which makes very little sense to me (since it opens and leaves a vowel heavy rack), and POI 7F (understandable, but hmm). The IO fish at K9 or OI fish at 9G also rank above my move.

>Toh_Weibin: EIIINOP E3 IONI. +14 41
#note E2 PIONI(C) seems to do best here, followed by moves like 12D OPINE and E5 PI(C)INE. My move is 4th - honestly though, I didn't know PIONIC, so the P wouldn't have been useful for me as a hook.

>Toh_Weibin: BEIIIPY H1 PYI. +33 74
#note L11 YIPE is a good move, preventing the A hook to ABUTTER (which I wasn't 100% sure of) and scoring a decent amount with an okay-ish leave. My move is probably second or third, possibly behind YIP at the same spot.

#note My move, (T)WIER and B(O)WIE all sim pretty close, but my move seems to be the worst of the 3. I can understand why TWIRE is worse than TWIER. BOWIE is quite obviously a grasp at a bingo, but at the cost of 14 points? Really not sure...

#note No missed bingos here. This sims OK. I9 F(A)B's close, but really not very necessary IMO.

#note Missing DAGO/A(BUTTER) E10.
>Toh_Weibin: ?BEIPRS 9F BEPR.ISe +78 217
#note The 9-letter P(RE)ScRIBE is available, but it's obviously too dangerous. I didn't see it.

#note Missing, to my fortune, N7 HiDALGA. This is a safer and better play.

>Toh_Weibin: ADELMNY A6 MYAL +45 336
#note Poor move, though it has one of the best scores - with so many Es in the bag, I should have been more aware of the bag and played DYNEL A5. All the top moves play off the E and keep the A.
