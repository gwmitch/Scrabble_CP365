>Evans_Clinchy: DEIQSTV 8G QI +22 22
#note This sims better than -QV, although I did think the exchange was worth considering.
>Will_Anderson: EEGILOU 9F OI +15 15
>Evans_Clinchy: DENRSTV 10C VENDS +32 54
#note This sims fine, although it's interesting that dumping two tiles with VOID 9E does so well also. I thought I'd just score 21 more rather than gamble on a fish.
>Will_Anderson: GLU 7H LUG +7 22
>Evans_Clinchy: AIIILRT C7 TRI.IAL +24 78
#note Pleasedon'tblockthispleasedon'tblockthispleasedon'tblockthisPHEW. Needed this to bail me out of the ugly rack.
>Will_Anderson: ?EEEORT 13A TE.OmERE +58 80
>Evans_Clinchy: EFIIRTY 12H FERITY +41 119
#note Or YETI down to the triple, but I figured I'd go for more points and take my chances digging into the bag.
>Will_Anderson: MOW 8A WO.M +36 116
>Evans_Clinchy: ADGINOO H12 ..OD +24 143
#note This scores the most, and the AGINO leave is palatable since I'm opening a bingo lane to potentially cash it in. I'll take it.
>Will_Anderson: APU M12 .AUP +18 134
>Evans_Clinchy: AAGINOY 15K YA.ON +33 176
#note Sim slightly prefers AGONY at E4, which I totally disagree with. YAPON is two extra points, it keeps a leave that's easier to stomach, and it doesn't recklessly open the board with a 40-point lead.
>Will_Anderson: EINN 12A IN.NE +22 156
>Evans_Clinchy: AAGIJTU J10 JU.A +27 203
#note Or JURAT. Figured it couldn't hurt to save an extra consonant.
>Will_Anderson: EILPRSS E2 LISPERS +78 234
>Evans_Clinchy: ADFGITX F5 AX +54 257
#note Not sure where I'm going from here with DFGIT, but this is the play.
>Will_Anderson: KOUZ 4A ZOUK. +56 290
>Evans_Clinchy: CDFGITT A1 DIT. +42 299
#note Not sure how much longer I can keep the shooty-outy-ness going here.
>Will_Anderson: ABDEERS K2 DEBASER +75 365
>Evans_Clinchy: CEFGHTW A10 TW..CH +42 341
#note Doesn't look like outrunning him without a bingo is going to happen, but I'll go down swinging.
>Will_Anderson: ?AENOTV O8 VENATiO. +83 448
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEEFGN 14E EF +28 369
#note Sure, why not.
>Will_Anderson: CGHILMR L3 HIM +33 481
>Evans_Clinchy: AABEGNO J5 GA.A +20 389
#note This is best, scoring 20 and keeping multiple decent outspots for BONE.
>Will_Anderson: CGLR C3 C.R +10 491
>Evans_Clinchy: BENO 2G BONE. +10 399
#note Umm, oops.
