#note A fine play, but for the minor detail of not being good in our book. (AMENDER MEANDER REEDMAN RENAMED ENARMED# REAMEND#).

#note I thought I had to at least take out the easy bingo spot (S-TINTS), but this might not have been best. Quackle says that GHI 15H, keeping EEERZ, wins 5% more often.

#note Interestingly, this was my opponent's 4th play of 3 or more tiles that didn't hit any premium squares. Not that they were bad plays or anything, I just thought that was kinda weird.

#note Brutal problem. EVERSION 15A was playable no matter what the last tile was, so playing BESHREW D2 would surely lose. Most racks would still be able to bingo out, but I had to hope to get lucky, for opponent to be "off by one".
