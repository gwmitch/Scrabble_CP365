#note UNSOWN or UNWON both better.  I would have played UNWON for sure if I'd seen it.

#note What a miss!  Q(U)RSH is best and obvious.  Don't worry--I start to play better soon.  Without QURSH/QOPH available, quiz:  what is the most stylish exchange?  Answer:  I think keeping PSH would be fun, because I saw during the game that any I gives TOWNS(HIPS) for 63!

#note I was pretty pleased with this.  Clearly better than AIRS(H)EDS--scores a couple more and much less dangerous.  Plus has some style!

>Jason: ?AEEHNR 2A HERm.EAN +74 460
#note as it turns out, the only bingo.  I looked for quite a few minutes as I'd racked up a lot of time on the clock with some easy turns and eventually found it.

#note buggered this up--for whatever reason didn't see the obvious GUIL(E)D on the bottom row or the less obvious but better (F)ULGID.

>Jason: L G8 ..L. +8 516
#note 2 more points hemmorhaged to PENCE(L).  Still, only 3 turns that were sub-optimal and I found the two flashy plays.  QURSH was an amazingly bad miss, but still, equity loss of about 30 in a game where I drew all the stuff is good for me.
