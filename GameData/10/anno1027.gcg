#note best:  9E GRUM 22.  not sure why i'm advised to pass the bingo.  because it doesn't hit a DWS?  not enough of a reason for me.

#note best:  15K FLONG 30.  blech.  this was the worst move I made all day.  I saw jigsawn watching me play which made me even more nervous.  i couldn't think of a decent play on row15 or row12 using my S.  the brain just wasn't working.  burned so much time and then gave up.  i didn't want to just leave row 15 wide open so i looked for a way to make it harder to use.  more minutes wasted.  frustrated i play OW which uses my only vowel and just one consonant for my rack.  i had a feeling this move would decide the game.

#note best:  J12 JO 19.  trying to set up a good J play next turn.  I have row12 to the Y or row 10 hooking my S.  
>Dona_Jinx: AA G13 AA +8 337
#note I guess she didn't know the S-hook.  She could have blocked both lines by playing AA at G11 but instead just blocked the Y.  
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: ABJOSTT 10C JABOTS +27 334
#note best:  F14 BA 21.  my play will make it close and i just hope that i can go out the next turn with enough points to win.  in retrospect, not a great plan since it is easy to use the J and hit the DWS given what's left in the bag.  
>Dona_Jinx: ENNNORU E10 .OURNE +16 353
#note she was under time trouble and didn't have time to properly play this out.  i'm fairly sure that playing either JEON or RENOWN wins.
