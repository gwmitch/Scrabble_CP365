#note I'm finally starting to learn about these situations.  A year ago, I would have had a hard time not playing FURIES.  But this play fishes, scores decently, and I keep my S while blocking the S hook that Q set up.   And I'm gonna draw NT and bingo next turn.

#note I spent two minutes on this rack.  I spent the first minute being annoyed that I had an unplayable PARANOEA.  Eventually, I realized that my unplayable word is a freaking EIGHT and I'm wasting time.

#note I almost went blonde on this rack.  It kind of reminded me of the time I almost missed BOGARTED against Dan Terkell because I thought BOGARTED was a seven despite writing the alphagram on my scoresheet.  In this case, I almost missed HAIRLINE because I thought I "almost" had HAIRLINE.  
>Quackle: CEOOPQX 15L C.OP +30 397
>Tasha: AFIIKOR 14D FAKIR +29 506
#note I spent about five minutes here.  I scanned the board to see if Q can play the Q.   Okay, there's no spot.  Good.  Second, I looked for Q's highest scoring X play.  I saw L4 GOX for 22 and 14F for 29.  I, of course, missed 1A OXES and an extremely obvious high scoring X play (and I know why I missed it, more on that later).  So I figured that 14F GOX is the best play so I looked for a play that messed up Q's plans while giving me a decent out in two.  I saw FAIR/FIAR first leaving IKO, but there's no place to play those KOI or IKON so I looked for something else.  I thought of switching the plays (playing 14F KOI instead) but I quickly dismissed that. Okay, there's FAKIR.  It gives back a 25 point EX play (note:  missing 15H EX), but whatever.  I'm tired of looking and I gotta rewatch the second season of Teen Wolf.  FAKIR leaves OI and that gives me 20 points for C1 IDOL and I get the Q from Q's rack.  BOOYA!!!
>Quackle: EGOQX N5 OX +52 449
#note *#^#&!S^!  I missed this because I saw Q's rack as EGOQX.  Since there's no place to play the Q, the best play in that rack is GOX.  Although I THOUGHT I was looking for the best X play, I was actually just looking for the best place for GOX.  
>Tasha: IO C1 I.O. +20 526
#note Although I knew I was going to play IDOL, I suddenly become alarmed because Quackle can play 1B QIS afterwards.  Why didn't I notice that before?  Well, obviously I can't play IDOL.  I gotta play OI somewhere else.  Okay, there's N2 OI for 10 to stick Q with the Q.  ...  .... ..... Wait a second,  I'm going out!  That's such a minor detail it's no wonder I almost forgot.
>Tasha:  (EGQ) +26 552
#note As always, I need to pay attention to detail, especially in endgame.  I had way too many dingbat moments in this game.  Blocking the X results in an out-in-three.  Played properly I gain 16 more points, with a nine point difference in spread.  I always miss good set up plays.
