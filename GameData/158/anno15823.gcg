>Bernard_Gotlieb: AAGNORX H8 AXON +22 22
#note I think ANGORA is the play here, H4, to set up his X if he draws E, I or U.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEHTU 11G U.HEATEd +70 70
#note oooh ATHE(N)EUm. I didn't know it.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEGRT 12D GRATE +29 51
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEILNP 10J PA +22 92
#note I didn't know PALA(T)INE either? Ouch...
>Bernard_Gotlieb: DLU M10 L.UD +10 61
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIILNY G8 YA +21 113
#note AI(R)Y. Oops. this is starting off pretty badly.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: APRT F6 PART +28 89
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILLNO 13J LOI. +5 118
#note Dunno
>Bernard_Gotlieb: III -III +0 89
>Joshua_Sokol: EEILNOU E10 EU.O +8 126
#note I considered LOUIE 14G but deemed it too dangerous. Maybe OU(R)IE is better here.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: III -III +0 89
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIILN 9F ...I +12 138
#note Dunno
>Bernard_Gotlieb: W 13E .W +10 99
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILNY 10D L.Y +32 170
#note looked like LINEY gave back too much. I couldn't bear to use the Y for 19 (5D YEA) when I had 32 for it... :P
>Bernard_Gotlieb: B K9 B.. +5 104
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEIIN -IIE +0 170
#note I didn't know AEDINE. I was tired of having too many vowels.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: IL D8 IL. +4 108
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEMNNW 8A WAD. +24 194
#note Ah. L8 NEW(T). I only saw DAWT there. I thought this was a bit defensive.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ENRSSTU B7 S.UNTERS +70 178
#note I guess not.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEFMNNS -DFN +0 194
#note Cool!!! (AXONE)MES! I kept the M over the D for scoring purposes.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AGOOZ E2 GAZOO +34 212
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEMNSS 2E .AMENESS +65 259
#note Still AXONEMES. I hesitated to play this since it was so volatile. Sim says it isn't much better than anything else, but it's a large enough disparity.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: IORT 1F TORI +26 238
#note I believe to have dodged a bullet there.
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEGJOR A12 DOER +30 289
#note The sim is liking 3C BR(A)G best, probably because if I draw another E I have JEE(Z) and if not I still likely score at A12. DOER is in 3rd place.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EIMN 4C MI.EN +32 270
>Joshua_Sokol: BEFGHIJ 3A FEH +32 321
#note I was kind of scared of the other F, but this seemed necessary. In actuality, L6 JIBE, D3 F(I)B or F(I)G are all very close to FEH.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: IQ L8 QI +25 295
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BCGIJK A1 KI. +30 351
#note I felt like I had to block the FF hotspot. My intuition was correct.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: FINO 1L INFO +27 322
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BCCEGJ I1 ..JECt +22 373
#note I wanted to get rid of the J... :P
>Bernard_Gotlieb: DEINTVV N1 .IVE +20 342
#note If he plays (OR)T, he comes within 6 points of me since I get stuck with the G.
