>Eric_Tran: AGGHMNT 8G GANG +12 12
#note GMN goes better than HTM, but GANG is better defense than GHAT.  4 ply says GHAT.  I usually prefer a closed board.  Against Cesar... not sure if I want open or closed.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AAOPSUW J6 WA. +15 15
#note it seems AOSU is better on this board than AOPSU. doesn't make much sense to me. (-3) GAWP
>Eric_Tran: EHMNTTV K4 THEM +27 39
#note VET is good defense, and makes it very difficult for him to score.  But, THEM is 8 more pts and more turnover.  Sim says VET - I choose wrong.  The defense is so important, since both leaves are crap.  Crap leave = emphasize defense.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ADOPQSU 4H QUO.A +48 63
>Eric_Tran: FNOOTVY 9F FOY +19 58
#note Didn't spot 7H FOAMY.  FOY makes it so easy for him to counter.  Sim also suggests 3L plays, which is bleh.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ADKPRSS M4 SPARK +27 90
#note the other move i considered here was 10E PADS but that would give up a lot i think. 7F DAK is simple and sims best. (-3)
>Eric_Tran: ENORSTV 6M .VO +14 72
#note His rack should be semi-random, so I don't mind AVO here.  
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DEEEIIS 8L E.ED +30 120
>Eric_Tran: AENRSTT 10B NATTERS +78 150
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?AEIIRS 5B SEnARII +73 193
>Eric_Tran: DDEEEUX L8 .XUDE +26 176
#note 1 D left; 1 S left. I liked opening the board and setting up my D.  Better than 6D EXED.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?AILSTU 13H TULAdIS +77 270
#note LAwSUIT 13I maybe is a little better maybe for the extra points, but i liked the defense of TULAdIS. (-1) also this is pretty lucky.
>Eric_Tran: BDEEMOO 4A DEMOB +36 212
#note Dislike killing the board, but this is so many pts.  will still be able to open the board later.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ABCFNNV 3D FAN +16 286
#note ? i guess this is probably a bad move. didn't see CABMEN/VANMEN (-8)
>Eric_Tran: EILNOOR A1 ROO. +15 227
#note too paranoid about opening new lines.  K9 ONO scores well and keeps a bingo leave.  I also wanted to slot an R at A1; but sim says LOI(D) there is also better.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BCGINOV C9 C.VING +30 316
>Eric_Tran: EILLNRU 14B I.LU +10 237
#note Sim likes LI(G)ULE or NIELL(O).  I preferred to play short to prolong the game.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BHIIIOT N10 HOI.T +32 348
#note maybe B2 HIES so a bingo doesn't screw me. although i would likely still win after one.
>Eric_Tran: EEJLNNR J10 JEL. +27 264
#note Hoping to hit 2 bingoes, or a bingo and a big Y play.  Also thought about finshing for REJOINED.  Either way, situation is very bleak.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BEIIPWY 14I PYE +45 393

>Cesar_Del_Solar: ABCIIIW 1F BI +11 404
#note 1A RABIC -9
>Eric_Tran: DELRZ 1K LEZ +18 347
#note F9 FEZ to block Cesar's best plays.
