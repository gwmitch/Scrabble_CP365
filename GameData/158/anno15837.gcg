>Cesar_Del_Solar: CGILMOS 8F CLOG +14 14
#note for some reason CLOG seemed better to me than COG. COG does bingo more. (-1.5)
>Eric_Tran: DGIOXYZ F8 .OZ +34 34
#note Definitely better to keep and set up the Y
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BIMNRRS H7 M.RN +6 20
#note i somehow missed BORN... (-4)
>Eric_Tran: DGISVXY 11D IVY +36 70
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BGIRSUY 10F .I.GY +26 46
>Eric_Tran: ADGJOSX C11 JOG +39 109
#note And this sets up the X! cesar: dammit eric
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ABCDRSU I6 BU. +12 58
#note ?? my thought process: immediately see SUBACRID. good. wait a second, that's not a word, that's what i always guess! what kind of a word is SUBACRID? ok, so what am i thinking of.. oh BAUDRICS# :( it doesn't fit. but why not play SUBACID then? or 12B BOD. i'm pretty bad at scrabble. (-52)
>Eric_Tran: ADFLSSX D10 F.X +44 153
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AACDRSU B12 CARD +29 87
#note J6 AD actually gives me a much higher average score next turn and gives up fewer pts. (-7)
>Eric_Tran: ADLNSST J5 LADS +27 180
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?AEPSTU 4G TEAcUPS +73 160
#note ? DUSThEAP is much better, or UPbEATS/UPTEArS. (-17)
>Eric_Tran: BENNRST 3F BENT +16 196
#note Board didn't seem friendly enough for bingos to fish off with B(E)N or N(E)B.  Sim really likes H1 BEN(E) -- there are lots of vowels left.  I have a lead on him in terms of building a bingo, so opening the board a bit is to my advantage, as well.  BENT is about 6 pts back.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ADILLSV 2B VILLAS +31 191
#note i don't know what is right here. i feel like VILLA gives up just way too many easy points, but quackle thinks it only gives up 4 more pts on average, and i get to keep the S. (-6.5)
>Eric_Tran: DENQRSW C1 W.NDER +20 216
#note wanting to his a Q play at K3 (or possibly 4A).  Lots of vowels to help me.  Non-intuitive to play off all my bingo tiles, but sims best.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DEEEENU A13 DEE +28 219
#note i think i've drawn like 50 Es in the first three games
>Eric_Tran: AEFOQRS K3 Q.A +28 244
#note Ugh.  Should not cash in the Q here - so dangerous.  Sim likes waiting with D4 OF.  This play is definitely a mistake.  Too hasty, should realise I need to change plans.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEENOTU 3K .UEEN +36 255
#note eric: -couldn't been a lot worse  cesar: EEEEEEEEEEEE
>Eric_Tran: EFOOPRS 2L POO +24 268
#note A few good choices.  this, 2M FOE, D2 LOOF, 2M OF.  LOOF makes his life too easy with full access to the O line.  2M OF looks really tempting.  His rack is pretty random.  but the pool is nice enough he should usually hit a 6-letter play at H1, and then I'm toast.  So, I settle for POO.  Take a small lead, keep a good leave, board is very closed.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEIOTTU 11J OUT +11 266
#note 11J ETUI is very clearly better. (-9)
>Eric_Tran: ?AEFIRS M7 FREeSIA +82 350
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEEEINT D2 .EE +14 280
#note MORE Es PLEASE. 4A EIDE is best.
>Eric_Tran: AEHHIKM N9 HM +27 377
#note I like that this closed well, and preemptively blocks the whole O line (eg NONINERT).  Sim likes B5 HAKIM then L9 MA(T)H.  Meh.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AAEINTT L11 .AT +12 292
#note i should have seen earlier there were no possible INN- 3-3s.
>Eric_Tran: AEHIKNT 5E KITE +23 400
#note I didn't notice something like ORATION would fit at B.  Sim likes plays that block it, like TRAIK or KRAIT.
