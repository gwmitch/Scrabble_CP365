>Jim_Burlant: AEEFOUX 8F FAUX +28 28
#note Put down EAUX 8G, then, for reasons I can't fathom now, decided that unloading the F was more important than keeping a consonant.  I should have gone with my gut.  While the sim says this is barely a 1-1/2 point dog at almost 2000 iterations, my next draw renders it a 25-point blunder.
>Mike_Early: DGIRV G6 GR.VID +16 16
#note Given this rack fragment, Q says Mike should play G7 VAGI or G5 VIGA.
>Jim_Burlant: EEEEMOO -EEEOO +0 28
#note This was not auto-pilot. I looked at MOO F10 and this.  As hard as it was to turn down 24 points, I didn't like that (a) it opened up D, L,N, R, S, and T hooks that weren't in my rack and (b) keeping 4, count 'em 4, E's, as it meant that I'd be wasting a bunch of them.  Q indicates that it's either 11C MOOED, this, or MOO, and the difference in the sim is stylistic preference as to which is best.  I opted to keep EM since the M looked to be a good scorer and was fairly positive when combined with the E.  46-2/3% to win (MOOED wins 47, MOO wins 46-1/4), but not for long.
>Mike_Early: AINOSTT 12E STATION +70 86
#note Only other bingo for Mike is OSTINATI and it scores 62.  Mik's winning 68% in a short sim.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEMNNV 11J MAVEN +28 56
#note Best - he's just drawn a fresh 7 and, with 3 S's in the bag, he has at best a 28% chance of having an S.  Definitely worth it for me to open up this hook.   Quackle agrees - this is best, winning 28%.
>Mike_Early: GILRS O7 GIRLS +29 115
#note Of course.  Sigh.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIILN 13B CILIA +18 74
#note  Any number of 13J plays score a whole lot more; INLACE wins the sim at 24%; this sims 8 points down and wins 3% less often.  I didn't look hard enough at that sice of the board.  Weak.
>Mike_Early: CEORZ 10D COZ.ER +37 152
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEINNW B10 WIN.E +36 110
#note I may have missed the last one, but there was no getting this one wrong.  This is best - nothing else worth considering.  And the blank has incrementally bumped my chances up to 32% in a short sim.
>Mike_Early: OTW 14E TWO +31 183
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEENOU 15G EBON +20 130
#note I saw TUBENOSE, couldn't think of BLUENOSE/?NEBULOSE - not that it mattered, since none of the bingos play.  I had no idea what to do here - the only option that unloads the U is D6 BOUNCE 11.  Nothing really stands out - best is apparently to play these same tiles for 5 more points at 7E with BORNE for 25.  This wins 2% less often and sims 4 points down.
>Mike_Early: OPRT 15A TROP +38 221
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEGPTU 13J GETUP +25 155
#note Deceptive rack - this group of letters doesn't even make any 8's. This is best. 14-1/2% to win.
>Mike_Early: IQ A11 QI +26 247
>Jim_Burlant: ?EILRSU 6E LU. +6 161
#note Didn't know that FLUERIC took the S, didn't know SURPLICE.  And, annoyed by my having gotten rid of a U only to get another one back, this turn is where Caro's misery threshold was crossed.  I alphagrammed all the possiblities through the G, and flat-out missed everything when I saw DEGILRSU.  Sad, but true.  The small consolation:  Mike had AJSY? in his rack.  Even if I find SLUDGIER (which would have been my choice had I not whiffed), that wins 3% and FLUERICS and SURPLICE barely win 5.
>Mike_Early: ?AJSY D3 JAYS +33 280
#note I don't know the other 2, but Mike told me he had the blank in this rack.
>Jim_Burlant: ?CFINRS 4C F.NCIeRS +62 223
#note Best bingo.  5% to win - woo hoo.
>Mike_Early: ?AEOORT 3H ROOTAgE +70 350
>Jim_Burlant: AABEEMY 5I BEAMY +32 255
#note EMBAY scores 43 at 2H - whatever.   Too demoralized to care at this point, as it's all over but for the final score.
>Mike_Early: AHO 14M HAO +25 375
>Jim_Burlant: DEEHIKU 15N HE +29 284
#note Annotation stops here, final score 313 - 424.  Up until the missed bingo, the only play I really got wrong was CILIA and the points I missed there probably came out in the wash, as I hit WINCE through the C I floated on the next turn.   And, while there's no excuse for missing SLUDGIER, the fact is, he already had AJSY? in his rack and I was going to get hit hard no matter what I put down.  All that fishing instead of hitting SLUDGIER did was cost me 25 - 30 points of spread.  While there was some room for improvement in how I played, I think that, when all was said and done, with really strong play I maybe lose this game by 60 - 70 points and not 100...but that's about all.  There wasn't a whole lot I could do about the win.
