>cesar: EILSSYZ 8G SIZY +32 32
#note i had to talk myself out of sizey*, but i think even if that was good, sizy would still be better.
>jeremy: Q H7 Q. +11 11
>cesar: AAEELPS 9H SAE +33 65
#note quackle doesn't like this becaue AELPS is such a strong leave. i think this is a super defensive play that puts me up ~50 though, and as long as i don't misplay a closed board i should be good. (-4)

>cesar: AEHILOP L5 PHELO.IA +78 143
>jeremy: DV 7K D.V +11 49
>cesar: EGHSTVY 5J GY. +18 161
#note ? this is quite a poor move, almost worthy of ??. somehow i saw GYVE at M12 but failed to see it at M2. maybe after DEV this should get a ??. (-10)
>jeremy: ?EOSTTX N1 EXTOrTS +88 137
#note then again YEPS is good (and i think i would have challenged it)
>cesar: EHOSTUV M1 HOE +30 191
#note ?? an even worse blunder. HOE gives back a LOT of points; i was too mentally stuck to the S, and unfortunately i was unnerved after realizing i'd missed GYVE. (-16.5)
>jeremy: CERW 1J REC..W +51 188
>cesar: BDLSTUV M12 LUV +14 205
#note although this is a good move, it is nowhere close to a !, VATU at 12K does what LUV is trying to do but better. LUV gives up more points even if he doesn't have a blank bingo, and BDLS is a better leave. (-1)

#note maybe NOME or MENO for the pts
>jeremy: R C13 R.. +10 288
>cesar: EIJNNRT E11 JIN. +30 372
#note since this is so much better than everything else, it may deserve a !, but those should only be reserved for hard-to-see good moves.

>jeremy: AGO F9 AGO. +18 319
>cesar: AEEERTU 13H UREA +13 397
#note good, it's important to score as much as possible, but it would have been nice to be able to block a lane and/or play 5 off.
>jeremy: B 1G B. +4 323
>cesar: AEEIOTT M6 O.A +14 411
#note ? (should get a ?? for the massive equity loss, but since it's not a game-losing blunder i'll give myself a pass). (-82.5). The right play here is the awesome F1 OAT, which blocks many bingos.
