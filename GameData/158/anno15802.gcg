#note she laid down 5C MISJUDGE but probably thought it was way too volatile and took the safer bingo. 4B DEMIJOhn is best and tough to see. i was going to play MISJUDGER*. 
>cesar: BGLRTUV K6 VULG.R +18 82
#note VULGO is surely better, i gave up once i spotted this, because i may be able to use the 100% knowledge of the S hook. VUG F2 is also better. (-4.5)
>carol: FOX 11D FOX +53 135
>cesar: BEELOTZ 12C BET +30 112
#note i spent a long time debating between BLET and ZEE before i inexplicably played this. the worst part of spending ~5 minutes on a move is making the wrong move after that. lost focus this early in the tournament is a bad sign. (-2.5) BLET is best.
>carol: ACDO 13B CODA +40 175
#note this is why BET sucks partly

#note i was too close to playing TRULLED* here.

>cesar: AEIKNQT B1 INTAKE +29 234
#note quackle tells me this is the star play by a lot because stuff this obvious will always sim high. i still think though that it is a pretty decent play, especially given the fishing the last couple of plays, but are there any reasonable alternatives? i didn't want to open it with LIKEN and still keeping the Q.

>cesar: EEOOQSY 1A Q. +33 267
#note sheesh i thought OYES was collins only. but SOOEY 12K is a far better play than just dumping the Q, i missed it. (-9)
>carol: IRRY 15B YIRR +22 287
>cesar: AEEOOSY C5 EYE +25 292
#note missed SOOEY again. LOOEY 8L is a reasonable play (better than EYE for sure) (-14.5)

#note quackle sillily likes fishing an A somewhere.
>carol: AGIOPSW M12 POWS +23 361
#note carol had PISSING when she played ZAP and told me she wasn't 100% on VULGARS and didn't want to try it. i guess that move worked out for me, because i would have surely lost.
