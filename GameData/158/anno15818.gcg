>Joshua_Sokol: DGKLOUW H4 WOULD +26 26
#note 1st game vs Bernard in our Wednesday all-nighter series. GOWK 7H is winning the sim. I didn't consider it.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: BIIQR 5E BRI. +12 12
#note Bernard said he chickened out of ORIBI, which would have set his Q up.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEGKTY 6C GEY +14 40
#note 6B KYTE seems to be a better option. EG? isn't that much worse than EKT?. To be honest I have never seen KYTE played so I wouldn't have known to play it. EGT? is also almost as good as EKT?, so even 6D KYE is better than my play.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: IIQ -QII +0 12
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEKOTT 4H .OTTED +20 60
#note I wasn't quite sure what to do here either. This doesn't really look good. I think G3 KO(I) is better.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?AEHIMO 8A HEMAtOI. +92 104
#note 3I HAEMOId. I didn't know it either.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEHIKL B7 H.rBLIKE +94 154
#note This was a guess, but an informed one. I didn't know the bingo in this rack, unplayable but still cool HOBLIKE.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AGILNPR L3 P.ARLING +62 166
>Joshua_Sokol: AACDNTU C12 DATA +27 181
#note I took a while to figure out what to do here, and I decided that I should just go for points. After I laid this down I realized that it opened OKA... None of my plays that score or leave something decent seem to be defensive though.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ILOSTTX A12 LOST +30 196
#note This was his rack. He missed LOTI in the same spot, but LOST usually guarantees him a decent X play next turn.
>Joshua_Sokol: CFNSTUW -CFUW +0 181
#note Backlash after leaving CNU I guess. I didn't see F(I)CUS, which may very well be better than my choice. FICUS is simming way better than my exchange. 6J CU(R)F is doing well too.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ITX 3L .IX +30 226
#note Maybe a little dangerous if he didn't have the case Y.
>Joshua_Sokol: AGIINST 10E AGISTIN. +66 247
#note Lucky me.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: CMO 2M MOC +38 264
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEERSW H10 .AWERS +39 286
#note Should I play 4D WAE here? I thought it better to just score, but maybe I could manage to bingo next turn or the turn after. I also considered playing (S)EESAW here for the better leave, but I'm not sure it's really worth 9+ points. The sim says (S)AWERS/(S)EWARS>WAR>(S)EESAW. SAWERS is better than SEWARS probably because of Z(A).
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EFU G13 FEU +23 287
>Joshua_Sokol: AADEFUV 4B FAVA +28 314
#note Seemed clear-cut to me since A3 LEZ, BIZ, FIZ, WIZ were all unavailable to Bernard. COZ was still a possibilitz but that would be doomsdayish. 4B UVEA is actually simming a bit better, likely for a multitude of reasons including keeping F to score, A to play A(MID) and score, not giving the COZ possibility (maybe), and a better leave.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: INO 3A ION +15 302
#note all 1-pointers I'm guessing.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEIRU I10 .IED +23 337
#note First of all, it seems obvious in hindsight that TEED>TIED, just cause I have the case I and there are 3 other E's I may draw. Sim agrees by a whopping 5% margin... (W)EEDIER is simming decently. I wanted to keep the U because of the Q in the bag, so I only shortly considered K8 U(N)DEE. Besides, it didn't really score. So I think (T)EED is the best option here.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EJNOR 8J JO.NER +39 341
>Joshua_Sokol: EEOQRU N6 QU.ER +36 373
#note I can't remember my last tile, but I think it was a vowel.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ACNNRTY J2 CA.TY +24 365
#note He didn't know S(CATTY), so this play is already bad news for him. (WE)NNY 12H is giving him the best shot. Of course what he drew was ridiculous.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEOPUV E10 .E +4 377
#note So he draws SZ. I start trying to find my highest-scoring play and then realize I may be able to stick him with the Z. I happily saw that I could. I lost 12 points anyhow, since I didn't realize that 9B (r)EE was a better option.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: NNRSZ J10 .NN +12 377
#note -7.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEOPUV N1 V.. +13 390
#note -10? jeez...
>Bernard_Gotlieb: RSZ N6 .....S +15 392
#note correct.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEOPU 14F P.. +11 401
#note - a lot?
>Bernard_Gotlieb: RZ D6 .R. +3 395
#note -4.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEOU C6 .E. +14 415
#note correct.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: Z -  +0 395
>Joshua_Sokol: EOU 12A ...O +10 425
#note Correct.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: Z -  +0 395
>Joshua_Sokol: EU M8 .E +7 432
#note -3?
>Bernard_Gotlieb: Z -  +0 395
>Joshua_Sokol: U 11M U. +2 434
>Joshua_Sokol:  (Z) +20 454
#note I'm not understanding champ player's endgame for this. It literally told me to U stick myself with E(S) instead of play (N)E(E) and U(S) the next turn.
