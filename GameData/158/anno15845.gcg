>Jesse_Day: AADEOOT -AOO +0 0
>Eric_Tran: AEINOTZ 8D ZONAE +48 48
#note Sim likes ZEATIN better.  If we assume a decent rack for Jesse (based on his exch 3), ZONAE moves up a bit
>Jesse_Day: AADEFTT 7E DEFAT +30 30
>Eric_Tran: HIIIORT 6H HIT +16 64
#note Sim likes ZITI.  I should probably exchange here.  Leave is dreadful, and playing gives him more options.
>Jesse_Day: ABBELRT 5B BARBLET +79 109
#note Phoney
>Eric_Tran: IIKLORU D8 .ORIL +28 92
#note The horrible racks keep coming.  KRU(B)I is a huge improvement on leave, but after he takes the x3 lane, the board will be pretty dead.  The K isn't a bad latter on this board after ZORIL.  
>Jesse_Day: AGLORSW 10C G.OWL +17 126
#note JD: ugh. airglows looks completely unfamiliar.
>Eric_Tran: AEIIKPU D1 PIKE. +28 120
#note Missed KAU(R)I.  Also have a chance at playing WIKIUP here.
>Jesse_Day: AORSSVX 6A VOX +30 156
#note JD: savors should be a little better, not sure why I didn't spot it.
>Eric_Tran: AEINNUU 5J UNAU +10 130
#note Needing to open the board.  Sim likes UNA(K)IN (didn't see)

#note LINEAGE is a word I was not able to find.
>Jesse_Day: DDEIOSU A6 .OIDED +33 274
#note JD: time to start racing for blanks
>Eric_Tran: MNRSTVY 8K N.RVY +33 233
>Jesse_Day: EEOPRSU 1D .URPOSE +33 307
#note JD: non-obvious, but it wins the sim.
>Eric_Tran: ?AIMSTW 4A WAM. +30 263
#note ET: That 2J spot is really dangerous, with a decent pool and FHM still available.  MAW at K10 is 1 more pt.  Champ really likes the aggressive (C)WM.  CWM makes sense: I'm behind, and it balances the other hotspot.  
>Jesse_Day: CDEENOT 2J DOCENT +33 340
>Eric_Tran: ?FHIIST 12G FIsHI.ST +72 335
#note ET: Chickened out on INFIGHTS for 6 more.  From a psychology perspective, I think I should play it even if I'm only 50% sure.  The game is close, and I doubt Jesse would put the game on the line and challenge it unless he were >90% sure it was phony.  INFIGHTS 39win%, FISHIEST somewhere around the 20-25 win% range
>Jesse_Day: ?AEEGOT 11K O.EE +18 358
#note JD: with 3-4 minutes left, I tried to figure out how I could lose this game but failed to spot the real threat - if he has JIVY at N6 and an out next turn, and I draw the Q, then I will lose by a couple of points. I think OGEE wins 33/36. What I should've tried to do is keep a good Q play - playing OE at 1N wins every endgame because it always keeps QUITE. In this case keeping an extra letter leaves me more flexible! Just playing an O at J11 looks like it might work too.
>Eric_Tran: AIJNQRY 11H QI +24 359
#note correctly blocking my out
>Jesse_Day: ?AGIMT O1 s.IGMA +30 388
#note find the best play! it's clever. this is a dozen points off or something
>Eric_Tran: AJNRY J12 .AJ +29 388
#note MA at 10N last turn would've saved an out-play on row 15!
>Jesse_Day: T G12 ..T +6 394
