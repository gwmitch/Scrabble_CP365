#note Intriguing, attacking move from Naween - I think he kept back something like AET, but it was useful to open up another TWS battle area. Here my move is the best score, but also (holding the last I, already) offers the possibility of BI- or DI- front hooks to come.

#note Great, his fifth bingo in the space of six moves. They were pretty choice though. Obviously nothing very palatable here, but this one sims best - VUG or FUG F2 take out too many lines, but the hopes are very slim.

>Andrew_Fisher: BEOUVWW 6M OW. +30 371
#note This scores best despite the continuing bad leave - sims have the best chance at about 0.4% (supposedly WAVE 4D)

>Andrew_Fisher: ABENUVW C3 VAW +35 406
#note Finally that hotspot is colonised. I refuse BUNJE as the rack leave offers nothing - supposedly that was correct, as VAW yields 3.5% wins if you can trust Quackle.

#note Any bingo would have given me the miracle win here - possible sevens were NEBBUKS, NEBULES, NUBBLES, SNUBBER, SUBRENT, SUBTEEN and SUNBELT (though Naween probably ruled out any bingos when choosing to empty the bag, and may have held the S). Not to be.
