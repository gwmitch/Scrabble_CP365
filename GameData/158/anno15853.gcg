#note Couldn't think of MIAOU.  This is awful.

>Jim_Burlant: BDEGINO E5 GOB +19 33
#note Well, at least I got this one right.  This is clearly best.

>Jim_Burlant: DEINORX H6 DO.X +12 45
#note Knowing her rack changed things.  If she's trying FAULTERS* and didn't try FALTERS/GAUMS, will she even find REFUTALS?  I considered OX D7 but figured that she'd probably play FLAX for 42 and I didn't want to give her that. I figured I'd block the 8's.  This was gambling that she didn't know the back hook to GAUM.  
>Fran_Silver: AEL 9G A.EL +21 30
>Jim_Burlant: AEIINPR 10I NIPA +17 62
#note Either this or NIP, or J9 LI.  LI seems reckless; I'm fine with this, especially against this opponent.
>Fran_Silver: FLOST L7 FLO.TS +20 50
>Jim_Burlant: AEIRRTY D4 RAY +22 84
#note No bingos play.  This is best.
>Fran_Silver: ?INOOSV -?INOOSV +0 50

#note Or JILTER in the same location.  
>Fran_Silver: GILV B2 V.GIL +22 72
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEEIR K10 .EA +16 129
#note 11J EAT scores 17, but the idea was right.  It's either this, A5 AERIE or 11J EAT.
>Fran_Silver: DEORSTU 13E DETOURS +66 138
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIKRT A5 TAlKIER +84 213
#note KERATIn A5 scores 88.  Still in good shape at 80% in a short sim.
>Fran_Silver: EFI 8L .IFE +21 159
>Jim_Burlant: DEERSTU H13 .UD +12 225
#note Didn't know the back hook to VESTURE; VESTURED plays at 2B for 74. This is best if you don't nkow the bingo.  The bingo wins 97%; this wins 90. 
>Fran_Silver: CHINP 10C PINCH +24 183
>Jim_Burlant: EEIRSTT N8 .RISETTE +76 301
#note TIREDEST plays at 15D for 60, but this is best.  97% to win.
>Fran_Silver: EIMNOOS O12 MOON +44 227
#note Several bingos available for Fran (this was her rack), but even if she hits, she's not even 10% to win.  C8 EMPOISON wins 9%.
