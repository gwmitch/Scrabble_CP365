#note Very close with DU(V)ET.  This scores well, and the board is really gross, which is good for my crap leave.

>Eric_Tran: DEEINUU 11C E.UI +8 59
#note I played too quickly here.  Many better plays to consider: like exch EUU.  or LIEU instead, for defense.  DEINU also that much worse of a leave than DENU.

#note B looked like a better letter to slot in the x3 lane.

#note This play is not that great.  my thinking was that I keep SIXTE for next turn, and might draw an A for a play at 7A.  But better to take the pts with HONEST, and aggressively go for a play at 7A.  If only he found WOMMERAS, then I could just play ETHOXIES

>Eric_Tran: AEIRSTX 7A TAX +46 250
#note SEXTARI(I) kinda surprisingly wins the sim.  The pool is really good, so this will maximize my chances at getting more blanks and another bingo.  I was getting too fancy.  AX is also fine, since the board is already so bingo friendly.  I also got paranoid about defense and didn't want to slot Conrad an easy R to bingo from.  But given the pool, RAX is better than TAX.

#note depressing.  2J RERISE sims well, as I'll need to score well and bingo.

#note Sim likes RETIRES J3, to keep more bingo lines available.
