>insidious: AEELMOW I6 WAME +23 23
#note Sid: EM(B)OWEL sims best. I didn't know this one and I wouldn't have played it anyways. I like WOE or OWE for 17 because of the much better leave.
Josh: I prefer the other WAME for 23 to this, even, since it only gives a T hook with WO.

>insidious: AEFGKLO G2 FLAK +22 45
#note Sid: GAOL G3 here is just too good, setting up FLOWN. I wish I'd seen it.
>axcertypo: ?CFGLRS 4E GR.. +7 113
#note Sid: I'm not in favor of static's choices of SCLaF(F) or SCRuF(F). I think GRAB is better than FLAB but I might exchange.
Josh: I chose GRAB over FLAB cause I didn't think the leaves were much different and I had a shot at F(F) bingos and overall higher scoring bingos with CFLS?, and FL(AB) gave him more points. GR(AMA) is one point better though, and I don't see much of a difference in the outcome of the game if I play it. I suppose I could burn the blank, as I'm already handily leading, and I suppose I could exchange as well. I'm not sure what is best.
>insidious: AEEGHOO F1 GOE. +16 61
#note Sid: Static likes OHO and CP likes HOER but I'll sacrifice points to keep the H over the G.
Josh: I think OHO may be correct here, since you still have G(AMA) afterwards. Not sure that makes a huge difference, but it could be substantial. Who knows.
>axcertypo: ?ACEFLS H1 EF +24 137
#note Sid: I don't think I knew FECIALS, just FETIALS.
Josh: I don't think I knew FECIALS either. Not a huge mistake but I need to remember FECIALS. I should since I know FACILE is an adjective, and that's what I see first.
>insidious: AEHNOYZ 5C AZO +30 91
#note Sid: Still haven't made the best play. GYOZA is just too much better.
>axcertypo: ?ACILSU 1H .USoCIAL +86 223
#note Sid: Not always an easy find.
Josh: I only saw this because lately I've played ASOCIAL and missed or seen EUSOCIAL. Seeing it depends on experience I think.
>insidious: AEHLNRY 6C HAY +32 123
#note Sid: A lot of options are close here. HYLA, YEARN, LEARY, and my play are all in the top, each with less than a 4% chance of winning.
>axcertypo: EEIILVY L1 .IVIE +20 243
#note Sid: I originally leaned towards CIVIL because it makes it harder for me to bingo, but it's just too much worse equitywise.
>insidious: DELNRRU 2K R.ND +19 142
#note Sid: This play was so weird, I had no idea what to do. Static and CP like RUN(OFF) better but I'm unconvinced.
Josh: I like RUN(OFF) but who would see that... It's also pretty dangerous, but I think that at this point Sid can't worry about that, and needs to focus on maximizing his chances of bingoing next turn.
>axcertypo: BDELOTY 2E B... +12 255
#note Sid: I either like DOBY or LOT(AH) for 16. CP seems to read my mind. I think everything at A4 stinks.
Josh: I'm not playing at A4... I didn't think much about this play but I thought that my leave may yield me a bingo next turn. Turns out it only bingos with N for NOTEDLY. I also thought this was a good play to cut Sid's chance of scoring big at A1, which he would find useful if he wants to stage a comeback. This play is probably both underthought and overthought.
>insidious: DELNORU M5 ROUNDEL +63 205
#note Josh: I don't think I even knew this.
>axcertypo: DELOTTY N10 DOTTY +35 290
#note Josh: Winning the sim by a bit in front of DOTTLE/DOTTEL, TOYED and N4 DEY.
>insidious: ?EMRSST O4 MaSTERS +87 292
#note Josh: Well jeez. How did this happen?
>axcertypo: AEEEILU M13 EAU +15 305
#note Sid: This seems obvious.

Josh: This and 13J ELUA(T)E are close, actually. I didn't like my chances at this point, but the pool wasn't very nice either, so I knew it was probably a coin toss that depended on what either of us drew next.
>insidious: CDENNNR L12 END +18 310
#note Sid: Wow this is weird. CRED for 31 might be worth despite the leave if it wasn't so bad defensively. ZANDER is something I didn't see but I still prefer my play. Exchanging are also among the options. CP likes END best.

Josh: If I were Sid and I glanced at the pool I would be deathly scared of playing CRED. The decision here seems very hard to make. I would play (ZA)NDER though.
>axcertypo: AEEEIIL L8 AI +9 314
#note Sid: Exchange?

Josh: I simmed this with the logical exchanges, and keeping AEL is the best exchange here, and the best play according to the sim. I really didn't want to exchange since I didn't want to give Sid any vowels. I thought I would need to smother him to win, as the pool is extremely consonant-heavy. But maybe I need to hope for some points or a bingo, which playing AI doesn't help with.
>insidious: CINNPRV 7B NIP +27 337
#note Josh: This looks right.
>axcertypo: EEEEILT G8 LEE +10 324
#note Sid: Yucky but I just don't know what else to do. I'm not sold on exchanging like I was on Josh's last turn.

Josh: Exchanging here is actually really bad according to the sim. This time I agree. This play is simming best among everything quackle and I saw, but my chances of winning are pretty low.
>insidious: CGINRRV 10B CRING. +19 356
#note Sid: I thought this was my biggest blunder of the game, but I still have a 64% shot at winning. The sim thinks that this is still an okay play, but I disagree. I played CRINGE to set up the R, but I still think it's asking for trouble given the pool. GIV(E)R sims best (71%) and I like it but I also like VICE even though it sims significantly lower (56%). I think I only lose if I get stuck with my letters.

Josh: at first glance this looks right, as it leaves only 2 consonants. But CNR is probably less easy to get stuck with than RV.
>axcertypo: EEIOTWX 8A WO +17 341
#note Sid: hmm.. W(R)OTE, TOWIE 11g, and EX 9C are the only 100% winning plays. I like EX for 22 since the leave is just so flexible.

Josh: Here's a case of Quackle not working at all. Actually, WROTE, TOWIE and EX all lose. Champ player loses to champ player. If I play W(R)OTE, Sid can play D12 OH and stick me with the X. If I play TOWIE, it's possible Sid will see his only win with H(I)P, blocking EX and forcing me to play (O)X. If I play EX first, Sid can block TOWIE with 11K JO and outscore.

My only win here is really difficult to see. It's actually (N)IX E10. It sets up a nice out in two with OW/OX and (W)EET/(NIX)E. If Sid blocks that with H(I)P, I play WO or WE 8A and outscore with T?E/(NIX)E plays.
>insidious: HJOPRTV D9 P.TH +18 374
#note Sid: My best play. I really like how I played this endgame.

Josh: I didn't see this. Very sharp move. I was also running out of time...


>axcertypo: EEITX C12 EX +23 364
#note Josh: my best bet here would be to pass and hope Sid plays JO/OE, so I can play T(OE) and stick him with the V. I also need to hope he uses his R so I can set up EX/EX 13B with E(H) without him blocking the setup after using my I. It doesn't win but it comes closest. I didn't know CRINGER was an option. If CRINGER is invalid I win with this sequence, so long as Sid doesn't pass back.

Josh: I don't think I've ever witnessed such a crazy endgame. I love Scrabble. Also, nice comeback, Sid.
