#note My thought process.  1)  I don't want to spend forever on this rack.  2)  I want the D on the DLS.  3)  I want to use a letter that can seal up a corner of the board.  4)  I want my bingo to prevent Cesar's 7s.

#note I11 DAFT does a good job of sealing up the board.  I maybe played too quickly here.  Especiallyi after KI, it looks right.

>Eric_Tran: ADEGMST L1 GAMED +28 274
#note I liked blocking that open O and Z after John's short play.  Sim also suggests L10 MASTED for a big score.

#note So sick!  I was hoping for another U for UVULITIS, then realised I had this.

>Eric_Tran: CEHNORW 11A COW +21 404
#note With all the I's gone, slotting the C on the x3 lane looked safe.  Need to block the D and the ER.
>John_O'Laughlin: BORY 3G BYR.O. +17 288
#note Good in collins.  I figured my win% was higher by letting it stay
>Eric_Tran: AEHLNOR H1 HO.LE +36 440
#note Champ is crazy and suggesting crazy plays like O(PA)L
