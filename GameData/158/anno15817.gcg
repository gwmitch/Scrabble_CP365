>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGOVW H4 WEAVE +30 30
#note Tiebreaker against Bernard. It's 2-2.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: NUU 6F UN.U +6 6
>Joshua_Sokol: EFGIILO 8D FOGI. +13 43
#note I thought I8 or G8 FOGIE to be too dangerous.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: BFO 7C FOB +21 27
>Joshua_Sokol: EEILORT 4G O.E +6 49
#note (BO)OTIE is interesting. I chose this cause I wanted to play aggressively for once and guarantee a spot for a bingo as best I could. Maybe I3 OE does the job too.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AQT 9B QAT +19 46
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKLRRT 10A KIR +24 73
#note Holy shit T(OWE)RLIKE...
>Bernard_Gotlieb: APX 5D PAX +33 79
>Joshua_Sokol: AEELNRT 11C TELERAN +67 140
#note For some reason I couldn't find ETERNAL, a much better placement in my opinion. I don't see why I should unnecessarily open a 3x3, but I guess it's just as dangerous as the hotspots TELERAN 11C opens up.

>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?ACEEGI 14E AGE.CIEs +66 175
>Joshua_Sokol: EGLLRTY 15A TELLY +32 208
#note Thought this spot was more dangerous and therefore worth more than one point more than 3C TELLY.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ADIW J2 WADI +24 199
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGNORR 15L OGRE +20 228
#note This or ROGER, same spot, seem to be the two choices. ROGER scores 5 more but OGRE's leave is around 4 points better in a vacuum. It may be better to go with ROGER here since the pool is consonant heavy. That would have helped me next turn maybe.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EZ G13 Z.E +45 244
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINNRR 3I R.N +7 235
#note I don't know if 12F RA(V)EN is correct here, or 9H RAN, since the pool is consonant heavy. I guess my chances after RAN are pretty good, but I don't think RA(V)EN will work out well. The sim gives a slight advantage to my play over the other two. Maybe there is something better than these options.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: BHOOT 13A BOOTH +29 273
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEINRS 12G A.A +22 257
#note SA(V)ARIN? The sim loves it compared to AVA...
>Bernard_Gotlieb: NOPRY 3C PORNY +37 310
>Joshua_Sokol: EILMNRS L2 LIMNERS +74 331
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?DIIIST 14A ID +19 329
#note We couldn't find any great plays here. Sim is giving a slight edge to M2 ID over 14A ID, but Bernard didn't know RANID.
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEHMSU 2A CHUM +30 361
#note I had a lot of time to think about this rather difficult position but I didn't use it that well. Good thing I seem to have made the right move. I saw the M3 DUES gave him possibly STUDIeS/ESS and that CH(O)M(P) gave him DI(C)TIeST, but that was because I mistracked and thought there were two unseen T's instead of 3 unseen I's. Big mistake as I had all the time in the world to make sure my tracking was correct. Sim is loving N10 MUSHER for some reason. Nothing seems to be an 100% win as I thought. My play is around 10% lower in second place. I wouldn't have played MUSHE(R) since I didn't see any way he could win after CHUM whereas I would have seen STUDIeS again with MUSHE(R).
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?IIISST M3 SI +18 347
#note All of his best plays block DUDES/TELERANS, which he didn't spot.
>Joshua_Sokol: DDESU N4 DUDES +17 378
