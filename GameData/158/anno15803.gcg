#note seemed like a toss-up to cash in the Q now or next turn but apparently quackle thinks it's better now. i didn't like HPR that much i guess, i dunno. (-2)

#note what do you think? quackle likes fishing with 3I NUN as well but i don't think i'm gonna bingo that often? even quackle says it's 36% and that's too low i think for just 4 points in a neck-and-neck game. my move has a tiny win% edge.
>judy: IIIII -IIIII +0 326
#note this is actually probably what she exchanged
>cesar: EGMNOOR M3 GENOM. +24 376
#note strongly considered MOG at F10 or even MO before deciding on this reluctantly. the problem is of course the i's, and with her just having exchanged, i really had to hope to get lucky here if i'm going to play GENOME. i just felt i needed the points and to close down the board a little. mathematically though MOG seems like the right play and i should be playing it instead of going by vague intuition. (-4.5)

#note i blocked aflutter amazingly
>cesar: IJLORWY N2 JOW +39 415
#note i think it's liking YOWL a little more because of some miniscule chance of JOINTURE? i can't tell. either way these are all close and barring drawing all the Is or something i should be able to win...
