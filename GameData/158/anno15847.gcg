>Rafi_Stern: HJOSTTV 8G JOSH +28 28
#note Rafi vehemently defends his play of JOSH here.  It statics best, and will lead to a more defensive game.

#note His last two plays signal he has an S.  but there's not much I can do.

#note eschewed on HENLIKE.  Given the score, I wanted to score big, and keep the blank to score big again.  2ply says to just take HENLIKE.  I also blanked on the WEIRD-O hook, so I thought this play killed the best hotspot.
>Rafi_Stern: ANORRW 15F NARROW +37 247
>Eric_Tran: ?AEEEHR D7 HE.aERAE +72 234
#note Considered 10F HE, but that runs into problems if he plays down from the T. this is better than REHEATER/D and ETHEREAL in terms of keeping more lines open.

#note With 6 in the bag, All of Quack's best suggestion play off 4 or 5 tiles.  My idea of playing short, then, is rather bad.  I need to increase my chances of getting the blank, and force Rafi to either 1 tile-block or empty the bag.  CO(D)LIN looks fine here.

>Eric_Tran: CILNPST 11C ..T +12 326
#note quack says there are no win, and to play INFECT.  I was hoping to draw the blank for MANCIPLES, and he would miss my play.  Also considered P(ER) hoping he'd miss the hook.
