#note Conrad: Exchanging OU looks better here.
>dacrON: ADGMPRR -GMPR +0 0
#note Conrad: Eric exposed an S on his opening draw (don't think he noticed he did), and traded 1 in 30 seconds. I'd think he has to keep a pretty strong leave to trade 1 so quickly, so I gave him credit for a strong leave. Top of his range with AEIRST leave, this sims about 4 back, lower range of his leave, say ADOPRR, about 23 back, but I don't think that's going to happen after a 30 second trade 1. His actual leave AELNOS puts this 13 back. All in all, I think this is a good example of biased heuristics due to being at the end of a really rough tournament. I thought exchanging would be better up against a trade 1 with a really powerful rack, but it looks like playing through is a bit better.
>Eric_Tran: ADELNOS -O +0 0
>dacrON: ADINORU -  +0 0
#note Conrad: Exchange U, exchange OU, pass. If he bingos, I bingo back. I can definitely get some 2x2s with ADINORU. But what do I sim this against? If I still think SATIRE is in his range, then trading 1 is a better option scorewise, although slightly more variant. My interpretation is that passing is the safest option here, but dependin on what rack I think he has, exchanging 1 or 2 may be better. I think I stand by my play, but that's in part because I'm not really sure how to analyze it.
>Eric_Tran: AADELNS 8G NA +4 4
#note Conrad: Again, Eric played very quickly here, seemingly unwilling to go for the 6 pass. Potentially a bad scenario for me, since my rack sucks now.
>dacrON: ADINORU 9G UDO +12 12
#note Quackle seems to prefer dropping the U for 3, but again, does it depend on what leave I think he has? Eric has made all of his plays quite quickly...I'm not sure if this is a mistake? It may be, but likely not a very big one.
>Eric_Tran: ADEHLNS 10E HANDSEL +75 79
>dacrON: AILNORW 11E OW +25 37
#note I think this was my rack. I was positive HANDSEL took an L (it doesn't), so I wanted to keep the L. It's not, apparently, so LOW seems obviously better.
>Eric_Tran: ACEGNSU L4 UNCAGES +86 165
#note Conrad: It, uh, got silly from here. stupid way to end the worst tournament of my 9 years of playing competitive Scrabble. Probably could've just resigned (allowed at Can-Am) about two turns later when he six tile overlaps with S?, but I don't believe in resigning - hence the final score.
