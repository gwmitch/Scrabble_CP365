#note Good start.
>Lou: EFGIOSS 11D FOGIES +30 42
#note I can infer the last tile Lou held was an S.
>Jeremy: AEEEIIL 12A ILEA +20 99
#note 7.4 L10 (B)AILEE was top.
>Lou: ADIV B10 VA.ID +34 76
>Jeremy: CEEEITT I6 TEE +12 111
#note 0.3 M9 E(L)ECT is favored by a little bit.  This is fine.

#note 2.9 K9 CAD scores 4 more, sims a bit ahead keeping doubled EISTT instead of CEIST.

#note best
>Lou: DNS 13A D.NS +23 168
#note There goes that S I infered earlier.  I have the last S in hand, so that could be an advantage.

>Jeremy: EHMNNRS G6 HERN +23 244
#note 3.6 G6 HERM.  It keeps NNS which I didn't like on a board like this.  If it's going to be a jammed up board, that M can be valuable ammo next turn.  Also, I assumed Lou would play O column, I had M1 HEM lined up for 30 pts. -- that got blocked.
>Lou: GOO O4 GOO +18 207
>Jeremy: ADIIMNS F2 MAIDS +23 267
#note 5.3 F2 MIDIS.  The top plays are long words, because there are 2 blanks unseen.
>Lou: EJ M1 J.E +32 239
>Jeremy: ?AIKNRT E4 KA +24 291
#note 3.5 E4 KI.  The unseen tile pool has 3 more I's.  Poor mistake.  This may have cost me the game.
>Lou: QU 5C QU.. +14 253
>Jeremy: ?IINRRT -IR +0 291
#note 14.0 6B RIN.  I did not want to give out that GRIN hook and lose the game to OOZING.  6C IT and IN are suicide with an unseen Z (ZIT, ZIN).  I2 RI(F) sets up H1 ZOO.  Not wanting to burn all my time, I decided to just trade 2, and hope for a bingo.  I have the T for 14D bingo line, B column and 2 row could also easily yield a bingo.  My play is 82.18% to win.  RIN is 87%
>Lou: GLO O4 ...GOL +24 277
>Jeremy: ?IINORT 6B TIN +18 309
#note 8.4 6C IN.  I really don't know what to make of that suggestion.  I chickened out on 2A INtROMIT (wins 77%).  Thought of INTERMIT, and doubted INTROMIT was any good.  Quackle says better than the bingo was 6C IN (wins 78%).  As it turns out that would have given up MINsTER/s(QUAD)/T(IN)  at 2B.  6B TIN  wins only 55%.
