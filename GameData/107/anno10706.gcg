#note given that i know no words, and that robin's style is very i-know-all-the-words-y, i gritted my teeth and preferred to play a closed board from the beginning, even though all of my inborn 'kamikaze' instincts were telling me to play PYURIA keeping the beautiful ER. i thought the equity sacrifice would be earned back in time. little did i know.... (-7.5)

#note bahahaha
>cesar: AIINPUV D3 VIA +14 44
#note ugh. i don't think the rest of this game is worth posting, but let's see how far i get. 13C UNRIP is better, of course, i always have trouble finding that word. (-5.5)
>robin: EFW D12 FEW +30 144
>cesar: ?EINPQU 6E .QUIP +36 80
#note the thing i have to be doing now is NOT chickening out on PERIQUE, particularly with it being so pretty. (-17)
>robin: ANSUU J2 UNAUS +28 172
>cesar: ?EGINYZ 4I Z.YIN +34 114
#note still, not a bad draw, and i have a good shot at bingoing next turn...

>cesar: ?EGLLLO --  -71 114
#note yeah.. that's probably not the right play. i did know LOGROLL, and was hoping there was another similar word that i could either get away with, or better yet have her challenge it and be good. desperate times call for desperate measures. the right play here keeps LLL? (-36.5)
>robin: EGO 8A GEO..... +39 295
#note i'm getting totally owned. i shoulda played that.
>cesar: ?EGLLLO B8 .LL +5 119
