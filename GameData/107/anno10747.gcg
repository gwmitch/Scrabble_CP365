#note This looks like it makes it the hardest to play a noskill overlap for too many points.

#note I decide not to play ANT(I) because it doesn't block the M bingo line. (QI)NDAR does though!

>Matt_Canik: ACIILNS 9C IL. +4 392
#note This was really tough. This situation is unique- Fran wasn't tracking and doesn't track, so emptying the bag isn't that big a worry to me, because she still won't know what I have. The other plus to ILL is that two of its hooks (TILL and KILL) take esses in front, making it harder to block. 
>Fran_Silver: ADEEKLT 2I EKE +37 443
#note She spends a really long time here, still hasn't tracked correctly, and coffeehouses about how she doesn't know what I have, but she knows I have an S. Then she plays this, setting up a bingo like with SKI. I just really don't get this. 
>Matt_Canik: ACIINST 1E ACTINS +34 426
#note I didn't know ISATINIC. I'm pretty pissed she was able to open that line just like that without thinking, but this was also my fault for not knowing ISATINIC.
