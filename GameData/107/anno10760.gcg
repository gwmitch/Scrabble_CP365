#note Nice placement.
>Jackson_Smylie: ABESSTW G7 WAB +27 27
#note WAB? WABS? SWAB? BAWTY? SWAB? WEB? WEBS? I don't want to give away my second S, and I think ESST bingos more than EST. I also like the S hook WAB gives.
>Alex_Rodriguez: ACGIORU F3 COUGAR +24 54
#note GIAOUR I9, AGIO I8, then COUGAR.
>Jackson_Smylie: CESSTTX 5E T.X +20 47
>Alex_Rodriguez: EGIMR 12D GERM. +22 76
#note GRIM(Y)...? I assume he must have another E to play GERM(Y). 
>Jackson_Smylie: CESSTTT E11 S.CT +12 59
#note I see ST(E)T or T(E)TS, but S(E)CT scores four more, and I don't think ESTT is that much worse than CEST. I actually bingo 3% more than TETS or STET after SECT.

>Jackson_Smylie: AEIQRST -Q +0 68
#note An interesting but unworthy option is (O)E 4G, which sets up QATS.

>Alex_Rodriguez: IJ D10 JI. +13 115
>Jackson_Smylie: AAADIUU M2 AU.A +8 162
#note This was a tough turn - I figure he is close to a bingo. I wanted to block the last good lanes with AU(R)A, but didn't like the L hook. The S was still left open which was scary. I figure he either a) doesn't know LAURA, b) doesn't have an L or c) has an L and knows laura but can't bingo there. I also was worried about a BL- or CL- or FL- play up top, but I thought I needed to score and shut down a bit. Quackle says exchange keeping AD which I don't think I agree with. 
>Alex_Rodriguez: DFR 2L F.RD +16 131
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEINPU 1H UNDIE +27 189
#note I knew either NUDIE or UNDIE was valid, I whiffed INDUE. He didn't hold. 
>Alex_Rodriguez: IO 1N OI +17 148
>Jackson_Smylie: AALNNPV J3 ..V +7 196
#note Oh ouch. I saw NAVAL and PAVAN but didn't see any spots for either of them. 6I NAVAL plays which kills the lane I want to block. I knew quackle would hate (DE)V but it really prevents him from playing and I can hit stuff next turn with DEVA. 
>Alex_Rodriguez: IO I9 OI +11 159
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AALNNP 6I NAP +17 213
#note squush'd. Fish off one and draw a blank, it's smylie's signature move. I wasn't sure whether to play PAN, NAP, or PLAN. I didn't see ANAL which I now like, especially since it takes no hooks. I played NAP because it took the least hooks (that was not including NAPA which I saw the next turn). NAP sims best. I thought it also might be nice to bingo.
>Alex_Rodriguez: DI 7K ID +7 166
#note Now i'm not sure if he's just blocking my bingo setup. He isn't creating an S hook, he already has one. This play really confused me.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AABELN N4 .NArABLE +65 278
#note I missed one bingo, (D)AmNABLE, which I might not even have played had I found it. At least INARABLE drew a challenge.
>Alex_Rodriguez: IN -  +0 166
>Jackson_Smylie: EEKNQST 8M Q.T +36 314
#note This leaves me SKENE/SKEEN for next turn.
>Alex_Rodriguez: IN 9L NI. +18 184
>Jackson_Smylie: AEEEKNS O11 SKEEN +44 358
#note I was only 90% sure of SKENE but 100% sure of SKEEN so I opted to play the latter. SKEAN kept EE which is worse than AE.
>Alex_Rodriguez: EH N14 HE +22 206
>Jackson_Smylie: AEEFLOZ 11K FAZ.. +34 392
#note I'm playing quickly, somewhat low on time but just no need to get spread; TSC doesn't count spread at all. ... Hence my missing of FEAZ(ES).
>Alex_Rodriguez: EE M11 .EE +24 230
>Jackson_Smylie: EELNOPY 12K EY. +27 419
>Alex_Rodriguez: ?ILORSV 14M S.. +19 249
#note OVeRS(ET) but it's a moot point now. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ELNOPR 13J PRE. +18 437
>Alex_Rodriguez: ?ILORV 15F ..OILe +24 273
>Jackson_Smylie: LNO J8 ON +8 445
>Alex_Rodriguez: RV 7E V.. +9 282
>Jackson_Smylie: L 11C L.. +3 448
#note Kind of funny here, I thought I saw him hit the clock's middle button after VAW, and thought the game was over. I then tallied up the score and whatnot, all the while my clock going over 1:01 over! Alex was cool about it and didn't count the penalty, as I had had over 2 minutes on my clock right before VAW. The only mistakes I made this game were confusing UNDIE with NUDIE/INDUE, (DE)V may not have been best. And technically missing FEAZ(ES) but it didn't matter. I had an equity loss of -8, -6.5 not including FEAZES.
