#note Statically, exchanging 6 keeping the X is best.  When run in a 2-ply sim, it's a close call between this or excahnge 6 keeping the R.  At 1000 iterations, this gets the nod by the slimmest of margins.  Whether or not  you agree with this, this worked out.

#note This or STIBIAL are Scott's best bingos.
>Jim_Burlant: EEFOSSV 3I F.VES +30 115
#note Best, winning 44%.

>Jim_Burlant: BEIKNOS H10 .OKENS +45 160
#note Hated breaking up the rack, but with plays like BONK or BIKE 2L only scoring 26, I felt that 45 points were a bit too much to pass up.   Quackle mildly disagrees, saying that 2L BONK 26 was the play.  The difference in the 2-ply sim is close - Q says BONK 2L and L9 BLOKE are best, with this winniing 1-1/2% less often.  (-1.9)
>Scott_Garner: CIRTY 12D TRIC.Y +30 168
>Jim_Burlant: BHITUUZ L2 Z.BU +30 190
#note This doesn't do well statically, but after a couple of iterations this percolates to the top of the 2-ply sim.  It's best, and I'm treading water - still 48% to win.  Q also likes 9M HUB and 2L HUT.
>Scott_Garner: EE 2L .EE +26 194
>Jim_Burlant: AHIQRTU G12 .HI +23 213
#note I considered two choices in this position:  this, and 14F QINTAR leaving UH.   What swayed me to make this choice?  He took a while before putting down ZEE.  I figured he was close to something, and my gut told me  I'd have a much better chance of hitting a good comeback play if I left QUART than if I took the points now with QINTAR.  The sim agrees.  Even against a random rack, this is best.  Q also likes 11C QUA and 1N HI.  I'm 60% to win.
>Scott_Garner: AEGINOT L8 GE.ATION +74 268
>Jim_Burlant: APQRRTU 14J QU.TA +68 281
#note Still only 42% to win.  
>Scott_Garner: IX 15N XI +36 304
>Jim_Burlant: AEEPRRT D5 PRETREA. +61 342
#note Took so long to find this that once I saw this, I slapped it down.  This, of course, plays for 77 at 4C.   Too bad I didn't bother to look at the rest of the board.  While this doesn't open up as much, this gives up way too much on the scoreboard.  the 4C placement should have been the play.
>Scott_Garner: INNNO 15C NINON. +16 320
>Jim_Burlant: EEILLMO 1N ME +16 358
#note No idea what to do here.  Q suggests a really slick play I didn't see:  E10 MERLON 24.  Best for balancing this rack, and it doesn't open up anything dangerous.  This is poor; it was a feeble attempt to limit what he could do at O1 if he had an S.  
>Scott_Garner: OPR 8L .ORP +21 341
>Jim_Burlant: EGILLOO 14B LILO +14 372
#note No idea what to do here.  Q likes C2 IGLOO and 14D LOGIN.  IGLOO looks stupid; I didn't see LOGIN, which is what I should have played.  
>Scott_Garner: AVW 13A VAW +32 373
>Jim_Burlant: EEGGOOS E3 OGEE +20 392
#note Q likes C2 GOGO and 7M GOO.  This is near, but not at, the top of the heap.
>Scott_Garner: DDM M7 D.M.D +23 396
>Jim_Burlant: CDEGIOS F3 DOGE +29 421
#note According to Championship Player, eitehr this or N6 CORES are best and they maximize spread equally if CP is to be believed.
