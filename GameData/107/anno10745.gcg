>Matt_Canik: ?AEJOQS 8G JO +18 18
#note The sim likes JOE about 2 points more than JO. I guess the E isn't helping my rack because I have the Q.

#note Quackle wants me to keep EIS? or play OE before this.

>Dave_Wiegand: EHINRSW 12A WHINS +36 74
#note Not sure why this isn't SHREW or SHEWN, but I'm sure he has a reason. He is Wiegand, after all. 
>Matt_Canik: ?AGGLNO I6 AGeLONG +74 129
#note GANGpLO(W) is a word I didn't know. 
>Dave_Wiegand: ACEIRST 12H A.RESTIC +80 154
#note I guess that's why he didn't play SHREW or SHEWN. 
>Matt_Canik: AEOOPQZ O12 .OOP +24 153
#note EPIZOA and QOPH both look better, I just didn't see either of them.

#note Am I really going to challenge Wiegand? No. He actually thought it was good. 
>Matt_Canik: ?ENNQVW -NQVW +0 198
#note I just don't want to try to fight through shit. I want to get these off my rack now, not play ENOW and put off my inevitable exchange. The sime says play ENOW.

#note I spent over 8 minutes on this turn deliberating between AVOW, VROW, and KNOW. I picked KNOW because it scored the extra points, but was very worried about doubling up my Is or pulling the lovely VUI. But finally I just played KNOW, because AIRV still looks tempting. Quackle hates this. 
>Dave_Wiegand: AEEIILT A12 .AIT +25 393
#note He said he was trying to take out the BYCHATS hook. 
>Matt_Canik: ADINRUV D1 VINA +28 428
#note I just can't really play AVID or VINA in the 14 row with that S out, if he has it he pretty much wins. I whiffed UNFAIR. 
>Dave_Wiegand: EEGILSY N2 G.ILY +34 427
>Matt_Canik: DDIRRTU 14D DRUID +24 452
#note So I have very little time here. I look at this, see SEEP underneath, count it as 35, and see that R(O)T will score 11 and win by 5. So I play this. Well SEEP doesn't score 35, it scores 45. Fuck. Three plays win here. Maybe if I hadn't been a dumbass, I would have seen them!
