#note i am bad at anagramming. the play here is G5 GOWD; this is significantly better. however it is definitely worth thinking about exchanging especially with his opening play. (-8.5)
>whitley: DEIRRSY K2 DERIS.RY +74 84
#note gave him exactly the needed letter, i guess gowd woulda done the same thing
>cesar: CDEGUUY 6E GUYED +19 36
#note 6G GUY is the play here. it's important to keep as good of a leave as i can with this rack. (-3.5) DECURY 4G is also strongly worth considering;; even CURDY is ok; i wanted to open the board up as much as possible and didn't like curdy for that reason.

#note god damn it, why do i have to have this U. take the points i guess.
>whitley: DEGV 3J V..GED +22 215
#note he played this quickly. another cludgy dump keeping ERS or something ?
>cesar: EEIINOU O1 IN.UE +21 157
#note ugh, getting impatient here; IODINE sims better, and i even think i saw it but was so sick of the U already. (-7.5)

>cesar: EEILNOT 4D OLE +23 180
#note this can't be the right move, right?  i think M13 TO looks a little better.

#note should consider QI here too.. 
>whitley: FINO 12D INFO +17 314
>cesar: EIJLNRT 3A JILT +27 219
#note find me the best play here... JILT sims best, and i wanted to do JIN but i KNOW he has an O so that can't be right. E14 JINN is really cool, though.

#note if i'm gonna keep the 3-3 lane open, L10 LEX gives me the best shot at a miracle triple triple. it could happen?
