#note Wasn't thrilled to do this, but I don't like to chicken out all the time either. Didn't see RIO(J)A.

>Danny_Panganiban: ?ADEENT O7 sTANDEE +80 126
#note It's going to be one of those games.....
>Matthew_Larocque: AILLMUV 6G LUV +15 61
#note I took a really long time -  I considered VILL 6F, VALI(D), VALU(E), etc.  I kinda hoped I could get some kind of play ending in LM for this spot but that seemed too unlikely, so I just dumped the ugly UV combo. I had no idea INFANTA was a word, just INFANTE.
>Danny_Panganiban: EEPV 10J VEEP +27 153
#note Looks like I really need to get a bingo fast now.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIILMO K1 AIOLI +16 77
#note Ugh. I didn't want to open like this for 16, but these racks are so terrible. I need to get really lucky.
>Danny_Panganiban: BEHLNO 1H HON.BLE +45 198
#note Here's where I truly lost the game. I didn't like his word, and I saw the huge T(A)XEME if I challenge it off. On the other hand I still had AXE for 40 so I let this crap slide....
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEMTX 2M AXE +40 117
>Danny_Panganiban: CDEINRS 14I CINDERS +82 280
#note Frig. I can't even hit him back on the TWS down there - just another nail in the coffin.

>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMORT 2B METEORA +77 205
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMORT --  -77 128
#note I'm desperate so what the hell..... he's so far ahead he doesn't even need to challenge. But he does anyways....
>Danny_Panganiban: AEMRS O1 S.AM +66 362
>Danny_Panganiban: AEMRS --  -66 296
#note Yeah.....no....
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMORT 10F OE +18 146
>Danny_Panganiban: AEMRS 11C REAMS +30 326
#note Heartbroken that I can't play ATOMY down there now.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEMORTY 2F YOM +23 169
#note I guess I should know TO(D)Y, but I didn't. Also missed TYE for 27 under REAMS.
>Danny_Panganiban: ADU 13J .UAD +39 365
#note Sigh
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEGNRT D10 B.G +12 181
#note I didn't know what to do at this point.... I saw B(REAMS), but I guess I wanted to keep it open in case I grabbed a D, C or the blank to bingo. Sim says just dump the B or score 24 for BANG or TAB/(TOM)B.
>Danny_Panganiban: GOO 1D GOO +11 376
>Matthew_Larocque: ADENPRT G2 .P +7 188
#note Gonna hang onto the D for D(REAMS).
