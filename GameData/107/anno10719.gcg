#note he showed me the Y by putting down JOY, which changed my move considerably.
>JD: DEGMMSU C5 GUM +16 161
#note I might have chosen a more defensive spot for these tiles (GLUM) if he hadn't shown me the y, but the y makes it far less likely that he will bingo. gum may just be better anyway.

#note this play limits the range of X plays he can hit on column A and turns over tiles in pursuit of one of the two blanks.

#note there goes my lead
>JD: DEEIILO C9 OILED +23 355
#note my take on the situation was that I'm in a lot of trouble unless I can pull the x - therefore, I should score and try to turn over as many tiles as I can. I thought this would be the only real option but quackle comes up with IODIDE at I9, which scores much less but sets up a new huge X spot and also allows me to bingo 10% of the time, giving an extra option for stealing the game. they end up very close on any kind of sim I can come up with. one way or the other I am a 3 to 1 underdog. I feel fine taking the points.
>Nigel_Peltier: AACDEPT L4 DA. +33 383
#note nigel played this pre-endgame and endgame really well. this is almost a clinching play.
>JD: AEIIOPX 2I EX +52 407
#note as far as I can tell no play wins more than one endgame. POX wins if I draw the W and gives me a chance if I draw the R and I don't spot AERIER. EX wins no endgames technically but gives me a real fighting chance with a lot of draws - with an N I have SINOPIA and there's only one way to block. there's a few other endgames that are quite tough as well. I didn't see much at the time beyond drawing a T for PATIO.
>Nigel_Peltier: ACEINTW 1A WANT +31 414
#note his best play is NICE which leaves him with 26 and 25 point outplays on different parts of the board. this seals it too.
