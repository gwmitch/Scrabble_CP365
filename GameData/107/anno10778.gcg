>Matthew_Larocque: EEGMNRR H4 MERGER +24 24
#note Didn't know GERMEN. Also didn't know if *EMERGER was valid. PREMERGER works though!
>Hans_Oh: JOT I3 JOT +24 24
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ENNPSU 10B PUNNErS +76 100
#note Or PUNNEtS. For some reason I thought it was spelled PUNNITS. Probably confusing it with PUNDITS. UNPE(R)SoN for 76 is a lot flashier.
>Hans_Oh: IX 9C XI +36 60
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFIITY D8 F..ITY +32 132
#note LOL. I actually won the best phony prize for this awful play. Over words like DOORFRAME, SUNFIRE, NONWAGES, and another phony I played - SEAFARED. Whatever!
>Hans_Oh: UUU -UUU +0 60
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAEIIN 6H .AIA +17 149
>Hans_Oh: LOST 3I .OLTS +24 84
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEIINV E4 CAVIE +25 174
#note I didn't really want to play at L1, why take the chance? I forgot about CIVIE but there's more As left anyways.
>Hans_Oh: DLO C13 OLD +18 102
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEIINT 15A NI.ATED +30 204
#note Wasn't sure about using up all my letters, but it seemed worth it compared to something like DI(D) for 15. I missed IN(D)ITED, but again there's more As left than Is.
>Hans_Oh: AILOORS 14F OORALIS +68 170
#note On the other hand I gave him a spot for this..... I'm sure he's not going to know OS(T)IOLAR because I sure didn't.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGINOW 2J WE +28 232
#note Kinda risky I guess, but I missed WIGEON(S), so this seemed like the only good play.
>Hans_Oh: EY 5K YE +20 190
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINNOS 15K NO +8 240
#note Taking out the S so he can't cheaply bingo there.
>Hans_Oh: EF 1K EF +12 202
#note Was he trying to block the hook? Guess he didn't have a T or the blank yet.
>Matthew_Larocque: CEGINSV 8G V.G +7 247
#note If I can't score, might as well block.
>Hans_Oh: W J2 ..W +17 219
>Matthew_Larocque: CEINOSU 13G CONE +26 273
#note Taking out the open T.
>Hans_Oh: LU I11 UL.. +4 223
>Matthew_Larocque: EIMNSTU J10 UM +10 283
>Hans_Oh: IQ 11A QI +15 238

>Hans_Oh: AER 6C RA.E +9 247
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AABBDH B4 DAB +28 378
#note Looked for some fives and failed, kABAB is the best. Probably better not to empty the bag though, and this play worked out for me quite well.
>Hans_Oh: PZ 5D Z.P +29 276
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABHHOR A1 HORAH +45 423
>Hans_Oh: IKT 8L K.IT +39 315
>Matthew_Larocque: ?B 10L r.B +10 433
#note Didn't have time to find the best outs - (UM)Be(R) for 16 and (K)aB for 14.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ADEU) +10 443
