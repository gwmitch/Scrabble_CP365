#note Best.

>Jackson_Smylie: ?EGHNOR 7G lEGHORN +66 88
#note I saw the possibility of OVERHANG/HANGOVER before he played RAVER, but didn't see the bingo after he made a play. Aarrgh. This bingo is quite defensive on the plus side, though OVERHANG/OVERHUNG are light years better.
>Lee_Fingold: ADIOSU N2 AUDIOS +29 93
>Jackson_Smylie: DEGIOWY 4K DOW.Y +34 122
#note I looked for a long time on this rack, and I figured I missed something. WEDGY, DOWE(R)Y, DEWY, DOGY. DOW(D)Y sims 3rd best.

#note HNNNG! I saw BE(R)IMING but thought it was only BEMIRING. I'm not there on prob yet, but still, AARRGHH! Other than that, MIB, BI, (R)IMING, B(R)IM, (N)IB, MI, BI(DE), B(OX)E(R), ME, (R)IB, and BIG all simulate up to 6.5 points better. Ugh.

#note T(H)EINE
>Jackson_Smylie: BIILNSW K11 BIN +22 222
#note I saw WIS(H), LIB, and BIN, the top three best static plays in that order. I wanted my S at that point for reunites, as I see a closed board in the near future in with every good tile counts. I didn't like LW synergy in ILSW, but is it really 2 points worse than INSW? BIN simulates second behind WISH.

#note Awww he blocked HAKIM. I'm not to AEIKMNS on prob yet, so the KI(NE)MA miss is excusable.
>Lee_Fingold: AGO 14F AGO +15 265
>Jackson_Smylie: AILLSTU A14 AL +11 288
#note AL sims best thankfully. I can't score more than 18 realistically, but that keeps AILL. I am just hoping he can't hit anything - outrunning may be hard, but I'll hope for the best.
>Lee_Fingold: CERY 14J .ERCY +38 303
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AILSTU G6 A.. +2 290
#note This was a travesty of a play. I'm looking at my score sheet hoping I was down more as I quackle - fishing like such is unnecessary and just awful. Especially with the Z out. I saw the Z possibility but for some twisted reason thought I had to bingo to win. UTS, (JUNTA)S, (H)A(B)U. Sheesh.

#note I should have found dUEL(L)IST. I was about 90% sure SPAST was good though. I don't know where I have seen it before, likely ISC.
