#note this seemed ok on a closed board, and I thought he might not know trock. the results are fairly non-intuitive here. UKE at L6 to set up a new lane does wel.

#note this is definitely an ill-timed exchange - even if I don't see outrock, the opportunity is still there for me to pull further ahead and keep leaves that score just about as much next turn as exchanging.

The way I was thinking about it was that if he doesn't know trock his options on this board are very limited - and if he does hit a bingo making frock/crock then I have a lane to respond with. If I play ETUI now I was concerned that I would run out of real estate to get a counter-bingo down. Still, with 6 Es left I should play through.

>JD: AEEELRT D3 TELAE +21 283
#note I could have just played TEE but it seemed like there weren't that many bingo tiles left to draw. I also didn't like how easy TEE made it for him to score.
>Kevin_Lee: EEMU 15L .MEU +18 259
>JD: CEFRTUZ E7 FURZE +39 322
#note FUZE at 12N is way better. I thought I was being relatively defensive, but I guess quackle expects him to score on column N. CERT is also a much more flexible leave.
>Kevin_Lee: DEEGIRT 5D .IE +6 265
>JD: ACIIIST O1 ASCI +43 365
#note aways* isn't good - but I felt good about my chances of getting away with it, and I also didn't want him to be the one to hook a bingo there first.
>Kevin_Lee: ?EEILPR C7 REPLIEd +81 346
>JD: GIIPTVV N12 VIV. +20 385
#note even with this crazy draw I've got this one in the bag - but I actually totally misplayed the endgame. I figured getting VIVE down for 20 would be top priority, but more urgent is getting some of my other clunkers down with PIG at B12. After all, I actually have another spot for VIVE.

#note this is also wrong, as I would've realized if I'd seen his next play coming
