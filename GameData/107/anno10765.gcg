>Trip_Payne: DUW 8G WUD +14 14
#note It was really cool to get to play Trip for the first time. by scrabble standards he's a celebrity. cross-tables disillusions me by telling me I already played him once before in a game I have no memory of whatsoever.
>JD: EEIILPR 9H PERI +15 15
#note for some reason I agonized over this play for ages and then chose a lame option with a bad leave. just PIE or LIE at 9E are both fine. PIE is more defensive, LIE a bit less so.
>Trip_Payne: EEHIKLN L6 HENLIKE +87 101
#note nice play, I kinda wanted to challenge
>JD: EILRTUW M2 WILTER +28 43
#note oh dear. it appears that this isn't a word. it's not even better than any of my other choices. like TWIER. my winning percentage is already down the tubes. good thing it stayed on.
>Trip_Payne: AEGP L1 GAPE +31 132
>JD: EEFLOTU N1 FEEL +34 77
#note and now outfeel won't go down. it really didn't look like my game at this point. I should maybe play FEU instead of FEEL. FEEL does create a new lane though although it's not clear if that will be any of use to me

#note I thought about leaving the J, good thing I didn't
>Trip_Payne: AMT E4 MA. +36 219
>JD: ACCGMSU 11I GUC. +22 195
#note this is a key move
>Trip_Payne: X 6L ..X +29 248
#note blocking my huge scoring plays
>JD: ACFMSTY C2 MYC +27 222
#note with a couple of esses out I didn't think it was time to sacrifice the points and open another S hook. against conrad or kenji I'm pretty sure I would have to play it at M12. I should probably still do it anyway.
>Trip_Payne: EEINRV 1F VEERIN. +33 281
>JD: ?AFOSTT K11 .OFT +11 233
#note this is a really bad play. TOFT creates a nice diversion that he has to block and keeps row 10 open. this creates a really weak lane. my worst play of the day that wasn't missing a bingo or accepting THISTLED*.
>Trip_Payne: ANSSTUY -ANSSTU +0 281
#note very fortunate that he didn't block
>JD: ?ADDIST 10B DIDAcTS +68 301
#note somehow I totally missed the nonbingo plays at O1 which are way better. this is another big mistake.
>Trip_Payne: EIN F1 .INE +17 298
>JD: DEIOORS 11B ODOR +23 324
#note no oroides, I think this is a pretty good try rather than playing short.
>Trip_Payne: AOT B1 TAO +19 317
>JD: ?EIILSS 14D SILkIES. +61 385
#note just wanted to make sure there was no way he could bingo out
>Trip_Payne: BENRUVY 12D NERVY +41 358
>JD: AAHIOR A1 AH +29 414
>Trip_Payne: BU I1 .UB +8 366
>Trip_Payne:  (AIOR) +8 374
#note unfortunately I didn't play that great and really had to get lucky to win this one.
