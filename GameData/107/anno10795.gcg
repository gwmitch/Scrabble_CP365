>Matthew_Larocque: AANNSTY 8H ANY +12 12
>Mike_Ebanks: BEOO 9G OBOE +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEINST 7B ETESIAN +64 76
#note Even when I get great draws like this, Ebanks is one of the guys I consistently lose against.
>Mike_Ebanks: DEIW 6B WIDE +36 56
>Matthew_Larocque: AACNOQX D4 CO..X +46 122
>Mike_Ebanks: FT 5D .FT +24 80
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEKNQ F3 QA. +12 134
#note Maybe this was the wrong call. I kind of instinctively ditch the Q as hastily as possible. Even though AKEE 10E scores 26, there's a pretty good chance he'd have had an A or an I to hit me back.
>Mike_Ebanks: AGNT 10I GNAT +19 99
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEEKN K10 .KEE +16 150
#note I didn't know KE(T)ENE which looks like the best play by a long shot.
>Mike_Ebanks: ACDV 12H CAV.D +28 127
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEELNW H12 .LAW +27 177
#note Still leaving myself vowel heavy, but have to keep scoring all the same.
>Mike_Ebanks: MRT G7 .M.RT +16 143
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEEGN 11K .AE +11 188
#note Didn't find EAG(L)E which scores an extra point and dumps an extra vowel.
>Mike_Ebanks: ??AGHRS N8 GnASHeR +80 223
#note Wow are you kidding me, I never even held this. It just sounded like something that would be a word. Like biter, chewer, gnawer, chomper..... etc. So I mean yeah, this loss is all on me, but I was totally sure the word would be fine :/
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEGNNN 11B GENNE. +14 202
#note Was pretty sure this was a phony, but I just got double blanked with this garbage on my rack. I'm going to have to get a little crazy.
>Mike_Ebanks: AJU 8L JU.A +60 283
#note lol
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIINVZ G2 VID +23 225
#note No As or blanks left, so I can do this without worry.
>Mike_Ebanks: ELR 5C L...ER +20 303
>Matthew_Larocque: EIINSUZ D10 E.NUI +10 235
#note Yeah I can play Z(E)IN for 26, but that's not good enough. I need to get more points out of it, and Mike might think ENNUI doesn't take an S.
>Mike_Ebanks: BSUY 15L BUSY +46 349
#note Seriously, how many points did he get because I let *GnASHeRS stay on? I guess I deserved it though after I played *READVISE in a tournament for 90-something points and my opponent didn't even hold.
>Matthew_Larocque: ILORSUZ 14F ZO. +32 267
>Mike_Ebanks: FO M13 FO. +22 371
>Matthew_Larocque: IILPRSU M6 UL. +4 271
#note Just take the points at 15A now? I thought I'd try and set up my P or something nonsensical.
>Mike_Ebanks: MOOT N3 TOOM +22 393
>Matthew_Larocque: HIIOPRS O2 OI +4 275
#note Well I totally missed SHIP for 45 and HIP for 30 parallel to TOOM. I'm just being totally stupid setting up my P again when Mike probably has the other P.
>Mike_Ebanks: PR 10C R. +4 397
>Matthew_Larocque: HIIIPRS 1M HIP +39 314
#note Mike had a duh moment himself, he did have the other P. He left the spot alone and forgot I also had a P.
>Mike_Ebanks: DEILPRT L2 PERIL +19 416
>Matthew_Larocque: IIRS 15A IRIS +22 336
#note Mike did check ENNUIS here, so it might have been worth using the spot earlier to get an extra turn.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (DT) +6 342
#note -10 from the time for me.
