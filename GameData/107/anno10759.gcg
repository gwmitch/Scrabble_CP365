>Eric_Peters: AEEW 8G AWEE +14 14
#note Nice placement.
>Jackson_Smylie: AEEEKOT 7G KOA +32 32
#note Best.
>Eric_Peters: CMOR 6F CORM +32 46
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EEEOST -EE +0 32
#note Best.
>Eric_Peters: V H5 V... +10 56
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AEEOST 9A cOATEES +67 99
#note No overlaps and possibly a challenge. He holds a while then figures I would play goatees if I was unsure of cOATEES
>Eric_Peters: GILNRU A9 .URLING +24 80
>Jackson_Smylie: ?FGISUZ D7 FU.Z +17 116
#note Best.
>Eric_Peters: DE D7 ....ED +38 118
#note I was worried about that.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AGHINS 15A .NASHInG +89 205
#note Didn't know (G)INGHAmS.
>Eric_Peters: ACNO F12 CON. +8 126
#note He lays down his N and A at E9, I assume he has an R or T. And he blocks QI. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AIQRRRT C6 QI +18 223
#note I'll hit T(E)AR next rn.
>Eric_Peters: IPY C11 YIP +24 150
>Jackson_Smylie: ADIRRRT 13E D.RR +6 229
#note (E)AT, (E)RR, D(O)RR. I think he's close to a bingo so I prefer DORR to ERR. D(O)RR is fourth.
>Eric_Peters: ANT E8 N.AT +33 183
>Jackson_Smylie: AFIORST H12 F.O. +12 241
>Eric_Peters: X 10D ..X +60 243
#note I thought he may be setting up ZAX, but I didn't want to waste an S on blocking it. I asked him after the game whether he set it up, he said he drew the X after NEAT.
>Jackson_Smylie: ABINRST B8 B.T +11 252
#note Forgot KOAN, which sets up an S hook (N(E)B J7). B(O) sims best, with B(O)T third, but i like N(E)B. 
>Eric_Peters: AHW I10 WHA +14 257
#note The problem with playing this guy is I can't tell if he is fishing or just sucking. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AINORST 14H .RATIONS +70 322
#note I'm so good.
>Eric_Peters: EJT O12 JE.T +57 314
#note He spends 3 mins then plays JE(S)T. Leeds'd.
>Jackson_Smylie: BDEGMOY L11 GOY.M +28 350
>Eric_Peters: AE 11K A.E +8 322
>Jackson_Smylie: BDEILPU 10M PUB +13 363
#note PUB seems to block everything. I wonder why PIU sims 3.7% better. 
>Eric_Peters: U 14E U. +9 331
#note I forgot that all simulations need the 'opponent is eric peters' button that makes everything 120% high win %.

>Jackson_Smylie: DDEEILS 12K D.E +12 375
#note I prefer D(O)E to DI(M)E because I want to bingo after he inevitably opens things up. And DE(B) is just silly.
>Eric_Peters: E M9 E... +7 338
>Jackson_Smylie: DEIILSV L7 VID +11 386
#note ?????? Why does VID do so poorly? It sims worst, with VE(EPEE) best, then VI(E), DI(B), and LI(B), the last two are just silly. All of the four best are 86.7-87.7% win %. VID is at 78.2. ???????
