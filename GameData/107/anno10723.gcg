#note tossing back the Us is an option too, I figured I would set up the S. the winning option by a long way is UNIT - OSU has some synergy.

>Gab_Wong: ADF J3 FAD +17 97
>JD: AAELNOS O1 A.E +9 60
#note overthought this one, but for some reason ALNOS seemed to hit more than ELNOS, especially with so many Es left. opening with ANOA doesn't seem right.
>Gab_Wong: DIINORT 9A DINITRO +64 161
>JD: AHINNOS A6 HON.A +27 87
#note I didn't see ohia. it's probably the right move even though it's very defensive.
>Gab_Wong: CEEOO B2 COOEE +25 186
>JD: BCINPSS 9J SPIC +23 110
#note ok idea but I should've moved it over a spot!
>Gab_Wong: DEX C3 DEX +39 225
>JD: BILNRSW L8 W.N +10 120
#note I don't like this play in retrospect because it makes it too easy for him to block that side of the board. I debated between this spot and GOWN, and I think GOWN is better.

#note it starts to go downhill in a hurry here...
>JD: EIIIMQR -EIIIMQR +0 194
#note I figured that rather dumping the Q I might as well try to draw one of the five tiles in the bag that actually scores points (blanks, esses, Y). quackle agrees!
>Gab_Wong: ALY 14D .AY +32 328
#note so much for the Y
>JD: AEELOTU N8 EAU +14 208
#note seems like a fair try, especially if he doesn't know spicae...but I am in deep trouble
>Gab_Wong: GIMR O5 GRIM +33 361
#note unfortunately gab has the last scoring tile that fits at O8
>JD: EELLOQT -EELLOQT +0 208
#note I should probably just cash in my chips and give up with EXTOLL rather than trying this again but it hardly matters
>Gab_Wong: ?NS 12J oNS +32 393
#note of course, little did I know that gab's last draw after GRIM included ??S. By this point I was in full-blown heckling mode and I kept asking gab "how many blanks do you have now?!" He finally caved and told me he had just drawn both of them, and then played this ridiculous play.
>JD: EEEIITV 5B ..IT +22 230
#note I have no idea what I was trying to accomplish on this play. it had been a long day.
>Gab_Wong: ?AILNOS F1 LIAiSON +72 465
>JD: EEEQRTV 1D RE.EVE +30 260
#note leveret is a much better play

#note Gab went over and I didn't! nyah! by the end of this game I was coffeehousing at full volume and we had people around us laughing. 1-6 and time for a giant bottle of asahi.
