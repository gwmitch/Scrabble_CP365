#note this is a weak play, I didn't like OPV as a leave but it definitely beats FTV, theft is the play
>Dean_Saldanha: AMOSSTW E3 TWASOM.S +76 174
#note well, theft would've helped

#note I may have missed my best chance to come back right here - given the circumstances playing OUTFAKED* might have been worth a try. I didn't bother trying it because I thought it looked too ridiculous but dean indicated that given his rack he might have ended up accepting it.

#note I figured I would retain TOOK as a good backup play, but why not take the points now and see if I can beat 18 next time?

#note this play is too cute

#note gotta create lanes somehow, now I have an S hook.
>Dean_Saldanha: EEGNR 15A GREEN +24 346
>JD: BEELLYZ C1 EELY +32 253
#note I imagine a sequence where I play EELY, draw an E and play ZEE, and then bingo from the Z to win. sure, it's not goingto happen. a reasonable alternative is YELL to set up a BLAW hook to bingo with. one way or the other I am screwed.

#note now I wish I'd played YELL.

>JD: BEJORSZ 1A ZE. +36 298
#note I should block bingoes on column A and B first. JEEZ looks fine.
