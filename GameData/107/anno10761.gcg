#note I probably should never have tried this, but I figured it was worth a shot. also, I have to live up to the phonerz nickname. he may just have accepted it because he had a bingo.

#note rush at 8A is not a bad alternative but what the hell, it's vegas. I was hoping he would know sourish for sure so he would be less likely to challenge.

#note I didn't really need to sacrifice points and do this. gyved is fine.
>Mike_Baker: AGSW O6 SWAG +39 297
>JD: DEEFNOW A8 EF +27 434
#note it seemed like optimal tempo to take this play now since he can't play on M anyway. quackle basically agrees.
>Mike_Baker: DIU D13 .UI +5 302
>JD: DENORTW I9 TERN. +10 444
#note 5 points better to play TERNE now because playing TOWN gives him CABLET, but I wasn't sure he would see cablet and I was low on time.
