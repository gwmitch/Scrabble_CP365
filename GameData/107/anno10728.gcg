#note with a 50 point lead impending it seemed like a bad idea to create a volatile new lane with WOO at N1 even though it sims in front by a bit.

>JD: AILNORS N1 LO +8 303
#note this is probably the most important play of the game. quackle despises my selection. I figured that with a pretty good leave, my best way of guaranteeing a win even if he draws the blank was to try to hit a bingo of my own as quickly as possible - hence, why I tried to open a brand new lane here in a different quadrant in spite of being in the lead. quackle has a few plays I feel ok about - INRO at 14K does a pretty good job of beginning to close the board. Besides that,  if he does bingo on row 14 it will likely give me a scoring play back, which means I could fish with OR at B14 and go up 40 and feel prett safe. finally just cashing in with IONS at N1 looks pretty good, since even if he bingoes at the bottom right it will be hard for him to outrun me (although I'm in trouble if he bingoes to the C). Ultimately I don't think quackle is great at evaluating these kinds of positions, but I think I make it way too easy for him to get back in the game with this play, and I should probably just play IONS.
>James_Porter: ?AEIIST O1 ISATInE +80 352
>JD: AINORST N7 RATIONS +61 364
#note this is a super-tough position because the X is out. If I want to win without drawing the X I need to block the spots with my bingo - so AROINTS or RATIONS at N7 to block M13. As far as which one of those, I figured I would try to make his next play as tough as possible so I played RATIONS to prevent easy overlaps at M7.
>James_Porter: AADINRX M12 AD +19 371
#note he has three winning plays here - DRAIN at O10, AXONS at 13J or RADIAN at 14G. none of those are that easy to figure out.
>JD: FHORU B14 OH +21 385
#note I now have two winning plays, neither of which I found. my play only leaves me with one out but it was the best I could find under time pressure. HOUR at B1 leaves some outs and FUR at 6A which leads to a super-tough sequence to win.
>James_Porter: AINRX B7 X. +18 389
#note he mistracked and didn't think I had an out.
