>Maureen_Morris: AILQU 8D QUAIL +48 48
#note I hadn't played a game with Maureen in 2.5 years so cool to see that she played up to division 1 this time.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AFLNTZ G7 F.Z +29 29
>Maureen_Morris: AG 9G .AG +17 65
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AALNOT 7G .A +8 37
#note I saw ALATION, but was surprised to learn that it's the only 7 in this rack.
>Maureen_Morris: DEEJ I4 JEED +23 88
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ALNORT 5E OuTL.ARN +78 115
#note Or ORNAT(E)Ly (knew), cAL(U)TRON (no clue what that is).
>Maureen_Morris: EW 6I .WE +29 117
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEGTW 4A WAGED +31 146
>Maureen_Morris: MORS A4 .ORMS +30 147
#note She put it down kind of slow, was worried she was gonna play (W)ORMY.
>Matthew_Larocque: ANNOSTU D8 .UANT +28 174
>Maureen_Morris: ACENT 13B ENACT +29 176
>Matthew_Larocque: DELNOOS 14A ONOS +30 204
>Matthew_Larocque: DELNOOS --  -30 174
#note LOL I'm beyond terrible. Unforgivable. I arranged the letters as LOOSEND and quickly gave up. I've never been more happy to lose my turn playing a phony....
>Maureen_Morris: EX 14A EX +36 212
>Matthew_Larocque: DELNOOS 10H NOODLES +69 243
#note Really, I don't deserve these points.
>Maureen_Morris: AV 12B VA. +21 233
>Matthew_Larocque: BCEIORU C2 BU. +12 255
#note Wow I was stuck here forever. I couldn't find a damn thing. Actually I think I saw BOU(G)IE and was doubtful it was worth the risk. Didn't like BRUI(N) for the same reason. BIO 11I would have been what I needed here.
>Maureen_Morris: HNT 15A NTH +38 271
#note Ouch, I totally did not see that coming. I had long forgotten about that corner because I assumed it was dead.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEFIOR N5 FOREn.IC +64 319
#note I really tried to find a better scoring play here..... oh hey I can play the same word for 94! Way to go, me.
>Maureen_Morris: ESY O6 YES +31 302
#note She told me how undesirable it was to part with her S. So it would be safe to assume she didn't have the other one at that moment.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMOOT B6 EMOTE +23 342
#note Word to remember: ALANT.
>Maureen_Morris: IV 8L VI.. +11 313
>Matthew_Larocque: AGILOPR 12L LO.I +14 356
#note I was pretty lost as to what I should have done here, so I figured blocking the S hook couldn't hurt my chances of winning. I have no clue why I kept missing parallel plays underneath NOODLES the entire game.
>Maureen_Morris: HOP 13K POH +28 341
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIIKPR B1 KA +20 376
#note Yeah I saw plays like PIKI 14H, but honestly? The score is a little close to be giving away free triple word scores. Let her open it if she wants to....
>Maureen_Morris: BRU F10 BRU. +12 353
>Matthew_Larocque: GIINPRY I9 ..ING +9 385
#note I don't claim to be any good at endgames, mostly because I never keep up with my tracking. Quackle says.... just dump one of the Is somewhere. I said.... lets just finish the game asap!
>Maureen_Morris: DEIIIRT 14J DIT +15 368
>Matthew_Larocque: IPRSY 15L SPRY +35 420
#note I was going to play PYI(N)S but she in inadvertently set up my S.
>Maureen_Morris: EIIR 15H IRE +12 380
>Matthew_Larocque: I L4 I. +4 424
#note Oops, I(VIES).
>Matthew_Larocque:  (I) +2 426
#note -10 for me, and she underscored herself by 4 somewhere.
