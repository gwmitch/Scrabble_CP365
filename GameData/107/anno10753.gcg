>cesar: ?EEGOOS 8H OE +4 4
#note this is weird. i score 4 more points on average next turn and have a 83% chance of bingoing, vs 72% for EGO. but EGO 8H scores 4 more now, and also gives back 2 less points to my opponent, so it sims 7 points higher... i still choose OE. (-7)

>cesar: ACEEINS 1L .ICE +15 129
#note a straight out fish like D11 RE is super tempting but quackle says it only works ~53% of the time; that's way too low for 4 points. CAKE is the play, and then pACE. is INES better than ANES? i think i knew that at one point and forgot. (-5)

>cesar: ADELLNS O3 .ALLED +33 162
#note wandle is slightly better because there's 5 Ns unseen, i think.
>rpd: AGLO C11 GAOL +21 168
>cesar: ENSTUXY 15A UNSEX +45 207
#note oh GEEZ i was positive UNSEXY wasn't a word. i know it doesn't compare, but it is a word. my choices were between XYST and UNSEX, and i chose the latter because it felt like a better scoring leave, plus XYST leaves an undesirable B hotspot at 14B. still 6 points is too much to pass up so XYST seems better, but UNSEXY is clearly best... and i thought i knew the JQXZ 6s! (-11.5)
>rpd: II -II +0 168
>cesar: ACDIMTY 14A MI.D +25 232
#note might as well kill a lane, but i chickened out on 5I DICKY. PYEMIC K7 sims a little better than that. also MY F14. (-4)
>rpd: B B13 B.. +9 177
>cesar: ACFNTWY 5I WAC.Y +34 266
#note TWANKY is simming slightly better by win percentage. is it because of a -CT ending word? i don't know.
>rpd: AG G5 AG. +4 181
>cesar: DEEFNRT 4B FENDER +25 291
#note this was a tough move. here is my reasoning, which made sense to me at the time: it's going to be hard to keep her from bingoing and there are some high point letters out. they are therefore probably in the bag and i will need them for scoring after her bingo. that's about it. i saw 14A MILDED and knew that equity-wise it will be the best play by quite a bit, but my wacky reasoning won out. (-8.5) am i totally off the mark?
>rpd: AEINSTU 12G SINUATE +74 255
>cesar: JQT K11 Q.T +24 315
#note eek, i don't know what else i had, but the Q and J were definitely together because i remember feeling mildly satisfied my specious reasoning had worked. i can't fathom anything else being better than this though.
>rpd: IZ B4 .IZ +35 290
#note i was actually pretty worried about HAFIZ before she put this down. whew.
>cesar: AIJNOPT E3 A.JOIN +28 343
#note quackle is creative here with 3C PION setting up TAJ but i sort of doubt it's better. quackle also says robin bingoes about 0.2% of the time after ADJOIN or PION. because i am morbidly curious about what this bingo is, i did a log and searched for high scores until i found 13H NONTITLE. i didn't even see that spot. (-17) because PION is apparently significantly better.
