#note When I was drawing my tiles, the last tile accidentally fell out of the bag. No one saw it, how after some discussion it was deemed to be an overdraw.

Basically what ended up happening was Andrew knew that the last tile in the bag he was getting was an F. Luckily for me, he wasn't able to capitalise on it given the state of the board.

I was also able to block both out-plays here.
