>Josh: BEEEIOR H8 OBE +10 10
#note Interesting between this, BEE and EERIE. This gives the least back; I prefer it.
>Michael: ANR I8 RAN +13 13
>Josh: AEEILRY 11C AERILY +27 37
#note I should just play G9 AYE here. Didn't consider it.
>Michael: GRUU J10 GURU +17 30
>Josh: ACEEENV H8 ....ANCE +48 85
#note happy to get away with this.
>Michael: NZ F10 Z.N +32 62
>Josh: AAEGKOV 13B AGAVE +31 116
>Michael: ?AELRSU K4 mAULERS +67 129
#note missing pLEASUR(E), REUSAbL(E) and RESALUt(E). Michael must have been focused on this spot from last turn.
>Josh: CEEIIKO 12J .EIKI +18 134
#note I was pretty sure this did take an S, but not completely, and I think Michael would be afeard to add one, since very often I have played a phony and had him add an S to it. So this was an important play. I probably should just play COKE L1. I also considered phonying with ROCKIE or RICKIE, but that didn't seem worth the risk of it getting challenged, which is stupid, since Michael probably won't challenge.
>Michael: DEIMNRT 15B REMINT.D +64 193
#note especially with another bingo aligned and ready to go.
>Josh: CDEEOOO M9 COO.ED +32 166
>Michael: IMPP L3 PIMP +30 223
>Josh: EIJLORT 6J J..E +29 195
#note Maybe just to get the board open for my EILRT leave I should go for the equity with M2 JO. I just don't see that ending well enough times for it to be worth the patient play of JUPE. Also considered that Michael has yet to go through all the fives and wouldn't be sure of JUPED*.
>Michael: ATX M2 TAX +37 260
#note JO was the play! ;)
>Josh: EIILORT N2 ORT +25 220
#note This was a steady mistake. I just missed N1 OIL. Much better.
>Michael: BOS O1 BOS +24 284
>Josh: ?EHIILW N10 WH.LE +64 284
#note Wow, what a draw.
>Michael: GILOQSU O8 GULS +27 311
#note This was an interesting play by Michael. Shedding the S when it isn't valuable seems like a good idea. 14A QI still probably makes more sense, but that can be played next turn. Just a question of being able to better respond to me.
>Josh: ?DIIIOW M2 ...I.D +21 305
#note A very equalizing draw for me from the last one. Apparently I bingo 1/4 times after W(A)I(R) B12, and 8% after O14 WO. I drastically underestimated those percentages, so this was a mistake.
>Michael: IQ 14A QI +28 339
>Josh: ?FIIOVW O14 WO +22 327
#note Michael played QI too quickly. I didn't want to risk the game by playing WIV(E) D8, or FIVE or WIFE in the same spot. I had him with an S after GULS, so that was wrong too. Given that he can score making A(ZINE), I might be better off opening the board. But I think this is just hindsight speaking. I doubted that I needed to go for a bingo to win.
>Michael: AHOY 9C HOYA +28 367
>Josh: ?AFIITV 8A FIAT +32 359
#note Briefly considered NATIVIF(Y)*, but that may not win anyway, so it's not worth the risk. I thought it was more likely that I would catch him with a poor rack in the endgame and manage to eke out a win. I have a great fish here, that's totally the correct play to make. Can you find it?
>Michael: DNNOSTT L11 D.T +15 382
#note Wow. This is really what I had to hope Michael had, as I can't even win in this endgame if he plays his tiles right. So I actually figured out that I had a win after this play, but it was too late. I cannot believe that I missed a glaringly obvious play after this. Michael has to know two words that were not in his vocab to make the only out in two he has, which begins with 8G T(OR)T(E)N, an invariable 6 even I didn't know! Then he has (F)ONDS or DONS(Y) E5 to go out. That is the only win Quackle can find. Can you find any others? 
>Josh: ?EEFIV 7A ElF +28 387
#note The only way I can win is by seeing my most obvious play. And I somehow missed it. L8 FE...
>Michael: NNOST N6 SO +23 405
#note -5 to 14H (C)OST, as Michael loses a whole lot of momentum here.
>Josh: EIV B12 V... +7 394
>Michael: NNT A7 ..T +6 411
>Josh: EI 14G I.E +10 404
>Josh:  (NN) +4 408
#note This was another very intense game! I wish it had gone better though, but I figured out what I did wrong in the endgame easily enough. Just a question of making sure I see all of my candidate plays in the endgame instead of focusing on other things.
