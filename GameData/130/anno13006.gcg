#note quackle likes this about as much as GESTS.
>Chris_Williams: ELZ F4 L.Z +32 62
>JD: EKSSTTV 3K V.T +12 78
#note tacking on the S is close. however, I have to think that doign so would give him extra information about my rack. VEST isn't an option because of VESTA.

>JD: EKNOSST H4 .....S +21 99
#note this is pretty bad, the right idea here should be playing KOI at I3. I thought I was being clever and defensive or something in regards to his 9 point play...but I need to bingo too! KOS also sims well at N2 (bingo percentage is higher with ENST than after ENSST) but I like it less.

>JD: EEKNOST 13C KE.STONE +84 183
#note KEYNOTES should be better, even if I think he's likely to bingo.
