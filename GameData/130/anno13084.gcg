#note OGAM is 33 but who wants to keep a U. Okay, I did last game. But that was 8 points instead of 5! Plus I played this before I had a chance to see OGAM. GAMUT looks cool too.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADELMP --  -92 190
#note I saw all these juicy scoring plays and ultimately decided that this sounded reasonably plausible and if it didn't work out I'd still have a good play next turn. However, given the scores after this, I should have guessed that she would have challenged if she had ANY doubt at all.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADELMP E11 PALM +31 221
#note I told her that I should play here just in case.  I mean, the last thing I need is FRITZ for a gazillion points coming down next turn.
>Anita_Rackham: EIZ 1L .IZE +45 195
#note There it is!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADENOS 2N AD +31 252
#note (E)NDOStEA is an 8 that I have missed so many times that it makes me feel ashamed of my scrabble rating. I feel less bad about ADENOm(A)s because that one is a little more foreign to me. Either way it's probably a sign that I need to study so I don't get smacked back down to like a 1300 rating.
>Anita_Rackham: Y 14E .Y +28 223
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENOSS K9 OSE +20 272
#note Well, there is a bingo here, in two different spots. However A(T)ONES for 32 is winning the sim. OSE is a few options down.
>Anita_Rackham: UUUV -UUUV +0 223
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AELNNS M3 NE +13 285
#note ALENc(O)NS. 80 points. 
>Anita_Rackham: ?CEEITX N4 EXCITEd +77 300
#note That was unfortunate. I was feeling good until I realised I couldn't find any bingos. Now I was feeling like crash and burn was imminent and inevitable.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILNRS H3 LA. +6 291
#note Just try and stop me now!

>Matthew_Larocque: ?DINNRS 12L RIND +24 359
#note I totally missed the S hook she set up. This becomes important later.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?EHINNS --  -20 359
#note Well, it looked like HI upside down! I start laughing like an idiot. She asks me what I played and I just keep laughing. She waves her hand and challenges it off. Then it dawns on me. Oh, and what the heck at NINE(BARKS). People know these words?

#note Terrible play but I had to beat the clock.
>Anita_Rackham: W 9C W. +9 386
>Anita_Rackham:  (?IN) +4 390
#note She must have been taking a gamble with the HOE play, but given the scores I don't think she needed to put the game in such a position of chance. Either way, I got real lucky. Oh, and she was scored at 402. I used to always double check opponent plays and I've been really lax with it lately. 10+ points is just too much and it happens quite often.
