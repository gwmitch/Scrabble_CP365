>JD: NNPRRSY L9 SPRY +31 61
#note given his last play I wanted to keep lanes as tight as possible. quackle likes it even without inference
>Nigel_Peltier: EEIKNOP 10L .I +4 35
>JD: DEINNRU N5 INURNED +69 130
#note nigel almost certainly has a huge rack on this play. N8 and N9 both seemed bad.
>Nigel_Peltier: AEINORS 7B ERASION +72 107
#note he had aneroids if I play at N9!!

>JD: CFFGLUW O2 GUFF +25 273
#note it's about to get ugly...I figured I would block the top-right and try to score with my W on the bottom-left next turn.
>Nigel_Peltier: HI B10 HI +28 236
>JD: CEGILRW K4 CLERI. +18 291
#note I figured I would try to turn over tiles to get at one of the blanks and set my W up as an aside. it's an alright idea but WERGILD does the same thing much better...6 more points and a way better leave.
>Nigel_Peltier: DOY E11 YOD +26 262
>JD: ACEEGIW C2 CAGIE. +26 317
#note I can cash that W whenever - still trying to flip over tiles. the problem is that CAGIER does allow him to bingo a lot more.
>Nigel_Peltier: ?AEIRRT 14B ARTsIER +73 335
>JD: AEEENTW J5 EWE +31 348
#note I wanted to leave this lane and the one on row 2 open at the same time, figuring that he couldn't hurt me too badly at this spot unless he had the J. not sure what I was thinking - the game's super-close, and WERE definitely takes out the easiest spot to hit.
>Nigel_Peltier: AJS H12 JA.S +57 392
>JD: AEMNTTU N1 TAM +20 368
#note it's not loking great, but a play like MAUT keeps my best tiles and leaves the C, G and S all to bingo from. could be worse. why did I do this?

#note wow, I played really poorly. WERGILD, WERE and MAUT all would have been significant upgrades. I guess I didn't deserve to win this game.
