>Roxane_Gay: OY J6 OY +19 47
>Avery_Mojica: DEIINOS E6 DE.ISION +68 77

>Avery_Mojica: ?AENNTU 2M NU. +20 249
#note I couldn't find ToNNEAU or TUNNAgE, so I looked elsewhere. This is the best non-bingo.
>Roxane_Gay: ITW M11 WIT +19 227
>Avery_Mojica: ?AACENT 11K CA... +22 271
#note C(E)TAcEAN is a word apparently... I also missed CATENAs, CATENAe, and CyANATE. This is the best non-bingo.
>Roxane_Gay: QW -QW +0 227
>Avery_Mojica: ?AAEMNT N13 AM +22 293
#note If I would have seen Ni(Z)AMATE or META(Z)oAN (I was thinking of ECTOZOAN before the tournament actually as one of the words I wanted to play), I would have played it immediately. I wasn't satisfied with 70 at this point and I wanted something fun... That I could actually find. I also missed (E)MANATEs, (E)MANATEd, ANAThEM(A), and other 60 point plays. This is the second best non-bingo, AMA in this spot being the best.
