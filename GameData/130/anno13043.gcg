#note AIRPOST
>Emil_Rem: AKLR G5 LARK +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AIRSTU 5D URA.ITeS +78 86
#note Only 2x2, cause the U is crappy.
>Emil_Rem: AJM 4B JAM +32 50
>Matthew_Larocque: EHORSST 9E TOSHERS +82 168
>Matthew_Larocque: EHORSST --  -82 86
#note NOSH NOSHERS TOSH..... yeah no. If I was just going to pass my turn I should have tried *HOSTERS instead. HORSTES is the bingo in this rack. 
>Emil_Rem: EEOU I5 .OU.EE +10 60
>Matthew_Larocque: EHORSST 6F H. +26 112
#note Oh geez. E(A)RSHOTS. I must not forget that R hook.
>Emil_Rem: ENNU H1 ENNU. +18 78

>Emil_Rem: EFH 10B FEH +24 127
>Matthew_Larocque: DFIILRU 4J LURID +23 257
#note FU(N)DI starts shutting things down, IF 9B sets up LURID which is probably a decent gamble.
>Emil_Rem: ABER 12D BEAR +34 161
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFIIYY 9F AY +25 282
#note YAY because who wants to keep a Y, but then watch him play COLZA or BAIZA.
>Emil_Rem: BGINNN M3 B.NNING +26 187
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEFIIY 9B IF +24 306
#note Eh what the heck. I'll probably still have EI(D)E next turn.
>Emil_Rem: AQST 13A QATS +35 222
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEEINY N2 EI.E +16 322
#note Q is sending me a message that the E at H1 is an issue since it's wanted me to block it for 3 turns now.
>Emil_Rem: CLP 7K CL.P +8 230
#note I'm not sure if he was just consonant heavy or trying to set something up, but it seemed like he probably had the blank here.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEENOY 8M .AY +22 344
#note Since it also takes a T hook I have to block this now. Fun fact - there's only 78 eight letter words that start with a Y.... X is the only letter that's worse. but hey, I can rest easy since he won't be able to play gems such as YOKOZUNA and YASHMAKS. Turns out he didn't have the blank though, so CO(N)EY is a far superior play.
>Emil_Rem: DEOZ 2F ZO.ED +39 269
#note And this doesn't come down.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEENOO B4 .OE +12 356
#note ECOtONE. 
>Emil_Rem: AADILOV 13G AVOIDAL +80 349
#note My gut was "OVOIDAL, not that!", but then it actually started to sound like a word. Poop.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CENOT A11 TO.uE +42 398
#note Missed my last letter. Maybe this is bad, but the remaining pool is decidely unpleasant so taking the points seemed like a good idea.
>Emil_Rem: GIIIOTV H13 .IG +21 370
>Matthew_Larocque: CGNTWW B12 W.NT +23 421
#note Yeah I guess TW(A)NG gets rid of the G too and blocks his VIT(A). Heck W(A)G even saves W(A)NT for next turn!
>Emil_Rem: IIOTV L10 VIT. +14 384
>Matthew_Larocque: CGW 11K W.G +14 435
>Emil_Rem: IO 14M OI +6 390
>Emil_Rem:  (C) +6 396
#note A little rough, but I held on for the *avoidal of a loss.
