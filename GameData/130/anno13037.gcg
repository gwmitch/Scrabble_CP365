#note see, with collins, unless you're missing bingos, usually your play is decent anyways. BEWET# and WEETE# are the two best plays here, but i guess if i don't know anything else.... (-6.5)

#note i don't like blocking lanes like this. 4C BIOTYPE is probably better. ?

>cesar: AEEGITZ B9 .GATIZE +42 81
#note is this the right thing to do in this situation? a lot of the time he shouldn't have that big of a comeback. F2 GAZE looks safer.
>wiegand: JKRS 15A J.RKS +63 230
#note blah.

#note hebetate is ours. i also don't know words. that woulda been useful. (-43)

#note i wanted to try embolise# but then i saw this. funny how embolize# is not good in ours and that's our spelling. (-1.5)

#note pretty sick
>cesar: ADEPRTY C3 PRY +29 253
#note a7 decay ? or 2K PATY? both look better to me even though PRY sims a tiny bit better.

#note F6 CHENET# looks pretty sweet. quackle seems to be giving K8 FRET a significantly higher win % because of entropy (stdev), but it's probably because it's playing weird static plays for wiegand to the triple that i then 3-3 through. :/
