>Matt_Canik: DFIIMSW D10 IMID +20 108
#note Down a bunch early, I want to make sure this board stays open, so I thought it was okay throwing this and its hooks out there. Shoulda played (B)IFID. 
>Doug_Riblet: HIJ 3G H.JI +35 232
#note And after a Z, RETINA bingo, X, and J, I'm down 100. Cool.

>Matt_Canik: ACLORSY 14H OY +10 371
#note This opens up a really hard-to--block lane. I've got next to no shot at outrunning him, I feel like I need the bing here. I don't see *much* that I can draw into ACLRS without getting the E, so I really hope I can get that.

Duck likes (A)Y G8 for 9, gives me shots at OSCULAR/OCULARS/CAROLUS with a U, ESCOLAR and friends with the E, SCROTAL with the T, and CORRALS with an R , but I don't see where CORRALS would fit.
