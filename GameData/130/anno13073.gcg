>Matthew_Larocque: ADEORTT 8F ROTATED +70 70
#note I should have taken the 2 point hit for a little more defense.
>Mike_Ebanks: ACDEIIR J6 RA.ICIDE +69 69
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLORR 11F GLOR.A +14 84
#note This is pretty meh, but these letters don't score anything on this board. G(I)RO gets the nod from the sim. 
>Mike_Ebanks: OW I11 .OW +22 91
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEEOR H11 .READ +32 116
#note R(OD)EOED!
>Mike_Ebanks: ??GINTT 15H .oTTINGs +77 168
>Mike_Ebanks: ??GINTT --  -77 91
#note I didn't challenge this with absolute confidence, but my gut told me that DOTTING wasn't a noun. He has a good number of bingos here including 3 from the D.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEEIKO 7I K.DI +31 147
#note I assumed that if he saw any bingos he was absolutely sure of, he would have played one of them. This leave is terrible, but I expect him to fish next turn and then if I have too I'll block the D.
>Mike_Ebanks: ??GINTT 9I T.N +16 107
#note Haha, my play actually opens up another 9 - NIGhT(ID)E!
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIOSU 15F EI.E +5 152
#note Have to block, he has two blanks.
>Mike_Ebanks: ??EGITY 14D GEY +28 135
#note He's probably better off using one blank to score big in this spot.
>Matthew_Larocque: EILOSUU M2 LOUIES +25 177
#note Killing the s-hook to make it harder for him.
>Mike_Ebanks: ??IQT 2J QuI.T +66 201
#note So much for that.
>Matthew_Larocque: AABFOSU D12 BU. +12 189
#note I used up a lot of time here. I can't imagine him wasting his blank on this spot, so I might get easy points next turn. Maybe I should be worried about him s-hooking QUILT, but I'm still behind so I have to gamble a little.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?GV 6L V.G +18 219
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEFOSU 15A OAFS +32 221
>Mike_Ebanks: ?EIOPTU F2 POUTIE. +17 236
#note I was shocked at Mike's decision here. He played the bingo at first, then withdrew it and changed to this. I knew that *SPOUTIER was a phony, and I figured he was setting that up. This should have been Mike's game and he should have played the bingo.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEMOUYZ O1 ZYME +74 295
#note I knew I would probably lose my turn here, but it was so many points! If he lets me have the phony I'm in a good position because I know the s-hook he set up is phony.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?AINV 3C AVI.N +18 254
#note He doesn't even hold!
>Matthew_Larocque: ABJORTU 13C J.BA +36 331
#note BO(GEY) ranks higher. Chances are low of me actually drawing J(I)NN or JI(V)E, but I suppose I will likely still have J(U)T(E) at least.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?HN G7 H.N +20 274
>Matthew_Larocque: EHOORTU D1 HO.E +28 359
#note He can still conceivably bingo, O(V)ERHOT blocks better and ends the game faster.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?CISS 3I CIS +20 294
>Matthew_Larocque: LMORRTU 5D RU. +17 376
#note Dunno. I missed RO(T)L, but who wants to keep a U.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?EFLS 1F SELF +31 325
#note Ok, so I stated earlier that I knew this was phony. And if he had used it for a bingo, I would have challenged 100%. But in this situation, I was low on time and I don't need to challenge in order to win. There was like a 1% chance that I had gotten SPOUTER and *SPOUTIER mixed up, since I did at one time think SPOUTER was phony. I've also had a few really nasty games with Mike where he snuck up and beat me because I choked, so even a 1% risk seems like too much with Mike now.
>Matthew_Larocque: ALMORTX 4L L.X. +22 398
#note Oh, and while I briefly put Mike on hold, I mistakenly thought I could play AX 1K. I thought I would have been playing A(iS) for some reason. So I mutter "oh crap" and quickly play this instead. Quackle recommends MOT(H) instead but it's just a matter of spread.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?AENNPW C2 N.W +13 338
>Matthew_Larocque: AMNORT B1 MO +14 412
#note Bleh. I just choked since I couldn't find anything.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?AENP A1 AmEN +27 365
#note He can go out but misses them I guess.
>Matthew_Larocque: ANRT 14A NA +10 422
#note TA(J) or RA(J).
>Mike_Ebanks: P 7E P.. +8 373
>Mike_Ebanks:  (RT) +4 377
#note Sucks for Mike, he misplayed his blanks and I got away with 74 points. But, I feel silly for letting *SPOUTIER go because I was pratically waiting for him to use it so I could challenge, and then I didn't because I really wanted a win against Mike for a change.
