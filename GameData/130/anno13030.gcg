>phonerz: AEILNOP 8C OPALINE +74 74
#note: Oh look, Jesse is a luckbucket. And in other news, water is wet.
>xp: ADINORW 9C WINO +28 28
#note: WO 7C is probably a little better, but WINO isn't terrible.
>phonerz: AABERTW 10D TAW +36 110
#note: Jesse was unsure of this rack. if correct, the star play is B(LO)ATWARE F7, which is ridiculous.
>xp: AAAADDR -AAADD +0 28
#note: Tile draw FAIL! Quackle doesn't like this exchange much. I didn't like this rack much, so we're even.
>phonerz: ABEINRU H7 I.URBANE +61 171
#note: Stop doing that, Jesse.
>xp: ACEHMRX G5 MAX. +38 66
#note: Bad play. Bad! MAXI/MANA/ALOW for 51 much better.
>phonerz: AABEIRT 13B ATABRI.E +74 245
#note: Will you STOP DOING THAT?!?!?!?!
>xp: ACEEHOR H1 OCHRE +37 103
#note: Sigh, now OCHREAE doesn't play. Just trying to open up more bingo lanes for him.
>phonerz: ADEILLS 2H .EDILLAS +80 325
#note: I was kidding about that opening bingo lanes bit. Sigh. Well, time to consult the playbook on what to do when you're 220 pts. down 6 turns into the game É oh, wait, the playbook says what you do is lose! well, at least i can try to make it interesting É
>xp: ADEEMPT O2 .TAMPEDE +92 195
#note: That certainly helps
>phonerz: ?EHIRST 5E TI..SHaRE +102 427
#note: phony. It's Collins. 1st off, it should be a word, so I don't feel too bad about letting it go. 2nd, if I do challenge it for some reason, he has about 7 plays of 87-89 to choose from the next turn. HER(ME)TISt is the 2x2 which is available. At this point, I say to him "you realize the payback from this game is gonna be a bitch, right?" Yes, here I am talking trash down 232. Well, at least I can bingo again ...
>xp: ?EEEFST 11H .EEFiEST +74 269
#note: (R)EEFiEST would've scored a few more, but this scores decently and opens a few bingo lanes. I am, in fact, still trying to win this game.
>phonerz: EIKNRRS G12 K.R +15 442
#note: Jesse goes fishing. LUCKFISH isn't good, but SUCKFISH is. Just sayin' ...
>xp: GGJQUUZ F3 QU.Z +73 342
#note: Quite possibly the ugliest rack I have ever seen. But this nice Z spot has been set up thanks to a bad play by me and a phony by him. And when I draw DIN out of the bag to go with my leave GGJU, it suddenly occurs to me that I still have a chance to win if something crazy happens É
>phonerz: CDEINRS 15A CINDERS +94 536
#note: Well, so much for that idea. DISCERN/KIRN for 97. See, I can trash Jesse here for missing stuff like that because clearly he is just the luckiest human being alive.
>xp: DGGIJNU B10 JUG. +28 370
#note: OK, well, that sucks. Nowhere for JUDGING to go down. So much for that whole 'win the game' idea. 
>phonerz: AGILOTY 7B OY +22 558
#note: Hey, you're up 166 and you've bingoed 6 times, why not go for a 7th? And this is a club game, mind you, so why not try something crazy?
>xp: DFGINOY 10J YO +31 401
#note: And since it's club, I'll go fishing as well, instead of playing FOGY for 40 or whatever it is. At this point, I'd be cool with seeing him bingo a 7th time. In a tourney game, I would play to get this sucker over with, and then break a pen and a clipboard and storm outside in a huff. But since it's club, meh, whatever. Go fish! 
>phonerz: AGILOTU 12B .UT +14 572
#note: First thing all game that didn't work for him. Luckbag.
>xp: DFGINNO A1 FONDING +99 500
#note: Amazingly, that worked. First 500 loss of my scrabble career. This game has officially gone nutters. The lunacy is now compounded by the fact that there is 1 tile in the bag and it's the V! Of course! What better way to close out one of the zanier games in history than to be V-stuck?
>phonerz: AGILOOV 12G ..VA +23 595
>xp: V -  +0 500
#note: Jesse challenged off REV/EVEV.
>phonerz: GILOO J5 .O +7 602
>xp: V -  +0 500
#note: Jesse challenged off QVH. d'oh! It's QVC! What was I thinking?
>phonerz: GILO J5 ..G +7 609
>xp: V -  +0 500
#note: Jesse challenged off LV, which was worth 55 back in Roman scrabble.
>phonerz: ILO E8 ...L +8 617
>xp: V -  +0 500
#note: Clearly the right play here is QUIZVLOW/VXI for 45 and hoping that your opponent has suddenly been zombified, at which point you may have some bigger problems to deal with than losing the game. "Brains É" Zombi Jesse! Run!
>phonerz: IO 3L OI +10 627
#note: The 1135 combined score is a club record, and I suspect there haven't been more than a handful of games in history with more points than this. Fun game to be a part of, probably the most enjoyable loss ever.
>phonerz:  (V) +8 635
