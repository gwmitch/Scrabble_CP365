>Wesley_Yocom: CCEILUY 8D CYCLE +30 30
#note He later said that he kept IU hoping to get an N for the UNI extension.
>Matthew_Larocque: EHPRRTU E4 HURR. +22 22
#note Yeah, I blanked on the R hook. :/
>Wesley_Yocom: QSU I8 SUQ +26 56
#note He was really torn when he played this. 
Then he drew his letters.
"Ahhh no!"
- Wes Yocom
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEJPTT D1 JAPE +52 74
#note I had no idea what the source of his grief was, but I reasoned at the time that maybe he had clunky letters and I should immediately score 52 points.
>Wesley_Yocom: DINX H5 IND.X +22 78
>Matthew_Larocque: BEOPSTT C2 BOP +34 108
>Wesley_Yocom: GINNN 5H .NNING +14 92
#note Yeah, he drew that many ens after he ditched the U. That's just cruel.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEOSTTU 1D .UTES +36 144
#note Or (J)OUST which I didn't even consider.
>Wesley_Yocom: EEORRSV D8 .OVERERS +78 170
#note For some reason this word just sounded funny like it was somehow redundant. 
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILOOT 15C I.OLATE +21 165
#note I haven't studied the 5 vowel eights so I wasted a lot of time here, then figured I was too vowel heavy to make a lame short play. In any case I do need to take out this S despite what the sim says.
>Wesley_Yocom: ATV B1 VAT +27 197
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDINOT A2 BANDITO +97 262
#note Wow, what a draw.
>Wesley_Yocom: AIU 10I .UAI +15 212
#note "I'm going to do a vowel dump."
- Wes Yocom
>Matthew_Larocque: DFGRWWY 13C W.DGY +34 296
#note It's not often you get to score well with a nightmare of a rack such as this shining example.
>Wesley_Yocom: EGIO 10A OGI.E +13 225
>Matthew_Larocque: EFHMMRW K8 WH.RF +28 324
#note I saw F(E)H and F(E)M but missed F(E)MME. I should have played WH(A)M saving F(E)M for next turn.
>Wesley_Yocom: ?DEEINS M8 DElINES +79 304
>Wesley_Yocom: ?DEEINS --  -79 225
#note "Time to make the comeback."
- Wes Yocom
>Matthew_Larocque: EFILLMM 11C F.MME +37 361
#note I can't really stop him from playing a bingo, and I got lucky by drawing the other F so I got a second chance at this play.
>Wesley_Yocom: ?DEEINS M1 dESI.NED +70 295
#note His best move is ED(G)INESs for 85.
>Matthew_Larocque: AILLORT L12 ALIT +20 381
#note It scores and  takes out one of the bingo lines, but sim says play ALTO instead. I don't get it.
>Wesley_Yocom: AAKT G3 KATA +23 318
>Matthew_Larocque: ELOOORZ J2 ZOO. +33 414
#note OOZ(I)ER.
>Wesley_Yocom: ?AEI 8K .A.Ed +27 345
#note He has a lot of out plays, the best being the tricky A(N)ImE at L4, with the runner up being AIs(L)E at 13I.
>Matthew_Larocque: ELOR M10 LO +16 430
#note Not to be outdone, OL(d)ER scores 15 while going out, and OR(I)EL scores 14.
>Wesley_Yocom: I 3G .I +6 351
>Wesley_Yocom:  (ER) +4 355
#note He was overscored by 9 somewhere... I really need to stop that from happening in the future.
