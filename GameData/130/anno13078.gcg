#note didn't look right
>JD: DEEGGIT C9 .IGGED +24 66
#note I have interesting info about his rack since he didn't bingo. Another consonant seems possible. other options are GET at 10B or EGG at 7A.

>JD: AEHIKLT 12C .LAIKET +26 92
#note didn't seem like there was a great short play to keep a good leave but KHAT at 7B is a better play.

>JD: IRRSSTU 10J ..UR +7 150
#note might've tried TSURRIS* if he had left it open, which jerry said he would have challenged off. a lot of quackle's suggestions such but SUER at 7H looks like an upgrade on my play.

#note quackle doesn't like RAZOR because of the cheap points it gives up - but I figured at least it gives me a path to victory (draw a miracle bingo)
