>cesar: CDGLRRR -DGLRR +0 24
#note that's annoying, especially because GRRRL# doesn't fit. keeping a R is better than CR. maybe the C sucks in Collins. (-1)

>cesar: ABDOSTT 4D BOT +24 152
#note ARGH. not all duplicate letters are bad. STAT is a good leave. BOD for 27 at 4D is basically as good as this, but i like it better. i hate Ds and Ts together.
