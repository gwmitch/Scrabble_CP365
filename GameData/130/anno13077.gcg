#note FOOTLE looks better
>Mike_Frentz: AFN 15A FAN +26 95
>JD: KLORTUW 11E T.L. +14 133
#note KUE looks like a definite upgrade since it dumps the useless U, upping my bingo percentages from 3% to 12% while still blocking his best spot to score
>Mike_Frentz: AADLNSW -AADL +0 95
>JD: DIKORUW F6 WO. +14 147
#note I don't have my rack for this turn but I think I may have missed KIWI.
>Mike_Frentz: EM I12 ME +14 109
>JD: CDIKRUU J11 DUCK +33 180
#note KUDU is easily the play!
>Mike_Frentz: CEINOSS K6 COSINES +80 189
#note kudu prevents this although he still bingoes
>JD: ?DGIRRU 10K .URD +9 189
#note quackle suggests RID at L7 as a less dramatic way to open the board. I think I agree.

>Mike_Frentz: ?AEHTVX 6D VA. +9 319
#note I think this may have been his actual rack
>JD: ADEEIRS 3H .ERAISED +70 367
#note might as well just take the points with drearies, I think - can't do the other reraised because it would give up an X play
>Mike_Frentz: HU 2M UH +22 341
>JD: AEIJNTT 2F JE.N +29 396
#note wins 100%...unless you decide to blow the endgame as I did. no bingoes fit

#note a nice try by mike, but there is absolutely no way in hell I should not challenge
>JD: AGIOTT 4N TO +13 409
#note we were both low on time and I figured he wouldn't be able to figure out a good sequence after I block HEXto

>Mike_Frentz: EOTX J8 OX +20 403
>JD: AGIT F2 .IG +11 420
#note so many winning plays! so much suck! GOAT, IT blocking his best spot...
