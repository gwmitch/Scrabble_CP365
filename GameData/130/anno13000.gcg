#note this is a definite mistake compared to PTUI, which makes it harder to play at 1H and keeps the useful H.

#note after looking at this position for a long, long time, I find that I only win about 37/120 endgames after making this move. I essentially lose if I draw the Q no matter what OR if I fail to draw a vowel. The problem is that there are also good tiles in the bag like the X and the S. The only real alternative I can find would be playing REV at M5, fishing for a bingo at 12H and trying to dodge the Q as best as possible. It's hard to figure out what the odds are like for that outcome (he's likely eating the Q at least 80% of the time), but I often don't draw enough firepower to chase him down, either. That said I think REV gives him more chances to screw up (cashing the X play too quickly, mistracking and not blocking, not accounting for the Q etcetera).

#note TYRE at A7 accomplishes the same thing but without allowing for a counter-setup...

#note I airmailed this play - if I play QaT at N8 I guarantee myself a huge score next turn since he can't go out!
