#note chris was nice enough to add some comments...if chris added a comment his name will start if off, otherwise it'll just be me

#note chris: "Q likes VEG which does stop NEWSMEN. That feels so weak, but with the blank, I understand the logic"

#note his actual rack! nice play
>JD: EGLPQTU F1 PULQ.E +21 190
#note I had no idea what the hell to do here. quackle actually likes fishing for LOQUAT again by playing PEG, which I didn't think of. my play is pretty terrible.

#note chris: "I felt I had to shed BV, couldn?t without employing the E. CHP work and Z should sometime. On sim, BREVE shoots to the top, then dips back down. I did not like paasing up ZEP, but felt it 2 or 3 turn-wise. Didn?t like  PECH at all, did not see ZEBEC."

#note chris: "sure, three more consonants"
>JD: ?ANOTXY 12G OX +37 262
#note I liked creating a new lane for myself after chris blocked the cheap X play
>El_Presidente: CEFJLNZ 10B CLEF +20 271
#note chris: "got an E on my 2 tile draw, but clunk is the word. JELL may be better, but when I am in a consonant ride, I want to play 4, though they could be AAAA."

>El_Presidente: ACIIJNZ O8 ZINC. +57 328
#note chris: "God, I wanted to cover 13G just opened which indicated very offensive tiles, but I can?t pass up 51."
>JD: AAAEEOR 14A AREAE +21 369
#note I saw ASEA but shutting down this quadrant seemed really good, and there were a lot of consonants out to help fill in AO
>El_Presidente: AHIIIJV 7A HAJI +27 355
#note chris: "AREAE was the game. I was miffed over not being able to do anything or to have gotten my paws on some balance. When opponent?s post-bingo draw includes ER, that is not good news for the home team. Here was the first of 2 Hail Mary?s."
>JD: AELNORT 8A ON +23 392
#note the scariest thing in the bag was the profusion of i's, so I figured I would play short and save BLAE.
>El_Presidente: AGIIIRV N12 .IG +10 365
#note chris: " Last Hail Mary in the hope that you have left the case  A in the bag. Sure; as if : )"
>JD: ADELORT 15J RELOAD +30 422
#note just playing it safe. I have BREVET to score some points next turn if I don't have an out. quackle actually likes fishing for my own bingo.
>El_Presidente: AEIIORV 3C VIO.I. +20 385
#note chris: "Let?s just get it over and keep spread as low as possible. Did not see OVARI(AN). I did see RED !!! : )"
>JD: ITU 6L TUI +16 438
#note chris: "Lost by 50. The consonant crunch at the midpoint, and triple I vs E?s and R were not overcome early or late."
