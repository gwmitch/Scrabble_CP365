#note I played this move on auto-pilot figuring that maybe if I was lucky I could hit a 9 through IN, but RIG at I7 only scores 11 less and bingoes 35% of the time as opposed to 10% for OP.

#note the moment of truth...the pool is terrible for bingoing but just about any play I can make at this point gives back huge counters. Plays like TAIL and LICIT sim OK because the board is pretty dead as long as I don't change anything and I can draw into lots of consonants. Unfortunately I made this play being convinced that it was very defensive...completely forgetting about the M hook which makes this super-volatile! it actually doesn't sim that bad but I should've just taken my chances with ILIA at 14G, I think.

#note I stared at this position for a long time - MILIA didn't occur to me which would've sealed the deal. I probably should've been more deliberate about finding all of her best plays - ASTONY is the scariest. But I was focusing more on making sure that I didn't get stuck with the V, and I liked MATH because it left VIDE/DIVAS. As it turns out I lose by 1 point in two different scenarios - ASTONY with an F or SONLY leaving FA for next turn. However every other play that doesn't involve MILIA loses a lot more. Long story short, it's a shame I didn't see the huge hook I created but Pat has to play perfectly to beat me, and even then she can only win 1/4 of the time.
