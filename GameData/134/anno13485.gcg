>New_Player_2: HOQRTUV 8D QUOTH +54 54
#note First match of the tourney against the best. I was pretty happy about my first draw.
>New_Player_1: ACDIRSS F4 SARC.IDS +67 67
>New_Player_2: ELNRSTV 5E L.V +12 66
#note Didn't think VENTRAL took the s, but there's no excuse for missing TAVERNS or VARLETS.
>New_Player_1: DGGIMWY 11C GYM. +20 87
#note MT: MIGGS might be a little better because IDGW is so bad.
>New_Player_2: EFNRRST H1 TREFS +43 109
>New_Player_2: EFNRRST --  -43 66
#note Ugh, big blunder here too. My chances of beating Matthew are getting slimmer and slimmer.
>New_Player_1: DEGISVW H1 SWIVED +58 145
>New_Player_2: EFNRRST D1 FERNS +32 98
#note Have to score here, don't want to pick badly again after RIF. In hindsight I guess FIRN is OK. Even then I'd be behind after drawing a bingo.
>New_Player_1: ABGGNRT I7 BANG +29 174
#note MT: Yeah, I should do GARB instead, obviously. Oops.
>New_Player_2: EEORTTZ 12B TOE +19 117
#note Missed OYEZ, wanted a good Z play next turn, but OYEZ is still much better than this.
>New_Player_1: EGINORT 2F TO.ERING +66 240
#note MT: Oh I missed FORESTING, which might be a little better because of things like what happens next.
>New_Player_2: AELMRTZ 1A ZAR. +48 165
>New_Player_1: AADEEIT 2A AE +19 259
>New_Player_2: EKLMOTU L1 K.OUT +28 193
>New_Player_1: AADEIOT 1L .ADI +30 289
#note MT: Damn, I whiffed on 13A IODATE.
>New_Player_2: EEEHLMR 3G H.RE +26 219
#note I knew I was missing an rh word. RHEME is best 13C.
>New_Player_1: AEEIOTW 13C TAWIE +32 321
>New_Player_2: AEEELMN 4H .EE +12 231
#note I really need a blank, quickly, since I'm still not too far behind. In that sense, MELENA (if I knew it) was by far the best play.
>New_Player_1: AELOORT 12G RETOOL +16 337
#note Great play on his part, since blocking the best line (2x2) is almost guaranteed to win it for him. Also, this permits him to likely draw a blank or two if I don't have them both. (MT: Strange-looking play, but I think it's the right thing to do. At this point, a big 2x2 seems like the easiest way to lose. So let's block that and leave him with lines are are difficult or unattractive. Plus this digs for blanks or the JX. I'm not going to win if I choke on one-pointers that don't bingo, so fishing here just wasn't interesting to me.)
>New_Player_2: ABELMNO 11K BAM +24 255
#note I don't like BLAME because there's only one E in the bag and because there is also a D somewhere, as well as one of the blanks at least that is very likely on Matthew's rack. MOB is a better leave but it blocks one the 14 lane. I also need as many points as possible here.
>New_Player_1: ?ADIINU 14G IgUANID +62 399
#note He said he wasn't completely sure about INDUSIA. I might have challenged, even though it's Matthew. IGUANID I was pretty sure of. (MT: Kind of silly I wasn't 12000% sure of INDUSIA, but whatever I like this anyways.)
>New_Player_2: EFJLNOP 15G FOP +38 293
#note Championship player likes NOPE in that same spot. It apparently wins 0,61% of the time, and the only other thing that has a win is NOPE L15, with 0,30%. Unfortunately the only bingos with FJL that I knew at the time were JELLIFY, JARFULS and JUGFULS, none of which are possible with the bag that's left. So FOP is really the only choice I see at this point, though maybe JEO(N) A4 is a possibility, if I get really lucky.
>New_Player_1: IILOPXY J6 XI +29 428
>New_Player_2: ?EEJLNN D11 ...N +7 300
#note At least this opens up some points with the triple.
>New_Player_1: CILOPUY M5 OCULI +11 439
#note Matthew said the only out in two he saw was this, but POLICY is best. He was running low on time though.
>New_Player_2: ?AEEJLN 8K JE.Ly +36 336
#note As I was also running low on time, I didn't see his other out, I thought this blocked it all.
>New_Player_1: PY 3C P.Y +16 455
#note Well done, Matthew. If it weren't for not playing VENTRALS, this may have been a closer game.
>New_Player_1:  (AEN) +6 461
