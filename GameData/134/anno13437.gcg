#note The only play I considered was MOILING, but I chickened out on it.  I thought I made a huge mistake on this rack.  Well, I did make a mistake, but not a 15 point one.  More like 6, but I could have done better.  I don't like K5 OI.

#note This play isn't even on the list, but it sims four points below DIM after I added it.  I hate fishing because I don't do it right.  I never catch anything anyways.  I wanted to play MILDS, but I wasn't sure of the pluralization.   If I had to do it all over again, I'll just play DIM.

#note Okay here we go.  I had a whopping 13 minutes left.  A record! Trying to block his bingo for chump change is silly.  I looked for a five with the Y instead.  This will give me a nice comeback on column A and  I'll have the game in the bag when he bingoes on column D.   He WILL bingo.  He won't be able to resist the bait.   I figured the only way he'll win is if he bingoes with ZINGERS.  But that's not going to happen.  It's much more likely he'll bingo with SISTErS on column D.  It won't be good for him if I draw the Z after this play and it'll be worse for him if HE draws he Z after bingoing.  I was at 46% to win with OPT and now I'm at 60%.  YENTA sims best and I agree.  YENTA forces him to bingo on column C while leaving big openngs for me.  NEEDY is a strong play (though not quite right).  With NEEDY, he can still bingo on column D OR C...which is something that I'm just  now noticing.  I wasn't even looking at column C. 
>Dan_Terkell: ?IINSST D4 INsISTS +70 316
#note It's almost scary how close I was.  Whoa, look at what the top play is.   I actually saw N4 SNIT over the board and thought that might be better than the bingo.   I didn't even see A8 NITS, but SNIT is top play anyway.  SNIT's win percentage is 57% and the bingo is a little under 40%.

#note Ugh, I messed it up.  A8 DATE is top play and it took me nearly ten minutes to find out why.  I mean, I'm sticking myself with OOR.  It's the top play because Dan HAS to play BIZ/BIZE/BIZES.  I knew this.  What I DIDN'T see was that I can play ZOO afterwards.  I didn't see it because I was too busy trying to figure out the highest scoring out in two.   Time to practice...uh...out in threes?

#note YES! I did it! I DID IT!!!!!! I DI-...okay, Tasha, calm down.  You're in public.  The good news is that I did what I was trying to do.  The bad news is that it still could have been better with ZOO and all that.  But I'm getting there.  FINALLY!!  So excited!  I'm gonna keep practicing!
