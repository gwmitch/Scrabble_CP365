#note This is the Division B championship game. The 3rd/4th place game didn't even have a chance at 1st due to spread. I was one game up over Rebecca at this point, so I either had to win, tie, or lose by LESS THAN 126.

#note G3 (JIVE)R for 19 leaving FLANS? is best because it doesn't empty the bag. My play still has 100% win, but is only vaulated 11.2 vs Jivers 48.6
