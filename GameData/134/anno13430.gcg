#note Matt told me to play the best game of my life, and I'm trying to do that. I'm taking time on every play, looking for things that I would not normally find. This is one of those things. ERICOID is also good

>Bruce_Shuman: ACIV 10D VICA. +16 26
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEFGNVX I7 V.X +42 134
#note Best play
>Bruce_Shuman: ?EGMNSS K5 MESSiNG +92 118
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAEFGNS J5 EF +30 164
#note GANEF is best here, after that is FAVAS and thn EF.
>Bruce_Shuman: ILOT D10 .OLTI +16 134
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAGNNOS F10 .ONGA +10 174
#note Missed ANG(I)NA, after that is AGA(I)N and then CONGA
>Bruce_Shuman: EGY L4 GEY +28 162
#note DEADPANS is the only bingo here. PADS is after, but VOLTIS is a phoney.
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AADNPS 15A PADS +34 208
#note DEADPANS is the only bingo here. VOLTIS is no good, but that play is second best. The best play besides DEADPANS is PAIN E8. I should take more time next time to look for all possible bingoes, because I almost never run short on time, and I may have found DEAPDANS.

>Bruce_Shuman: ABDE J11 ABED +14 176
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?ALNNOU L11 ANNUL +16 224
#note UNA(I) is beter thn this, and then AULD, and then ANNUL. I missed that spot at 14A. I need to work on making parallel plays.I'm pretty bad at that.
>Bruce_Shuman: HLOT 15L .OTH +21 197
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?EFOQTW N12 WEF. +20 244
#note WEFT is the best play
>Bruce_Shuman: AJM I3 JAM +28 225
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AEIOQT O8 QuOTE +48 292
#note I thought for a while about this. On one hand, this board is incredibly unbingo friendly, so I figured that I should take the points and be ahead a bingo. On the other hand, if it opens up for bingoes, I would want to be able ot take that opportunity. I decided to go for the points and close off the triple. Quackle says that is the wrong play. It has QA(T) 13B as best and TA(V) 7G as second best. It also has QuITE as 4th best, above QUoTE, not very sure why.
>Bruce_Shuman: BELNORU G9 L.B +22 247
>Amalan_Iyengar: ADEIIRT C12 AI +10 302
#note Wow. I actually made he best play here, even though it lost me the game. That is surprising.
>Bruce_Shuman: AEEKSTW B7 WEAKEST +80 327
>Amalan_Iyengar: DEIRRRT 8A D.TER +21 323
#note DETER is way down, behind plays like RETIRE and REEDIT. I just wasn't thinking straight here. Maybe I was demoriralized by the fact that he had just bingoed, but if I had just thought this play out, I mayhave won. IRR is a terrible leave, and RETIRE takes the D that I already have on my rack. None of them aregiving me a high win percentage. RETIRE is the best, at 30 percent, but it is still 10 percent better than DETER at 20 percent
>Bruce_Shuman: EIILN E3 LINIE. +12 339
>Amalan_Iyengar: AINORRU 4A URAR. +12 335
#note OUR is best, followed by URARI.
>Bruce_Shuman: AZ F2 ZA +33 372
>Amalan_Iyengar: INORTY G3 YONI +21 356
#note Well, I can't win. (W)IN(E)RY is best, followed by YONI
>Bruce_Shuman: EHORUU J1 RHO +23 395
>Amalan_Iyengar: RT C3 R.T +6 362
#note Noah also lost his game to Sam Masling, so Bruce gets first, I get second, Noah gets 3rd, and Sam gets 4th. I just don't know about AI. Quackle really likes it, but it gave him a bingo lane when I was up by 50. Before DETER, I think I was playing pretty well, but after that, it all fell apart. I need to hang in there, because there is always a chance, and I can't throw away that chance.
Congrats Bruce.
