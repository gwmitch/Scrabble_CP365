>New_Player_2: HOQRTUV 8D QUOTH +54 54
#note First match of the tourney against the best. I was pretty happy about my first draw.
>New_Player_1: ACDIRSS F4 SARC.IDS +67 67
>New_Player_2: ELNRSTV 5E L.V +12 66
#note Didn't think VENTRAL took the s, but there's no excuse for missing TAVERNS or VARLETS.
>New_Player_1: GMY 11C GYM. +20 87
>New_Player_2: EFNRRST H1 TREFS +43 109
>New_Player_2: EFNRRST --  -43 66
#note Ugh, big blunder here too. My chances of beating Matthew are getting slimmer and slimmer.
>New_Player_1: DEISVW H1 SWIVED +58 145
>New_Player_2: EFNRRST D1 FERNS +32 98
#note Have to score here, don't want to pick badly again after RIF. In hindsight I guess FIRN is OK. Even then I'd be behind after drawing a bingo.
>New_Player_1: ABGN I7 BANG +29 174
>New_Player_2: EEORTTZ 12B TOE +19 117
#note Missed OYEZ, wanted a good Z play next turn, but OYEZ is still much better than this.
>New_Player_1: EGINORT 2F TO.ERING +66 240
#note (F)ORE(S)TING would've been a nice find here.

>New_Player_1: ADI 1L .ADI +30 289
>New_Player_2: EEEHLMR 3G H.RE +26 219
#note I knew I was missing an rh word. RHEME is best 13C.
>New_Player_1: AEITW 13C TAWIE +32 321
>New_Player_2: AEEELMN 4H .EE +12 231
#note I really need a blank, quickly, since I'm still not too far behind. In that sense, MELENA (if I knew it) was by far the best play.
>New_Player_1: ELOORT 12G RETOOL +16 337
#note Great play on his part, since blocking the best line (2x2) is almost guaranteed to win it for him. Also, this permits him to likely draw a blank or two if I don't have them both.
>New_Player_2: ABELMNO 11K BAM +24 255
#note I don't like BLAME because there's only one E in the bag and because there is also a D somewhere, as well as one of the blanks at least that is very likely on Matthew's rack. MOB is a better leave but it blocks one the 14 lane. I also need as many points as possible here.
>New_Player_1: ?ADIINU 14G IgUANID +62 399
#note He said he wasn't completely sure about INDUSIA. I might have challenged, even though it's Matthew. IGUANID I was pretty sure of. 
>New_Player_2: EFJLNOP 15G FOP +38 293
#note Championship player likes NOPE in that same spot. It apparently wins 0,61% of the time, and the only other thing that has a win is NOPE L15, with 0,30%. Unfortunately the only bingos with FJL that I knew at the time were JELLIFY, JARFULS and JUGFULS, none of which are possible with the bag that's left. So FOP is really the only choice I see at this point, though maybe JEO(N) A4 is a possibility, if I get really lucky.
>New_Player_1: IX J6 XI +29 428
>New_Player_2: ?EEJLNN D11 ...N +7 300
#note At least this opens up some points with the triple.
>New_Player_1: CILOPUY M5 OCULI +11 439
#note Matthew said the only out in two he saw was this, but POLICY is best. He was running low on time though.
>New_Player_2: ?AEEJLN 8K JE.Ly +36 336
#note As I was also running low on time, I didn't see his other out, I thought this blocked it all.
>New_Player_1: PY 3C P.Y +16 455
#note Well done, Matthew. If it weren't for not playing VENTRALS, this may have been a closer game.
>New_Player_1:  (AEN) +6 461
