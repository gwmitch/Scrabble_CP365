#note All of my plays so far have been Quackle's top choice, but that's not saying much.  They were easy to find, and I didn't have any other very good alternatives.  Here was the first turn that really made me think.
>Dave_Koenig: EHIILNT O1 LINI.H +30 212
#note It's Quackle's second favorite play, but the best is the should-have-been obvious LITHS O1.  No excuses.  Not only do I need every point I can get against this guy, the I is helpful here because of the PUTTI hook, which may be the only way I can get seven letter bingos down.  I failed to think about that hook at all and was caught off guard when he took it later.
>Geoff_Thevenot: OVW C1 VOW +30 256
>Dave_Koenig: AAENTTW A12 ANEW +35 247
#note Another best play, and this time I had to look beyond the obvious 1A WAVE.
>Geoff_Thevenot: CDHIT M10 DICHT +29 285
>Dave_Koenig: ABEOTTY 1A BE.Y +48 295
#note If you find a good move, look for a better one.  This looks strong and is indeed the highest scoring play, but it is not the best.  For only 3 fewer points, N2 BETRAY solves the duplicate T problem once and for all and critically draws two more tiles with the blanks unseen.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?EGINRS 15G ErRINGS +89 374
>Geoff_Thevenot: ER (challenge) +5 379
#note Nothing I could have done about this, you might say, but if I had been sure DICHT took the S, I could have saved myself the 5 points of challenging it.  You think it doesn't make a difference here?  Just wait to see what happens.
>Dave_Koenig: AEEMOTT N2 MET.O +37 332
#note Another best play by me, both scoring highest and keeping the best leave, but I'm running out of time.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ER O1 ......ER +33 412
#note Fortunately, this one I knew and didn't have to spend any points challenging.  But he just left one in the bag, and I just drew CFG.  What can I do?
>Dave_Koenig: ACEFGRT 9H .F +21 353
#note Even if I could draw a bingo through the open letters in ORDINARS, he was sure to block it, unless I gave myself a second spot to bingo.  That's when I thought of the RECAUGHT possibility through the H.  Drawing the U isn't enough though, unless he misses it, which is highly unlikely considering who my opponent is.  I need to draw the blank to give myself ARGENTIC 1L as a backup bingo. Turns out if I do draw the blank, his best play is NEUK 14G, and he wins by 4.  Do you realize what that means?  Challenging DICHTS eliminated my last chance of winning the game.
