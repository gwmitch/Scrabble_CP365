#note Couldn't decide between short and long here. The way the next few turns played out, I definitely regretted playing long. I did consider ex. B, but decided it didn't hit often enough. In fact, ex. B is Quackl'es play. And short plays are the next best choice. So I botched this turn, apparently.

#note Maybe I should just do IOTA. Might be worth the risk. This leads to a closed board too often. Still not sure.

#note I regretted this play immediately. Setting up the S hook with no S or ? in hand was probably wrong. I don't need to bingo to win this. TAX is fine.

#note The sim says it's much better to play I6 QI. I am guessing the big factor is leaving more tiles in the bag, anticipating tempo in the endgame? I dunno. Obviously I want to ditch the Q and hope to outscore him somehow with the HP while he deals with the unattractive unseen pool. Currently, I don't have wonderful scoring options, so I felt the need to draw more than one tile to increas my chances of hitting a big play. I also just completely missed 14J PHI, which would have been a good play to bank, even if it's wrong to play it here.
