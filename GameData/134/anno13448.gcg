#note he just signaled an S, which makes this play worse. really all of my plays here suck. HAOLE or OAT sim best. OAT looks weird but EHNOR bingoes a decent amount of the time, especially with the C to play through. neither is very intuitive. Even OHO sims better than OOH.

#note DIXIT is less of a gamble, and my DEILT leave is clunky with this board - the sim is even. I should probably be decreasing volatility at this point and play DIXIT.

>JD: ADLRRST M11 LARD +14 239
#note I really liked setting up my case S, but LARD is risky because of the two unseen Ys. I didn't like giving cheap points away by playing LARD at 2L. on further analysis my favorite is LARDER at 11H which neutralizes the hot-spot at H12.

>JD: ACIRSTU 15H TRIACS +39 304
#note rather than go fishing it seemed best to block the big H12 spot and take some points. I could also play CITRUS instead. either play gives me a shot at drawing the blank.

>JD: ?AHIOTU 14I OH +28 352
#note I didn't know what to do here except for score and hang tough. maybe if I'm lucky I'll draw a play at A10. any other ideas? quackle likes THOU which seems wrong. what about THO at 8L? HIT at J2?
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EM A7 ME +22 375
>JD: ?AAIKTU 13I KA +29 381
#note sadly, after all this I drew the winning play and missed it under time pressure. mAKUTA seals the deal for me.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DEELMO M5 DOM +21 396
#note unfortunately I could tell I was doomed because he could just play MELOID...but he, in turn, chickened out of his game-winning play because he didn't see an out
>JD: ?AITU A10 AUdIT +9 390
#note the funny thing is that if I play MAKUTA it's only a one point win - then he will probably try MELOID, and I play KI for 6 to win by a point. Even just getting AUdIT in was split-second - I had about 6 seconds to put the play down and finished with 00:00
>JD:  (EEL) +6 396
#note quite the game! I did well to stay in range but it's a shame I missed the gamewinner. I could've had a 1 point win instead of a tie!
