>Will: AADEHLT F10 HADAL +35 257
#note Torn between this, F10 HAD, and H1 HAST. I still thought I might get a free crack at SPILING, so I eschewed H1 HAST to leave it open. HADAL gives me 4 more points and two more tiles with SSS?? lurking than HAD.

#note Darn! And COUGARS/SPILING was there too.

>Will: EKNRSST D12 KENT +37 333
#note 13L TSK! Does that really give me a chance, though? A long enough play through the K forces me to play down column A, and I can't find any 7s remaining holding ERNS that fit. I shouldn't empty the bag here regardless - KEN holding all the remaining hooks and leaving one in there would've been much better at least for spread.
