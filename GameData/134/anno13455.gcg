#note I like VID ok but all he has to do is play AVID to shut down my hooks, which james will see for sure

#note the board is now really closed, and james is very unlikely to open it again for me. since I'm already down 100 I felt like blowing up the board is my best chance of winning.

#note this is an extremely tough play! I could also fish off a U at 13C. quackle likes the one-tile fish hitting ALIENER, AIRLINE, AILERON...

#note duomo was the play I needed and looked for but just could not find...big miss, but I'm in a lot of trouble after james' next play (although I would've had the D to play to as well). this is ugly.

#note I'm basically tost at this point - maybe my best chance I sacrificing 10 points and playing ULVA at 10L, which I saw but passed up. I have a tie at this point in the tounament, so I probably should've gone for it, but I was low on time.
