#note Another one of these almost bingo racks to start.  Your guess is as good as mine here.
>Chris_Lipe: EEGP J7 GEEP +19 19
>Dave_Koenig: AEENORT I5 REA.TONE +71 81
#note Lucky both that this word was added in CSW12 and that it still fit after his play.
>Chris_Lipe: ADEI H12 AIDE +21 40
>Dave_Koenig: ?IJORSU K3 JUnIORS +90 171
#note It actually took me quite a long time to see this bingo, which is the only one in the rack. (No other sevens or eights.)
>Chris_Lipe: DEGHIN H1 NIGHED +50 90
>Dave_Koenig: CEFIIWW 14D WIFE. +20 191
#note WIFIE# 7C looks slightly better.  I thought it was good, but was slightly afraid I might be misremembering it because of WIFEY.  Anyway you look at it, the leave is not great, but as Chris said at another point during this tourney, "If I'm going to be drawing to a bad leave anyway, I'd prefer to draw more tiles."

>Dave_Koenig: BDDLLRT 2F DR.LL +12 229
#note TRILD# (a past tense of trill) is better in this spot.  Although T is a better tile than L by itself, the L has better synergy with both the B and the D.  Here's one way to think about that: you hardly ever see a T adjacent to a B or D in a word, but you often see an L adjacent to them.
>Chris_Lipe: PR 3K ..RP +26 189
#note Before making this play, Chris had laid down a word hooking an S at 6E.  I probably would have assumed he had an S anyway, but he removed all doubt.
>Dave_Koenig: BDINSTY O1 BIST +35 264
#note BITSY 6B is what I wanted to do here before his play, but taking out the S hook on column O seemed more relevant.  BYS O1 might be a slight improvement over my play.

#note By far his most likely bingo spot here is 9A-G, so I rush to take it out.
>Chris_Lipe: MU 7B UM +17 265
>Dave_Koenig: ?LOOOOV A7 VOOdOO +35 364
#note This is an interesting and instructive moment.  It's crucial to take out the A7 bingo lane, but it seems counterintuitive to burn the blank to do so, when there were alternatives for only 7 or 9 fewer points. (VOL at 12B or A7)  However, the value of the blank decreases late in the game, and I am unlikely to bingo again anyway.  Also, drawing to a rack of ?OOO is likely to put me in a situation where I can't score anything decent on the next turn and am forced to make game-prolonging, low-scoring short plays.  On the other hand, this move speeds to the end of the game, reducing his chances for a comeback.  In some situations, one of the advantages of the blank is not just to bingo, but that it can bail you out of a bad rack quickly.
>Chris_Lipe: EIRSTTU N3 .UTTIERS +66 331
>Dave_Koenig: AAAHKLT 3A TALA. +33 397
#note Looks like the best endgame combination here is 12C AH followed by L9 TALAK#, but I was less than sure of TALAK#, which is indeed an alternate spelling of the word that I played.  Once I committed to playing TALAQ#, there was no sense in delaying it to take out the big F score on O8, because that would allow him to play FONE# 5C taking out the spot.
>Chris_Lipe: AAAEEFO O8 FE +32 363
#note Better to burn an extra vowel with FAE or FEE O7.
>Dave_Koenig: AHK 2B KA +26 423
#note This is the second best continuation, but I missed KY B14, which nets six more points after OE B11 (to block AH 12C) and HA 2B.  AH 12C is not as good right away because he will play AA 14A taking out the high scoring K spot.
>Chris_Lipe: AAAEO A1 OA. +16 379
#note 14A AA is two points more.
>Dave_Koenig: H D12 H... +20 443
>Dave_Koenig:  (AAE) +6 449
#note I made an arithmetic error at the end which cost Chris one point on the score, and neither of us caught it, so it was officially recorded as 449-378.
