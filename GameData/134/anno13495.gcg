#note Dunno why I didn't play bank here.
>New_Player_1: DIIOUUY I9 YOU +21 21
>New_Player_2: ?BMNOST 12C eNTOMBS +83 101
#note An I works too. Cool.
>New_Player_1: DEEIIUW 13C DUI +16 37
>New_Player_2: AEIINRY 13G YA +24 125
#note I had no idea what to do here. I found the second best play, buy there were no E's out yet so AYE is much better.
>New_Player_1: AEEHIWZ 14H HAZE +44 81
#note Extremely scary for me. I have nothing good to block the T hook and I'm pretty sure he has a T. 
>New_Player_2: EIIJNNR I3 JINNI +28 153
#note Holding my breath.
>New_Player_1: DEIIRUW 2I DUI +20 101
#note Well then. I guess he really isn't drawing well.
>New_Player_2: AEEFLRT 15C REFLATE +112 265
#note I got extremely lucky here...
>New_Player_1: EIILMRW L12 WILE +33 134
>New_Player_2: AEGHNOW J8 HEW +38 303
#note WAGON is nice here. And wow, HAZELHEN.
>New_Player_1: AACEIMR 8J .AEMIC +42 176
#note Held him a bit, but I liked it.
>New_Player_2: AACFGNO G8 FAG +23 326
>New_Player_1: AEENPRT 4E APER.ENT +72 248
#note I might've challenged PREENACT, could've given him some leeway.
>New_Player_2: ACEGNOR 1K ACORN +32 358
#note Took a while here cause I had a feeling I had something. No excuse for missing ACROGEN as I knew it. I also chickened out of OCREA and missed OCEAN. Really bad play.
>New_Player_1: EEOOOVV 5C VOE +16 264
>New_Player_2: EEGIPRT M11 GET +17 375
#note REPEG, PEG or GIVE are also good here. I wanted to block something, so I'd go with GIVE if I had to choose.
>New_Player_1: DELOOOV E9 VOL.. +16 280
>New_Player_2: EIPRTUX O8 .UREX +22 397
#note This was extremely bizarre. The only word list that I've ever fully looked through besides twos and threes is X fives. I still manage to confuse LUREX and CAREX to form this phoney that Ross holds but doesn't even challenge. This could have cost me. Fortunately I have an undeserved lead.
>New_Player_1: DDEOOST 11A DOT +7 287
>New_Player_2: ILOPRST A11 .RIPT +27 424
#note Well, this actually comes up first according to Championship Player...
>New_Player_1: ?ADENOS C2 NAE.OiDS +74 361
#note I did hold here! You can give me that. I then remembered NAEVOID and let go. Apparently it's an adjective. I think even Ross thought it was good.
>New_Player_2: GILOQSS B7 QI +24 448
#note Wow, missed the one 6 spots up...
>New_Player_1: IR F2 RI. +7 368
#note I played pretty terribly near the end and didn't deserve this win. But I'll take it.
