#note I should fish with J5 VAR, according to Quackle, although this isn't too terrible.  L1 RENVOIS is also a little better.

#note Apparently EORT isn't that great of a leave, because several plays rate better than this. Didn't want to risk opening with Quackle's suggestion of N1 TORE.

#note Loved this play because it scored and left the board conducive to bingos, which I needed, but didn't give up any short plays on column A. However, Championship Player prefers just KA by 2.5%.

>Chris: EEMNNTY M12 MY +28 308
#note Missed 12L TYIN, which beats this by a couple percent. Quackle also prefers 11A TENTY, which I didn't like because it blocked a bingo lane.
>Mark: ADR L10 ..ARD +32 381
#note Nice play, I thought. Should I infer he has the S?
>Chris: EENNRTT 4K T.N +7 315
#note Quackle wants me to keep scoring, but I figure I need to bingo now or never.
>Mark: NT 2M T.N +6 387
#note A timely block of my triple-triple.

#note Out of time, I knew I would lose when I saw I couldn't stick him with the Q. Not long after I played this I saw 14F MO, setting up 15G HOOF, which loses by 20. I need to get better at finding these kinds of plays. Best is to concede the QAT spot and do 14I OF followed by 4F HOMO.
