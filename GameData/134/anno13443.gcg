#note I had just learned VAINESSE# shortly before the tournament and was 1/3 on it in my cardbox.  But I hadn't learned the rack well enough and didn't spot the bingo when it counted.

#note I could not convince myself to pull the trigger on SPEEDED, which is good even in TWL.
>Dave_Wiegand: CIIY 3B CI.I.Y +36 200
#note A beautiful play by Dave, scoring very nicely with a bunch of lousy letters.
>Dave_Koenig: BDEQRRW H10 B.RDER +30 215
#note I did not know WHEFT#, which would have been enormously helpful here.  BREW A9 is the play.

#note Even though I was in the lead on the move, I did not feel good about my chances in this game from this point forward.  I'm battling through the J and Q while the blanks are nowhere to be seen.  And there are too many open lanes so that shutting down all the bingos seems to be impossible.

#note Here I even hit my draw of the case I, but it wasn't enough.
>Dave_Wiegand: DNOP B7 POND +23 384
>Dave_Koenig: AEILOOO A14 .I +33 385
#note The faster ways to go out are useless because they don't score enough.
>Dave_Wiegand: ?LRV C1 VR.L +9 393
#note Dave's clock was down to a few seconds here, but this is good enough.  Although I can score well off the V, he will have MUSTANGs to go out.
>Dave_Koenig: AELOOO N3 LA.O +15 400
#note A desperation attempt.  Couldn't remember for sure if LAZOS# was good. (It is and so is LAZOES#.)  And I needed to deke him into playing a phony.
>Dave_Wiegand: ? 8K ...n +10 403
#note Dave played it safe and won anyway.  I can't complain.  I had my chances in this one.
