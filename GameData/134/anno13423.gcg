>Sam_Masling: EKNW 8F KNEW +22 22
>Amalan_Iyengar: EHMNOSU 7I OHM +15 15
#note I missed HOUSEMEN here, didn't know that. After that, Quack likes HOKUM. After that, quackle likes UH  for 14 leaving EMNOS. I liked ENSU better than that though.
>Sam_Masling: EILNOSU L4 ELUSION +75 97
#note Not the first time he's bingoed right out of the gate at me. Also the best bingo here, other options were EMULSION
>Amalan_Iyengar: ELNOOSU 6I LO +17 32
#note Darn. I missed UNLOOSE completely, as well as UNLOOSEN, two common words I should have gotten. After that, quack says ONO and LO, but I like LO better because I have that S hook for SLOW
>Sam_Masling: FOX M2 FOX +35 132
>Amalan_Iyengar: EENOPSU K10 UPO +12 44
#note missed POUFS, after that UPO  5H is best, but I disgree with that, because I'm down, and I would take two open bingo lanes next turn instead of scoring 8 moe
>Sam_Masling: CIOS 2J COI.S +32 164
>Amalan_Iyengar: AE 9F AE +12 56
#note Didn't write down my rack here 
>Sam_Masling: VW 12J V.W +18 182
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAENRSY I12 AR +13 69
#note Best. A  cool play would have been ANA(L)YSE for 50

>Sam_Masling: ADEINST 5C DETAINS +73 255
#note well, crap

>Amalan_Iyengar: AAENRSY 10E AY +31 100
#note best
>Sam_Masling: DITZ D10 DITZ +35 290
#note DITZ and ART would have been better-it also closed down a bingo lane for me
>Amalan_Iyengar: ABEENRS 14I BEANERS +77 177
>Sam_Masling: AIQ C2 QAI. +28 318
>Amalan_Iyengar: CHIJORR O12 JO.H +66 243
#note I know that I may have already shot myself by fishing, now I just want to claw my way back into this by scoring a loot while holding good tiles. CIRR isn't greaet, but nothing comes even close to scoring this, so I'll take the points when I can
>Sam_Masling: EOTU 2A TO.UE +28 346
>Amalan_Iyengar: CDEINRR 1E DICER +27 270
#note I think this was my rack, or something like it. DEZINC is apparently a word, but this is second best
>Sam_Masling: MV 11C V.M +24 370
>Amalan_Iyengar: GGRY 10I GR..GY +21 291
#note I forgot to write down my rack for this turn and the next one, but it  was pretty bad.
>Sam_Masling: BDEILPR -BDEIL +0 370
>Amalan_Iyengar: GL F4 L.G +8 299
>Sam_Masling: IT 1A IT +14 384
>Amalan_Iyengar: EINPRST 15C PTERINS +86 385
#note I don't know what the blanks are, but apparently the bag is wrong here
>Sam_Masling: BEI 13B BI.E +30 414
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AADEEF D4 F.ED +26 411
#note I had about 15 minutes prior to this play, after it, I think I had 5 minutes. I retracked everything, and I thouht FEED was the best play. The blank is somewhere, but his rack is ALNRRTU, I think. If  I play FEED and not FETED or something, he can't hit the triple, and I don't think he can score much. FEAZE is first, and then FEASE< but that lets him hid the triple. 
>Sam_Masling: AL K4 LA +18 432
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AAE 13L AA +14 425
#note I didn't want to play EASE, because that opened the triple sER is after that, and then AA, According to quack, i have no chance of winning this game.
>Sam_Masling: NU 1N UN +8 440
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?E F13 sE. +19 444
#note I lost 3 points somewhere, probably with the blanks. His rack is TRR. He also went over by 10 seconds. Recorded score: 449-428

>Amalan_Iyengar:  (?RT) +4 448
