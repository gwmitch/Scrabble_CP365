#note SUIVEZ at M9 is the best move without a doubt. didn't know the word. VIZY scores well and still gives me a slight chance of a bonus on the floating S. I didn't mind scoring 15 odd the next turn if I had an average pick to dump some vowels. I didn't want her to feel comfortable with a 50+ lead so went for the score.
>Theresa: ?AEEKNO M2 kOKANEE. +74 169
#note a very good spot with two Ks
>Suresh: AEIMOOU 4H OOMIA. +26 86
#note OOMIAK better than OAKUM, better leave with EU.. did see VOEMA at K8 before she played the bingo, won't play it now, bad leave with EUIO

>Suresh: ?BLNOTW J11 BLOW +24 224
#note didn't know SNOWBELT.. obvious choice.. thought I'll open up a bit.. She could only block the opening with an N or S with the tiles remaining.. so happy to take a chance..
>Theresa: ADEH C3 DEA.H +26 325
>Suresh: ?NNORTU 15D NeUTRON +81 305
#note TURNONS is better.. but didn't know the word
>Theresa: AGM 5E MAG +30 355
>Suresh: ACDFORV D2 DOF +27 332
#note really frustrating pick up.. would have loved a Q or a J to come down D4 line for a neat 45+ score.. can't even scheme for a bonus with this rack. the best moves are VOAR or DOF. I even contemplated changing and hoping to bingo. Her lead isn't exaclty a bingo, if I am about 25 behind I could hope for a good score with the Q or the J and hope the she has bad racks and get stuck with the Q. 
>Theresa: GTU B2 GUT +18 373
>Suresh: ACILRTV 13I V.LTAIC +32 364
#note happy with this spot, better than CORIVAL at the same place. scores more and makes it less accesible for her to score on the triple lane. I didn't get too sidetracked with her JUDO setup at A3, I am behind and I can't afford to worry about it. 
>Theresa: DQU N11 QU.D +28 401
#note 

>Suresh: AAIJORS O8 ROJI +44 408
#note ROJI the better move than RAJ at A1, have fewer tiles to deal with and prevents her from scoring off the QI hook.
>Theresa: ACEEITT D6 .ECTITE +29 430
>Suresh: AARS 13C ASAR +18 426
#note simply class.. TECTITE what a word, won her the game.. I did see ASAR at B9, lose by 1. I liked TECTITE so much that I played my S on it, lost by 2.
