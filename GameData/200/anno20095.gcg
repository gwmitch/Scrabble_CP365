#note VIA is also an option. I liked opening the board way open for my blank and because I am playing Mike. Though I haven't played Mike before in a tournament, I know from online play that he likes closing the board down, and does much better on closed than open boards.

#note Wasn't sure whether to play some version of AMbERINA. This seemed fine enough -- the board's going to be very open no matter what.

#note I probably should've played BAA here. Maybe I didn't think of it? I have a decent lead and column N's openness doesn't matter for me bingoing too much right now, but it will likely be a pesky lane later in the game.

#note Wish I had not autopiloted this play. VEERY 14F is a worthy move to consider. If I can stave off a bingo for a couple turns VEERY should win me the game. Even if he bingos after VEERY it's an even game. I think I made the wrong choice here.

#note Also thought about blocking down the bottom ERt lanes with VIED. I didn't think seriously enough about what a column O comeback would do, which is open yet another lane for Mike. This doesn't accomplish enough closing at all. I should do VIE or VIED, probably VIED because 2 points is fine, the D isn't spectacular here, and the pool is good.

#note I instachallenged, and Mike forgot to put his tiles down, so I accidentally saw them on the way to the computer. Hence my marking his last rack. However, I played the game as if I didn't know these tiles.

>Noah: ?FGISUY G13 IF +13 321
#note This is an interesting choice. The thing is if I do something like FLUKY 4K or GUYS 12B I have a big lead with the blank so I still almost always win, so maybe I just go for spread here. I'm not sure.
>Mike_Baron: ACIP O1 PICA +34 276
>Noah: ?GNOSUY 12B GUYS +26 347
#note Like on this turn I just open another lane because his bingo isn't going to beat me pretty much ever. I could do TOWY but I think opening the other lane is actually a good thing for me. These reasons suggest that I probably should've just done GUYS last turn.
>Mike_Baron: DEEGR K1 GREED +22 298
>Noah: ?INOOOS 1K .OO +5 352
#note I'm legitimately worried about Mike getting a huge G bingo, so I do this. GOO keeps INOS? which is great to bingo with here while seeming to outrun other bingos he might get. However, him somehow getting two bingos could be a problem. I missed ISOGON, which avoids this problem perfectly and probably wins 100% of games.
