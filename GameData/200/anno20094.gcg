>Noah: DELNNOY A10 LE.ONY +33 96
#note Tough play. I thought about LEMONY, MONY, ONLY 12L. ANNOY, ANYON and DYNODE are also options. I still really like this though. It seems to keep the most comeback friendly board, and it scores and keeps a decent leave.
>Tom_Bond: ?AAAILR B4 mALARIA +68 289
>Noah: AADFIJN J11 .ADJ +31 127
#note Clearly a good setup to make. I need to make something happen this game. Even if I was just going for spread, I think this would still be the right play.

>Noah: AADFIMN A7 FA +26 153
#note Unfortunately didn't think of ANIMA here, which I definitely prefer, though I don't think I'm making it back into this game.

>Noah: ?BENPSU A1 UNBE +23 230
#note Spread is still worth going for here. I figured keeping as many lanes open for my blank was good, hence not UNBE M12.

#note Blech, missed USURPINg. Fortunately, this turned out better.
