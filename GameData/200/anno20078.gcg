>JD: ENRRRTT E5 RET.RN +12 12
#note pretty close sim, just about even with TORR or TORRENT in the same spot. in retrospect I think I might like TORR actually, because the appearance of an S setup could cause her to overreact and sacrifice points to block.
>Theresa_Brousson: AAI D10 AIA +8 38
#note she can play ACAI here
>JD: EEOORST F7 O.E +10 22
#note I thought OWE would be better defense than TOE or ROE because it blocks F6. instead, I give up more points per turn this way, probably because of cheap overlaps I allow on column G now (which is exactly what happened). on the other hand, AIA does suggest that she almost certainly had all 1-pointers last turn, which does decrease my chances of getting burned on column G.

#note a couple of really difficult options are available including EMYS at 13A and TOMBOY at C9. TOMBOY is particularly good since it creates an S- bingo lane on row 15.

#note nice blocking play

#note this at least gives me a 3/45 chance at OUTPRAYS, which still won't be enough to win though. maybe VOR at B1 and hope that she mistracks?
