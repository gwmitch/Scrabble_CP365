>Jim_Burlant: ABIORSZ 8D ZORIS +48 48
#note Nice start!  For reference, the next best play, BIZ 8G, wins 1-1/2% less often and sims only 3-1/2 points down despite the 20 points given up on the scoreboard and the major defensive liabilities of the play.  I'm surprised it's even that close.
>Chris_Cree: Q G7 Q. +21 21
>Jim_Burlant: AABORRS 9C BAR +21 69
#note The highest scoring play here is a word I didn't know: ARROBAS, which scores 36 as a non-bingo 2x2 at E5.  It's surprising to me that this actually sims better than that; Q indicates this is a very strong choice that needs a minor improvement:  I should play off the O with BOAR 9B. 
>Chris_Cree: ?ELOPSY 10E EmPLOYS +72 93
#note The best play here for Chris is utterly sick:  POLYPORES E3 scores 102!  His other option is PEYOTLS for 88 at 10D.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AINORS H1 NARcOSI. +82 151
#note A zillion bingoes available down the K column but none scores more than 78; this scores 82 and is best. 70% to win.
>Chris_Cree: CLOR E5 COL...R +36 129
>Jim_Burlant: AAENORT H10 .OANER +21 172
#note No 8's play, as this rack needs an open I, M, or U.  I considered fishing with something like OCA or BOA before opting to score because I didn't like the board position with any of the fishing plays.  The duck doesn't like this at all.  I can see why...sort of.  On the one hand, the R's are almost gone and the blanks are out, so turnover is not as essential.  That said, this doesn't open up much that isn't there, it takes out potential 6's at H10, and keeps my tempo going.  This is the only thing that scores even half decently.  Pick your poison. 
>Chris_Cree: JW I9 J.W +26 155
>Jim_Burlant: AAADETT C9 .ATED +16 188
#note The first two tiles out of the bag were AT, and had I fished, I'd have played for nothing and be sitting on AAENRTT with no open C (REACTANT), E (ANTEATER), I (ATTAINER/REATTAIN) and L (TARLETAN/ALTERANT).  Again, the duck says I should just fish.  Maybe BAAED instead, but I'd opt for 4 tiles turned and 16 points as opposed to a fish keeping duplicated T's...but that's just me.
>Chris_Cree: EGM D12 MEG +23 178
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGMTT 15A GETA +26 214
#note Against Chris, I have to be very sure about it to play it.  I saw METATAG in this rack but immediately questioned myself and thought I was making it up and didn't agonize over it by any stretch.  Too bad, as METATAGS plays at K3 for 72.  This is so-so.  Best if you chicken out or whiff on the bingo is B10 MAG for 30. 
>Chris_Cree: EW J10 .EW +15 193
>Jim_Burlant: ABKMOTV B12 MOV. +29 243
#note Best.  An interesting option I didn't know was TOMBAK, which plays to the S from K4 for 30.  Still in good shape at 71%, but not for long.
>Chris_Cree: CEINORU 1H .EURONIC +83 276
>Jim_Burlant: ABEKLTU 6H .UK +17 260
#note Glad I didn't try TUCKABLE* on row 4, as an after-the fact check of Zyzzyva reveals this rack makes no 8's.  The play is either this or 14F KUE.  I didn't like what this did to the board, but it was either this or block the E on row 14.  Given how the subsequent draw went, it wouldn't have mattered.
>Chris_Cree: HIVY 4H .HIVY +26 302
>Jim_Burlant: ABEELTT 3L BLET +19 279
#note He hit CHIVY just in time - he just blocked NETTABLE. As for this, this is the wrong execution of the right idea; less is more here, and I should play BET in the same location to open the easy hook and keep more of the rack together.  Nonetheless, this is getting bleaker by the turn.
>Chris_Cree: AFINU 3C UNFAI. +20 322
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIOTX O3 .AXITE +42 321
#note Too many points available to worry about trying to hold the rack together when the only play that keeps any semblance of balance is 2B AXE keeping a vowel overloaded AIOT.  This is best, and it's not quite 25% to win.  His next rack makes that 0.
>Chris_Cree: DEEGNSU N8 DENGUES +75 397
#note And that just about does it except for the final score.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIIIO N5 AA +17 338
>Chris_Cree: HPT 2G P.TH +36 433
#note Annotation stops here - final score 355 - 461.  The $64 question:  do my tiles still fizzle if I put down METATAGS?  Or is that the game changer and is it his tiles that fizzle?  I definitely should not have lost by 105 points.  But whether or not I would have won is pure conjecture.
