#note latest encounter with my mate and frequent victor Austin. would I finally be able to take a game off of him?! he was on a roll going in.
>JD: AACEGIR 9G CAA +26 26
#note my rack seemed like a good one to go second with (AGACERIE#/ACIERAGE#, CANAIGRE#, CARRIAGE and VICARAGE). austin had struck me as being strong in his bingo knowledge, so I prefered to play for a more closed board with CAA. ACAI# and GAE both sim slightly better.
>Austin_Shin: INRS K5 RINS +24 54
>JD: AEGIRTW 7I WI.G +27 53
#note I didn't know WINGE#. if I do, I could play WIN to keep the board more closed, following my plan. RINS likely shows another S anyway in which case I may be better off not offering the chance of WINGS.
>Austin_Shin: AIIPRST 5F AIRST.IP +60 114
#note austin actually missed PIARIST# here, which I wouldn't have known.
>JD: AEORTTV H1 VOTE. +27 80
#note austin blocked overtart without giving me rotavate# or rotovate#.
>Austin_Shin: IQ L4 Q. +22 136
>JD: AAEIRRT 1H .ERATRIA +86 166
#note nice fortunate draw
>Austin_Shin: EINNOY 4A YONNIE +28 164
>Austin_Shin: ?AEELRY (challenge) +5 169
#note I was unsure enough to challenge
>JD: BHKNOTU 3B BOUK +36 202
#note I missed UNHOOK for 10 more points, but UNHOOK gives back a lot of points on row 1 so this isn't such a bad play (2 points off on a sim)
>Austin_Shin: ?AEELRY 10H sEALERY +90 259
>JD: ?DEHLNT 2G H.NED +20 222
#note austin's last play was a bit of a crusher, but at least I picked up a blank. however I made a terrible play here for some reason. why not just play THIO/HI? I suppose I must have missed it.

#note bingoing one turn faster would really have helped - HONED killed my winning chances in retrospect. after my bingo here I'm always down a tempo and in need of more luck.
>Austin_Shin: EGI 7B GIE +17 347
>JD: AELMRTT 1A ALT +28 348
#note my last major error, have to cover this spot now. MAX even leaves me decent bingo chances for next turn (20%ish).
>Austin_Shin: ACI K10 .AIC +32 379
#note if I just play at this spot last turn, how will he ever score 32 points??
>JD: EJMORTW 8D WEM +24 372
#note hoping to draw a J play on column N, probably still won't be enough
>Austin_Shin: ADER M10 .EAD +23 402
>JD: BJLORTU N6 JOLT. +31 403
#note I can BLOC his fondues bingo (also by playing elutor) but I was trying to get him to chicken out of playing LAICS.

#note well played austin
