>Jennifer_Lee: AACENOT 8C OCTANE +22 22
#note Quackle wants me to exchange the duplicate A. Is ACENOT really so good? 

If I don't exchange, Quackle recommends OCA at 8G. What?! Why would I slot the vowels like that?

>Jennifer_Lee: ?AEFIOST --  -83 67
#note Sigh. I know FOLIATES from my cardbox, but I played FLOATIES without thinking that I would have known if it was good based on FOLIATES. You know, pool floaties. It should be a word.
>Zachary_Dang: AGM 2G G.AM +13 75
>Jennifer_Lee: ?AEIOST J2 .ISATOnE +61 128
#note Lots of options here, including ISO(L)ATE at 9E or K1, A(C)hIOTES at D7, E(C)TOpIAS at D7. I(C)EbOATS at D7 is fun. I picked the least preferred of the possible bingos.

>Jennifer_Lee: ADDEENO D8 .ODED +18 193
#note Didn't know A(C)NODE. EN(C)ODED is nice. Didn't know that NEON was a verb, (nE)ONED at L8.

#note I didn't know TRODE, TRONE or OREAD.
>Zachary_Dang: NORU 8J ..URON +18 189
#note Plus 50 for playing a neuro word against me.
>Jennifer_Lee: EEEERUY B13 EYE +25 238
#note I wanted to play EERY but had a memory crisis and thought it was phony. EYE sims very close to EERY.
>Zachary_Dang: KLLNO A10 KNOLL +20 209
>Jennifer_Lee: BDERRRU 13H B.RRED +18 256
#note Quaclke likes BRR at H13. I didn't know DURB(A)R or B(O)RDURE.

>Jennifer_Lee: AGINRTU 15I UNITAG. +9 310
#note I was ahead and trying to turn over tiles quickly to end the game shut down the last easy bingo lane I saw. Instead, Quackle wants me to dink off one or two tiles and keep row 15 open. Hmm. Maybe because the blank is still out and it thinks I will need to bingo back after Zach bingos?
>Zachary_Dang: ?IISSST 15A S.STI +55 314
#note SESTI* is phony. I didn't challenge because I saw that I could win if I went out. 
>Jennifer_Lee: BIR 14E BIR +11 321
>Jennifer_Lee: BIR --  -11 310
#note 3-letter word crisis here. I was so sure BIR* was good. This was heartbreaking. I don't mind losing a well played game, but I hate losing due to my own errors.
