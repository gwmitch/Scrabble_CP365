>Norman: ?EGORSS 10B GROSSEs +73 133
#note My play of GROSSEs at 10B was Quackle's last (15th choice). After I played it, I saw that I should have hooked the S to CREWING for 4 more points. But my play was not that bad.
>Michal: AEEIIRT G3 I.E +4 84
#note Michal's play of I(R)E at G3 was not the best play per Quackle. The best play was a bingo AE(G)IRITEat B8.

#note There were 15 bingos listed by Quackle and my play was not one of them. The top one was TENsIVE at E1 hooking to IRE.  It was funny that I saw INViTEE almost immediately but I never saw INViTED.

>Norman: DEMOOTU N9 OUTMODE +79 338
#note I was going to play MODE at A1 and then I saw OUTMODE at N9. Played it even though it set up a possible triple triple with the E at N15. I decided to take the small risk remembering what Matt Canick once told me.
>Michal: DEILUYZ O13 YID +38 236
#note YID at O13 was second best choice. Quackle preferred ZED at M13 for 54 points.
>Norman: BFHINOP 1A HOP +28 366
#note I was kind of concerned with the ED at the bottom and wanted to block it. ButI also saw HOP at 1A for 28 points.B(O)HO at D9 would score 41 points but I never saw it. So I went with HOP.
>Michal: ELNTUUZ 10K ZUL. +13 249
#note Good thing I played HOP necasue Michal could have scored big with ZULU at A1. He ended up playing ZUL(U) at K10. LUZE(R)N at 8A for 48 points wsa Quackle's top spot.

#note BOAT at 11J was a better choice.
