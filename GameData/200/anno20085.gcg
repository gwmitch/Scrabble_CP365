#note She had other double-doubles that played that ARE valid, but I held and released. 

She originally played a word to the S in TELSONS, and when she picked it up and moved it, I got excited that she didn't block BAKERIE(S), and played it quickly...thus...
>Joey_Krafchick: ABEEIKR K3 BAKERIE. +78 155
#note I missed BI(D)ARKEE for 12 more! Playing too fast bites me yet again...

#note Should I just play AA? I think the 5 points might be worth it.

#note I lost some equity, but I still like my play. It takes that hotspot, and I'm saving the X. 3C F(O)X wins by a good margin, but another play that is ahead of mine that I didn't see was F(ED)EX. 6000 iterations (-7)
