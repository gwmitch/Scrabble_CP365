>Jennifer: AEIOPTT E8 .PIATE +16 16
#note I missed PATO(O)TIE at E4.
>Zach: IV 13C VI. +12 38
>Jennifer: AEEMNOT F6 MO.E +16 32
#note Augh, and here I missed NEMATO(D)E. Not a good start for me. Also, TEN(FOLDS)!
>Zach: EINOSTT H8 .TONIEST +77 115
>Jennifer: AAEMNTU E4 AMU +14 46
#note Good grief! And here I missed MANTEAU at 5E or 5A. With three missed bingos in my first three turns, I deserved to lose this one.

#note Quackle prefes R(E)GLAZE at 13G.
>Zach: EOO A1 O.OE +21 192
>Jennifer: ABCGKLR 15A BAK.R +33 198
#note Quackle slightly prefers BAG(E)L in the same place, leaving CKR over CGL. It is a better leave, though I'm not sure I'm willing to sacrifice 9 points for it.
>Zach: OX 3F OX +36 228
>Jennifer: ACEGILP C2 .APE +26 224
#note P(E)LAGIC at 13G is cool, and is Quackle's top play. Quackle hates my play.
>Zach: ENNUY 13H .NNUYE +20 248
#note I held for a while and almost challenged. I did not know you could spell the word this way.
>Jennifer: CDGHILU G10 DUH +17 241
#note DUCH(Y) at L9 is the top play. Too bad I had not played Dominion recently enough to remember this word.
>Zach: ENRRTUV M7 VENTUR.R +66 314
#note (O)VERTURN at J1 also possible. I held VENTUR(E)R for a while.
>Jennifer: ACGIILN J1 .I +4 245
#note I missed INLACI(N)G at J7. This was a poorly considered desperation play. I was trying to create a lane to hook my L and bingo ... this was just a weird way to open the board. If I was going to do something weird like this, (T)I at 9K would have been better. I was trying not to mess with the south end of the board so I could keep play-throughs open through the N and U.
>Zach: EGGI 11J GIG.E +14 328
#note This blocks the N and U playthroughs nicely, but also opens the 3WS when there is 1 S and 2 blanks out. I'm not sure I would do this for that reason. I need to bingo to win, and Zach has given me a high scoring lane to hook my bingo on an otherwise not great board for bingoing.
>Jennifer: ACGILLN 8K CL.AN +24 269
#note CLANG(G)I(N)G at J7 is preferred.
>Zach: EFQ K10 F.Q.E +17 345
>Jennifer: CGILOSW O2 SCOWLI.G +65 334
#note In hindsight, if I was going to play through the E at 8M, it would have been nice if I threw the G ont 8O so I could bingo to the G from O1.
>Zach: ??HJRTW O11 sHReW +46 391
#note Zach could also have done (Q)uR)sH at 12K for 51 points, which is pretty cool.
>Jennifer: AE N5 AE +13 347
>Jennifer:  (JT) +18 365
