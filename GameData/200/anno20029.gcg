>Carl: AHLNTUU N1 HULA +29 298
#note Lots to think about here. HAUNT 10J was my first instinct, but the NTU leave after HULA seemed better. (Wrong! NTU is only negligibly better than LU.) I also liked that HULA seemed to allow more blocking options in the bottom right quadrant. (Wrong again! There are already easy ways to block.) I should have played HAUNT. (-5)

#note Quite a game we've got here. Five bingos and some other big plays besides.

>Carl: EEIINPT 4H PIE +21 349
#note Running out of ammo. 2-ply, PIE sims neck-and-neck with PETIT 12F, but given what happened next, I think PETIT is better long-term. I didn't see PETIT.
>Opp: GGV F10 V.GG +17 338
#note Scary! Look what he can do with the right letter.
>Carl: CEIJNRT 15F IN........ +10 359
#note Quackle hates this play, but the sim isn't inferring anything from the opponent's last turn. My opponent could easily be setting up SOY 14D. I also don't like that all my reasonable options leave row 14 open for multiple turns. If he doesn't already have it, he's doubtlessly *closer to it*, and I'll still have to worry about it next turn.  It's difficult to quantify, but I don't know where my play stands next to sim winner JIN 10B. I really don't like JIN because if he doesn't have SOY then he's more likely to have the D and vice versa. Suggestions?
>Opp: AX I11 .AX +37 375
>Carl: CEJRTVW J2 JE.. +28 387
#note Things aren't looking so good anymore. Those Ss are still out there, and I've drawn VW to go with my consonants. Figure I'll score and set up the V. A hidden play wins the sim; I'll find it next turn. (-3?)
>Opp: FINOPSY 3I Y.P +23 398
#note His actual rack. Blocking VUGGY paid off-- this time.
>Carl: CELRTVW 9K TEW +30 417
#note I love stuff like that!
>Opp: FINOOOS K1 FO. +17 415
>Carl: ACLORSV 14B VAS +28 445
#note Dumb. I know his rack, so I should have seen that he has no plays through the V. I didn't bother to look.

#note A few months ago, the best play would be LAC (else I'm stuck with the C), but now CLIT is acceptable.
