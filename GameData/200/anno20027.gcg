>Michael_Wolfberg: EGV F9 VEG +20 61
#note defense at last!!!
>Joshua_Sokol: AENRSTU J5 UTE +19 96
#note but that won't stop me- oh wait I just completely blanked here and saw NATURES thinking it was the only solution to AENRSTU and failed to look any further... It's been a while since I missed something so high probability! I miss the good old days...

#note I didn't know DELFT took the S here!
>Michael_Wolfberg: ACM E10 MAC +25 121
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIKTVZ 12G ZAIK.I +40 202
#note It's really nothing short from insane that I played ZAIKAI 3 (!!!) times in a 14-game tournament. I don't know if I considered KIVA 13E, but that looks both crazy and awesome at the same time. But I had to go with ZAIKAI! Always play ZAIKAI! But which placement is better? I'll leave that up for debate.

#note in the absence of palatable options, go for the fancy. 3L NEG looks fine, but I liked my flexibility after this.
>Michael_Wolfberg: DO 13G O.D +25 242
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEFNSU 3L FEU +23 256
#note cool, no more hooks available for this but my own. Though the X is problematic.
>Michael_Wolfberg: AQ I10 QA.. +14 256
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINOSY N10 YO +28 284
#note 12A YONI(C) is a fine option too, hmm. Also, YE over this for sure now that I see the numbers. I had no idea how much better EINOS was than EEINS. a 10% increase in bingo chances with EINOS. Wow. Large mistake.
