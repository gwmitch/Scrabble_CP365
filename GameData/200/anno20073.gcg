#note john and I seem to meet at all of these international events
>Olaugh: AEF 7J FAE +25 25
>Jesse_Day: AEFMPTV 6L VAMP +30 78
#note for some reason I remember VAMP as being difficult to find. it gives up a lot of free points compared to EXEMPT, but I'm still a bit surprised that EXEMPT sims better given its dreadful leave of FAV.

#note this seemed like a nice opportunity to make the board shape very defensive, especially with john fishing last turn.

#note or exchange 7. I thought about OUZO at C8 but it probably just gives him free points.

#note looks like an opening play, but he can play on row 11 and close again right away.
>Jesse_Day: ?ADNOOU C8 OU.O +17 202
#note I can score more by playing NOYAU right now, but it seemed more useful to create this new lane at B8.
