#note if I remember correctly she put a play on the board, picked it up and then exchanged 7. I think both of us were pretty laid back at this point in the event.
>JD: AEHJNOS I5 JEON +24 46
#note I can think of no reason why I would play this instead of JOHN, and would promptly be punished for my idiocy

>JD: AEEHNST H7 H.E +12 58
#note I did correctly evaluate that I would bingo a lot more with a new lane, but I can't possibly leave the hotspot at 5K unblocked - JANE is the move.

#note ridiculously stupid? greedy? clever? I saw the possibility of drawing ADZ for 57 after my setup. but I should play BONGO, and actually quackle prefers DZO at B12 (better defense) after I discarded the one at B13 because of the huge comebacks.

>JD: AABDRSZ O1 BAZAR +59 312
#note I am supposedly about 88% to win now
>Joanne_Craig: EFO M1 FOE +18 266
>JD: ADDESTT 15D SATED +31 343
#note looks dreadful but sims quite well. favorite is STEDD# which makes it harder for her to use 14F (but does open that spot as opposed to SATED) and lowers her bingo percentage. close on win percentage. STEDD# would've ended quite poorly in this world.
>Joanne_Craig: ?AEEHIR 14G HEApIER +67 333
>JD: DMOPRTT M7 POM +21 364
#note it seemed like I would win as long as she didn't draw FE or F?. but quackle puts me at about 50%. I should play POT and save the useful M.
>Joanne_Craig: DEFU 15L FEUD +47 380
#note emptying the bag, but I drew UV?...
>JD: ?DRTTUV 12B R.. +3 367
#note I was under some time pressure. best sequence that can be found is if I play RIN at 12B, in which case I put real pressure on joanne by threatening DUVET unblockable, even though she can still win just by playing LOOK and FAB/ORA.
