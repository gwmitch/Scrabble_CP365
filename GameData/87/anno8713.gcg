#note Scored as 60.

#note Ooh, didn't see BIZARROS. Slightly stronger, maybe.

#note 14G KADI wins the sim here. I actually really wanted to keep IG for an ING play down column A.

#note Ugh. Agonized over this and EXODO(I) and (O)XO. Totally missed DOUX.

#note I spun this rack around and showed it to everyone at the table. We all had a good laugh as I started plunking tiles facedown. Adam muttered "good thing I left 6 in the bag". "Uh... what? CRAP."
>Logan: Q D8 Q. +21 316
>Tunnicliffe: EEEEEGI 2H .E. +17 345
#note I'm surprised N10 GEE sims so much better. I thought emptying the bag would be suicide here. But really it makes sense. I need to speed this game up to give Adam as few turns to catch up as possible.
>Logan: CDH 1F CH.D +21 337
>Tunnicliffe: EEEEGIR 15E EER.E +5 350
#note Had a good 2-3 minutes left. I saw my win. GIE threatening RESEE and EERIE. Golden. But wait, let's check to see if he had an out first. OMG SURFIER I need to block that. Oh crap, 1 minute left. Sigh... No, dumbass, play GIE. SURFIER is an out, but it's not enough. Take 5 seconds to do the freaking math. FRIGGGGG. I play EERIE with 28 seconds left, panicking.
>Logan: EFRRSU O12 FRE. +11 348
#note Adam was low on time, too. I guess he missed the big 14C SERF.
>Tunnicliffe: EGI C2 GE.. +10 360
#note I still have 28 seconds. And I can win this game. I saw OURS and just assumed I was missing something else. I scoured the board for Adams big out play, assuming he MUST have something scary somewhere and I need to block it. With 10 seconds left, I slapped down one of the two equal-scoring plays I saw (LIPE was the other one). With 6 seconds, I realised I was giving him RUG. 6 seconds is plenty of time to move my tiles to LIPE. But my finger was already pressing the button......
>Logan: RSU 2A RU.S +10 358
#note I got lazy in the recount and only recounted my plays. So the extra point for ANNOTATE meant the score went down as 361-360. I stink!!
>Logan:  (I) +2 360
