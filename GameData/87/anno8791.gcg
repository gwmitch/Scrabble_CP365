#note George got collin's confused, he says.  Or maybe it was on being table 1 - I don't blame him.

#note Should take the pts here with OPAQUED.  I got too paranoid.  If anything, good leave means less chance of a high pt tile counter on H

#note I figure if he plays on 11 (likely) I might get a huge J play.  Else, I can cash the J on a x3 next turn.  This is still 2nd behind JEE(Z), because I hold Os.  But, gotta be a little risky sometimes, I learn.

#note George is low on time here - less than a minute.  he's also frantically trying to retrack tiles.  Sim says nothing wins here, but I'm hoping for two really big scores and hope he makes a mistake.
>George_MacAulay: GPT 14G ..G +6 412
#note George mistracks, thinking I have a D, and is low on time, so blocks the hotspot.
>E_Tran: ORRST 14A ROTS +37 423
#note Sim says TORRS ties the game.  Instead, I hope he errs again and go for the win.
>George_MacAulay: PT 15F P.. +8 420
#note George has a kinda tricky winning outplay that he misses here.  Tough to find under time pressure
>E_Tran: R 10E R.. +14 437
#note And I steal my first game at table 1.  Not often one wins being outbingoed 3-1 without huge JXQZ plays.
