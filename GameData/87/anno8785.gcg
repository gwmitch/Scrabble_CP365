>Chris_Cree: BDNOU 8D BOUND +22 22
>Jim_Burlant: DEMRTUW E7 M.WED +22 22
#note This is second best; couldn't think of (O)UTDREW E8, which wins the sim.  This sims roughly 2 points down.
>Chris_Cree: BFO F10 FOB +32 54
>Jim_Burlant: ?AACRTU H1 ARCUATe. +83 105
#note Best bingo.  Of note:  C8 ACTUARy, C8 AUTARCh.
>Chris_Cree: AGHN C7 HANG +22 76
>Jim_Burlant: AEIINSW 6F WI. +14 119
#note A deceptive rack - it sure seemed like there should have been some good scoring in it, but there really wasn't.  The highest scoring play available is 6B AWE 20, and the IINS leave makes that an iffy choice.  I considered WITAN for 4 more, but felt that it wasn't worth the 4 extra points to break up this promising rack.  Q agrees with me - this is best.
>Chris_Cree: EOORRST B1 ROOTERS +73 149
#note Chris's best bingo is 13C ROOSTER 77.  Chris is winning 55% with this, but not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRST 5E RAT.NIES +89 208
#note Obviously any number of easy bingos here.  The only trick to this position is that it could have been very easy to slap down ANESTRI or ANTSIER for 80 down the A column instead of finding my best play.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Chris_Cree: GIP 1A G.IP +30 179
>Jim_Burlant: DIIILUV 2F VI.ID +21 229
#note Best - outside of this, G11 LIVID or 3H CIVIL, not much else to do with this rack besides exchange.
>Chris_Cree: AELX A7 AXLE +39 218
>Jim_Burlant: EEEILPU D1 .ULE +12 241
#note Weak.  Looking at the kibbitzer options, I saw PULES L1 and didn't like it (I thought it too likely to give back at least 30 while I was stuck with an iffy EEI leave), I didn't like creating a line for an easy 7 with PEISE L2, ETUI 4A gave up too many points to the other options, and I flat-out missed UTILE 4A, which looks like the best of a very weak lot.  The 2-ply sim agrees with my analysis - UTILE is best.  
>Chris_Cree: AGO D11 AGO +12 230
>Jim_Burlant: EEIJNOP L1 JEEP. +44 285
#note The classic dilemma:  play the board?  Or play my rack?   From the standpoint of my rack, JOE C13 would be best as it scores 38 and leaves a very promising EINP.  But given the pool and Chris's last play, I thought he might be closing in on something and I didn't want to slot the triple line with all those bingo prone tiles still at large.  Q agrees - this is best, and I'm winning 71%.
>Chris_Cree: ?ACIILN B9 INCIsAL +79 309
#note It was obvious from the time Chris took on this position that he recognized just how complex it really was.  He told me post-mortem that he was debating whether to put down the bingo or play (J)AIL to take away my easy comebacks.  He felt the extra 46 points were too much to pass up, so he put this down.  Championship Player says his best play is fINICAL 14B, with JAIL trailing it by 2 points.   CP says INCIsAL  is a 4-1/2 point dog to  JAIL. According to CP fINICAL wins 56%, JAIL 53.3, and this play 49.9.  Whether or not you agree with Quackle  his leaving the J alone paved the way for me to win this game.
>Jim_Burlant: AIINOTT 1L .OIN +33 318
#note Since he didn't hang a C, S, R, or H, it's obvious that a 1L play is the ticket - but which one?  I opted for this as I wanted to unload one of my I's and AITT seemed like the least offensive of the possible leaves.  Championship Player agrees - either this or JOTA are the choices and they win 35%.  I chose this as I preferred to unload one of my I's.  
>Chris_Cree: AHLNQST -AHLNQ +0 309
>Jim_Burlant: AEINSTT I8 SATINET +69 387
#note This is embarrassing - talk about hitting Chris with small-arms fire!  I couldn't decide whether this or the 13F was more reckless, and I thought this was less volatile if he had something like ZOOKS.  Since he passed 5, I figured he kept SZ and threw something like FQVKY back into the bag.  Against an inferred SZ, the 13F placement sims roughly 2 points ahead of this and wins 89% to this play's 87.
>Chris_Cree: DOY 15A O.DY +36 345
>Jim_Burlant: AEFKMQY H13 YAK +37 424
#note FLAKY for 60 would have been nice, but oh well.  This is best.
>Chris_Cree: ELU 4L .ULE +7 352
>Jim_Burlant: EFHMQST 11H F.T +6 430
#note Having never beaten Chris before, I was giddy that I couldn't lose, and I therefore didn't bother to think the end game through.  Blocking his best play of REZERO with something like HEFT or METH would have been a decent idea.  Or. forgoing that, FEST J11 followed by a Q dump somewhere.   Nothing like needlessly punting 16 points of spread, eh?
>Chris_Cree: EEORRVZ O3 R.ZERO +45 397
