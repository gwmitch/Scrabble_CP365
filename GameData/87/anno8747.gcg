#note sweeeeet
>Mike_Lean: ADEHMNN 9H HAND +22 22
#note best imo.. i wanted to keep the N for a bingo making novation so he could challenge, and i like the EMN leave

#note purty find
>Mike_Lean: DEMNRRR -  +0 22
#note and then i found a way to pick up 3 Rs in 4 tiles.  down 167 with this junk rack, i see MODERN K7 and something crappy making NOvATIONS, all of which still leave me with 2 Rs.  i'm thinking it's either challenge this or lose, so i challenge even though i think it's good
>John_Stinson: AA L3 AA +19 208
#note anddd i'm now down 186.
>Mike_Lean: DEMNRRR E8 NERD +18 40
#note i cave and burn the hook.. i know this is awful and play it anyway.  missed DERM K1

>Mike_Lean: IMMRRTY 12B MIRY +27 67
#note didn't want to play RIMY and let him luck-hook a G in front.  i saw IMMY 11I but really just didn't want to hold on to 2 Rs.  I think it would have been a better move for keeping the board open though.

#note i saw MELTY for 36 but this a necessary phoney because i'm down by so much.  i need every point i can get and he most likely won't challenge.  i didn't know termly

#note no clue
>Mike_Lean: CEIRSST 9B CIT.S +20 186
#note huge decision here (unfortunately whiffed ERISTICS 6A).  quackle really wants me to keep CEIRST, and i was thinking this too, but couldn't justify just throwing an  S on JAW.  it was between this and RITES for me.. i think RITES would have been good to open up another bingo lane, but i saw a lot of mid-point tiles in the bag and wanted to keep the R so i wouldn't have CG or something bad, or worse pick up the 2nd C.
>John_Stinson: EGIN 5D GI.EN +18 308
>Mike_Lean: CDEIRSV 13F SCRIVED +73 259
#note picked up the 2nd C and the V, so it turned out to be a good decision to play off the C.  bingo time.  not 100% sure about this, but he's up by too much to challenge still

>John_Stinson: EFT H12 F.ET +33 341
>Mike_Lean: AEEILSU H4 U. +3 262
#note i see there is a Q in the bag, and i know if i dump an E and pick up a Q, i can hit TEQUILAS for 104.  so my decision is between EN and UN. i think "don't be stupid mike, picking up the Q is a 1/20 chance, just play off the U because there's still 2 left after this."  
>John_Stinson: BO D3 BO. +12 353
>Mike_Lean: AEEILQS 3D .E +4 266
#note FML I GOT THE Q.  now i'm like screw it, i'm fishing for tequilas, 1/17 chance.  i may as well dump the E, fish for the one of 2 Us in the bag (2/17 chance), and open up another bingo lane in the process
