#note If I see TU(R)F I would play it.  Sims slightly better.  Here I try not to be too paranoid about the X.  Unlikely he kept it; so, there's a 5/91 chance he has it.
>Joel_Wapnick: EITX 6E EXIT +64 96
#note Of course he has it.

#note Ick.  Overthought this play.  Didn't want to regret missing it at Table 1 (yes, that did run through my mind).  So I boneheadedly play this phoney.  In situations like this, I think I need to be smarter and lay the tiles down and try to draw a reaction.  I know, eg, that Cree scrunches up his face when I play stupid phoneys on him.

#note I held this for a long time, but wisely didn't challenge for former (and future) champ
>E_Tran: EEIJMOR N6 JE. +26 265
#note Champ likes M2 JOE.  shrug.
>Joel_Wapnick: EH 9M HE +29 306
#note Yeah, I was a little worried about that setup spot.

#note I want to keep DEMY for next turn, while blocking the x3 lane given the juicy pool.  But, OBA and OBIA also do the job really well.

>E_Tran: ABDEEGO 15A DE.. +35 357
#note Ugh.  Best is BODEGA, and to hope for a miracle.  IF I want to save the B for next turn, GAMY is waaaaaaay better.  I'm hoping he makes a small blocking play at A, and I can get two big scores to catch up and win.
