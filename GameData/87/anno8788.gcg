#note Hmmm.  No standouts, though if I was going to dump the rack, VECTOR would have been a better choice.  I didn't see it, and everything sims within 3 or 4 points of the top choice.  Of note:  Q says I shouldn't have dumped the R.  My thinking at the time was that, with the E likely to be taken out, I wasn't going to get very far keeping 4 consonants and I'd be better off turning the extra tile.
>Paul_Holser: ?EIORTU 7G OUTfIRE +69 89
#note Best bingos for Paul are either MIsROUTE or MOIsTURE H8.
>Jim_Burlant: AAIMNPT 8M MAP +25 44
#note Q points out a really cool play I would never have found:   TIMPAN(UM) H1, which wins 33%.  This is the next best choice, though it obviously gives up a bunch and only wins 25%.
>Paul_Holser: EGLNOPT 6E PONG +21 110
#note Paul told me his rack post-mortem, and this play drastically altered the progression of the game.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEINOT E5 O.E +10 54
#note There are higher scoring plays available (most notably 5E ONE), but with that open R on row 12, I was looking at a probable RETINA 8 with any number of draws, and I wanted to make sure things stayed open.  Q agrees, and says this is best.  I wrote this off as a negative equity position, playing for 10, expecting to give back 30.  I didn't expect his next comeback, that's for sure.
>Paul_Holser: AEILNRT 4D TRENAIL +72 182
#note Paul's best bingo is INTERLAP, and 11D TREENAIL is a close runnerup.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGINRT 13B GNAT.IER +72 126
#note Chose this for the hyper-volitaile board position.  13B TREATING (Quackle's choice) wins 15%; this wins 13.
>Paul_Holser: ADHK H11 KH.DA +51 233
>Jim_Burlant: ?FINSTT B7 FiTTIN.S +76 202
#note B7 TUFTINGS is a slightly better bingo, but apparently, 12D FIRTH was my best play. Sim says FIRTH wins roughly 23%, and this wins 16, simming roughly 12 pointsw down to FIRTH. Given his next rack, however, nothing would have mattered.
>Paul_Holser: AEEJQUZ A8 QUA +70 303
#note Paul told me post-mortem that this was his rack.  Even if I didn't give him the 70-point comeback, I qould have been very hard-pressed to come back given that he was sitting on all the goodies.
>Jim_Burlant: EELRSUY 11E Y.U. +22 224
#note Best, nothing else worth consideration.  I'm winning 9%.
>Paul_Holser: EJO 3B JOE +22 325
>Jim_Burlant: EEEILRS O4 SLEE.IER +61 285
#note Best play, but it's not like I've got much in the way of winning chances - I'm winning 10%.
>Paul_Holser: EHNOS N10 HONES +47 372
#note And the hits just keep coming.  Hardly surprised by this - when he put down QUA I realized that this just wasn't my game.
>Jim_Burlant: BDELOOS 12B .OB +20 305
#note The all-too-familiar refrain:  you have to know the bingo to play it.  2D BOODLES (p > 10600) scores 69 and wins 15%.  This choice wins 4.
>Paul_Holser: FIZ O13 FIZ +52 424
>Jim_Burlant: DDEELOS M12 ED +22 327
>Paul_Holser: ABDU L9 DAUB +24 448
>Jim_Burlant: ACDELOS 2D SOLACED +69 396
#note Apparently the bingo is not the best play - 14B SODAS ostensibly wins 5% to this play's 1%.  How?  If he falls asleep for 15 minutes?
>Paul_Holser: AGIINRV 1I RAVING +16 464
>Jim_Burlant: AILWXY K10 AX +38 434
#note Saw WAXILY but chickened out on it.  When I saw that everything was within 3 points of each other, I just wanted to maximize my score.
>Paul_Holser: I G2 .I. +4 468
>Paul_Holser:  (ILWY) +20 488
