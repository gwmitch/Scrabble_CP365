>Evans_Clinchy: AEELLOP D12 OLE +16 38
#note The sim likes this, OLEA in the same spot, and LEAP/PLEA hooking AGENTRY all roughly the same. This is the aggressive option. He's gonna score a ton next turn, but I'm more likely to bingo first.

>John_Karris: ADIRW 11J WI.ARD +38 123
>Evans_Clinchy: CEFILMP N10 C.IMP +34 200
#note Playing some defense for a change. Sim thinks it's close between this, FILMED O6 and CAMPI M10. I didn't see CAMPI, but no matter. I think CRIMP is right at this score.
>John_Karris: ARX 6D RAX +37 160
>Evans_Clinchy: EEFHLNO 9G FEH +28 228
#note Sims best. FEOD C12 is another option, but this is better defensively and works better with a very bingo-prone tile pool.
>John_Karris: VV C7 V.V +17 177
>Evans_Clinchy: BEEILNO D1 BOILE. +22 250
#note This is great statically, but the sim slightly prefers OLEINE 5F. My play is a little too wide open.
>John_Karris: ?DINRUU 1B UN.URIeD +80 257
#note Sure enough, he doesn't bingo if I play OLEINE.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEGINSS 14B ........S +17 293
#note At the time I thought this was a no-brainer, but it's actually a potentially fatal mistake. There are two A's, five E's and two I's in the pool. If I draw any of those vowels, I'm almost certainly not bingoing. AEGINS looks like a decent stem at first glance, but I've got to get better at the whole "don't just blindly fish, think about what specifically you're fishing for" thing. Sim recommends fishing off an A, either at F5 or D9. Can't argue with that. SEEINGS or SEISING next turn would be nice.
