#note She told me her first rack, I think this was it. I know she didn't throw back the K, which I surely would have done.

#note I was about 90% this wasn't good but I'm nowhere near where I should be on 8s right now. I had a 62 point X play, so I let it go. mistake.

#note can't decide if dumping the Q or taking this spot is more important, but every other time I play Becky she hits spots like these for 40 regularly. I decide to make her find her points instead.

#note with 2 Us, she doesn't have a bingo on that rack, and this sets up (WE)EL as an out.

#note Well after the game she looked it up and said she didn't have any playable bingoes, but apparently mODULUS is good and played at 14F. I guess I dodged a bullet, but neither of us knew that word.
