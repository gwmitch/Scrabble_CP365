>Matt_Canik: CDEOOSU 9G CODE. +26 56
#note Not a good play. CODON 7G. The duck prefers DOU(C)E 4H which I saw but didn't like.

#note Going for turnover here. If I didn't suck i would have played ANYTHING else. Probably reformat though.

#note And now I'm just flustered. FUCK.

>Geoff_Thevenot: ?AIIMRT 12D .cIMITAR +60 244
#note We discussed why he didn't make this (S)IMITARs after the game, he said he thought there was only one unseen S and he wasn't afraid to play that because me pluralizing would just shut down the board more.

>Geoff_Thevenot: AW 7B AW. +30 274
>Matt_Canik: ?AHLRST 9C H.R +21 211
#note My thinking here is this: on a closed board, he won't run away from me, and I'm holding the last S and the last blanks, so i'll set myself up an unblockable  lane one turn or hit a bingo along the 2 row and be caught up. Ad for now, I'll just score while I can.

>Matt_Canik: ?IOORST 2C RISOTtO +63 298
#note Chose this over TORSIOn because this enables us to trade off TWS squares, whereas TORSION make it easier to block both and score 40 on his turn. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEHLU 1D HULA +26 321
#note He set down HUE 1F, then picked it up and played this. Not sure why LEHUA didn't come down for 42. 
>Matt_Canik: DEEGLUX B10 .UDGE +28 326
#note Interesting rack here, but with no Ds, no esses, and one R unseen, I don't think this will hurt me bad, and I want to hold onto the X to hit VEX or ILEX the next turn. Duck sims this best.

#note Dumb luck. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AGIIRUV 4A VIG +19 360
>Matt_Canik: IIOR 15H OI +15 409
#note Game was over, but OR/JUDGER/TO scored 13 more. I just wanted an out, I guess.
