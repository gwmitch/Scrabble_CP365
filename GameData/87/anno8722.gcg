#note I was afraid to play DIF here in case he had an E for VETO/ADO. Missed F(E)TID entirely.
>Danny_Panganiban: DS 4I D..S +14 26
#note Looks like Danny has esses to spare...
>Matthew_Larocque: FIKQSTT H7 Q. +11 102
#note Which should have told me exchanging the Q here might be better, he is likely going to use another S to rack up some points with it.
>Danny_Panganiban: EIJSV 9D JIVES +32 58
>Matthew_Larocque: AFIKSTT E8 F.AT +14 116
#note Yikes, I was really stuck here. This actually does best in the sim shockingly, I thought it was a garbage play because I couldn't find anything.
>Danny_Panganiban: AAV D11 AVA +14 72
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BIKSTU 13C K.B +18 134
#note Need to brush up on my entomology? That and 5 letter words - B(A)TIK for 32.
>Danny_Panganiban: GN 11B GN.. +5 77
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IISTUU -IIUU +0 134
#note Pretty close in the sim here - keeping an I does a bit better though.
>Danny_Panganiban: OP 3L OP +10 87
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFLSTZ N2 FEZ +35 169
#note Wow enormous fail 107 point bingo here. I didn't know about SPELTZ either, hm. This sims ok but missing 107 points is never ok. Argh!
>Danny_Panganiban: EGIILRT 2D RETILI.G +61 148
#note Danny closes the gap, but with my blank I should be ok.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CELPST 1G PET +27 196
>Danny_Panganiban: ADELY 1A DELAY +38 186
#note Danny announced 44 here, 6 points higher than actual. I normally count all my opponents plays because this happens a lot - I once had an opponent overscore a play by 17!!! points, but the game got recounted and she lost because of it.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CLOSTW 3E WOT +24 220
>Danny_Panganiban: EH 2A EH +23 209
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACLNRS 4A CLANS +30 250
#note A beam supporting a ships' deck. My play sims incredibly bad. CAN/FA/OPEN claims victory 90% of the time. I'm not sure why I missed that.
>Danny_Panganiban: UUUY -UUUY +0 209
#note Danny gives me a chance to put the game away.....
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EHILRU L6 HURLIEs +77 327
#note 3 bingos, this one fares the worst, but it's all very miniscule - as long as I play A bingo I don't think I can lose.
>Danny_Panganiban: OW K11 WO +21 230
#note Danny announces 20 incorrectly..
>Matthew_Larocque: NOORTUU A4 .ONTOUR +27 354
#note or (C)ROUTON, (C)ORNUTO (didn't know).
>Danny_Panganiban: EOU 8L .OUE +12 242
>Matthew_Larocque: EIMORUY N6 YO.R +15 369
#note My time was low - but figured I needed to muck up this spot with a blank still at large. I think I can somewhat disregard rack balance because Danny has often pulled bingos on me at the last minute so I'm not letting that happen again.
>Danny_Panganiban: ACN O1 CAN +26 268
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIMRU B6 AIM +17 386
#note Places about 4th - AUREI 14E places at the top, but that seems like an awful gamble. He'll most likely slam me with 50+ using the X.
>Danny_Panganiban: IX 14B XI +24 292
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIRU 14E AUREI +11 397
#note Ultra fail, it's a good thing I was leading by 100 points. I could have safely let my clock go overtime and made the better play here.
