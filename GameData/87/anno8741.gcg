>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEGHO H4 HEDGE +28 28
>Emil_Rem: AAEERT 9F AERATE +19 19
>Matthew_Larocque: ALMOOOT 10B MOOLA +19 47
#note Well, I didn't play this for 28 apparently. It's like I saw every spot expect the most obvious, high scoring one.
>Emil_Rem: AHILT 7E ALI.HT +15 34
>Matthew_Larocque: DENOTWY 8A DOWNY +44 91
#note Uh, yeah, WYTED scores 9 more. Luckily Emil seems to be dumping all his letters and not really scoring anything.
>Emil_Rem: AEOTU J2 OUTEA. +10 44
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIOTTY K3 TITI +18 109
#note Whoa, (M)OIETY. I didn't really like TITI but it actually sims pretty high. Missed (H)O(T)TIE.
>Emil_Rem: ARUZ 5D AZUR. +28 72
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEOPSY 8K PAYEE +37 146
>Emil_Rem: AARU 4A AURA +14 86
>Matthew_Larocque: ?FINOSW 7M OWN +20 166
#note OMG. I was going to slap bOWFINS down if I could just find a place for it! How the hell did I not see the spot. Usually I suck at finding bingos, but I'm ok at finding parallel plays. :/
>Emil_Rem: CENO 10K CONE +15 101
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFIORS 11I IFS +28 194
#note Well, still have nice letters, but I need some space to place now because I failed last turn. It's really close between this and FRISE, but I don't even know FRISE and keeping the E is probably better.
>Emil_Rem: JST 3I J..TS +40 141
>Emil_Rem: JST --  -40 101
#note Nope
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EMNORR A1 NOM. +18 212
#note There's no reason to play this over MOR(A), I just like to randomly forget 4 letter words. I correctly identified ROMA as bad, but couldn't simply switch the R and M. 
>Emil_Rem: EJS 3I J..ES +40 141
#note He must have been really sure about JUTTS to play that instead of JUTES?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFIRRS 12C ReFIRES +72 284
#note This one's always fun if there's a P in the bag. It sims best too, not that I have any idea why.
>Emil_Rem: IT E10 .I.T +14 155
>Matthew_Larocque: DELNPQR H11 R.PEL +28 312
#note I'm always wary of hanigng onto a Q that I might not have a place for, but 28 points is 28 points, I can worry about this mess later.
>Emil_Rem: ?EINOSU 15E OUt.INES +58 213
#note Monster bingo. There is 2 words that reach the TWS for 74 though.
>Matthew_Larocque: BDILNQV L12 VID. +16 328
#note I don't really know what I'm doing here. I think I was trying to form a Q dump while shedding the V.
>Emil_Rem: CDK 13K D.CK +22 235
>Matthew_Larocque: BGILNQ 11A QI +15 343
#note Snagged the last I - would have been a painful finish had I not. This whole tournament had been full of lucky draws and fluke plays, now I'm an overrated chump!
>Emil_Rem: BGVX 2A .X +18 253
#note He missed X(U)
>Matthew_Larocque: BGLN L1 GL.N +20 363
#note Quackle likes dumping the B first, really? He can block my 20 point spot for GLEN....
>Emil_Rem: BGV M6 B.. +8 261
#note I honestly didn't even see the 2nd place for this, but Emil placed his B there, than changed his mind. I was almost out of time so if it wasn't for him, I'd be in trouble.
>Matthew_Larocque: B D10 .B. +8 371
>Matthew_Larocque:  (GV) +12 383
#note Not sure what was up with Emil's racks - so many low scoring dumps when he had higher scoring plays.
