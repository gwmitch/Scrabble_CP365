#note 4D H(A)PAX 50.  I was tempted to take BATH or PHAT and come back for OX.  Champ says... yeah, PHAT or BATH is the winner.

#note B2 COSEY 51.  On the way home I saw COPY keeping ESS would have put me in a better position.  Champ says... yeah, COSEY is best, there, or hooking JIHAD.  COPSE is another option instead of POESY, which really isn't that great, apparently.
>Liz_Gottlin: AEEKLN O5 ALKENE +34 271
>Ryan_Fischer: CLMOOSW C11 COW +24 319
#note She's drawn 6, I shouldn't be scared.  Except, the blank is unseen, as is an S, and that pool looks decent.  I don't think this was right, but I couldn't bring myself to set up a monster S hook.  I played COW here 'cause I have the L (and not MOW 'cause I don't have the N).  Champ says...  COW is best.  Go figure.
>Liz_Gottlin: EFW B4 FEW +32 303
>Ryan_Fischer: DLMNOSU O14 OM +17 336
#note Couldn't convince myself of DOUM(A) (and was worried it'd open something big for her).  UNSOLD and OSMUND, though nice, are dumb.  MOLD seems even worse.  Wracked with indecision and low on time, I threw this down.
>Liz_Gottlin: EGHIOUV 5M OV. +6 309
#note Excellent play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADLNSTU L3 DUNT +17 353
#note Now she's got a bingo in two spots up top which I've gotta block, and hope she can't hit down below.  Damn.  DUNT *is* Champ's pick (yay!), winning 70%, but no go.
