#note Had I known PROSER I would have player is there for 44 however mine is much more defensive although the other sims better by 6%ish

>Tim_Michaels: AW 7G AW +22 157
>Joey_Krafchick: AAFIMTX 15F FIT +31 248
#note I thought on this one for a while and had I known MAFIC I would have loved to play that. I felt the X was easy to score mith on this board so it didn't hurt to keep it, plus FIT scores nicely and eliminates that spot.

#note ATAXY isnt as defensive although it scores 4 more. MAY sims better slightly
>Tim_Michaels: EGP M3 PEG +22 201
>Joey_Krafchick: ?AEMTXY 6C MATEY +21 305
#note Here I just wanted to play off a lot of tiles and block some lanes. I opened up news ones that were less dangerous.
>Tim_Michaels: EGIINRV E2 RIVE.ING +74 275
#note Blocked grieving but gave his this! Should have played meaty instead!

>Joey_Krafchick: ?EELRTT 1F ERE +12 357
#note This was trick since there was only one bingo lane after this play and I had no bingo. I figured this was safe. Simmed the best despite not being on the original choices option.
