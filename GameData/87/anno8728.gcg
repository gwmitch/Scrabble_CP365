>Ryan_Fischer: CELORRT 8H ORC +10 10
#note Champ says CEORL.  I really wasn't sure.  Wanted to play COLTER but it gave back a ton (but that's what I want versus him).  Figured ORC might give a shot at an open board/quick bingo.
>David_Gibson: GMNRTU G8 TUG +11 11
>Ryan_Fischer: EELRTUV J8 .UVEE +18 28
#note Blocked my revolute truelove.  Revolute takes no hooks, either.  I thought it might.  9C VULT(U)RE 20.
>David_Gibson: ?DEMPRT 12F TeMP.RED +80 91
>Ryan_Fischer: BHLOPRT K4 BROTH +30 58
#note There are a lot of 4-letter extensions to TORCH: -WOOD, -LIKE, -ABLE, -IERS, -IERE, -IEST, -ERES.
>David_Gibson: AOX H12 .OXA +39 130
>Ryan_Fischer: ILLNOPR L1 LILO +18 76
#note I considered keeping the I, hoping for TORCHIERE, but it's so not worth it here.  Looking at the other top choices, I'm fine with this one.
>David_Gibson: EFKU 1K F.UKE +36 166
>Ryan_Fischer: INNOPRR 10B PORIN. +17 93
#note M9 NON(D)RIP 22.  He was really amused by this play because of what happened next. I figured some misdirection was in order, so I played this leaving NR hoping to get a decent draw and one of those unseen eses.  He took the bait.
>David_Gibson: AHY 11A YAH +18 184
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEGINR M8 BREA.ING +76 169
#note Needless to say, he was surprised to see me play a bingo on the other side of the board without an S.  Hehe.  Now still available is (TORCH)A(B)LE, which I didn't know at the time.
>David_Gibson: ?ELOTUW 15D OUTL.WEd +61 245
#note Damn.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIMNTV 14B VIM +20 189
#note D4 MINIVE(R) might give me a little bit more hope.  Champ says... oddly, MI N10 22 is 11.4% to win.  VIM is only 9.8%
>David_Gibson: Q C13 Q. +22 267
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIINST I12 .I +8 197
#note I figured KI blocked too many bingo possibilities.
>David_Gibson: EJL 6J J.LE +27 294
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINSTY 14J YA +27 224
#note Yeah, I shoulda gone with my gut on YEA(N)S with 3 eses unseen.  Was still in it even with my unfortunate luck until then.
>David_Gibson: DI 2N ID +21 315
>Ryan_Fischer: DEINSST 8M .IS +15 239
#note Ooh!  A7 DITS(Y) 37.  N6 STIED 39.  I was fixated on creating another line, which DITSY sure would've done.
