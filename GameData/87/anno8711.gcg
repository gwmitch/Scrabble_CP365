>Mike_Ebanks: FGHIT 8D FIGHT +32 32
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIINNZ F6 ZI. +33 33
#note Whoa, (F)ANZINE, does that mean what it sounds like it means? *checks Zyzzyva* -_-
>Mike_Ebanks: NNPY E7 P.NNY +24 56
#note I didn't even know what PINNY was either. Thankfully it wasn't "full of pins".
>Matthew_Larocque: EINNORS G8 .ON +7 40
#note (T)ERNIONS is the play, although I spent enough time here that I should have came up with  IN(T)ONERS at the very least. I knew I was missing something but the game had to go on, so yeah....blah
>Mike_Ebanks: C 7E ..C +22 78
>Matthew_Larocque: EINORSS I5 SONSIER +72 112
#note I kind of liked this placement because with 7 new letters, there was a reasonable chance I could strike another blow on either of the open triple letter scores.
>Mike_Ebanks: MU J6 MU +22 100
>Matthew_Larocque: EGILOPV H11 OGIVE +35 147
#note Don't ask me why I didn't play this for 41 instead, because I have no idea.
>Mike_Ebanks: CEHMY H1 CHYME +56 156
#note I deserved that
>Matthew_Larocque: DGLPRTU 3D GULP. +14 161
#note Yikes, letters getting kind of ugly. Mike didn't know GULPY, but he let it go.
>Mike_Ebanks: AIV D1 VA.I +24 180
>Matthew_Larocque: DEKNORT 2B KO. +14 175
#note I took a pretty long time on this one - I couldn't do anything good with the 10J spot, dumping the K was a priority here. My play actually sims pretty high - didn't expect that. D(U)NK is a play I didn't catch.
>Mike_Ebanks: ABF J10 FAB +32 212
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEENRT 1F RE.ANTED +62 237
#note Um, CANTERED? Seriously I was just moronic here. Oh, and CRENATED but I've never heard of that one.
>Mike_Ebanks: BOT D11 BOT +17 229
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENOOR 12J .OO +10 247
#note I figured by opening up here, it would be virtually impossible to NOT bingo again. Unless I get overloaded with vowels, or suck, or both.
>Mike_Ebanks: AQT 14B QAT +30 259
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEENR 2H .AE +14 261
#note ANEARED! Frig. And there's ANAER(O)bE for 58 but you actually have to study to know words like that >_> I missed the 17 point spot to dump AE
>Mike_Ebanks: DEISW 15A WIDES +52 311
>Mike_Ebanks: DEISW --  -52 259
#note LOL. The sad thing here is I thought WIDES was the phony.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENRRT M7 ERRANTs +72 333
#note Right so, embarassment of riches might be the term here. Nothing I saw was completely defensive, so I just picked one. Wait... this bingo actually sims at the top of theh heap? Well that's just dumb luck.
>Mike_Ebanks: DEIJ 8K JE.ID +42 301
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAAELX G12 AX +37 370
#note Sweet, other blank and the X now. I shouldn't be in danger of losing, right?
>Mike_Ebanks: ISTW 15A WITS +45 346
#note yipes
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAELUW K11 L.WE +22 392
#note Wow what a terrible play. I was in huge rush though - I think I had like 60 seconds left, if that. Of course that's all on me for taking too long on plays like KO(A) and the bingos. Anyways WAUL at 3J scores 20 and sheds the U. Or just WE for 28, good god.
>Mike_Ebanks: EILLR 15K RILLE +26 372
#note And I give him this.... still, the game isn't lost yet. In fact there's only one way I can probably lose this game. And, in epic choke fashion...
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEIRU -  +0 392
#note A valley on the moon's surface. >_<
>Mike_Ebanks: DDEOSU N7 D.ED +22 394
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEIRU B2 .AURI +11 403
#note bad bad bad but, I had like 10 seconds to make a play. If I go overtime making a different play, it doesn't make much of a difference.
>Mike_Ebanks: OSU N12 SOU. +16 410
>Mike_Ebanks:  (AE?) +4 414
#note If I didn't let my mind crumble here, I would have been good for second place instead - this was easily the biggest blunder of the tournament.
