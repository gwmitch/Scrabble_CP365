#note I actually thought of LEMURES here, but it was a complete guess - thought it was another way to spell LEMUR. Just ended up using this unimaginative bingo, but it gets the job done. Just for fun, MEwLERS seems to win the sim, with SMElLer right behind. Makes sense to double a letter, or use an awkward one for defensive purposes.
>Randall_Thomas: DEGIINW 6E WIE.DING +67 67
#note Randall not going to let me get away so easy
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEENRR E5 E.ER +14 86
#note This seemed like the best way to score and keep a nice leave. Sim doesn't give a clear favorite here, but this play competes with RA(G)EE, EA(G)RE, EA(G)ER, (D)ERE. All score about the same and have good leaves.
>Randall_Thomas: AEORTUV 10A OUTRAVE. +71 138
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEINRT A4 AERATI.N +77 163
#note I saw this right away - didn't look for other bingos since this had to be best.
>Randall_Thomas: AIRV B2 VAIR +18 156
>Matthew_Larocque: DEFLNQS D2 DELF +21 184
#note I really had a tough time on this play. Even though this ends up at the top of the simulation, FLED would have been way more defensive. If I draw an I, there's a decent QI dump for me.
>Randall_Thomas: CHI C1 HIC +33 189
>Matthew_Larocque: NOPQSUY 9G P.Y +22 206
#note I didn't see QU(I)N for 21, but with SUQ on my rack, I had no worries about keeping the Q. If I draw an A, nice spot for QUA.
>Randall_Thomas: IZ L4 ZI. +26 215
>Matthew_Larocque: FNOQRSU 5J QU.N +41 247
#note This sets up some dangerous hooks, but it's still the best play by a mile. If he hooks it, I will probably get something on a TWS.
>Randall_Thomas: DEMTU N3 MUTED +24 239
#note Interesting. Guess he's trying to fork here.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFOORSS O6 FOR +26 273
#note Damn - I didn't know if FRASS was a word, but it sure is. SAROS scores well too. Anyways ROOF is probably better, I played FOR just because it didn't open anything new up. I'm not really that obsessed with defense - but when I'm playing higher rated players I'm a little more careful I guess.
>Randall_Thomas: JO M2 JO +26 265
>Matthew_Larocque: AGNOSSW 12A SWAG +28 301
#note With a spare S this seemed like a great option. Sim wants to play SWANG for an extra 2 points. It's embarassing, but I always think of SWUNG, and think SWANG is bad english. SWUM/SWAM are also both valid, so that should help to eliminate any confusion.  
>Randall_Thomas: BGO 13C BOG +23 288
>Matthew_Larocque: HLNOSTY O1 NOSH +47 348
#note Also, TOSH (didn't know). TOSH sims a bit better too.
>Randall_Thomas: EKU M7 UKE +14 302
#note Ruh roh
>Matthew_Larocque: BLOSTTY L9 BLOTTY +26 374
#note Well I can feel that he's about to bingo. I figure dumping my letters here should give me enough of cushion to weather it. What is a SYBO. BLOT/ABO/GOT sims best. Is that because I can abuse it with my Y next turn or something?
>Randall_Thomas: EP E1 PE +12 314
#note Well then what are you up now Randall
>Matthew_Larocque: AAACINS 1E .ANIC +27 401
#note the P did make me panic cause a bingo up there would be much more damaging - felt like I had no choice. PACA is a word that would have been useful to know. Sim wants to play AA for 13 parallel to BLOTTY, but like I said lets block the more dangerous threat here.
>Randall_Thomas: ?AEILNT N9 ENTAILs +71 385
#note He took a bit of time cycling through the countless bingos, aware of the X. At a quick glance, ELAsTIN or ELATIoN seem like good defensive options. It doesn't really matter though since I have another good spot.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIOOSX 14B SAX +36 437
#note I was very low on time here, but quickly figured this was the best spread play.
>Randall_Thomas: D E10 .D +6 391
#note D plays for 13.
>Randall_Thomas:  (AIOO) +8 399
#note This was my 3rd victory over an expert opponent. I've had fluky tournaments, but this was by far the most stacked division that I have played in. Compounded by the fact that the pairings ended up giving me probably the hardest path of anyone. As a 13 seed out of 18 players, I only played 2 people with a rating lower than mine (and Wesley is underrated anyways). I never played any of the bottom 3 seeds, and played Eric Tran twice. It was a good weekend to be lucky, at any rate.
