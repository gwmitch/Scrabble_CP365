>Quackle: EEJPRRV 8G PERV +18 18
#note Nothing much to say, picked this over JEEP, which is the right call.... oddly enough, Championship Player lists exchanging the J as the #4 play, above any JEEP. Yeah, shoulda just fished to that bingo-prone EEPRRV rack....
>New_Player_1: ?EEMNNZ 9E NEEM +16 16
>Quackle: EIIJLNR J6 JI.ER +33 51
#note Best, better than JIVIER and JIVE.... considered JINNI E7, which is #2, but ELR vs. ILN sure isn't a 9-point difference...
>New_Player_1: ?ACGINZ 8A GhAZI +74 90
#note Like casual players, Quackle will occasionally ditch the blank for high scoring plays... unlike them, however, it goes GhAZI for 74 rather than ZiT for 11...
>Quackle: IKLNNOT K4 KNOT +27 78
#note Surprisingly the best, though I woulda gone E5 NIT(IN)OL 28 or B8 (h)OTLINK 24 for style had I seen either of them...
>New_Player_1: ACDLNQU F9 .QUAL +34 124
>Quackle: AEILNTU 4E AUNTLI.E +76 154
#note Only bingo out there, a rather "un-aunt-like" play (then again, my aunt did once play the impressive 'digitize' on Thanksgiving). Of all the family words, SONLIKE, AUNTLIKE, FATHERLIKE are all that are good....
>New_Player_1: CDDNRST E3 C.RD +14 138

>New_Player_1: ADNOSTY 14A TODAYS +41 179
#note Hmm, didn't know that took an S...
>Quackle: AEEOPTT 15A OPE +28 218
#note A tiny bit behind A11 PET(T)O 24.... close enough
>New_Player_1: ADMNNTU 3L DUNT +13 192
#note No, forget H1 DUN(T) for 15, let's just do.... a reckless low-scoring dump into the triple lane?  Good lordy, Quackle.... I don't need no fancy computer to know that that sucks
>Quackle: AAAESTT 4N AA +8 226
#note This play is MIA from the list, but I didn't think it was that bad. Best is N2 A(N)TAE 14, which I didn't really know, but would have played. I guess I overreacted to dunt, which seemed like a(n uneccesarily) desperate fish, that I needed to block some how, even though it could retaliate with a 3x3 like retailed, entailer, etc. AA was a semi-okay block, that kept a decent leave. Maybe something more opening, like 13H AA would have been a better route. Whatever
>New_Player_1: ?AELLMN H12 .LEM +27 219
#note Containing one of the most unlikely front hooks (xylem??) this side of sgraffiti.....
>Quackle: AEIRSTT 15H .ISTREAT +83 309
#note They call me... Mr. Hodges! No mean mistreatin' mama here.
>New_Player_1: ?AELNRW O8 tRAWLNE. +83 302
#note 83-83=.....?
>Quackle: BCFFGOW H1 COF. +27 336
#note What? No ADEINRS? 7F WOG 20 is a bit better, but this isn't too far behind.... everything here scores 20ish and leaves ugly crap behind
>New_Player_1: ADGIORU 13J GUIDO. +16 318
>Quackle: BEFGOSW N9 OF +28 364
#note Sucks. 11J SWOB 34 wins 90.45%, and should have seen 12L BOW(L) 34 at 87.88%. This is way back at a humble 75.38.
>New_Player_1: AIINOOR 12L OI +11 329
>Quackle: BBEEGSW N2 G..W +16 380
#note In these types of situations, I'm still clueless. N13 (O)B(A) 18 and O1 BE(TA) 18 are top two listed at 85%-88%, while mine is about 80%. I figured I'd leave one in the bag, and keep a few vowels for the endgame. I didn't really see any possible bingoes. Turns out the only one is oran(g)ish (I thought "hoarsing*"), which I sadly didn't know. A classic "poke and hope" sort of play
>New_Player_1: AHINORX 7B OH +19 348
>Quackle: BBEEISS G2 BE.S +17 397
#note And I survived! L7 SIBS 10 and 5C BI(R)SE 11 are best, but this is only two behind. In the words of the Tower of Pisa arcitects, "good enough"
>New_Player_1: AIINRX A3 RAXIN. +21 369
>Quackle: BEIS 11A BISE +11 408
#note Only out. Took Quackle down sans blanks.... maybe there's hope for me after all
>Quackle:  (I) +2 410
