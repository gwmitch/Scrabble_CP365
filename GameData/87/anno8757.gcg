#note All of these plays sim within 2% of each other. I like this because of the leave and board control that I have.

#note 750 sims says QUIN is the best but it only scores 1 more than the third simming QUA. I like QUA because it keeps the board closed and CDEIN is nice to have. I liked QUINCE but it was enough more for me to open the 3x3 lane up.

>Joey_Krafchick: CDEIMNR N2 MINE +30 168
#note Playing David I always think of defense, and since CRIME would give him a lot of options I decided MINE was safe and nice scoring. I thought for a long time. MINE sims better slightly
>David_Gibson: EITU O5 ETUI +15 125
>Joey_Krafchick: CDEIORS M11 C.D +12 180
#note I thought hard but couldnt decide on an elite play. IDOCRASE didnt fit, so I played this to keep EIORS

>Joey_Krafchick: EGIIORS L11 R.I +11 191
#note Now the  board is almost shut off from bingo lanes and I'm thinking I have a solid lead, so why not shut it down more? I had no bingo here so I played this, finding it was a suitable leave and nice enough points while simultaneously blocking a bingo lane. Sims best with 500 iterations.

#note Go figure
>Joey_Krafchick: EEGILOS 9C OLE +13 204
#note This is where the turning point was because I thought this would made it a closed board duel and I was close enough in score. However....

>Joey_Krafchick: EGHISTY --  -45 204
#note With three unseen S's and a blank out I thought he may have been setting himself up, or it could have been a decoy. I needed points and they was no where else to get them, so I tried. Now I Know. On the other hand, EY(E)SIGHT and HYGEIST work! So do GIRTH and YIRTH! DURP!
