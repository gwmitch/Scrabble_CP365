>Emely_Weissman: EGIOV 8D VOGIE +26 26
>Sam_Masling: BDILMSS E4 LIMB. +18 18
#note Adding the 'S' is better according to the duck, but I didn't want to telegraph that I had an S this early in the game.
>Emely_Weissman: BEEH D3 HEBE +30 56
>Sam_Masling: DEIRSST I2 STRIDES +70 88
#note (E)DITRESS
VOGIES* but neither of us knew that so it stayed.
D(EM)ISTERS is an awesome 9.

>Emely_Weissman: AENN 5I .NANE +25 109
>Sam_Masling: EGINOOS C3 EGO +27 143
#note Played OE same spot warrants consideration because it opens up a line with no others really open but the 10 point sacrifice isn't worth it.
>Emely_Weissman: AIV G7 V.A +11 120
#note Miscored as 10....
>Sam_Masling: EINOSST K4 ..SONITES +72 215
#note She blocked INOSITES/NOISIEST which were the only 2 I saw for awhile but then I saw that.  Missed ESSONITE which is better but don't know that word.  She challenged this.
>Emely_Weissman: AAAAAAA -  +0 120
>Sam_Masling: ?ACDFIP L7 FAD +19 234
#note Missed PACiFI(E)D  This isn't great but nothing else is either.

>Sam_Masling: ?JKPRTY E10 J..KY +19 321
#note I thought about playing J(ER)K and keeping the Y but with a blank out it's not worth trying to make a set up.  I had seen the possibility of R(URALITES) earlier in the game but just completely missed it here.  P(O)RKY is rul nice.
