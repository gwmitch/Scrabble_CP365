>Matthew_Larocque: GGHHIIS 8F GHI +14 14
#note Funny opening rack. I played this hastily, sim indicates HIGHS for 32 is better as well as just playing HIGH.
>Paul_Sidorsky: EKSV F6 KE. +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: GHIOOPS 5B POOHS +29 43
#note Due to a lack of scoring plays without the S, I have to use it here. 
>Paul_Sidorsky: ENVY D2 ENV.Y +22 40
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGILRU 4B UL.A +18 61
#note No clear cut favourite in the sim, but I don't agree with 3B LI(N)GUA, too easy for Paul to get easy points. The simple G(N)U would be pretty irritating though. U(N)RIG opens a hotspot that's dangerous for him to use. EAR(P)LUG opens but also forks the TWS squares. UL(V)A scores decently and doesn't really give him anything, but keeps the G which I'd rather get rid of.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AOORRSS -  +0 40
#note I guess that ended up working out for the better.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGILMNR 7H MINGLER +66 127
>Paul_Sidorsky: AOORRSS O7 SOAR +23 63
#note His actual rack. Good thing he had an extra S to spare!
>Matthew_Larocque: FIOOQRT 6I QI +28 155
>Paul_Sidorsky: AAERSTY 5J YA +16 79
#note His rack again.
>Matthew_Larocque: FOOORTU N9 FOU +17 172
#note After YA I definitely want to block this S hook.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AAEORST 9G ORA +16 95
#note He said I blocked AEROSAT. 
>Matthew_Larocque: DEOORTT 10E TOTED +23 195
#note Ugh, I'm pretty sure I've missed this one before. I went for defense again, rejected TOOTED since it offered easier points than TOTED.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AESTW 11D WAE +18 113
>Matthew_Larocque: AFIOORT 12A FARO +32 227
#note I did not know FAROLITO. Paul's short plays indicated he was saving good letters, so it seemed right to take the points. However A(LO)OF does this even better.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AESTV A12 .AVE +30 143
>Matthew_Larocque: IILNOTX C9 INT.O +19 246
#note I didn't like the X plays I saw, so I went for this. NIT(R)IL does this way better because it gives me the huge spot I need.
>Paul_Sidorsky: CEMNST 2A CEM.NT +24 167
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEILRX B9 XI +24 270
#note I've never been good at X bingos. I should also play something like AXIL 1F because it scores a lot more.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AZ 4K ZA +33 200
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AELNRR 12I ReLEARN +71 341
#note About time I see something, it's amazing I'm still winning.
>Paul_Sidorsky: DEENSSW 11J DEW +25 225
#note He said I blocked LEWDNESS.
>Matthew_Larocque: DIILTTU O12 .IDI +15 356
#note I wanted to take out row 1, but had no good plays to do that. Unless I want to do something silly like IT which still sets up an S. Maybe I could exchange this whole rack instead?
>Paul_Sidorsky: BENSS 6C B. +12 237
>Matthew_Larocque: CGLPTTU 15K CULT. +8 364
#note I thought about GULP/ZAP but that seemed foolish. I could also just play PUG/ZAG, but thought getting rid of an extra consonant would make it easier next turn. Sim likes M2 PUG or TUG a lot more than CULT(I), and also suggests 3L PLUG or PUTT. I can't lose, but I hated having no good options to stop his bingo.
>Paul_Sidorsky: ?DEINSS 1F INSiDES +76 313
#note EDGINESS for an extra point.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEGJPT 13G JEE +22 386
#note Not much here, but blocking his (D)UI helps my spread.
>Paul_Sidorsky: IU J1 .UI +6 319
>Paul_Sidorsky:  (BGPT) +18 337
#note A game I should have won by more than I did, but I luckily blocked his bingos at the right times.
