>Howard_Pistol: DEE 9F DEE +12 12
>Morris_Greenberg: ?NNRRTT -NRT +0 16
#note Normally, it's better to just keep RT, but since I am picking from a pool of at least 2 less of each (so lesser chance of doubling than normally), this is fine
>Howard_Pistol: EGOR 10E GORE +20 32
>Morris_Greenberg: ?CILNRT 11H LINT +12 28
#note Quackle slightly prefers TIL or NIL 11F, I am fine opening it up a bit more.
>Howard_Pistol: ADEHK 7C KHEDA +26 58
>Morris_Greenberg: ?CEENRV 6G CERViNE +78 106
#note I missed REVaNC(H)E, but this is a safer play, so I might have done it anyway if I saw REVaNCHE.
>Howard_Pistol: DIINS H1 INSID. +24 82
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AEINST 12H STAINEd +76 182
#note Luckbox. I am pretty sure the blank was the last tile I drew too.
>Howard_Pistol: ALUU 5K LUAU +14 96
>Morris_Greenberg: AEMOORR 3C ROMEO. +18 200
#note I straight up missed ROAM and REAM 8A, really bad. I liked how this play cut Howard's bingo percentage. Quackle estimates it to be under 3.5% after ROMEOS, whereas it is around 10% after a play like ROAM. I would obviously play ROAM if I saw it, but this is still an effective play with an 100 point lead.
>Howard_Pistol: APW 2D WAP +33 129
>Morris_Greenberg: AEGORTZ 8A ZOA +42 242
#note RETAG 4B is also a very nice play for 37 points. It allows me to score a bunch and hold onto my Z.
>Howard_Pistol: DEITY 1A DEITY +45 174
>Morris_Greenberg: EEFGRTT 9B EFT +26 268
>Howard_Pistol: OOW 11C WOO +18 192
>Morris_Greenberg: AEGHLOR 11M HOG +13 281
#note Not initially in Quackle's top 15, but does very well in the sim. This cuts his bingo percentage to under 2 percent, whereas higher scoring plays like HOG for 28 12D allow bingos 5% of the time. The real star of a play which I missed is GHERAO for 37 12A, that looks like it scores enough to not bother messing with column O. GERAH 12B does too.
>Howard_Pistol: OTT 13K TOT +23 215
>Morris_Greenberg: AACEFLR O8 FLA. +24 305
#note This was a tough choice between FLA(G) and REFLA(G). I chose FLA(G) at the time because the pool was a bit ugly, and leaving myself with a strong leave allows for more flexibility on future turns. I am fairly sure now that REFLA(G) is the right play, as seen later in the game.
>Howard_Pistol: J L4 J.. +20 235
>Morris_Greenberg: AACEMNR 12B REMAN +31 336
>Howard_Pistol: AIQSU O1 QUAIS +50 285
#note REFLAG would've blocked that. I was so concerned with blocking column O as a bingo threat that it didn't really occur to me how much damage to my spread it could be as a Q lane.
>Morris_Greenberg: ACGLNRV 1G V.NCA +10 346
#note This wins 100%, but Quackle suggests V(I)G instead. I was mostly concerned with not getting V or C stuck, so I opted for VINCA.
>Howard_Pistol: BBEIISX F12 .IX +26 311
#note Savvy play by Howard, but BIBS 14J nets 5 more.
>Morris_Greenberg: GILRU 14D LU. +10 356
#note RIG 14J.
>Howard_Pistol: BBEIS 15F EBBS +35 346
#note BIBS.
>Morris_Greenberg: GIR 2K RIG +6 362
#note RIG 14J. I got an early lead and really made sure I didn't keep the board volatile enough for Howard to outrun me, but I sacrificed a large amount of spread by playing FLAG instead of REFLAG.
