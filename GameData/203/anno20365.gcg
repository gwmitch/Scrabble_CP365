>Wendy_Mcgrath: AQT 8G QAT +24 24
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEIOW 9H WOE +15 15
#note I tried to justify this as barely worth playing because I'm blocking cheap points under the Q. If I draw 3 more vowels next turn, though, I'm screwed.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: DEEKN 10F KNEED +40 64
#note That's not good.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEISU 11E EAU +14 29
#note Lucky that EAU plays.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: DIRT 12C DIRT +19 83
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGISS K3 AEGISES +73 102
#note Timely bingo, I could have easily paid the price for not balancing my rack earlier.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: PU 6J P.U +11 94
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFLNNS L1 FLAN +28 130
#note Disappointed in myself for seeing FENLANDS and chickening out. I lost the first game because I chickened out on GURRY. Need more confidence.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: EIV 1L .IVE +30 124
>Matthew_Larocque: ENOPSTY 13B YON +20 150
#note (D)OPY gives too much back.... (S)PY 7K is a good play I missed.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: IIIII -IIIII +0 124
>Matthew_Larocque: EOPRSTT 13F SPOTTER +71 221
#note Too risky?
>Wendy_Mcgrath: GINX 8K .XING +63 187
>Matthew_Larocque: DFHJOTU H12 D.JO +42 263
#note I laid down *H(O)FT momentarily. Thankfully I decided to save myself the embarrassment.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: ALOZ N6 ZO.AL +36 223
>Matthew_Larocque: EFHOTTU L10 FOU.TH +32 295
>Wendy_Mcgrath: CEEOS 15K C.OSE +30 253
>Matthew_Larocque: ENORRRT I13 .OR +14 309
#note I forgot that she could play IKATS or SKATS, so I thought I was closing the board more than I was.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: CEI N1 .ICE +18 271
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIRRTV 14A VET +26 335
#note Good time to draw the V.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: ABI N12 BIA. +12 283
>Matthew_Larocque: ADGIMRR M7 D.M +23 358
#note O11 RIDG(E) is the sim's choice. I thought I had looked at that spot, but I guess I didn't see this.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: IIU -IIU +0 283
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIMRRY O5 RAG.Y +34 392
#note Or (G)RIMY for 33. Either play wins over 98% of the time. Wendy will need at least two bingos and that is not likely to happen on this board, although I still had forgot she could open by hooking KATS.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: ABW J1 WAB +15 298
>Matthew_Larocque: IILMNRU 12N .I +5 397
#note Wasn't sure what to play, but I shouldn't empty the bag, so I ditched a duplicate I. Quackle's champ player is saying only four plays win and this isn't one. Not sure how that is possible. (P)I scores 6.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: ??AEINR 2N .N +4 302
#note She has a handful of bingos to the A, but she didn't find them and gave up. After the game she did realize ANTISERA was one of the options that she missed.
>Matthew_Larocque: HILMNRU 15C HURL +16 413
#note I figured she'd still have trouble finding anything, so I just played off letters. I should play something like M(A) or H(A), which I would if she was a high rated player.
>Wendy_Mcgrath: ??AEILR 1G gRE. +18 320
>Matthew_Larocque: IMN 11K M.N +10 423
#note 9E MI 13
>Wendy_Mcgrath: ?AIL G1 .rAIL +4 324
#note We both missed IKATS all game.
>Wendy_Mcgrath:  (I) +2 326
#note I got lucky that the blanks came too late after the board died for her to catch up.
