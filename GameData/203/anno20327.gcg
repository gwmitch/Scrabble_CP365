>Wayne_Clifford: AIINRST 8G TI +4 4
#note Wayne's rack. I'd just exchange I, TRAINS is pretty strong.
>Matthew_Larocque: AIMNOOV 9D AVION +14 14
#note Wayne's obviously sitting on strong bingo letters, so lets set up my M for big points.
>Wayne_Clifford: AINPRSS I2 SPRAINS +66 70
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEFHMO 8A MACH +54 68
#note Instead of CHEF because there's a good spot for my F at F10.
>Wayne_Clifford: ABO H4 ABO +15 85
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEEFOR B3 FOREB.DE +68 136
#note LOL! I played this quickly without even realizing my stupid spelling error. I noticed soon after and had to fight back the urge to burst out laughing for the rest of the game. 
>Wayne_Clifford: ADEX A1 AXED +52 137
#note Yes, Wayne didn't challenge it either. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DIINTU 1A .UDITINg +77 213
#note I was about to back-to-back phony with *UNITISED until I smartened up and saw this. I've gotten a lot of junk past Wayne though, so he might have bought it.
>Wayne_Clifford: AEOOQRU E1 .AO +3 140
#note He said after the game he was fishing for a Q play, but then realized he missed SQUARE on this turn. It's possible he misread what he wrote down. That would suck if he missed 75 points and played 3 points.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AJMNRU D3 JUN +29 242
>Wayne_Clifford: EOQRTU A10 ROQUET +77 217
#note I was so surprised when this came down, that's what the fish was leading to?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGMRY F3 GAMY +29 271
#note Bingo missed, but it's a lower prob with a blank K. I'm not good enough for that yet.
>Wayne_Clifford: EHOSV 2I .HOVES +40 257
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFGLRZ 1M FEZ +52 323
#note I told Wayne he was going to hate me since I'm hitting yet another big score. Wayne reassured me that he already hates me. So I guess no hard feelings about the cheapness going on here ;)
>Wayne_Clifford: ADI 12A .ADI +28 285
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEGLRT 11D LEG +10 333
#note I just saw this word recently too, and tried to remember ETAGERE + an L makes a bingo. I haven't seen MACHE in so long I forgot it was even a word.
>Wayne_Clifford: EITW 5H ..WTIE +22 307
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CELORT 14A .LECTROs +72 405
#note ELECTORS is better defense, but one of my weaknesses is playing the "other" word just for variety, or for increased challenge potential.
>Wayne_Clifford: ELPU H11 PUL.E +21 328
>Matthew_Larocque: AEKLORS 4L KA +26 431
#note I guess I'd survive an outbingo, but no sense in coughing up spread so I didn't emtpy the bag with something like KOLA.
>Wayne_Clifford: EGINNRW 15G R.NEWING +65 393
>Matthew_Larocque: ELORSTY 14J YO +31 462
#note Yuck, 3 bingos here that I didn't know. PROSTYLE, PROTYLES, UROSTYLE. I looked until my time ran out, this is like the 10th best play. 
>Wayne_Clifford: I 5D .I. +10 403
>Wayne_Clifford:  (ELRST) +10 413
#note Lots of cheap drawing and cheesy plays this game, and also *FOREBADE. So bad it's good.
