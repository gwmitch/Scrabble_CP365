#note Not sure why I insisted on keeping AOY here. YAY is better, either at 9B or 9C.

>Evans_Clinchy: ABCKMOY F11 YACK +35 57
#note KYBO# C12 sims best here, which surprises me. Dangling the vowel in the triple lane just seems unnecessary. YACK offers a similar score, better defense and a leave that can score well next turn.

>Evans_Clinchy: BOORSSU H1 BOS +27 184
#note I spent a while staring at SORBOUS* and convincing myself it wasn't a word. Then once it got time to actually play something, I failed to consider a high-scoring 6-tile play. BUROOS# for 41 and SORBUS# for 47 are both better than BOS.

>Evans_Clinchy: DDHORSU M3 DUH +23 207
#note Thought about blowing up the rack with SHROUD H10, but didn't think 35 points was enough. Preferred to keep the better leave and angle for a bingo in either line 1 or 13. Sim agrees.

#note I knew I needed an extra bingo line to have a chance, and prying open this corner of the board seemed like the best course of action. PUER# probably isn't the best way to do it, though. He can play PIEING from the P and obscure a ton of my bingo possibilities. POULE# through the L looks better. Also digs a little deeper to ensure I draw that blank.
