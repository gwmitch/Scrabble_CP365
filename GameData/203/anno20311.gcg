>Noah: EEGLLUY E6 GU.LEY +20 20
#note I should maybe do the more defensive EELY, which I didn't spot. Though part of my reason for playing this was that I thought it might draw a challenge (though I wasn't 100% on it either). Some people liked playing GULLEYE(D) but I was sure it was phony and didn't think it would stick.
>JD: ?EEIRTT H1 RIvETTE. +77 103
>Noah: CEIILWZ 10B WIL. +15 35
#note This was a tough play. I thought this would be good because I could hit some decent Z plays on column C. Quackle disagrees and favors W(E), which averages the same next turn as WILE in a sim. It also scores more and defends better so it seems like the play.

#note Thought about NIB and BINDI here as well. It might be better to do BINDI here because it makes it harder for Jesse to defend against bingos, which he's bound to start doing soon enough. A five tile play on column J or something like that could be really bad. NIB blocks an ok scoring spot but I think I prefer keeping the board more open. Not sure -- this play isn't so bad at least.
>JD: BHIOORS L4 HI +29 256
#note quackle thinks that my expected points per turn after this move is much lower, which is probably true. OBE at J5 is pretty cool, setting up my O with OXO and blocking nicely, and keeping a much better leave. HOBO at 3J also sims better than my play.

>Noah: AADENTY H10 N.YADE +42 319
#note Thought about DAY but thought my chances were better if I didn't have to bank on an S and instead opened a bunch of lanes (I could even win by scoring if I'm a bit lucky).
>JD: AIKLNNP 12L PINK +44 372
>Noah: AAHMTTW 10L HAW +44 363
#note It seemed like I should choose the word that bingoed more because I didn't think I would win much without a bingo. I thought HAW might bingo more than TAW -- they're about the same. It seems like if I don't draw a bingo, TAW will let me score more because AHMT gives me options like KHAT and HAT 13L. Since their chances are basically the same on bingos, I think I take TAW here.
