#note Seth was clearly fishing, if I land an E I have a bingo, or if he plays one openly, then I might have on too. This also forces him to think harder about fishing next turn if this suggests a fish to him. That's why I prefer this to GRAD M11.

#note Similar play to the previous turn, except with more fruitful bingo chances.

#note This is just too juicy of a lane Seth created to not block and take the points here. Quackle likes (T)AGRAG K7, but that is probably due to being too optimistic about Seth's rack.

#note TO(R)II is better, I missed that at the time. Seth is starting to get pretty low on time by now, so I make some speedier plays than normal here. This could have been costly as a mistake.

#note I liked being slightly vowel heavy here as the unseen pool to me had a 10:5 consonant-to-vowel ratio. Quackle comes up with a beautiful play: TOI(T) J12. That blocks a sneaky scoring spot at K11, I really can't afford a FEZ play there at all, and even a play like FEM puts me in bad shape. This does cut his bingo percentage more, but he is bingoing infrequently anyways (only a bit above 7% after TOIT).

#note LIP(I)DE nets 2 more.
>Morris_Greenberg: CEIMT 4I C.TE +22 404
#note Seth was down to under 20 seconds, but I saw a potential problem with playing T(I)ME for 2 more: If Seth blocks CI(G) C2 with LU(G)E(R), then I have CI left, and I thought only 1 spot for the C in C(IRE) 12J (I didn't notice (E)C(HARD)). I counted it up if I play C(IRE) after to not get C stuck, and we'd tie. I didn't notice though that since Seth only has an S left in that situation, it doesn't matter if he could C stick me, playing (Q)I would win there. Unnecessary paranoia ftw!
