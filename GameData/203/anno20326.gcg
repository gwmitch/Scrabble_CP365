#note Becky found the sick VETKOEK#, but it doesn't play! VOETSEK# does, and for some reason I actually knew that word!

#note So fixated on trying to remember if SEIGNIOR takes an I (it doesn't) that I forget about the Y hook! Oops....

#note Becky's last play, to me, implies a very bingo prone rack. The best spot, by far, is the C. So I feel like it's better to block now than exchange - if I can make her bingo for 15 less somewhere else then I've done myself a big favor. 
>Becky_Dyer: EFGHLNS 4A SHELF.NG +86 311
#note Was really confused to see that as her rack!
>Matt_Canik: LMNORST J8 M..L +14 251
#note Opens the board nicely for my case S, but other weird collins stuff like MOR(KI)N# and YMOLT# seem like they're better plays.

#note My draw after this bingo was BDDFIPR, which made the unseen pool AAAEEOOUUWY. Wowza that's a special pool.

#note It's funny when you legitimately have to worry about your opponent threatening EUOUAE in an endgame
>Becky_Dyer: AEEOUUY N9 AYE +16 415
#note Low on time, Becky overlooks column C plays for me. 
>Matt_Canik: BDDIO C12 BO +30 402
#note But I can't do enough. OD is a nice play though, threatens BID B13 or BID/ODD.
