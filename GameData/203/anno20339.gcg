#note I thought about OXID as well. It is simming comparably with OXIM. 
>Kurt: ITVY 9H TIVY +18 18
>Randi: ?DDIQTT -DDQT +0 26
#note Would DITTY really have been better? It leaves me an unplayable Q and I feel  like I'm still pretty unlikely to bingo next turn. I can see why I probably should have kept a D.

#note Points and leave. 2 top choices in a row!

>Randi: BIJNOSU D4 JU. +22 193
#note Well I missed the bingo that I didn't know. But my play is simming at #2 below it :)

#note Q seems to think I should have fished here. I did think about it, but 40 is a lot of points. Also I didn't know RIBOSE (Other than that, Q seems to think I should have fished). If I had known it, I probably would have played it because 30+ points and take out 3x3 line. 
>Kurt: ETV O12 VE.T +33 241
>Randi: AAAEITT 15L AI +9 243
#note We are playing with new 2s. Also did not know what to do here. Also might have slightly forgotten that JUG took an A. Should probably have thought more about trading, though.

>Randi: AADEITT H1 TIED +40 283
#note Yay points!
>Kurt: AADH B2 DA.HA +26 282
>Randi: AAENSTU A5 EAU +10 293
#note Well if I'm going to forget that JUG takes an A, I might as well commit to having forgotten that JUG takes an A.
>Kurt: FIL A1 FIL +23 305
>Randi: AENNSTY 3G Y.N +20 313
#note Well, yea.
>Kurt: OSTW J3 STOW +22 327
>Randi: ?AENPST 5J .P +8 321
#note Okay so let's say hypothetically that I missed bingos that I know... If I had seen TRAPNEST OR TRANSEPT I might have played them. I kind of forgot to look. All I saw was PATIENTS, and that didn't score and I didn't like it. Though I don't know if I would have played them for the same reason. But I probably should have seen them. 

BUUUUTTTT pretending that I don't have 80 point bingos... (and realizing that I don't know that STOW takes a P)...
