#note This is the first game of Player 1 that we are analyzing.  As you can see, player 1 is a pretty good player.  And while we don't have all of their racks, we can still notice some possible tendencies.

#note Even though we really don't have Player 1's rack, this really can't be right.  Hitting REENTERS for a bingo is really hard, and there are more dangerous threats.  This might be okay if he has a huge rack or at least an S (and preferably a blank honestly) but I don't really like it.  Since this board has huge setup potential, you really need to try to outscore.
>Opponent: ?BEEINT M10 BEEN +21 187
>Player_1: IS N10 SI +14 221
#note This probably isn't right either without the case S.  Doesn't score enough and gives the opponent too much liberty to create more setups.  It's looking like Player 1 doesn't react to setups very well and doesn't see its potential, and as a result goes overboard in closing the board, not seeing that his opponent can just create lines to the point of submission.
>Opponent: ?DHILMT A1 DIT.H +33 220
>Player_1: DO B1 OD +15 236
#note Scoring 15 to block the board with a 1 point lead and no strong indication of range is not a good idea.  A good player can abuse this horribly.
>Opponent: ?ALMY D2 YA. +20 240
>Player_1: III -III +0 236
#note I can't say I get this.  After playing off 2 tiles for 15, trading doesn't seem good, and if your rack is that bad you can trade more than 3 tiles.  The blank, S, and to a smaller degree X are all very useful here.  And now you're going to be behind on a board where being down isn't a good thing.
>Opponent: ?ACILMN O11 NIM +10 250
>Player_1: EO E5 OE +7 243
#note This is not a good play by player 1 with really any rack.  It's seeming like a closed board isn't actually a bad thing against Player 1, as long as you aren't losing.
>Opponent: ?ACIILU F4 AI +4 254
>Player_1: A 5A .A. +8 251
#note Not really sure of the logic here, but probably not a fan regardless.
>Opponent: ?ACILOU N13 OI +9 263
>Player_1: S 14N .S +8 259
#note Unknown but probably not a very good block given his rack/range.  EX is probably better if he has it.  Again, maybe not worth avoiding closed boards against Player 1.
>Opponent: ?ACFLRU G2 CURL +12 275
>Player_1: EEORTUX E1 REX +34 293
#note We're sensing a theme.  Is there more evidence to support this conclusion that we can exploit player 1?
