>Matthew_Larocque: ABEGITW H4 BAWTIE +28 28
#note After Mike snatched the last game away from me, I was rewarded with playing him again in the first round of repeats. I flaked out on BEWIG.
>Mike_Ebanks: EEHMNOU G9 HUE +19 19
#note Based on what he told me after the game, this should be what his rack was.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGKRTZ H11 TAKER +32 60
#note Or ZAG, but let's see if I can cash it in next turn.
>Mike_Ebanks: DEMNOOU 15C UNMOO.ED +62 81
#note Good find.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACGGOSZ F6 ZAGS +40 100
#note 10 more points over ZAG, as well as being more defensive.
>Mike_Ebanks: DOU 14D OUD +21 102
#note He said he drew OUD the previous turn, then drew OUD again here.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACFGGIO 13C GIGA +25 125
>Mike_Ebanks: INOV I3 VINO +22 124
>Matthew_Larocque: CFILNOW J6 WILCO +37 162
#note Or perhaps WOLF, COWIN(G) also plays for 39, but I insta-played WILCO here.
>Mike_Ebanks: CDNOR 12G D.CRON +26 150
>Matthew_Larocque: AFNNY 13K FANNY +29 191
#note Missed the full rack. I ended up playing FANNY because points and he might not be able to use the Y effectively.
>Mike_Ebanks: EERSV 8J .EVERS +39 189
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEELRS O13 .EA +18 209
#note With that S wide open, I think fishing here is warranted. E(Y)RA and LA(Y)ER are the other two sim favourites.
>Mike_Ebanks: DEF N11 FE.D +22 211
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILRRS M2 REALIS.R +70 279
#note I thought there was a chance this was phony; the rust is strong.
>Mike_Ebanks: QT 4L Q.T +24 235
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ILNOUY 2J YOU.N +32 311
#note This took far longer to see than it should have, and I still missed OUtLYIN(G).
>Mike_Ebanks: ABJM 1H JAMB +56 291
#note I didn't expect that much pain.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILLTT 5K TI. +17 328
#note I may have the blank, but no way I'm going to open this board.
>Mike_Ebanks: HO K10 HO.. +25 316
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AELLTX 1N EX +29 357
#note Instead of AX because I wanted to save a play ending in AL at row 12.
>Mike_Ebanks: I 11M I. +5 321
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ALLRST 7F .L. +4 361
#note Fishing for STARLIn(G).
>Mike_Ebanks: ?EEIPPT 8A PEEIn. +27 348
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILRST C3 TrAIL.RS +68 429
#note I hit the bingo, but Mike allows me the outbingo anyways. I wanted to play PLAITERS, but given the situation I'll just play this and make sure I win the game 100%.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (PT) +8 437
#note I went -20 this game because my mind went a little nuts making sure I didn't play a phony bingo and blow the game.
