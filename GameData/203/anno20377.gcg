#note This is one of those times I disagree with Quackle. It prefers playing C13 OX for the OXO hook or 13B OX(Y) to set up DOXY, but I just think that's unnecessary. This is a setup which doesn't backfire nearly as much, and even if he takes the spot, I will sometimes receive an even higher point counterplay. It is not as juicy when it works, but it also is a lot less juicy for Joey.

>Morris_Greenberg: ?ENORVX 14A VOX +41 175
#note Quackle suggests VEX instead, since the O becomes really valuable here for OXO. Totally right, I can't believe I missed that.
>Joey_Mallick: EELOSSU K2 LEU.OSES +60 155
#note I held this for awhile, but thought I would only be in bad shape if I challenge at it was valid. It turns out Joey missed the valid higher point play of (C)OLEUSES anyways.

#note FA(I)NT D1 is definitely worth the extra points. I think I was too focused getting rid of 2 Ns.
