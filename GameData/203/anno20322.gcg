#note this is the exact rack cesar had against me during the infamous SWIFFET* game in round 13 of LA in 2014
>John_Luebkemann: ?EIKNNO G3 EINKO.Ns +64 75
#note it seems like he shouldn't bingo here - this gives up a lot of cheap points. maybe either IKON or ON at M3?
>JD: DGRSSUV H1 SURD +28 98
#note hotly contested sim result, very close to GUVS at 10D
>John_Luebkemann: FHO M2 FOH +41 116
>JD: AAEGSVZ N2 AGAZE +61 159
#note I should've at least considered AGAVE - AGAZE is only 2-3 points better on a sim.
>John_Luebkemann: EQU 4D EQU.. +30 146
>JD: EINSSTV 5E IN.S +38 197
#note I was preparing to play INVEST at H10, but I figured that keeping ESTV was an upgrade over just the S and that he wouldn't be able to score cheap points at 5E. but INVEST wins a sim by 5 - quackle thinks I might as well through the board open given that I save an S as my anchoring tile.
>John_Luebkemann: CCENOTT 7C CONT. +10 156
#note his actual rack
>JD: ?ENSTVV -VV +0 197
#note bad choice. there are plenty of lanes, and even if I just play EVE for 6 I'm likely to draw a 70-80 point bingo. by exchanging VV I get rid of the tiles that can make my bingo worth more! Quackle's favorites are NEVE and EVE simming evenly

#note I can fish an L and go for CALAMITE/ROLAMITE (or MELIORATE!) but it seemed smarter to try to go out first.
