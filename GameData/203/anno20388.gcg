#note I have no idea what the correct play is here. I like this. I need to keep the board open and score, and what better way to guarantee scoring by keeping the Z. Lloyd would not expect me to have the Z, so I might be able to score big next turn. It is possible to use up my Z now though with ZA(y)IN or (K)ANZU or 9a NIZAM. I don't know. Maybe ALUMIN instead? or KALIUM?

#note Given that I am 95% sure FUZEED* is invalid, I don't think I should play FUZEE here. It also interfered with the nice and dangerous bingo lane Llloyd created with his last play, which isn't necessarily something I want. I like my play a lot.
>Lloyd_Mills: IMNNOW 5F MINNOW +34 145
#note Lloyd said after the game, after I suggested 8L MOWN, that he had missed AIM and should have played it. Difficult decision here.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEIIOZ 1L ZO.I +69 123
#note Keeping the Z usually pays off. Now I'm in much less trouble, though trouble nonetheless.
>Lloyd_Mills: HO M1 .HO +27 172
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEIPPR 4D BEEP +24 147
#note Especially given that I am not sure of KIPPER's validity. I know how good Lloyd's word knowledge is, so it doesn't seem like a risk I should be taking this early, although it is clearly correct to play KIPPER in hindsight, I would say. 8L REPP plays for points too, and given the closeness of the game that also may be something that makes sense.
>Lloyd_Mills: AIJN D8 .ANJI +32 204
#note Hence KIPPED. This was really bad for me.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACINPQR C12 QI +33 180
>Lloyd_Mills: OS E11 OS +34 238
>Joshua_Sokol: ACLNPRT 8L TRAP +25 205
#note So, TRAP is better than TARP cause it discourages underlaps, but underlaps aren't that bad cause they set up a 7 lane. But what differentiates TALC from TARP/TRAP? The C looks like a better tile to put at O8 than the P, given that there are more bingos starting in C than starting in P. But looking further, there are more words starting with P containing my leave with TRAP than words starting with C containing NPR. So my leave with TRAP looks better than my leave with TALC. But the C is annoying cause many plays I make will close up parts of the board I want open. So I think TALC is a better play for those reasons, although it would seem I draw a bingo more often after TRAP or TARP than after TALC.  NARC keeps a T, and I don't really want that T, it will not help me bingo. There are 4 left to draw anyway. But the other consideration should have been 3B CLAP. Lloyd doesn't look like he a) wants to or b) can really benefit from the L8 hotspot after a play like OS, but maybe that's not too true. He could really have a few different types of leaves. But it looks more than likely he now has one-pointers and maybe another S or blank. CLAP also opens two distinct lanes that aren't going anywhere most of the time. I don't know, this is a difficult turn.

>Joshua_Sokol: ACDELRV 10B VE.D +28 233
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDELRV --  -28 205
#note He now seems likely to have a very good rack. I am in trouble. I saw that I could play VE(N)D at 10B. But I was 100% sure EDDO did not take the S. I was also certain that Lloyd had phenomenal word knowledge. Nevertheless, it seemed like VEND would be my best play by far if gone unchallenged. So I needed to convince myself that either I shouldn't risk it at this point in the game, or that it was a necessary risk to take. Unless Lloyd is 100% sure that EDDOS* is invalid, it doesn't seem that likely he will risk losing a turn, for the sake of 28 points and nothing else special about the play. But it is quite possible that Lloyd is as sure as can be that the word is invalid. The other alternative is CLAVE at 6B. That isn't a terrible play, and it at least sets up a hail-mary type bingo lane that I might need. I don't remember considering it. Given everything, upon my reanalysis, I am no longer certain this was the right play. Therefore, the only way I can decide for myself what the correct move was is by looking at the result, which was that of a failed attempt at stealing a few more points and opportunity to get back in this game. Good challenge, Lloyd.
>Lloyd_Mills: GINORST 14C STORING +72 324
#note Lloyd said afterwards that he was pretty sure EDDOS* was invalid, but what made the risk of challenging worth taking was the fact that he would have had somewhere to put his bingo tiles no matter if he lost his turn or not. Obviously this happened a month ago, so it's kind of hearsay at this point, but I believe that this is what he said to me.

Otherwise, he hesitated to play this knowing that he would be giving me 42 points with the same tiles I was getting rid of last turn.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?AABCDI 10B CA. +16 282
#note ah, well that's fun, I had two playable bingos here, neither of which I was familiar with. It's really a good thing that Lloyd blocked the triple-triple. I would have had a way back in the game with CA(R)ABIDs for 157! The problem is that I would not even have seen it cause I didn't know it. Again, I probably should have just given up at this point

DICAmBA is the other bingo with these tiles, and it plays at 2E. CArABID also plays along that lane.

#note Now Lloyd may very well have a 5th bingo. CHESTED, CRESTED would play with S(CAN), and RETCHES, RETCHED, ETCHERS and CRESTED play at D2. Given that 1) I could see myself drawing into a couple of things and 2) even if I did draw into them Lloyd might still have his own bingo, I allotted to try and reduce his scoring and bingo opportunities as best I could, as well as leave myself with immediate outplays.
