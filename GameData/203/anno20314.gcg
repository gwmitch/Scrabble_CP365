#note This turns out to be about a point better than N(I)L or L(I)N 5C, plays I was initially set on.

>Gunther_Jacobi: EHLLNRR 4C H.RL +7 116
#note LEHR 9I is the star play here. Big miss.
>Chris_Williams: AERU 3B RU.AE +26 137
#note Heavy vowel racks seem to be offering more flexibility on this board than heavy consonant racks.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEELNOR 2E OE +12 128
#note 23.9 eval, Q's top to my surprise. I struggled a long time on this rack, contemplating whether now was the time to play downward to open up the untouched bottom half of the board.

#note Again Q's top. A(PED) J3 comes next.

>Gunther_Jacobi: AELNNOR --  -48 136
#note 3I NO recommended by Q. Believe it or not I wanted to make this play, but couldn't justify fishing off two tiles three turns straight. Again I thought about playing downward, but instead I kind of went a bit berserk, sick of all these duplicate forced fishes...
Don't laugh-

#note This isn't bad, but NO 3I is still preferred.
>Chris_Williams: ??GINSW 13I upSWING +74 275
#note Ooh. jIGSaWN for style or SWe(A)tING SWe(A)rING 9H for a lot of pts. This was recorded as 76pts.

#note Again a mistake with tile distribution while uploading this game. With Chris' UPSWING I wasn't exactly sure which letters he designated as blanks---apparently the I was one of them since Q is telling me there aren't any I's left in the bag. 10 natural I's will appear on this board.
>Gunther_Jacobi: EEGNORT 11C GENRO +14 248
#note Missing GON(IFF)!
>Chris_Williams: AETUXZ 10B ZA +34 411
#note GAUZE says Q.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ET J10 ET +14 262
#note A very frustrating game for me. It all begins with missing LEHR, then failing to fish a third time with NO, playing a phony and also not attempting to open the bottom of the board sooner. All those mistakes compounded will result in a sub 300 game. We had the final recorded as 414-283.
