>JD: DEHOOTZ J10 HOOD +33 99
#note I thought that this S hook would come in handy at some point. however I missed the all star play of DOZENTH which is a hard find
>Maddy_Kamen: LMO E11 MOL +20 184
>JD: BEEPSTZ L4 ZEP +34 133
#note clearly wrong, BONZE way better since leave better and ZEP blocks my own S hook. didn't see it.

#note best is to play ICE at 13A
>JD: BIIKL B2 KI. +18 471
