#note This game wasn't held directly after the last one, but rather the next morning, so I should have had ample time to recover from the loss I had against Larry the past night.
>Joshua_Sokol: DDHIKOT E4 KITH.D +28 28
>Larry_Sherman: ENNY D8 .ENNY +23 51
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEMNOV 11B VE.OM +20 48
#note Too bad VENOMED didn't play. Besides this there seem to be 3 other moves to consider. 2 of them are aggressive ones; EVO(K)ED 4B and MOVE C12. MOVE scores 5 more than VENOM with the same tiles, and arguably suits my leave a tad better than VENOM does. On the other hand, it seems needlessly dangerous to put the E in such a friendly spot. I think I prefer the control of VENOM. EVOKED would be fantastic if I had my own R for R(EVOKED). But I don't, and Larry is relatively likely to have his own, so I think it is also a needlessly dangerous play to make. Although the control it grants in the short term, minus the R hook, seems decent. It paralyzes two nice floaters. The last play is VENOMED, which I was flipflopping in my head with VENOM. I ultimately decided the far superior leave of DEN was worth 6 points here over just N.
>Larry_Sherman: HILPRST H2 PHILTR.S +64 115
#note PHILTERS is also a word, and scores 3 more. EVOKED is looking great in hindsight...
>Joshua_Sokol: DEILNNU 2H .INNULED +76 124
>Joshua_Sokol: DEILNNU --  -76 48
#note Massive fail here. I didn't think UNLINED was valid even though it seemed like it had come up before. I just misremembered its validity. Also, I didn't think INDULINE was a word. I did on the other hand think this was... Brutal mistake
>Larry_Sherman: EZ C9 ZE. +47 162
>Joshua_Sokol: DEILNNU 4A UNLI.E +22 70
#note the other two still play... I should have talked myself into UNLINED.
>Larry_Sherman: FOT A1 TOF. +21 183
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDDINO 2F BI.OD +20 90
#note Maybe hope for a challenge with HODDIN? Otherwise it seems like I might need to score more and DA(N)IO accomplishes that at B2. But I think this has to be better, setting up a good lane for myself that can't really get blocked a lot of the time. One of the reasons it's a bad idea to put a tile one down from a triple when in the lead. Fork fork fork!

#note Still in it, but I always miss GOlDARN...
>Larry_Sherman: GIJO M3 JI.GO +28 283
#note hoping Larry doesn't know JINGO doesn't take an S.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEIV B11 .IVA +20 246
#note Would've been great to have written down my rack here since this is a really interesting position, but I forgot. I just needed to set up a dangerous lane with what I had and not fall too far behind. That was my logic, not that this is the right play cause I don't know. 
>Larry_Sherman: ILLM 12F MILL +13 322
>Joshua_Sokol: EINOQTU 14B .NTIQUE +36 282
#note Do I really fish here? There are still three S's out and I need at least one of them. Where will my bingos go if I hit my fish? Only ANTIQUE, (A)NTIQUED or (A)NTIQUER look like fishes I can hit... Still that's 6 hits out of 19. Unfortunately it looks like I need more than a small score and a bingo to win this one, which is why I opted to score and hope Larry has another awkward rack. Doesn't look like he has the X so maybe I can hope to draw that.
>Larry_Sherman: AEERRSS J9 ERASERS +68 390
#note Scored as 66
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEOOSU H11 B.U.D +24 306
#note -10 to 15J (S)OUSED and worse than a few other plays. I was probably low on time.
>Larry_Sherman: ACORUX 1D COAX +29 419
#note -11 to 2N XU, the play I expected
>Joshua_Sokol: EOOS 14J .OOSE +10 316
#note Unfortunately I couldn't see that he didn't have an out with his tiles besides (O)UR at 7M, so I should have played (O)E for 2 and kept S(H)OO 3G for the next turn.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (RU) +4 320
#note Bad mistakes early on cost me the game here.
