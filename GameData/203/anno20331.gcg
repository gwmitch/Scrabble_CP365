#note tight sim between a lot of different plays including NILL and HALL.

#note interesting. quackle doesn't like this play one bit. I figured he was liable to destroy me on column O next turn, but quackle thinks that if I play HENNA (my best play) then I'm not really doing any worse defensively, and I give up a whopping 10 points per turn.

#note even though the blank is in the bag, it seemed like time to prolong the game as long as possible. this way I fish for STORAGE on row 2 and below. quackle may not be much use, since Morris is surely blocking all the way from here. quackle's other reasonable suggestions include GUV at F12, GAZOOS and 9C OUTGO. OUTGO seems like he could just play at D8 downward and block, but it does leave the H and row 2 open.
>Morris_Greenberg: CI O1 .IC +8 289
>JD: ADGORST 9F D. +3 223
#note now I'm in business. I played the D because it's much harder for him to hook than the G. I can hit STORAGE 2x2 or ORGIAST or something. potentially I could even fish multiple times.

>JD: ?DIMPRT 2L M.D. +24 333
#note yay, I have the blank! blocking the lane on row 2 sucks, but it's also my only decent scoring play

#note the moment of truth - I really need a bingo on this turn. TRIPLIES# would do it in CSW but TRIPOLIS doesn't fit in TWL.
>Morris_Greenberg: ADEEORV 8A ROVE. +27 398
#note morris actually missed OVERDEAR on this turn, but his play looks good enough...
>JD: ?AELTTW D1 WAlLE. +26 395
#note ahhhhhhhh. I only had one minute, and I blew a fabulous chance to win - all I have to do is find WETTED/DADO at D4, and Morris's only winning play becomes ARDEB at B2!!!!! this very well may have cost me the tournament. under time pressure, I could not come up with anything better.
