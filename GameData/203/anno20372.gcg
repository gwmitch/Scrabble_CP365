#note Taking a chance that Wayne doesn't know the extensions.



>Wayne_Clifford: AGG E8 .AGG +12 12
>Matthew_Larocque: BEILOSW 12A BLOWS +33 105
#note I always miss this one! I wanted to play 7B BOW,  but the 16 extra points seemed liked it would be worth it. 80 points would have been more worth it.
>Wayne_Clifford: HOO 13B OHO +29 41
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIILST F6 LI.E +11 116
#note Lol, I kept thinking to myself that I was close to having LITANIES. Matt, you doofus. Also, either (G)IE is probably better for the leave.
>Wayne_Clifford: UUUUYY -UUUUYY +0 41
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIISTU 6F .IEU +4 120
#note This is what happens when you miss too many bingos.
>Wayne_Clifford: ABO 14A ABO +26 67
>Matthew_Larocque: EILSSTT 10C TE.S +17 137
#note I wish I had known NERVING took the S. (WO)ST scores 17 and sheds both duplicates. Even just playing (WO)S is cool to set up one of my tees. I was also worried about that corner, so IS for 18 seemed like a good choice. In hindsight, I like IS more than my play now.
>Wayne_Clifford: DE 15A DE +24 91
#note Lucky that wasn't worse.
>Matthew_Larocque: EILNSTU J1 LUNIEST +68 205
#note I can use my extension now, but I have to play this bingo....
>Wayne_Clifford: AEISZ 1J .AZIES +75 166
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAORTW -  +0 205
#note 75 points, LAZY as either a noun or verb seemed to sound too silly so I challenged.
>Wayne_Clifford: ADEIU K7 ADIEU +14 180
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAORTW J9 AW +28 233
>Wayne_Clifford: IN 8A IN....... +36 216
#note No fooling Wayne.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAORTT 5E ROTA +21 254
#note AORTA(E), which was also an option last turn.
>Wayne_Clifford: ACPR L4 CRAP +21 237
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEIRT M7 AIRDATE +77 331
#note AIRDATE seems to give me trouble so I'm glad I found it this time, it's a lot better than playing RADIATE!
>Wayne_Clifford: HI 2N HI +22 259
#note Wayne holds for some time, not sure if it was the bingo or TAPA.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEFNOT L11 TED +18 349
#note My original play was OF in the same spot, but *OT kind of foiled that plan. I wasn't sure what to do and I missed my last letter. I wanted to make a play that didn't take the S to keep things more closed but don't think I was able to do that here.
>Wayne_Clifford: F 8M .F +5 264
#note This was after I showed him my F!
>Matthew_Larocque: EFNORY O8 FERNY +72 421
#note I put my F down and said sorry.
>Wayne_Clifford: KO -  +0 264
#note THAT'S NOT A WORD! IFFFFFFFFFFFFF!
>Matthew_Larocque: JMOOQ 4B MOJO +28 449
#note Despite my lucky fortune, I'm still going to end this game in facepalm mode. At this point I noticed I have two Q dumps so I can afford to play MOJO for now. And I missed this rack which defeats the purpose of analysing this in first place....
>Wayne_Clifford: KO 4H KO. +24 288
>Matthew_Larocque: CLNQTXY C3 C.X +24 473
#note It hasn't registered yet that he took out one of the QI spots, so I need to dump it right now. 
>Wayne_Clifford: ?EIMRUV A7 V.M +8 296
#note I HOPE THE Q WAS THE LAST LETTER IN THE BAG *EVIL LAUGHTER*!!!!!!!
>Matthew_Larocque: LNPQTY C3 ...Y +16 489
>Matthew_Larocque: LNPQTY --  -16 473
#note GET THAT CRAP OFF THE BOARD. GIVE ME SOME CREDIT HERE! Sorry Wayne, I had to try it, and you DID challenge IFF earlier.....
>Wayne_Clifford: ?EIRU 5B E. +13 309
>Matthew_Larocque: LNPQTY 2I P.N +7 480
#note I should just play (U)N since Wayne is clearly going for the moral victory in slow playing my Q stick as much as he possibly can.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?IRU 2I ...a +15 324
>Matthew_Larocque: LQTY O1 ..LT +5 485
#note I  should play something like L(EX) but my time was getting low.
>Wayne_Clifford: IRU 9A .U +6 330
>Matthew_Larocque: QY O1 ....Y +8 493
>Wayne_Clifford: IR 5J .R. +6 336

#note That was fun.
