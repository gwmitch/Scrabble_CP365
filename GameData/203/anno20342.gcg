#note ***NOTE***: This game was played with the first PROTOTYPE of the IOWS (IOWS-EN001), a word source proposal derived from Wiktionary.  I'm providing it for amusement and to highlight a few known issues with the prototype.
#note Oh come on, all those new words and it starts with that?!?  Well at least I can mention that QIN# and QING* are also there.
>paulsid: AADGGIS 9F GID +21 21
#note GAG 7F sims best.  Ack, I forgot about AQ* despite having put it on my "watch" list of potential invalid words.  GI# I of course know.

#note Elise likes FYVE#, or some parallels with GUE#.

>paulsid: ?EFLOPS N6 FLOpPE.S +76 120
#note POLYSELF* is defined as "transformation of one's own character into another type of creature" (in video games).  FLOPSY* is another interesting word.  Elise prefers either of those to my bingo.
>Elise_0.1.8: ABIIIOR O4 BOIAR +43 122
#note A variant of BOYAR.
>paulsid: EMNNPTT 11C PENT +25 145
#note MEYNT# or TYMP#, but this is OK.

#note Time remaining on clock: [17:35.29]
>paulsid: AEJMNRT 12A JEAN +54 199
#note This is okay but JAM/YEM* or IJMA*/JS* are better.  (In the prototype all the letters take S's; this is on the cleanup TODO list).  Also JAYET#, JEAT# just behind.
>Elise_0.1.8: ADEFHIX K5 ADFIX +53 241
#note A linguistic term.  DD* is there because of dd, the common Unix command.  (This is an excellent example of why some human editing will be needed.)
>paulsid: EMRSTTU 13E SMUTT.ER +65 264
#note Nothing better, surprisingly.

#note Time remaining on clock: [11:43.00]
>paulsid: CCEITUW 1H WITC. +39 303
#note This is best; CUTCH or CWTCH# are a few points back.

>paulsid: CEKMOOU I4 COOK +35 338
#note Wow, WITCHUCK* woulda been awesome.  It's an old term for a type of swallow (bird).  OOM# or COOM# also good on row 14.  Or MOBO*, which means motherboard - I'm a computer guy so I know that!  Lastly KOMBU - hey I learned a new TWL word!  My play is down the list a bit.
>Elise_0.1.8: ALLNOST 2C STALLON +66 373
#note A variant of CION, although the citation given is from the *1913* Webster's!
>paulsid: EMRRUWZ 1A WURM +45 383
>paulsid: EMRRUWZ --  -45 338
#note I get deseprate and decide to try a word I've heard before.  I knew the dubious twos RS* and MT* were good (they're on my "issues" list).  Sadly it's not in there.  WUZ*/ZS*.  Or I shoulda seen REZ#/ZS* at least.  ZUBR* is an interesting choice too, it's a type of bison.

>paulsid: EMRRUWZ 13A .RM +26 364
#note Ugh, I got distracted and didn't see the bag was empty.  Elise is suggesting all sorts of cheap R-dump plays for some reason, but MEW M2 (yes IOWS has EW*) or KIFE*/GIM* seem reasonable.
>Elise_0.1.8: ?NOOUV 14E gUV +19 434
#note SG* is an abbreviation that's improperly-tagged, but UV* is actually listed as a slangy variant of "of", although the citations given might be dubious.
>paulsid: ERUWZ E1 ..ZER +28 392
#note Hey, I took a flyer and guessed right.  ZE*/HSE* is best.  BOTH are listed as gender-neutral pronouns.  I've seen several of those, XE* being the one I'm most familiar with, so they are probably variants.  ZE* is also listed as the comical "thick accent" version of "the".
>Elise_0.1.8: NOO M7 ONO +14 448
#note I think I did pretty well for not knowing probably like 9/10th of the words!  :-)
>Elise_0.1.8:  (UW) +10 458
