>Joshua_Sokol: EEGIRUW -EGIUW +0 0
#note Just to be clear (I think I'm emulating Winter here), I don't believe in complaining about my tiles. Even if it seems that I am making fabulous plays all game and just not winning. That being said, should I just play through this rack with WIG? 
>Lloyd_Mills: GIINSTT 8F SITTING +70 70
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEKNOR 7E OAK +25 25
#note Just like last game against Lloyd I feel forced to think hard about this turn. OAK forks the board in the best way, I think, leaving all quadrants up for grabs. My leave is decent for the board as well.
>Lloyd_Mills: EMOSTTT J3 TOTEM.ST +64 134
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEINRR I6 RE.AINER +73 98
>Lloyd_Mills: ACILLOR 12B ROCAILL. +72 206
#note oh noes, did Lloyd miss CLI(T)ORAL or did he just have a great reason to pass it up? Perhaps he didn't want to leave easy points for me in two spots? Seems like that's a good idea though, since he can hit one of the spots.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABIIUWZ K4 WAB +30 128
#note It worked for me relatively well last game, I should probably keep my Z this time around as well. Neither BAIZ(AS) nor 11E ZA leave me with anything to score with next turn. Maybe this was an oversight?
>Lloyd_Mills: ORY H12 .ORY +23 229
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIIUVZ 14D VIZI. +37 165
#note It seemed better to play VIZIR where I played it because it left more lanes open, but either VIZIR closes a quadrant and immediately closes lanes. It's probably more in my interest to leave the R and the Y open and make the top left harder to close by sticking a V at B8. This was a mistake.

>Joshua_Sokol: EGNNNOU --  -16 165
#note so last game against Lloyd I was in a very similar position. My options were slowly disappearing and I was down a lot. The only play that seemed worth making was a plausible phony. Last time it was EDDOS*, this time it was UNGON(E)* D1. I was quite sure it was invalid, but it seemed very risky for Lloyd to challenge, given that if he does not, he virtually always wins the game, and if he does, there is a chance that it's valid and I can 3x3. The biggest issue in plausibility is that GUENON makes UNGONE* very unlikely to be valid. So, yeah, I did it again and I stand by it, but in hindsight B9 NEU(R)ON is the play, I guess. Maybe I exchange again, actually. Who knows

#note now there is really no reason I should play through this, unless there is a fish I'm not seeing
>Lloyd_Mills: BDO M2 BOD +30 355
>Joshua_Sokol: EHMOQTX 10B Q.T +32 197
#note Oh wow. A simulation suggests I2 HEM for 23, hoping for QUIXOTE/T(HEM) or something crazy like that next turn. That is a fascinating play. It may be correct at this point
>Lloyd_Mills: EGOU L8 .OUGE +14 369
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EHMNOX M11 OXEN +34 231
#note Not knowing HEXONE is really really costly. D1 HEXON(E) is by all means the correct play here.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEEHMN 3C vEHEMEN. +82 313
#note Well, I got one down. All is not lost.
>Lloyd_Mills: DFU 2F FUD +35 432
#note uh, nevermind. All is indeed lost
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILSSU N1 SAU +20 333
>Lloyd_Mills: FIR 4D FIR +33 465
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEILNS 13M .L +2 335
#note You do not want to see me miss SNAILED, but you will. For some reason, I have had trouble with ADEILNS in the past. I immediately see DENIALS, and I think there is another, but no other order of letters seems to come up/make sense. SN is just really not what I'm thinking about. No excuses. Not that I will win if I play it. Here I was hoping to draw O1 INSTEAD.
