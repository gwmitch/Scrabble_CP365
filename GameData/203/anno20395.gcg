>Joshua_Sokol: HIINNOW H5 WINO +14 14
#note I am sacrificing 6 points here, since keeping a more balanced leave looks worth it here. INO looks like it can be great sometimes, but lots more times it can really mess up my flow! Although the six points factor is kind of overwhelming, hmm. WHIN also looks better for keeping the board under control. Interesting dilemma to start things off.

>Joshua_Sokol: CEIKNRU I2 UNC.RK +40 79
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIKNRU --  -40 39
#note I don't know why I persisted to think that HINK* was valid, even after annotated game number 19854 in which I learned it to not be so. I also missed KAMI. It took Sal a while to challenge though, and he didn't even challenge UNCORK!
>Sal_Piro: UW L3 WU. +14 51
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIKNRU E4 ICK +28 67
#note I really really need to sharpen my knowledge and vision of short words. RUCK and SLEW are the newest bunch to destroy the idea that I know all of the 4s.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?CLNOOU D1 CO.L +22 133
#note Missing COLONUs! M1 COON is also a better play than this
>Sal_Piro: AELNORS 10A LOANERS +69 212
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABENOU A4 BEANO +44 177
#note Missing D8 NA(N)OtUBE. Need to keep the board open I think, so it's a better play than forgoing the bingo.
>Sal_Piro: AMX 11C MAX +48 260
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EITTUV F10 .IVET +23 200
#note probably score now, worry about opening the board later? 1D (C)IVET may be an improvement.

#note stopped recording my racks here, guess I was frustrated! This is just guesswork
>Sal_Piro: DHI G13 HID +22 339
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEJRT M2 JET +32 253
#note I think I remember seeing (D)EJEcTA keeping R. If I wanted to blow my blank I should play J(E)T(W)Ay at 3I!
>Sal_Piro: BGO N1 GOB +38 377
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEFY 15G .EFrAY +48 301
#note I might have missed DEFY... I think I have to score as much as possible here to win after his next score, which will probably be a lot? 
>Sal_Piro: OOS A12 .OOS +39 416
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFLPRR L11 FERR. +22 323
#note again, just guessing my rack. I don't think I can win
