>Morris_Greenberg: AEIIORS 8G OI +4 4
#note MG: Note that I forgot my scoresheets from the last day in the playing room, so these racks are being recalled from memory (so there may be some mistakes). I should trade here, two vowel openings aren't a good idea (bingo percentage goes up by 5%). My logic at the time was that OI doesn't allow Jesse to score that much if he doesn't have a bingo, and he seemed to be having the tempo all tournament so a chance to slow him down might be a good idea.
>JD: GILLNOZ G7 Z.O +23 23
#note JD: this has a 36% bingo percentage next turn, saving OIL and ZOON hooks. nothing sims even close.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEEIORS 7G .OEA +16 20
>JD: GHILLNN K5 HILL +28 51
#note JD: tight sim between a lot of different plays including NILL and HALL.
>Morris_Greenberg: EEIRSTY L4 YE +15 35
#note MG: I chose this over (ZOO)EY and YE/(HILL)Y to leave more bingo lines open. I am close to one, and Jesse doesn't seem as close. Quackle prefers ZOOEY though.
>JD: AGLNNNN 6J L.NN +16 67
#note JD: sometimes life gives you 4 Ns but also gives you a decent play with them
>Morris_Greenberg: EFINRST 10G SNIFTER +81 116
#note JD: he missed FERNINST for 6 more.
>JD: ABGHNNO M9 B.OGAN +24 91
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EEOSUX N13 XU +31 147
#note MG: A bit bold, but hey, I'm playing for a tournament here! Go bold or go home!
>JD: AEEHNNO O12 NENE +28 119
#note JD: interesting. quackle doesn't like this play one bit. I figured he was liable to destroy me on column O next turn, but quackle thinks that if I play HENNA (my best play) then I'm not really doing any worse defensively, and I give up a whopping 10 points per turn.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EEOPST 15G TOuPEES +87 234
#note MG: I was choosing between PEyOTES and TOuPEES here. Negligible difference, though Quackle digs my choice.
>JD: AAHIOQR 9I QI +47 166
>Morris_Greenberg: ACIIJOV M1 JIAO +27 261
#note MG: I might've made up this rack, though I remember being happy landing the C and V to block the board with a lead at some point. If this is right, VIA M2 is probably a bit safer.
>JD: AAHORRU 1K RA.AH +48 214
>Morris_Greenberg: CFGIMUV 14F VUG +20 281
#note MG: Interesting. Quackle likes this most, but only slightly more than GUV N3. It's like it is psychic or something for Jesse's next play!
>JD: AGORSTU 4L ..U +6 220
#note JD: even though the blank is in the bag, it seemed like time to prolong the game as long as possible. this way I fish for STORAGE on row 2 and below. quackle may not be much use, since Morris is surely blocking all the way from here. quackle's other reasonable suggestions include GUV at F12, GAZOOS and 9C OUTGO. OUTGO seems like he could just play at D8 downward and block, but it does leave the H and row 2 open.
>Morris_Greenberg: CFIIMVW O1 .IC +8 289
#note MG: Good job to Jesse for making me play a -12 equity play midgame and it is still the best option.
>JD: ADGORST 9F D. +3 223
#note now I'm in business. I played the D because it's much harder for him to hook than the G. I can hit STORAGE 2x2 or ORGIAST or something. potentially I could even fish multiple times.
>Morris_Greenberg: EFIMVWY 13G MEW +27 316
#note MG: I can't even block! This looks fine, though another interesting (but very ballsy) option is playing WIFE or WIVE 2H. If Jesse's bingo that he's fishing for doesn't end in an A or O, that gives him a whole lot to think about with not that much time. I prefer my play, but boy, that would have made for a crazy rest of the game.
>JD: AEGORST E5 STORAGE +86 309
#note JD: there we go
>Morris_Greenberg: CFIKUVY D11 FUCK +31 347
#note MG: Hey Jesse, this is what my thoughts are when you double-double me without the blank.

JD: Hey now
>JD: ?DIMPRT 2L M.D. +24 333
#note JD: yay, I have the blank! blocking the lane on row 2 sucks, but it's also my only decent scoring play
>Morris_Greenberg: BDEITVY 6B BIT.Y +24 371
#note MG: I was choosing between BIT(T)Y and DIVE(R) here. I thought in the end, this just cut his bingo % so much more that it was worth taking less points and leaving the higher point spot open (39% for DIVER, 28% for BITTY). Quackle gives me 57% winning percentage here. I actually think it is higher, because I am almost certainly playing at 8A for a 30ish point play next turn if Jesse doesn't bingo right now, to really seal the game.
>JD: ?ILPRST 15A RIPS +36 369
#note JD: the moment of truth - I really need a bingo on this turn. TRIPLIES# would do it in CSW but TRIPOLIS doesn't fit in TWL.
>Morris_Greenberg: ADEEORV 8A ROVE. +27 398
#note JD: morris actually missed OVERDEAR on this turn, but his play looks good enough...
>JD: ?AELTTW D1 WAlLE. +26 395
#note JD: ahhhhhhhh. I only had one minute, and I blew a fabulous chance to win - all I have to do is find WETTED/DADO at D4, and Morris's only winning play becomes ARDEB at B2!!!!! this very well may have cost me the tournament. under time pressure, I could not come up with anything better.
>Morris_Greenberg: AADDEIR 1C A.ARDED +36 434
>JD: TT 2C T.T +7 402
>JD:  (I) +2 404
