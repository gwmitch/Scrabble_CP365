#note Pretty weird amongst top players, but not really.  Maybe a little bit too inattentive to equity?

#note Definitely too much of an equity sacrifice.  DUO or OURIE is much more typical: this seems like too much to entropy too quickly at close scores.  Definitely worth noting and playing at a higher than normal entropy (note that this does not necessarily mean more open)

>Player_1: AEKOPRU 6F PEAK +35 242
#note He's definitely going for a column 5 overlap next turn, but this is crazy: there are so many ways this can backfire by a simple setup.  This is a pretty constant theme with player 1: they really don't give opponents enough credit for setups and good board-opening plays.
>Opponent: AACINST D4 SATANIC +78 242
>Player_1: AEMNORU 8A MUO. +18 260
#note Way too fishy and bingo-centric.  This isn't really a good play either: Player 1's strategy really seems too centered on building a lead and then closing the board.  Stop this from happening and you probably are a big favorite against player 1.
>Opponent: ?EGIILR 4A GrI.LIER +61 303
>Player_1: AEGNORV 12A GROVE +25 285
#note GROVE seems nuts.  Something like OVA is much better, or something that limits entropy much better.  It seems like despite trying to close the board all game, Player 1 doesn't really know what to do when behind on a closed board.
>Opponent: DHLORTW 13G W.T +31 334
>Player_1: ADMNRTU L1 MURA +28 313
#note This isn't very good either.  What are you hoping for with this play?  Vowels are scarce, and the best way to catch up is getting a high scoring tile or sticking your opponent with junk.

>Opponent: DLLORST M7 STROD. +31 396
>Player_1: ACEINTZ 1D ZINCATE +139 486
#note It seems pretty conclusive: Player 1's strategy is to get a lead and close the board.  Rather than fight it, just make setups and get in position to make setups, and let player 1 take the risks to bingo first: they probably won't work out.  Rather than leave the board open, you actually want to let Player 1 take these risks: it seems they don't really know what they are doing on closed boards and they don't really manage leaves all that well, so you want to encourage technical positions on boards that can potentially be closed.  Player 1 is good at closing the board structurally but bad at dealing with setups and managing leaves, so you really want to get in a position where these mistakes will get punished, which means creating boards with bingo lines and high long term board entropy.
