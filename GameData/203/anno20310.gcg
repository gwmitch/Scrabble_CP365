#note after I took about 3-4 minutes on this move conrad asked me if I was collins confused...but actually the sim is very close with NOVAE at 1A (saving easy X points) and AXON at 1L which I didn't look at, but which saves GROVE/GLOVE or plays on row 1 for more easy points. all within a point on the sim.
