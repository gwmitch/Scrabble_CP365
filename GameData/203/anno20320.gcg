>Evans_Clinchy: ACEMNRS -M +0 0
#note Pleased to see this sim best - ACENRS hits a seven with anything out of CDEHIKLNOPSTUVYZ?. In other words, 68/93 of the unseen tiles.

#note It's a verb, dummy. HERYED# for 9 more.

>Evans_Clinchy: DEOUVVW 14A VOWED +32 168
#note Three plays worth considering here - there's VROUW 10J, which is the straightforward equity play, VROU#, which sets up WAVED/WIVED for 59, and VOWED. Quackle likes VROUW, which doesn't surprise me, but I've been trying to teach myself to stop playing like that. Turns the game into a luckboxy race to the next S, which is a really unnecessary gambit at this point. VROU# is a tiny score now for a ploy that isn't guaranteed to work later. VOWED seemed like the safest bet of the three.

#note I misscored this as 54 instead of its rightful 52. Edited the game to reflect this because it turns out to be quite relevant.
>John_O'Laughlin: DEEMPRR H1 REPR. +24 338
>Evans_Clinchy: AABGINN 3L BANG +19 409
#note This is probably not the best idea. I figured BANG was decent enough since 19 was enough points to maybe outrun a potential bingo, and I'm also obscuring some possible plays in row 2. But he still has plenty of bingo options, so it might be better just to play BEGINNE# N9 for 27 and outrun harder.

#note I thought PIGHT# was a word but I wasn't 100 percent sure and didn't think I needed to risk it. SPOILER ALERT I NEEDED TO
>John_O'Laughlin: DEEJNRW M7 JEW. +26 371
>Evans_Clinchy: AAGOPTT C7 GAPO +17 465
#note ...aaaaaaaaand, I blow the game. I went through the pool and found all the possible bingos and decided none of them could beat me, so I just blocked this line because it was the most dangerous. Except I missed REDLINER, and I didn't realize I could just block everything with POTTAGE 2B until two seconds after hitting my clock. Ergo: I suck suck suck suck suck.
>John_O'Laughlin: DEEILNR 1A REDLINE. +80 451
#note ...and thusly I end up with a tie that should have been a loss. Lucky me, I guess?
