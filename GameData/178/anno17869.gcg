>Evans_Clinchy: FLLLOQU 8D QUOLL +48 48
#note I needed not to lose by 193 to hold onto the tournament. I flipped over my first seven tiles to reveal: Q... L, L, L... O... F. Sudden freakout, like omigod I'm actually going to lose this. Then finally the U and the sigh of relief and the big opening play.

>Scott_Jackson: AMNRTVZ J1 TZAR. +34 70
>Evans_Clinchy: AELOWWY 1F OWEL.Y +36 156
#note Wanted to block the triple because of the whole "don't lose by 193" thing. This works OK, but WETLY in the same spot looks a bit better.
>Scott_Jackson: ?EEMNOV 2B EnVENOM +89 159
#note VENOMER/VENOMED are 100, OVERMEN is 101. oh noes

#note This sims second behind ZAPATA#, which is insane given the situation.

#note didn't know EINE#. too bad I can't get MEUNIERE down
>Evans_Clinchy: ADGPRTU 4L UP +20 303
#note Either this or PIG looks good for blocking up this area.
>Scott_Jackson: EINORUY F10 YOU +30 276
>Evans_Clinchy: ACDGRST I8 SCART +25 328
#note I thought playing in this area would work well for limiting potential bingos in both lines (I and 13). Sim says I have the right idea - SCRAG in the same spot is best.
>Scott_Jackson: EIINRRT 10I .IR +5 281
>Evans_Clinchy: CDEGHIS K8 HE.DIC +24 352
#note After his fish, I need to block somehow. HERDIC leaves him a spot to bingo, but he may well only have a low-scoring one that offers me counterplay to a TWS, so I can probably still hold on for a win. The best play is CHIDES 13H for 47 making SCARTH#, which I saw but wasn't sure of.

#note Eh, let him have his bingo, he's earned it.
