>Jason: EHIV 8G HIVE +20 20
#note So I'm 4-4 and I have Jason, Bernard, and Judy left to play in the round robin to start day 2. Of course I draw the hardest opponent first. I had never beaten Jason live in a tournament of even a casual game before this in something like 6 tries. 
>Chris: AACENRU F6 ARC +20 20
#note I wanted to play defense, but I should be fishing with VAU instead. Thought of this and ARCANE and decided on this but ARCANE is simming 2% better. Even though I kept the N I didn't think of the NARC hook. First play and Jason is in my head already :|
>Jason: IORSZ K4 ZORIS +42 62
>Chris: AAEGINU L2 UNAI +32 52
#note Autopiloted this but GAUZE is pretty clearly better. Q likes fishing with just ZA keeping GUINEA too but I rarely make plays like that and I underestimated the openness of the board since I was blind to NARC.
>Jason: HIOR 2J HO.RI +32 94
>Chris: AEGJOSY 1H JOEY +52 104
>Jason: EG M2 .EG +25 119
>Chris: AAGLNSS N4 SAG +22 126
#note This makes my remaining S less potent and sets up an O I don't have. It sims even with LAGANS 5B, which I would've played if I'd seen it since it doesn't have those drawbacks. 
>Jason: ACEEMNT 5B CEMENTA +78 197
#note I held this even though it's about 5k probability because I'm a bad player. I didn't challenge like a bad player though. 
>Chris: ELNQSSW 4C NEW +27 153
#note  Rejected WEN/WE C4 since they gave the scoring spot at C3. Thought of fishing with QI H7 but figured that I could draw QI N1 for 44 maybe if I kept it. 
>Jason: ADEIRTT B5 .ITRATED +65 262
#note Luckbox Li
>Chris: FLPQSSU J7 P.LF +21 174
#note Well, my Q looks better now! PELF opens a hard-to-block S hook and keeps some life in the game.
>Jason: ABT 8A B.AT +21 283
>Chris: ?BOQSSU O5 BOSQUeS +108 282
#note Booooom! Scored as 107 though hehe
>Jason: OORT 3B TORO +25 308
>Chris: ADEENPT N10 PANED +39 321
#note Considered PANTED and PANED and decided that opening the triple spot wasn't worth the extra points. The sim is liking PATED > PATED because EN > ET apparently even with no T's left. 
>Jason: EIMNV M11 VIMEN +39 347
#note He laid down VI and picked it up again at first. I was pretty sure he'd play VIM, which would have been awesome for me since it would have given me DEXY L12 for 52! 
>Chris: DEGLTXY A12 EDGY +34 355
#note Considered EDGY A12 and YET L12. YET was appealing since FKW are still out and any of them going at L12 really hurts my winning chances. However, the leave after YET is too horrible and the F and W fit at A11 too. 
>Jason: DOU 2A OUD +17 364
#note I was really happy to avoid a 40 point play from Jason here.
>Chris: FIILLTX C8 .XIL +40 395
#note Gotta play this here and hope for the best...
>Jason: OU 10J .OU +6 370
>Chris: AEFIKLT 15A .AK +10 405
#note So I had 4 minutes here. I knew that Jason didn't have the W on his FOU rack, so he had a 2/3 chance to draw it. I figured that with this 25 point lead, scoring 46 for KEF was pretty irrelevant since any bingo after that still wins for him. I ende up panicking and switching my play from KEF to YAK 15C to block the G and Y with about 30 seconds left and hitting my clock. I spent most of that time looking for a 6 at H15 since any 6 there pretty much blocks everything, but amazingly there aren't any playable.  I missed the really nice A(U)KLET for 46, which I should've played (that or KEF), since they block possible 9's through ME and ED for Jason and save spread in the cases I'm screwed anyway.
>Jason: ?AEILNR H8 .NERtIAL +71 441
#note So yeah i draw the W and lose hehe. Jason pointed out after the game that with his leave, a WR draw gave him INTERWAR and only a LW draw loses for him. Therefore, I had a 1/3 shot to win once he plays FOU and leaves AEIL?.
>Jason:  (EFILTW) +24 465
#note Final score recorded as 465-404.
