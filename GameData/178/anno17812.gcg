>Matt_Canik: EFGIRVY 10A VERIFY +39 210
#note VERIFY (39) and FIERY (41) were my two options here. VER(S)IFY (36) is also a decent play. VERIFY is winning a sim here.

>Matt_Canik: AELRRSV M12 .V.R +14 245
#note This was a really hard turn. VAR(V)E and EVER are the only two plays that really make sense here. Holding the last S, I think I've got a really goodchance to get a bingo down after EVER. Sim agrees: 61.5%. But nonetheless, it has VARVE about 2.5 points ahead.

#note Okay I missed the AELRS bingo last turn, but surely I'll hit it here...

>Matt_Canik: AEHLLRS 13C ..LL +6 281
#note I think I sort of need to fish here, but maybe I should just play L(EVER). I draw a playable bingo with D, E, I, M, T, U, W. That's 14/22 draws. Jim is likely to try and block something, though. 
>Jim_Burlant: EEY 15J EYE. +21 364
#note This is an awesome fit at B4. I noticed BEGONE but not BYGONE. 
>Matt_Canik: AEHIRST 8K .AIRE +48 329
#note ZAIRE sims above bingoing with WATERISH, but (Z)A sims above both plays. Without the G or P, Jim is going to have a really touh time addressing that spot.

#note Guessing from Jim's reaction to his draw that he doesn't have the Q. 
-
I can't find a single worthwhile fish here that gives me chances to bingo out. 
-
I decided to play OW and try to play for a Q-stick. It's a long shot, but I think it's the only shot I'd have. I'm hoping that he'll have the U, assume that he's safe if he draws the Q, and not notice the trap I'm setting. I can block N10 QIS next turn and stick him, saving my S for 15A. 
-
Again, this is a big long shot but I just can't find anything else. 
>Jim_Burlant: OW E13 .OW +10 395
#note But my one-tile draw was the Q, and he blocks QATS for 51 even though I just telegraphed that I didn't have the Q. 
it's just so annoying that he SHOULD have drawn the Q and eaten it here after this play, but it works out to be completely right for the wrong reason. Even if he draws the Q it's his game, but I can at least make it a lot closer.
