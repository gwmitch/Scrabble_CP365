>Matt_Canik: EEEHNTU H6 HUE +12 12
#note ETHENE and HUE are options. HUE sims ahead by ~4, but Q prefers the H7 placement. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ADVY 9H DAVY +20 20
>Matt_Canik: CEEENTT K5 TEEN. +16 28
#note Weird turn here. All the available options are pretty terrible. Sim likes T(Y)EE the most here. (Y)ENTE, the anagram of TEENY, is also over 2 points better. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: EEPV J3 VEEP +27 47
>Matt_Canik: CEEOTTZ I5 TOT +19 47
#note Wow this is going to be a fun game.
>Geoff_Thevenot: JO G7 JO +37 84
>Matt_Canik: CDEEIUZ 3J .ICED +22 69
#note The thinking here was that a play along 2M with an E at 2N could give me ZA. I didn't see (N)UDIE which is winning the sim by about a point and a half. Not interested in playing DE(V)ICE here. DUCE or DUCI F8 also seems wrong. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AALT 8K .ATAL +18 102
>Matt_Canik: AEKTUYZ L1 YU.K +34 103
>Geoff_Thevenot: ELR 2K L.RE +18 120
#note Oh yay that actually panned out for me!
>Matt_Canik: AEGMOTZ 1N ZA +46 149
>Geoff_Thevenot: INR F8 RIN +8 128
>Matt_Canik: EGMMOQT N7 Q.T +12 161
#note I didn't know what to do here. I don't really know how good his rack is right now. I'd imagine it's significantly above average/bingo prone. MOG E9 was the only other thing that seemed decent to do here, but if he *doesn't* bingo then I need this Q off my rack ASAP or I can't score at as well as I should be able to. 

I don't know how accurate a sim should be here, but it likes MOG by about 5
>Geoff_Thevenot: X 2K ....X +21 149
>Matt_Canik: EEGIMMO E9 MOG +18 179
#note Q likes MIMEO E9 the best by a wide margin. I think I'm playing too paranoid here, but I'm really afraid of a bingo with -ATED or -ANES or something of the likes.
>Geoff_Thevenot: APT D10 TAP +16 165
>Matt_Canik: EEEGIMO 13B OGEE +16 195
#note Unless he has a Y or a hella convenient fit, OGEE is going to make him give me a big spot back if he does bingo. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: FO 14A OF +20 185
>Matt_Canik: EIIMNRS O6 MI. +16 211
>Geoff_Thevenot: DEGINRS 14E DINGERS +66 251
>Matt_Canik: AEINRRS M8 .ERRAINS +71 282
>Geoff_Thevenot: HLOU H11 LOU.H +30 281
>Matt_Canik: ?ADFLNU 15B FUD +18 300
#note I thought about passing on all F plays to try and draw IF or EF 15A, but couldn't find a non-F option that was worth it. FU(G) is also something I can do. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: OS 10L O.S +20 301
>Matt_Canik: ?ABEILN 15M .IB +15 315
#note Really want to shed my I this turn with 3 unseen. I just blanked on ISBA, which is better. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AW D8 WA.... +20 321
>Matt_Canik: ?ACEILN M2 ..IN +10 325
#note A very very peculiar turn. I did this to stop KIS 4L for a lot. Geoff's last play (and the speed with which it went down) implied to me that he was holding another S. But this endgame is going to go from ''cool'' to ''meh'' with my next draw...
>Geoff_Thevenot: ABINORS B12 B... +12 333
#note Q says Geoff's only 50% win at this game is AB 12A. I don't really feel like playing through all the situations, but with the W as the unseen tile I think Geoff is completely screwed. 
>Matt_Canik: ??ACEIL A6 CELosIA +79 404
#note Choose the babiest bingo I can find, because that's how I roll. 
>Matt_Canik:  (AINORSW) +20 424
