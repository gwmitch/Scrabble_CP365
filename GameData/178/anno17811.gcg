#note Held for a long time. It's really convenient for Orry to phoney here but I just couldn't afford to lose a turn, especially with LAZY abailable.

#note incredibly, I overlooked QA(T). I'm trying to set up my S, or at least make him burn one of his best bingo tiles for a score that won't be enough to get him back into the game. This sets up SA(K)E for me.

#note Just had no idea what to do here. Worried a lot about X plays at 14, but he probably didn't have it last turn or he'd have played it. I don't know what I should have done, but this probably wasn't it.

#note Passed here. If he hit his bingo, then he draws a tile and I get the points. If he missed, he has to play a tile and then I bingo out and win. This has the be the optimal play for spread purposes.
