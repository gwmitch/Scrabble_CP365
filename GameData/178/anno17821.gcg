>Judy: IKR 8G KIR +14 14
>Chris: ADEILLR 9F LID +15 15
#note I did think about LARDLIKE but wrote it off. Shouldn't have especially since my last rack in the previous round was FATLIKE haha. Even though I wasn't sure, I should play it especially against a lower seed. Was tilted that RALLIED and DALLIER didn't play after KIR so that didn't help my concentration here.
>Judy: QU H6 QU.. +14 28
#note She snap-played this and it can't be right given the huge spot it gives up. 
>Chris: ADEGILR 5C GLADIER +83 98
#note I'm not sure I deserve this but QUID makes up for chickening on LARDLIKE in the cosmic book of karma so all's fair :)
>Judy: EE F5 .EE +6 34
#note 6 points! This tastes better than victory and y'all know how much I like victory :)
>Chris: BEEGTUU D2 BUG.E +16 114
#note The bugles are playing some song I don't recognize because I'm a musical illiterate :( Q likes TUBULE D1? Is it on crack like Rob Ford?
>Judy: EINOOOR -OOOR +0 34
#note Exch 4 and on a blistering scoring pace.
>Chris: ?EIRSTU E7 RUSTIEr +69 183
#note Looked for a bingo that paralleled everything and missed hIRSUTE for 87 at E10. Decided against STUIVER and STUDIER for 76 at H10 to not create the hook on the triple line and keep the board closed but sUITERS H10 is still probably worth playing over my play.
>Judy: AEINPRT 11C PA.NTIER +60 94
#note P(R)ETRAIN I7 is awesome, also TERRAPIN, APERIENT score 76 and 72. 
>Chris: ABCDINT J6 CANT +20 203
#note Considered ABACI D11 and BIDE B12 and rejected both as needlessly dangerous. Didn't look at BADE B12 though, which looks alright. Also saw BArDIC, and I have no idea why I didn't play it as it looks like a great play. CANT is awful; even though it shuts down the top right somewhat, CANTER and CANTOR are good meaning it leaves row 10 open pretty much and it's not good offensively either. 
>Judy: EHO 10I HOE +23 117
#note I held CANTOR for a sec lol
>Chris: ?BDFIIN L6 BIFID +23 226
#note Despite a bunch of mistakes I'm still in firm control of the game after this.
>Judy: MOR 8L .ROM +27 144
>Chris: ?AGNOOT 13E .OGATiON +60 286
#note I missed 3 better bingoes here. I'm playing down to my opponent's level again :(
>Judy: AEFLS 14J FEALS +48 192
#note This is phony? Didn't even hold and had no idea lol. 
>Chris: EEJNNSU N6 JE.N +27 313
#note Only considered JEON vs JEES G15 and missed JUPES for 44 at C9 aNd JUN K5 for 30. Goddamn I played terribad this game
>Judy: XY F13 .XY +29 221
#note PYX is 30 with just those 2 letters lol
>Chris: EMNPSUV H13 .MP +21 334
#note VUM K5. I guess i wanted to block the 3x3 (lol) but then I should play YUP F15 then and not use both of my letters that fit at L15
>Judy: ANOZ K4 AZON +36 257
>Chris: ENOSTUV 4I OV.TE +18 352
#note I considered VOE B6 but this seemed to block stuff the best. This sims best, so I finally did something right this game!
>Judy: AY 12C AY. +26 283
>Chris: ANSUVW 12K VAW +30 382
#note Don't have the last letter here. VAW here is better than VAW FOR 34 AT 13K due to the 3x3 threat obv
>Judy: IL 10E .IL +18 301
>Chris: DNORSTU C11 ..D +12 394
#note Maybe PAN instead since it still keeps STOURY and fishes for DOUBTERS? This fishes for BURSTONE but that's less points, idk. 
>Judy: OW 6B WO. +17 318
>Chris: INORSTU 15A STOUR. +30 424
>Judy: CEEHIS -  +0 318
#note I think she tried a phony here.
>Chris: AN C2 AN +12 436
#note By far my worst game of the tourney. I should've won by like 250. 
>Chris:  (CEEHIS) +22 458
