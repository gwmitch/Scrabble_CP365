>Winter: AHIIMNU 8D HUMAN +28 28
#note I wasn't in love with the double-I leave, and furthermore I mistakenly thought that if I drew IN(HUMAN) I'd hit the triple. Spent the game wondering if NON(HUMAN) is good.
>Ed_Liebfried: FOOT 7G FOOT +23 23
>Winter: DIIOORT 9E TOROID +25 53
#note I never see OOTID.
>Ed_Liebfried: DEEPR E5 REP..ED +40 63
#note Ugh, not what I want to see when I need to win by 92!!!
>Winter: BDIOTVX 10B VOT.D +31 84
#note Going for that big X play, so dumping the extra tile with BOVID would have helped.
>Ed_Liebfried: EE D10 .EE +9 72
>Winter: ABEIRUX F5 EX +52 136
#note Didn't see IBEX. Ugh.
>Ed_Liebfried: ??AENST K2 vAiNEST +68 140
#note Grrr... I am still hopeful to win, but by 92 seems impossible.
>Winter: ABFIIRU D1 FIBIA +31 167
#note Oops.
>Ed_Liebfried: AKNR 1D .RANK +36 176
#note Grrr...
>Winter: EEILRUU 4F LIEU +15 182
#note Ugh.

#note Oh, come on now.
>Winter: AACEERU B10 .ACUA +20 202
#note Baby needs a bingo leave.
>Ed_Liebfried: AMR A13 MAR +21 236
#note Thanks for not blocking Ed!
>Winter: EEENQRT G3 Q. +21 223
#note BUT NO THANKS FOR THE @#$%^& Q!!!
>Ed_Liebfried: LL 13A ..LL +16 252
#note Whew!

>Winter: EEENNRT M8 .NTERNEE +68 291
#note This was a tough decision, whether to play safe or take the extra points.
>Ed_Liebfried: EGOS 15K OG.ES +24 276
#note Damn. I was hoping he blanked on that, because I would have slammed him.
>Winter: DEIJOVZ 2B IV.ED +35 326
#note Didn't know VIZORED.
>Ed_Liebfried: AW N13 AW. +24 300
#note AARRGHH!!!

I saw this a turn later, and my heart sank, because that was the break I needed to win the tournament. 
>Winter: CHJOPUZ N6 JU. +26 352
#note Playing short, hoping to extend the game, because Ed is running out of time.
>Ed_Liebfried: GIY 3J Y.GI +16 316
>Winter: CHLOPTZ 11K CH.Z +36 388
#note Glad to keep the vowel.
>Ed_Liebfried: ABIORSS -  +0 316
#note HOLY COW!!! I block his ISOBAR(E)S, but he misses ISOBARS, and then HE MAKES AN ILLEGAL PLAY!!!

Quackle won't let me enter this, but what Ed did was to start to play BOSS at N1, but then, with just a few seconds left, he pulled it back, BUT LEFT THE S, and played BOA!!!

So I challenged off the illegal play and slammed down OP(T) to push him over time.
>Winter: ILOPTW J5 OP. +23 411
#note This might not be best, but it pushes him over time.
>Ed_Liebfried: ABIORSS N1 BOSS +21 337
>Winter: ILTW 14H WILT +11 422
#note AND, WITH THE 10 POINTS, I WIN BY 101, WHEN I NEEDED TO WIN BY 92!!!

Also, that was my third 101 spread in a row, fourth overall, out of 7 games!!!
>Winter:  (AIR) +6 428
