>Brad_W.: AAIIRTY -AIY +0 0
#note AIRY is probably better.  I'm getting in the habit of trading on my first turn, especially if I'm opening.

>Brad_W.: ?AAIRTU H3 AUbRI.TA +58 58
#note I saw 9H TImARAU 60 but decided not to open up the triple.

>Sam_K.: ?DEEGMS 4G G.MwEEDS +72 110
>Brad_W.: ELNRTUZ I10 LUTZ +25 115
#note Same word at 13F scores 1 more point, and it's better defensively.

>Sam_K.: DEHOT B10 HO.TED +36 170
>Brad_W.: ELMNNTX A14 ME +25 206
#note 7J M(I)NX 21 looks like the best play, which I don't think I saw.  I hated my play but I knew if I got lucky and drew a vowel or two, I could hit a big score on the TWS.

#note I got lucky.

#note 6J G(R)OUP 18 looks better.  It scores 5 less but the leave is better, plus it gums up some bingo lanes.  The sim likes 9K (R)UG 20, which also gums up bingo lanes, and I guess the doubled O's are not so bad.
>Sam_K.: EFL 7J L.EF +29 329
>Brad_W.: DGIORUW 9M GO +16 365
#note I can't remember why I made this play.  Not only does it not score (well nothing does really), but it keeps the dreaded UW combination.  My only idea is that I wanted to block the L and T bingo lanes, but I didn't really block the T lane that well.  12I (T)URGID 16 appears to be the best play.
>Sam_K.: I 2C .I +4 333
>Brad_W.: DGIORUW E1 DUG +10 375
#note I liked this play because it blocked the bingo lane he just created, cleaned up my rack a little, and left 1 in the bag.  Also, I had 10N WO 27 next turn if I needed it to score some points.
>Sam_K.: BI 10N BI +21 354

#note This was a phony but no way I was challenging at that stage of the game.
>Brad_W.: EIRS 11K IRES +14 422
#note Missed 13G SI(Z)ER 15.
