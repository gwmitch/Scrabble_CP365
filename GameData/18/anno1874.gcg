#note Dr. Word Knowledge strikes another stunning blow. The worst part is that I managed to spend four minutes talking myself out of ANTHESES, and maybe two-thirds of a second convincing myself that it was only HEARTENS. Might be time to study high-prob 8s again?

#note good job

>Shahid: AAIII -  +0 167
#note Lost challenge. I think part of the reason I balked on ANTHESES (instead of my usual strategy of playing whatever and letting opp figure it out) was because I remember Shahid not being too afraid of the red button, which he put to good use in this game.

>Shahid: AAIIU -  +0 167
#note Lost challenge.
>Phil: AAEEFLR 12D EAR +19 352
#note FETAL looks dumb to me since he apparently likes his rack enough to sacrifice two straight turns with it.
>Shahid: AAIIU -AAIIU +0 167
#note Oh.
>Phil: ABEFLMT 11B BALM +31 383
#note Inexplicably, I chicken out of FLAMBE here, and burn two more valuable minutes doing so. Sacrificing two points instead of LAMB is probably overthinking things a bit, especially at this score.
>Shahid: DIM 14A DIM +20 187
>Phil: EFNSTTU 15J TUFT +13 396
#note Wow, I totally didn't even know FUNEST, which almost means the opposite of what it looks like it's trying to spell. TUFT is ok though.
>Shahid: EJ M13 JE. +20 207
>Phil: EEEGGNS G8 .EG +5 401
#note Shrug. Almost doesn't matter what I do here, but this seemed most natural.
>Shahid: NOW N12 WON +25 232
>Phil: BEEGNRS O11 BEG +24 425
#note Quackle prefers to hold something pointier here, with either NEG or REB in this spot. I can see how the B and G may prove defensively useful in a few moments. I think I had about 2:30 left at this point, so I was pretty much thinking one move at a time.
>Shahid: ALV C8 LAV. +8 240
>Phil: AENNRSY 9C .NY +6 431
#note I did see that RELY could maybe give him DOwNPOUR, and figured there were probably a few other worst-case scenarios.
