#note apparently this is wrong. 7G ZA and 5J LUTZ are nearly tied for first. is my leave so bad? [-9] 6F ZEATIN is another possibility. i liked my play because it forced trip to open after his play.

#note or H1 VALID - these are basically tied. again i wanted to make the board a bit tougher for defense

#note it likes K3 AGA more! [-2.5] what's so good about aga?

#note trip's obviously having vowel shortage.. lucky for me AAU scores a lot
>Trip: NNOSY K8 SONNY +27 103
>Cesar: AEEIKOO 12I KA.O +22 175
#note this is an interesting move. 10A OKA is definitely better defensively, and scores one more with the same letters. close behind it is M3 LOOIE which also is ok defensively, and it keeps a good leave. my play is a bit back. [-3.7]

>Cesar: ?EEIIOR 13H OI +10 185
#note 14A SOIREE is nuts! my play and it are tied. 4K REI is a half pt. back but i think it's better than both!

#note plugging in his rack into the inference engine puts my play as clearly best

>Cesar: BEMOPSX O7 MO. +21 312
#note avoiding a disaster is my best bet here. i was going to do BOXED before he opened with ROC, but knowing he has DIOS? he could easily 3-3. i'd also thought of BUXOM if he blocked BOXED. but when he opened the C i immediately knew i had to block -- PEC is obviously better because it keeps BUXOM for next turn at the least! plugging into the inference engine gives my play [-3], PEC is best. 
>Trip: EGIO H1 GEOI. +24 213
>Cesar: BENNPSX L3 .EX +34 346
#note now plugging in DS? into the inference engine. B11 BOX is clearly better than my play.[-16] (is it really that much?)
