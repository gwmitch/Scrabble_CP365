#note Don't like luckboxing like this, but I'll take it.
>Judy_Horn: ACEL D4 LEAC. +20 20
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEFLNO 7I FEEL +22 100
#note Going a bit against my style here, taking points and balancing.  It's this or FEE in the same spot without simming.  FOE comes into play with, but I'm not too concerned about any other options.  FEEL felt right.  My old rule of thumb was when making plays such as this, come out "one more" at least, to leave a letter dangling.  This enables more lines for 8s, and ensures a more open board early on.  This, I've now realized, may be considered reckless.  It all depends on how much you respect your opponent to find 8s.

#note Best, no question, really.
>Judy_Horn: III -III +0 66
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGIINR F7 G.AINIER +63 181
#note I respect my opponent, but I wonder if playing ARGININE for 3 less is worth the possibility of a challenge?
>Judy_Horn: ADGP 13C PAG.D +22 88
>Ryan_Fischer: BEJMOOU J2 JUMBO.. +36 217
#note Now I have BOOJUM, which I have wanted to play for a while.  JUMBO(ES)* is 3 more points.  Do I risk it?  I was 50/50 on whether it was good.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEJMOOU --  -36 181
#note She didn't have as many doubts.
>Judy_Horn: IQ E10 QI +37 125
#note Clogging things up nicely, unfortunately.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEJMOOU N7 B.OJUM +33 214
#note And now I lose out because she later tells me she didn't know BOOJUM but figured I wouldn't phony twice in a row.  Game theory lesson to be learned here: take the obscure word that you're sure of over the common word you're not sure of, especially when there's a challenge involved.  And now B(O)OJUM will tighten things up even more.  Other options are BOOM 12A 34 and JOB F2 38.  I was blind to them.  JOB has merits of keeping a consonant for scoring, scoring more, and not opening the TWS.  What do I do with EJU after BOOM though (besides play JEU :P)?  After 1200 4-ply BOOM is on top, followed by JOB, then BOOJUM.  Weird.
>Judy_Horn: AEMSZ O11 MAZES +60 185
#note And if I had played it a turn earlier, this might not have happened.  She missed the anagram, SMAZE, for 68, or even MAZE, keeping the S, for 63 (although it's less defensive).
>Ryan_Fischer: DDEIOOT C8 DIDO +19 233
#note I had the right idea here, but DODO is better by a long shot.
>Judy_Horn: AFLR C3 FARL +29 214
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIOOPT 11K OPI.. +18 251
#note Rule of thumb I've come up with, and haven't tested: you get your rack-destroying power tile play, then you get the middling, scoring play, and then watching for the bingo, especially if it's a simple 7 you can tack an S onto.  So, I shoulda tightened things up here and now.  I didn't, and I paid.  I took a long time on this move, no idea what to do, and finally settled on something silly and creative, yet not defensive.  Oddly, Quackle didn't have it in its top 10.  It started out well, but then came back to earth as POO(R)I G5 and OE B9 (SUICIDAL!) win out.  Personally, if I'm gonna play OE anywhere, it'd be N14, forcing a 9 to bingo there.
>Judy_Horn: AEGLORT 15H GLOATER. +80 294
#note Just great.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEKORT O2 KEROTi.E +67 318
#note I felt like doing something REALLY stupid.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEKORT --  -67 251
>Judy_Horn: EIV O6 VI.E +13 307
#note Apparently, she's so scared of my rack (or its potential) that she HAD to take the spot now.  Fine, there's still 9s on column J to work with... or I could do something even crazier.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEKORT B9 KETO +23 274
#note ...like this!  Nuts, but it also forks the board.  I hold the blank with two Ses unseen.  So I can hit in either spot and make a killing.  The other option seems to be OKE at B1 or F1.  Even more risky, but it has a high percentage of success.  12I KORE is definitely the safer option.
>Judy_Horn: T 10A T.. +4 311
#note She makes a fearful, admittedly weak blocking play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEORWY A12 YOWE +51 325
#note I cash in on my hubris.  In hindsight, I should have kept what was the next to last E, and played WARY.  Though there are no Os or As left, either.
>Judy_Horn: CIN D12 C.IN +14 325
>Ryan_Fischer: ??ABHOR 14J HA +28 353
#note I took a LONG time trying to weigh the benefits of each play, and each leave.  There are a LOT.  I wanted to get away from the B, and at the same time I wanted to save column J.  I have to get back to -EST endings, W words, or functional 9s if I want to bingo, else I have to outscore her.  HOAR 6J was appealing, but out because I leave just a naked B with that ugly pool.  I want to minimize my variance.  Quackle lists HO in that 9 spot, but where do I bingo after?  There are long shot bingos ending in O on row 5, too, that will be blocked.  I have NO idea why AH 14I sims above HA 14J.  I chose the latter ultimately.
>Judy_Horn: NSTTUVY J6 V..T +15 340
#note She kills the 9 line, and seeing as how I haven't brushed up on my BUW bingos lately, I figure I best take the points.
>Ryan_Fischer: ??BORSU A7 BUS. +25 378
#note OUTBURST is the winner, and if I had a bit more time, I might've eked it out.  O(R)BS G7 is second best.  BUST is better than BURST I guess because it doesn't empty the bag.
>Judy_Horn: DENU 12I NUDE +21 361
#note Knew I shoulda taken that spot sooner, but it didn't hurt that much.
>Ryan_Fischer: ??IORSY L3 vIRe..Y +16 394
#note Two bingos missed, DERISORY and REVISORY.  No biggie there.  I spend two blanks for 16 points, which isn't terrible considering my time, yet again.  pRIO(R)Y G4 or ROSY 10H (or any like play) is the winner of the non-bingos.
>Judy_Horn: NNTT 4K T.N +3 364
#note Missed TINT for 1 more.
>Ryan_Fischer: OS 10I OS +14 408
#note OS B14 16 is best.
>Ryan_Fischer:  (NT) +4 412
#note Another game I should've won handily and only just won.
