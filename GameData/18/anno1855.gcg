>Mike_F: ADEEERT -EE +0 0
#note Right idea, wrong execution; trading just one E is seven points better. 8G DEE is also a slight improvement over this.
>Cesar: BEOOPYZ 8H BOOZY +46 46
#note i don't remember if i saw ZOOEY, i think i did, and hated BP. BOOZY at 8D sims best, cuz of defense. [-1]
>Mike_F: ADEIKRT 9C TRAIKED +79 79
>Cesar: ?ENPRTV L4 PERV. +26 72
#note i spent a long time looking for a bingo and then gave up. pervy* is no good :o
>Mike_F: AEEHILT K5 HE +22 101
#note This, 8A THAE or HIE, and K8 ZEAL are all within 2.5 points of each other. These are the kinds of situations I really don't know how to differentiate. Any thoughts?
>Cesar: ?FLNOST D8 F.ONT +24 96
#note very bad. i spent a while on this too, play FRONT hit the clock and notice ?LS on my rack -- DOH!! [-30]
>Mike_F: ACEIILT 8A ALI. +23 124
#note Practically tied with K8 ZITI; I silghtly prefer the leave after ALIF, plus the spot looks pretty dangerous.
>Cesar: ?ABLRSX M3 LAX +37 133
#note 10H LAX is better! they're almost tied in the SIM.   [-0.5]
>Mike_F: CDEIITU K8 .ITI +26 150
>Cesar: ?ABERSY 12I RoSEBAY +94 227
>Mike_F: CCDEMSU O11 C.MES +36 186
#note Just barely ahead of MUCID F6; given the margin, I need the points.
>Cesar: ADENOUV 15J VODUN. +12 239
#note didn't know VENDUE. i hate playing like this.. [-19] an interesting thing is that still 14J AVENUE and M11 ABOVE sim pretty high (definitely not as much as VENDUE). i'm too paranoid about that S and neglected my own advice to just keep scoring, it's not that big a deal.
>Mike_F: CDELOQU F7 CL.QUE +37 223
#note This is just ahead of N1 QUOD; the latter seems wrong, as Cesar will often have an O1 play, and I come out behind on the exchange. Can't afford that.
>Cesar: AAEIORS 13M AI. +20 259
#note sims best. i'm still annoyed about VODUNS because obviously stuff like CLIQUE and FLAX etc etc are available.. it's worth it to play avenue if i cant find vendue.
>Mike_F: DEFLNOO 2M FON +26 249
#note Would've helped to know CLIQUED; 13F DONE is clearly best. 2J LOOF is also an improvement; I guess I got tunnel vision on opening a new line.
>Cesar: AEMOPRS 1N MA +22 281
#note O1 ENAMOR for 33 is obviously better! MA keeps a strong enough leave that it's not totally hated. [-2]
>Mike_F: DEILNOT A5 DEL.TION +60 309
#note Though I expected it, it's still disappointing to see the triple-triple get blocked. This is the only bingo.
>Cesar: AEOOPRS 7F .OOP +26 307
#note keeping the S this is the star play.. if i could only think at the time of SCOOP!!
>Mike_F: EEHINNU 13C HEN +21 330
>Mike_F: EEHINNU --  -21 309
#note Yeah, yeah, I know; it's FRONS, pl. FRONTES. Only took Cesar a few seconds to challenge.
>Cesar: AEGRRSW B10 SWARE +31 338
#note 6H RAWER or a million other plays. B2 WAGER (nah too risky), 13G GREW ..... [-12.5]
>Mike_F: EEHINNU B5 EH +29 338
#note This was the best play last turn, and it's still best.
>Cesar: AEGGIRT 6I AG.. +16 354
#note 6G GRATER is much better. i want to end the game asap. and try to outscore. [-8]
>Mike_F: EGINNTU G9 .IN +20 358
#note This is only 28% to win; G12 NU wins 38%. I don't understand this at all; there are two more Is to draw, and NU closes a line, and KIN scores 15 more. Can someone explain?
>Cesar: EGIIRTW A14 WE +20 374
#note yet another bad play [-10.5]. 10K TWIG. 
>Mike_F: AEGNSTU 7L .UG +8 366
#note Sims best! Even though there's a G and a blank out, I have to gamble here, and hope I can distract him from the E line.
>Cesar: ?DGIIRT O5 DIGIT +30 404
#note i seriously did not think of SCOOP, i wonder if i was getting tired of getting so lucky. it doesn't seem to care about trying to kill that spot now that i can lose to something like jest. . i'm so lucky.
>Mike_F: AEEJNST E3 TAJES +33 399
#note This endgame is best. Overall, I played poorly enough to deserve not to win here.
>Cesar: ?RRU 3E .RUeR +6 410
