>Sam: AEHMOPR 8D HAMPER +34 34
#note I liked the relative defense of this despite the subpar leave, plus it scores most. Quack concurs.
>Seth_Lipkin: ?AINNOR H1 RAIsONN. +71 71
#note IRONmAN 9B is nice
>Sam: EFGOORV E7 F.VOR +22 56
#note Many options better than FAVOR; FOG 9C looks like the best one, I think. Should have taken longer here.
>Seth_Lipkin: IMOOSYZ J8 SIZY +50 121
#note ZOOMS 12A 
>Sam: ADEGOVX D10 GOX +27 83
#note AXED G2 is clearly better, I can't remember if I considered it or not. 
>Seth_Lipkin: ACIMOOT 4B OOMIAC. +20 141
#note OOMIAC C3 is better, and I might have even challenged CHAMPERS.
>Sam: ADENRRV F10 RAVED +24 107
#note Again, a superior parallel play which I missed.
>Seth_Lipkin: EILNTUY 5C YIN +25 166
#note UNITEDLY 14A is the only bingo
>Sam: ABBKNRW 3C BARK +50 157
>Seth_Lipkin: EEELRTU C11 TEE +19 185
#note Quackle likes ELUTE K11, which seems needlessly risky to me; nothing wrong with TEE. 
>Sam: ABINTUW 6F BU.T +12 169
#note Ack, my worst play so far I think, and probably for the whole game. I took a few minutes with this rack, and was rightly unsatisfied even when I laid BUNT down. B13 WAB keeps me in the game much better.
>Seth_Lipkin: DEGLLRU B12 DRUG +25 210
>Sam: ADEHINW 11J .AW +18 187
#note YAW clearly isn't the right play. Quackle seems to like NAE best for the points, which doesn't look too bad, especially considering I have the HW for YA hooks. Plus, I'm only down 18 after NAE. I liked YAW for the N hook, but I guess all four Ls are still out.
>Seth_Lipkin: ACELLLO M8 OCELLA +32 242
#note OCELLUS, OCELLI, OCELLAR, OCELLA*. Seth was surprised that this wasn't good after the game. CELLO is best among the real plays, and maybe even better than OCELLA*. 
>Sam: DEEHINO 12K HO.ED +37 224
#note Some interesting choices here. The three best options are probably HELIO, HOED, and HOLE. HELIO is neat since it keeps 2/1 consonants, with this vowel-heavy bag.
>Seth_Lipkin: AILNOSU O8 ALOU. +18 260
>Sam: DEIINPS 1C INSPI.ED +62 286
>Seth_Lipkin: AIINSST L2 ISATINS +69 329
#note Despite my previous awful play, I still haJd a decent chance to win if I didn't draw this out of the bag. I need to keep the U in case of the Q. Either JEST or JETE
>Sam: EEEJTTU 5J JU.E +22 308
#note I needed to keep the U for the Q here. JEST is best since it keeps a lot of vowels, given the consonant-heavy bag.
>Seth_Lipkin: ?EFGINT G13 FET +22 351
#note Quackle prefers EF M5, but it doesn't realize that I'm going to block. FET is a fine play.
>Sam: EELQTTW 15G .WEET +24 332
#note Q-sticking myself here is actually best.
>Seth_Lipkin: ?EGIN 3K E. +2 353
#note Quackle likes ANE or InANE, but I think Seth's sequence makes more sense.
>Sam: LQT M4 L.T +7 339
#note LEST is a point more, but playing the T and L off one by one with WOT and SOLA is better.
>Seth_Lipkin: ?GIN 15A I.G +15 368
>Sam: Q -  +0 339
>Seth_Lipkin: ?N 1A uN........ +36 404
#note Awesome find
>Seth_Lipkin:  (Q) +20 424
