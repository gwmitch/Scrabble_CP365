#note Third after 600 4-ply.  I don't like the chaos that the AAOS leave of FIZ will beckon, and I don't get why ZOA is better than AZO.  Either expose the DLS or allow an N hook.

#note Considered BANKWARD* VERY briefly.  :)  Very interesting rack.  Scrabble is most fun, I think, when the board is wide open and there are lots of juicy plays to consider.  So I'm gonna have to leave this one sim a long while, though I don't know quite if anything conclusive can be made of it.  DAK comes up like 5th upon generating choices, but sims 1st after 1000 spins 4-ply, so it does best in the long run (well, short, but long for me), and I'm quite pleased with it.  For a while, it was neck-and-neck with KAB N12.  I'm guessing this is because the B is so awkward, and it would be better to lose it at the cost of 3 points.  Now, "old me" would want to take something at L1, but I'm thinking, now, why go to the 3x3 when plays in the middle of the board score the same and there are plenty of lanes open anyway.  Setting up (DO) hooks to L1 will do minimal damage if the opponent takes them, and now YOU'LL have the counter.  Long story short: DAK is a winner.

#note It's such a shame she didn't give me a place for BROWNIE, but what kind of silly, effed# up, nonsensical word is BROWNIE(R) N2?  :)  It's BROWNISH!  You can't say REDDY*/REDDIER*!  It's REDDISH!  Wow, English sucks.  :D  Anyway, a winner was not me on this play.  BOWER L2, but I don't like exposing the DLS like that.  I'd RATHER come out to the 3x3 with a B there, as they're relatively innocuous.

#note O(B)ELI is better, yes.  Don't know why I didn't take it.  (B)OLE is perfectly sensible too, even though it leaves three vowels to one consonant.  My play is 3rd.

>Ryan_Fischer: CEEENOU 1L .ONE +18 262
#note I'm a little worried here.  My racks don't seem to be going anywhere and she's gaining.  I take a while to play (B)ONE, which isn't that great (and (B)ENE mighta been better, too).  2J CO(R)NU leaves EEE, which is pretty insane, though it scores 26.  COENU(R)E is cool, scores 17, cleans things up, though the only things worth drawing are the blank and the X.  Hard to say what's best here.  EOCENE 14E and CON(G)EE 13A are other options.

#note Daring hook setup, I gotta say.

#note Why did QUOD (14F) just fall outta my head?  Was I really THAT worried about the 3 Is left?
>Jean_McArthur: DEG 6M ..G +7 279
#note It's become obvious here that she's fishin' up a storm.  This is one part of the game I'm not good at -- shutting it down at the end.  Bingos on rows 1 and 2 are possible, though there are actually 5 lines open.  The most likely are those 3 at top.  First thought is, wow, OILMAN H1 38 solves all my problems.  She'll have an I to work with too, but the 38 points makes up for that, and even if she bingos out, it won't be enough.  But, barring that, you really have to play two tiles here, and possibly hope you can bingo as well.  That's why I settled on MA -- it blocks the R, and forces her to make the blank an A to use the new line I've created.  I don't know if it's a smart move.  Quackle hates it.  It's OILMAN, then MO(T) M13, LO 10A, ON(E) N13, or OR 4D, from the Champ's brain.

#note Well, there are only 3 here, and she got two of 'em (heh).  (C)ILIaTED for 83 is the other.
>Ryan_Fischer: CILNNOR 1H ORC +24 409
#note Wow, ORC(I)N(O)L is fancy.  Bit outta my league still, but maybe I'll remember it.  Brain farted on ROC versus ORC.  Oops.  Either way, not worth blocking her H(E)/H(E) for 20 and out.  I had the last laugh.

#note Always nice to win when the opponent gets the blanks, and she outbingoed me 3-1, and I still won.  Wow.  But I've still got a bit to learn about saving spread.
