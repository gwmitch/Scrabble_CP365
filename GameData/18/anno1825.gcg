#note The other premier options here seem to be BAYOU and YOU 8J. Although I didn't see or consider it during the game, I probably like YOU best. It keeps the best leave, and shuts down the double-double and TWS. If I can bingo next turn, it could lead to a closed board following YOU. However, I do understand that BOUNTY (which imo is better than BAYOU) keeps an open board, which is in my favor given the good leave (AS). It's also 5 more points than YOU. Still, I think YOU is best.

#note J9 EH looks better. Q says by 6.3. Just made the wrong decision.

>Sam: ADELSTU B5 SALUTED +75 181
#note Better defensively than the L1 spot, and worth the 1-point sacrifice.

#note Ugh. I saw AZOTE, and then thought it wasn't good. Embarrassing.

#note OX at either 10M or C13 would have been better, dunno why I played EX.

#note Manop didn't hold on this phony.

>Sam: DLLPRUV -LLPUV +0 397
#note ULVA is 8 equity points better than the exchange. I was a bit wary of him placing the Q at L1, but I should have realized that there was a good chance he traded the Q on his last turn, and almost certainly did not keep the Q on the trade.

#note Quackle's Championship Player seems to like DEAR D1, which I saw. I was scared of a big QI play at N14, but I guess I should have realized he probably had QIS H1 anyway. Is DEAR the right play?
