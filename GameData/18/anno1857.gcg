>Cesar: MQRTTWX K9 M.R.X +28 106
#note could not resist MUREX. exchanging MQTWX does better by win % just a tiny bit. 
>JKB: GJ 10B J.G +35 191
>Cesar: ?DQTTTW -DQTTW +0 106
#note least i have a blank!
>JKB: ELOPV L5 PLOVE. +19 210
#note this is an excellent move.
>Cesar: ?AEFLTT 11C .AFT +23 129
#note but i didn't know FLATLETs 6H:( my move sims even with it though!! it may be cuz of the awesome leave and bad position of flatlets.
>JKB: AENSTUU 8L .ENT +21 231
>Cesar: ?DDEILT 13I .I.ED +30 159
#note very disapointed about this miss, particularly because i even saw the possibility of tideland with these tiles and completely blanked on the N. i was very nervous this game!! [-13]
>JKB: ALN M6 AN.L. +18 249
>Cesar: ?DEHLRT 13B H.LT +7 166
#note time for a desperation fish. not the right way to do it. [-14] it likes N6 DENT. 
>JKB: OS 14A SO. +20 269
#note i didn't even blink at this play! it set off no alarm bells! what is wrong with me? [-20]
>Cesar: ?ADEORU O8 .AbOURED +77 243
#note aeroduct is better because it gives me a better chance to come back. they're very close but aeroduct has a slightly higher win % 
>JKB: CEILNSU 15D GIRTHS +50 319
>JKB: CEILNSU --  -50 269
#note i'm not going to win if this stays on the board!
>Cesar: CEEILSY N2 SEELY +46 289
#note This is a good time to use the new rack inference engine in quackle. I obviously considered his rack when making my play, but my current time (i think i was at about 4 minutes) did not let me think about it for more than 10 seconds or so, and i just didn't see the play he would make after my SEELY. my play would be ok if i didn't know what he had but there's no excuse otherwise.... [-20] N14 YE gives me a good chance here.
>JKB: GHIRST O1 SITH +46 315
>Cesar: ACEEIUU K3 EAU +14 303
>JKB: IN 15A IN +18 333
>Cesar: CDEIOUW N14 WO +23 326
#note how do these top players always seem to know what i have?
>JKB: AGI 14G GI.A +15 348
>Cesar: CDEEINU H14 .D +9 335
#note my idea here is to kill his spot and slow play the game in case he is stuck with the Q. quackle likes J5 CUE. it makes sense to me cuz if i draw the Q i'm screwed anyway.. but i also didn't want him to cash the triple! [-50]% ... CUE has a 75% win and my play has a pathetic 25% win.
>JKB: INOOQRT 6F OI +12 360
#note the cool thing about this play is that it is not absolutely straightforward to block, and i was so low on time here that this actually caused me to go overtime to try to figure out how to Q-stick him.
>Cesar: CEEINNU 4G UNCI. +8 343
#note went overtime here
>JKB: OOQRT M13 .O +9 369
>Cesar: EEN 3G NE +8 351
#note 15J NEE would win the game outright but i was already overtime. so actually, this would have been a tie but i was quickly running out of time and did not calculate it -- i assumed i would lose. [-10]
>JKB: OQRT 15K TRO.. +11 380
#note OMG!!
>Cesar: E E11 .E. +6 357
#note i quickly went out, but actually went an additional minute overtime -- at the time of my last play (NE) i think i was at -0:57 or so, he then immediately dropped his play and it took me more than 3 seconds to find a spot for my E so i ended at something like -1:02, and after his TROOD* i believe he was at 0:01. now, if i challenge and go out i obviously win. hilarious game huh!?
>Cesar:  (Q) +20 377
#note -20 for time => final score is 380-357
