>Rebecca: CGINSTX 2G X. +9 153
#note I took a long time to pick this.  Doesn't sim best, but I felt like it was likely to make him open the board and give me a vowel.

#note Scored as 65.
>Rebecca: EEFLPRS 12J ELF +14 278
#note G13 (I)F 5 sims better, but I don't like it.  I like 1F FE(N) 15.
>Opponent: EIOORVW H13 .OO +9 220
>Rebecca: EEPRRRS 15G R.PER +7 285
#note This sims terribly.  I was still missing plays through the N.  Quackle says 13L ERR 11.  I know I have the last S, but why give him an R to bingo through?
>Opponent: FOR 7A FOR. +22 242
>Rebecca: AEGNRSW 14J WAGES +49 334
#note Misparsed WAGER in my head and didn't realize I know it's good.
>Opponent: AOR 13L ORA +19 261
>Rebecca: AAEENRT 1F TA.NER +15 349
#note This is bad.  I like G1 A(X)E 16.  6F AE 21 sims best.  I didn't see it, but I don't think I would have played it: him bingoing through the N is one of about two ways I can lose.  I'm more worried he might have the D, but I don't see anything reasonable I can do about that.
>Opponent: EEK 15M EKE +31 292
>Rebecca: ADEIINW 9J I.N +7 356
#note There are lots of better plays.  I was greedy and wanted a V.
>Opponent: AAEIOVV 3L OVA +17 309
>Rebecca: AAADEIW 10A WAE +17 373
#note I didn't have time to try to figure out the endgame, especially with so many reasonable-looking choices.
>Opponent: AEIOV 6F OE +21 330
>Rebecca: AADI O11 AID +10 383
#note Missing 2F I(XI)A 19 for the third turn in a row.
>Opponent: AIV C2 VIA +15 345
#note After the game, he told me the last tile was a V.
