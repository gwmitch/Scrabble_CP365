>Jason: AAIRTXY 8G AIRY +14 14
#note I saw ATARAXIA and ATAXIA ... and it was the first move against Capp... and I saw ATAXY but wasn't sure enough to play it.  So I made a lamish setup of my X.  [-20]  It gets better!
>Capp: ?AALLOO 7F OLLA +14 14
#note Capp in turn misses a bingo, wALLA(R)OO.  This is a tough find, IMO.
>Jason: ADIRTVX 9C VARIX +45 59
#note I was actually half doubting myself on VARIX, thinking, OMG, I'm gonna play like a fool against Capp.  Luckily I correctly remembered :)
>Capp: ?AEGIOS E8 A.GOSIEs +66 80
#note probably worth not slotting the E at 9o for 4 points.
>Jason: DEEEHNT I5 HE..TENED +66 125
#note boo-yah!  of mild interested is that DEEEHNT?? is a 7+2 unistem and I found the only one.  I had found it pretty quickly and was pleased now to be in the game against "the man."
>Capp: EOORRRS 5I .ORROR +18 98
>Jason: EEEKLUU 15A LEEK. +39 164
#note just too many points to be EKUELEing around.
>Capp: ADDENSU 11H U.SANDED +70 168
#note Phony!  Out of the 3 games I have played against Capp in my life, he has played 2 phony bingos against me.  To be fair, this is a pretty reasonable word and neither of us really doubted it too much.  [-70]
>Jason: ABEELUU O6 BELAU. +27 191
#note close call here between DAUBE and BELAUD--the static evaluator prefers ELU but gives the nod to BELAUD after some simming.  ELU sorta stinks and so does EU, but I think I like EU better.  And anyway, I didn't really know DAUBE. :)
>Capp: GINZ 12A ZING. +50 218
>Jason: EHOOTUW 6E OW +26 217
#note NOHOW is the star play.  I didn't want to give up the scoring potential of the H and keep EOTU, but even HOW was better [-6].
>Capp: EEGNSTT 12K TEENS +34 252
>Jason: EFHOTUW J2 WHO.F +43 260
>Capp: ADGMSTT N10 M..TA +36 288
>Jason: BEEFTTU 5C BUTTE +24 284
#note again sims best, though a few alternatives come up higher on the static evaluator.
>Capp: DGMNOST D4 D.NG +18 306
>Jason: CCEFPRU M3 CR.UP +24 308
#note I thought CROUP was a slam dunk, but CURF for 18 sims a couple of points better on the strength of CEPR vs. CEF.
>Capp: AIMOSTY J8 .AM. +27 333
#note this falls off the bottom of the sim suggestion--YO for 22 keeping AIMST is the play for choice... and I think I agree. 
>Jason: ACEFIIN M9 FA..IN +39 347
#note Capp himself said this was a "really great play".  Sweet!  It scores tons more than any alternative.
>Capp: ?IIOSTY 7M .I. +5 338
>Jason: CEIIOPV 14E .PIC +14 361
#note so... here is a bad move.  I was really hung up on stopping QUOITS or JOINTS or whatever... just VI(B)E for 28 wins 60% or so.  I saw VIBE, but decided against it.  My move is like 40%--I need to be outrunning and assuming he's gonna hit something for 50, but scoring more myself.  Sigh.  I had lots of time for the endgame but it was just too hard for me. [-20%]
>Capp: ?IOQSTY L8 QI +26 364
>Jason: EIJOV C3 JI.E +36 397
#note best, now that we're going down this road.
>Capp: ?OSTY A8 SOYu. +48 412
#note yep.  I considered SpITZ during my endgame analysis, but not this... which has the net effect of winning by 1.
>Jason: OV 4A VO.. +12 409
>Jason:  (T) +2 411
#note a good game, despite its blemishes.
