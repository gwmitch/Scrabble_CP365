#note Terrible play--exchanging is better, and PENNANT looks best. Didn't even see PENNANT--have to do better than that.

#note Thanks...

#note ...for making my next play so difficult. GRIG is horrible; I don't even remember my misguided rationales. I like WITE F2, since it puts me up 100 and has a relatively decent leave, but I'm still not convinced of any best plays.
>Greg_Heidler: ?AEELRS 11A EARLESs +79 229
#note Held on this, seeing it as earl-ess (like duchess), but let it go when I realized it was ear-less. I later played earless against Mike Early

#note Terrible, terrible miss of VIOLATER. If Greg has HWZ, I may have just lost myself the game. Hopefully I won't uncover worse misses than VIOLATER.
>Greg_Heidler: ?HZ H1 pH.Z +75 372
>Sam: ADDLMSX D1 AX.D +26 396
#note The play I was so proud of, AXED, turns out to be terrible and losing. Greg can make the setup of VOWS 13B, threatening ON 12D, and no block of mine is worth playing. AXED loses by 6. Instead, I had the winning plays of AM 2E or DAM 2D (best). DAM threatens DEX and EX/XI--when Greg blocks with WORN C9, I have DEX, and his best out of OS K2 loses by 6. I took a long time with this endgame, but I foolishly (though correctly, given what really happened) assumed he would play SWOON 8A
>Greg_Heidler: NOOSW 8A SWOO. +27 399
#note VOWS threatening ON or ON threatening VOWS both win, and SLOW D10 threatening ONE C13 ties. Greg needed to find a setup play.
>Sam: DLMS I6 M..S +17 413

#note Desparation challenge
>Sam: DL F2 D.L +8 421
#note This game was also fairly well played, losing 31.4 equity points. I was extremely lucky that Greg did not capitalize on my mistakes
