>Jeremy_Hildebrand: DEOPY 7D DOPEY +32 32
>Jesse_M: CEEGIOT 9C GIE +12 32
#note Quackle likes 9D GEE 15 best, 9C OGEE 17 or GEE 12, D3 GEOI(D) 14 and 6H EGO 12 over my play. I remember seeing GEE at 9D right away and passing on it because I thought it was so volatile, given the number of Os and As that are available. I guess this an example of me overthinking again? 
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ADFS 9G FADS +33 65
>Jesse_M: CEHOQTU J4 TOQUE. +35 67
#note J6 QUE(S)T 36 sims just above my play. I saw it, but wasn't sure of which of the two plays was best.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: CEIMRSS 5E MISSC.RE +98 163
#note He plays a phony that's come up before, and I don't even hold...
>Jesse_M: ACEGHLL H1 CLAG. +30 97
#note GALL(S) in the same spot sims just a bit higher...I liked going for the points with CLAGS and leaving the C open to possibly score big with should a bingo be played from it.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: INVX L2 VIX.N +30 193
>Jesse_M: EEHLRRS 10H RE +12 109
#note My play is just about equal to 2J RE(V)EL 20 and H7 (YEA)R 7 on win percent (all are within .17 percent of each other). I'm a fan of my play out of all of them.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AAGIT M6 AGITA +11 204
>Jesse_M: AEHLLRS 8L H.LL +33 142
#note Only N10 HALER 45 sims higher, and not by much. I don't like leaving that I @ 8M open though, especially with the J and Z unseen.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AET 8A TEA +12 216
>Jesse_M: AEERSTW N10 WATER +45 187
#note My play's 2nd to 2J WA(V)ER 38...both allow for a cheap Y hook play to score at least 30, so I figured taking more points was better.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EINNV 13I VENIN. +26 242
>Jesse_M: EHIIPRS N1 PERISH +52 239
#note I was greedy and went for the clear points winner. 12L PI(T)H 36 sims highest and is certainly the best play in this situation.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: TUYZ 11I YUTZ +39 281
>Jesse_M: ?BIIKNO B4 BIKI. +21 260
#note I know I have to get rid of the K here. My play unfortunately sims 8th (keeping ON? with 5 Os in the pool has to be part of the reason for that), with 10A IKON 24 simming highest, and looks best to me.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: DDO 10C ODD +20 301
>Jesse_M: ?ENOOTU 1M U.O +15 275
#note My play again sims very badly (an ugly 9th). I am surprised that 6 of the better simming plays have a U in the leave. I don't know about all of you, but at this point, if I keep a U, I'm almost certain to draw one (call me superstitious, but it's happened far too much to be funny anymore). The two plays it likes better than mine that dump the U are 4D OUT 12 and 4B (B)UTEO 20. I don't like OUT (I think keeping the T is better here, given the pool), and I'd only consider BUTEO for the 8 extra points it gives. I think having a T here is vital, and despite Quackle's opinion, I think getting rid of a U is necessary, so I actually still like my play...
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EJO 2F JO.E +27 328
>Jesse_M: ?AENNOT A1 NOTA +20 295
#note Quackle likes C2 ANON 14 best, and then C3 NONA and A1 NONA before my play. I don't like ANON. Both the NONA plays are good to dump the 2 Ns and avoid the duplication problem should I draw the last N. I think in retrospect I may agree with playing C3 NONA 20.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AR A8 .AR +3 331
>Jesse_M: ?BENNOU C2 EBON +19 314
#note Not only do I draw the other N, but the other U, too. Who called it? Game over.
