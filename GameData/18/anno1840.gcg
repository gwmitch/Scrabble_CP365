#note My play, although 2 points less than O1 WEStERN 88, sims roughly equal, and I like it better defensively than leaving WESTERNS as a possibility...

>Jesse_M: CHIKRTW 2B CH.W +29 207
#note There are 7 plays above mine, and only 2 I would consider...someone help me out? Quackle suggests 2A THR(E)W 27 (highest simming), TH(E)W 25, ICK(E)R 24 or TWI(E)R 18, C4 HICK 26, 3A WIT(H) 20 or WIC(H) 24 are all better than my play. Here's my thinking though: C4 HICK 26 can't be right; the possibility for CHICK/something ending in CH is just giving away points. 2A ICK(E)R 24 is suicidal, 3A WIT(H) 20 or 3A WIC(H) 24 allows op easy scoring with the W and leaves me with crap, 2A TWI(E)R 18 leaves 3W lane open and leaves me with no vowels. 2A THR(E)W 27 scores well and leaves ICK on my rack, which is a decent combo, so I'd consider that. 2B TH(E)W 25 scores well and leaves RICK on my rack. I understand that CK has great synergy, but I like keeping a T given that there is only one other in the pool. Basically, I wrote all that to say this: I don't know why all 7 of those plays are better than mine. I understand that I may not have made the best play, I just don't get all of the logic as to why the other ones are better. Most of them seem to leave all consonants as a leave. Is Quackle assuming that I will draw nearly all vowels next turn or something?

#note Struggled on this rack for a while. Quackle suggests that 10D LOUIS 21 or 10D IGLUS 22 are both slightly better. I know they're both 10 points more than my play, but shouldn't I be keeping an S for a bingo, should a bingo ending in S become a game decider?

#note It may be one of the lowest scoring bingo options, but I chose it intentionally, as it severely limits his bingo possibilities on the 3W lane. Quackle confirms, saying that my play will lead to a win roughly 95% of the time.
