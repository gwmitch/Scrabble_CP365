#note Quackle likes PUG in the same spot better. Are Ms better to keep than Ps? I would have thought Ps, and hence my decision...

>Jesse_M: EGNNOPS G7 P.NGO +22 58
#note My greediness shows. Rather than playing the highest simming 15C SPONGE 43, I opt to wait to use Row 15 later.

#note He laughed and challenged, thinking I was trying to pull a fast one on him. Much to his surprise, he lost his turn
>Jesse_M: ?AEFHKR 14H FAKE +28 194
#note Took one look at the rack and decided there wasn't a bingo. Should have looked anyway, as I missed one for 84...

#note I didn't even hold this, even though it looked funny to me. I saw that there were other bingo options available, and that he gave me a letter to play a bingo of my own, so didn't care and left it

#note I mistracked, thinking there were no Es left in the bag, so I didn't block the R. Instead, I added an S to DIPTERON knowing it was no good, and emptied the bag...
