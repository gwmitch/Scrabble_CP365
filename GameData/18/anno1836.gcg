>George_Rhyne: ADEMT 8D MATED +22 22
>Jason_Keller: CDEJQRX 8A CRE..... +39 39
#note When I looked at my opening rack in this game, I thought, GAH, but I found this and thought it would be a cute high-scoring start.  Best.
>George_Rhyne: DENOV 7G DOVEN +23 45
>Jason_Keller: DEEJNQX 9B EX +36 75
#note I think I was too concerned about holding onto an E here.  Q likes adding ED onto my play for 10 more points.
>George_Rhyne: ARY 6J YAR +29 74
>Jason_Keller: DEJLQRU E5 EQU.L +28 103
#note Finishes close to M3 JUREL and K5 J(AN)E, and I'm more comfortable dumping the Q and keeping the J.
>George_Rhyne: BOT 5K BOT +22 96
>Jason_Keller: DEJRRTY D1 JERRY +51 154
#note I figure I'm done with power tiles for this game...
>George_Rhyne: EGGINST 2B EG.STING +74 170
>Jason_Keller: DILPRTZ 4L DITZ +58 212
#note ...and I draw the Z!  Now just watch...  It gets better.
>George_Rhyne: FIR O1 FRI. +48 218
>Jason_Keller: KLPRUUU 10A UP +21 233
#note Three U's!  Instead of realizing to dump ULU here at 1F (best), I decide to get cute.  I'm also fixated on trying to hook at 8K.
>George_Rhyne: AANO 3J ANOA +19 237
>Jason_Keller: AAKLRUU 8K KRAAL +40 273
#note Once again, I want to score with that hook at 8K, and miss the chance to dump my remaining Us.
>George_Rhyne: OSW H1 S.OW +33 270
>Jason_Keller: AIIIPUU -IIIUU +0 273
#note Look at my super-awesome drawing skillz!  Q seems to like exchanging more than five tiles.  I personally don't.
>George_Rhyne: AFNST A10 .NFAST +39 309
#note Not that this matters, but note to self: study some UN- words.
>Jason_Keller: AGILNNP G7 ..PLANING +67 340
>George_Rhyne: EILM 15G .LIME +24 333
>Jason_Keller: ?EHIOOT 14I HOOTIEr +85 425
#note Not HOOTIEs.  Only bingo that plays.
>George_Rhyne: BU 2M BU. +16 349
>Jason_Keller: ADHIOUV O12 HO.A +30 455
#note Interesting here.  I understand that the suggestion is to leave one tile in the bag and I have the game, while I'm vulnerable to a bingo out if I empty the bag.  However, I think I'm more likely to bingo in this situation given his plays, and I see the A at 11G.  I mistracked and realized that if I can hit the double-double, and I thought I needed three of CST? (didn't realize all the T's were out), for it.  My play was also best in valuation on my sim.
