>Jesse_M: EINNPTT 4H .ITTEN +16 31
#note Don't know what possessed me to make this move over 5G P(A)INT 14...clearly better, and I even saw it before BITTEN. Just stupid...
>Lisa_Odom: IQ 3I QI +44 81
#note And rightfully so, I'm punished.

#note I was not certain of whether BAGGING took an S, so I took 6 less points than any of the bingos that played there.
>Lisa_Odom: TU B12 .UT +10 298
>Jesse_M: ADHIJLR 14F JIHAD +49 365
#note My play scores best, but sims behind 13I J(E)RID 42 and 13I J(E)HAD 48. I saw both, but reasoned that after Lisa's play of CUT, she likely had something very good, and I didn't want to just let her bingo on the bottom 3W line. JIHAD scores the most of all 3 plays and makes bingoing on the bottom very difficult.
>Lisa_Odom: OY 15H OY +35 333
>Jesse_M: ?ALLOOR 15D LOO +13 378
#note My play or 15E LO 11 accomplish the same blocking objective, and accordingly both sim highest.
>Lisa_Odom: DEEILOR 12I E. +2 335
>Jesse_M: ?ADLLRR 12H R..ARD +16 394
#note When I first saw my play, I saw that she had BIOCIDE through its D, so I looked for another play. I saw RETRAL in the same spot, which sims highest, but chickened out on it and looked for a play again. I saw RETARD again and forgot about BIOCIDE, and played it. Oops!
