>Heather_McCall: EMW 8G MEW +16 16
>Ryan_Fischer: EIINSUZ J8 SIZE +42 42
#note Embarassingly missing UNISIZE for 97.  It's been too long since I've reviewed power 7s, I guess.  It's one thing to be told a rack has a 7.  Another to find it all by yourself.
>Heather_McCall: EMOU K11 MOUE +20 36
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIINOU -EIOU +0 42
#note I put down IONIU(M) and then picked it up.  Quackle likes it best, but I don't know if I want to give up that much.  Hard to say.
>Heather_McCall: EEKP L9 KEEP +33 69
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFINOS J14 FA +26 68
#note Best, though ugly.
>Heather_McCall: AEPT M7 PEAT +19 88
>Ryan_Fischer: DEINNOS 15G DON. +15 83
#note Scores best of the dumps, takes the TLS, what's not to like?
>Heather_McCall: DOY 14F YOD +21 109
>Ryan_Fischer: EIILNSV F10 VEIN. +19 102
#note After 750 spins 4-ply it's VILE, VINE, or EVIL sidelapping PEAT.  I don't like it.  Too many comebacks.  Mine is 4th, and I'll take it, though IV(Y) for 9 keeping EILNS is interesting.  Didn't sim as well but definitely leaves possibilities.
>Heather_McCall: IIIII -IIIII +0 109
>Ryan_Fischer: GILNOSY 12A YOGIN. +28 130
#note I looked for a while at 13C and couldn't quite come up with GIN(N)Y, the best play by far.  YO E11 is silly but functional.  My play is way down on the list.  Don't understand why.  I guess Ys in the 3WS column are easy to score to.
>Heather_McCall: EHRW B10 WH.RE +38 147
#note I guess that's another reason why YOGIN(I) wasn't great.
>Ryan_Fischer: AIILRST 11D LI.R +14 144
#note I've played LIST(E)RIA to an A, but guess it's easier to miss through an E.  Oh well.  Foolproof way of absolving this is either hammering home alphagrams or associating stems with certain words.  For instance, I used to have trouble finding SCENARIO, but no amount of blunt trauma to the head will ever make me forget that it's simply ERASION+C.  For LISTERIA, it's AEIILRST -- SALTIER+I.
>Heather_McCall: ATU A8 UTA +14 161
>Ryan_Fischer: AIIISTT -IIT +0 144
#note My punishment for missing the bingo.
>Heather_McCall: BCO 7F COB +17 178
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAILST C4 SoLATIA +64 208
#note And to think, I could've had two.  No, Quackle, the N2 placement is NOT very smart.  Why I opted to take 8 less points -- this position is much safer.
>Heather_McCall: EOR A12 .ORE +25 203
>Ryan_Fischer: EEHJNSV N9 EH +34 242
#note I thought for a good long while on this rack, and it's what got me into time trouble.  I wanted to save the H for a 50-point play at N10, but I also wanted to lose the J.  I figured, well, how about I take this spot now and set up my S-hook for the J?  If she has an S, I can play JE(S)S(E) for 40 or so instead on my next turn at 4A.  I think my reasoning is sound, as I can score more with the J/S combo by waiting.
>Heather_McCall: AGOT N4 TOGA +13 216
>Ryan_Fischer: EIJNSVX O7 XI +39 281
#note Tragedy of tragedies, she blocks JINXES O4 84 for the game.  :(  The Quackster says I should dump my S now for an extra 11 points.  Probably a good idea considering a lack of places to play them now.
>Heather_McCall: DGIR D2 GRID +18 234
>Ryan_Fischer: EJNRRSV 7B R.J +10 291
#note (FE)VER is probably best, as I don't know if she's stumbled onto the other S yet.  R(A)J isn't that bad though considering my lack of vowels.
>Heather_McCall: ACLT M12 TALC +17 251
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ENORSV 14A ..V +6 297
#note I wasted what was left of my already low time trying to find something here.  It isn't as easy as it looks.  Only 4 semi-hard bingos play: CONVERTS, CONVERSO, OVERSOON, and RUNOVERS.
>Heather_McCall: ABIN O1 BANI +24 275
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ENOQRS O10 SuQ +28 325
#note My fish yields the Q.  I see CONQUERS, no go.  So much for building up spread here.
>Heather_McCall: AEFLTUU H13 U.. +4 279
>Ryan_Fischer: EEINORU 2A ROU.E +12 337
#note Pretty bad play, giving her a good comeback.
>Heather_McCall: ADFLNST A1 D.AFTS +42 321
#note She plays the S for an extra three points here.  Wonder if she just picked it up?
>Ryan_Fischer: EIN 14M .IE +6 343
#note Missed (J)IN for 16.
>Heather_McCall: LN O14 .L +6 327
>Ryan_Fischer: N H7 ..N +5 348
#note Phew.
>Ryan_Fischer:  (N) +2 350
#note Note to self: Play faster.
