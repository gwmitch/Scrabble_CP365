#note This is apparently a silicon mistake, althought I doubt I'd play it any differently if you told me sim results ahead of time. Quackle likes either VENA or GANEV, and I can only see myself considering the latter here.

#note I was anticipating Sam would try to screw up Quadrant I, and thought of the possibility of a Y popping at the end of a horizontal play through FORENAME. It would've given me a really interesting choice. Sometimes I'm able to will that key tile onto the board, but my aim isn't always so sharp.

#note BLEAK is better. I think I convinced myself I liked ABS over EGS on this board, but I'm not sure it's true and even if true, I'm not sure it matters enough.

#note Eh. Just play MAGOT.
>Sam: AHHPY L8 HYPHA +49 526
>Phil: ADEIOST -  +0 353
#note Desperation challenged. Oddly, HYPHAE looked vaguely familiar, but this looked just unfamiliar enough to provoke me. Hoped it might be one of those oddballs like AGAPAE, but I guess that would imply HYPHE* which looks even worse.

#note After the bad challenge I lost all confidence in my word knowledge and couldn't try the HYPHAE hook. I couldn't even remember if GITE took an ess at this point. Bleh.
