#note Of course, taking the extra two points is not a serious option because of the F hook.
>Chuck: ?DDIRSS L3 DRuID.SS +68 68
#note Stylin' bingo by Armstrong.  Surprisingly, there are only two bingos with this seemingly promising rack.
>Dave: ELOOQRT 5I TOQ.E +26 96
#note I was a bit torn about whether to play TOQUE or ROQUE here.  The leave is a bit better with TOQUE, but ROQUE keeps the T for a play on column N.  I decided this early in the game on an open board it was better to maximize my leave.
>Chuck: INWY 3I WIN.Y +32 100
>Dave: AILORUX 9B UXORIAL +78 174
#note How often does drawing AIUX lead to a bingo?
>Chuck: GHI 10A GHI +37 137
>Dave: ACLOOTV 2F VOCAL +29 203
#note I missed one nicer play here: OCTAVO, which goes best at 4D.  Still, I was very happy with how much my play started to block the board.
>Chuck: ABP 6H BAP +25 162
>Dave: EFHNOTW 10H FOHN. +25 228
#note An interesting moment.  Of course I saw the natural play HOWF M10, which is best from a pure points and leave perspective, but I noticed that the board was starting to get very blocked.  I thought it was a good moment to take control of the board and not give Chuck much to play through.  However, it probably would have been better to do this by EFT 10E, which takes out the E column.  As it stands now, Chuck basically has one shot at column E before I block it up making comebacks very difficult.

>Chuck: NOO F11 ONO +17 205
#note Not a happy move for Chuck to have to make, but I guess he was dealing with a lot of one pointers.
>Dave: AADEETW 12A ATWA.. +20 274
#note Again, board shape and turnover seem more important than maximizing score and leave here.  The high equity plays are things like WAE D12 here, but no way am I going to do that especially when his last play insinuates he might be close to a bingo.  If he is going to bingo, I want him to do it on row 14, both to minimize his score and give me high scoring comebacks.  My move also has the virtue of reducing scores on column A by taking out the bonus square.  (e.g., GAZERS)
>Chuck: ITU N5 TUI +19 224
>Dave: ADEEELO O7 DEE +15 289
#note Before Chuck's play I was all set to play ELODEA 7B, both to take out the bingo line and to sprint toward the end of the game.  But given the inferences from Chuck's last two moves, it seemed very important to take out O column bingos here.  I was tempted to play only DE to avoiding giving him another bingo spot, but I do not like playing this way.  One of the problems with getting too defensive like that is that you can wreck your own rack enough that you don't score well for a few moves and allow the opponent to catch up without a bingo.  In situations like this, it is important to score what you can and keep running out the tiles, even while opting sometimes not to take the highest scoring plays if they are too volatile.  Besides, I am still making sure that any bingo gives me comebacks to a TWS.
>Chuck: EO 13B OE +16 240
>Dave: AAELOPT 12K TOEA +11 300
#note Again sacrificing a lot of points by not playing at row 14, but turning over the tiles as quickly as I can and cutting off a bingo line.
>Chuck: EY 14B YE +28 268
>Dave: AALNPRZ 15C PLANAR +36 336
#note See, this is a moment when I might not have had six tile play to the triple if I had neglected my leave too much on the last couple of turns.
>Chuck: ARSUV O1 VARUS +42 310
>Dave: BCEEKNZ 14G ZEBECK +38 374
#note Chuck immediately said, "Nice play."  That felt good.
>Chuck: IIMNRST 15L INTI +22 332
#note REMS/ZEBECK is best for spread.
>Dave: ?MNT G1 T.MaN +9 383
#note MaNAT N9 is one more point.
>Dave:  (MRS) +10 393
