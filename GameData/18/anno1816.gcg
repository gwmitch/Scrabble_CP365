#note thanks again to evan for providing his racks.
>Jesse_Day: AGLSTTW 9E TWAT +16 16
#note I didn't really like any of the plays that used the S, and this seemed best among the remaining plays...but maybe just WAT is better despite leaving four consonants, because it doesn't give him a play to the triple. WATTS, TWATS, WAT and TWAT all run about even in the sim. Evan chastised me for my obscene language after this play.
>Evan_Berofsky: EEEMPSW 8A PEWEE +35 53
#note evan accidentally showed me his S here.
>Jesse_Day: AEGIJLS K5 JIGS +34 50
#note there's a pretty play available here which I didn't consider - JIGSAW to the W. Actually, after seeing his S I think I settled a little too quickly on a play on the K column. In a regular sim JIG is about 3 worse than JETLAG, with JEE at B6 and JIGSAW somewhere in between. Adding in the inference of the S bunches them all together to within statistical insignificance, with JEE maybe a little bit ahead. So basically, the question should be - what kind of board do I want against evan? my answer is that I would much rather close it down if possible, which rules JIGSAW out and discourages me from making a play like JEE. He simply knows more words than I do - there's no need to play to his strength. As far as JETLAG, it's an interesting play because it means that I still have a place to cash the S, but I also know that he could use it, hence why it drops a little in the sim (I think). And EIS seems weak on a board with a lot of open vowels. I still like JIGS, but I would love to hear some feedback.

>Jesse_Day: AIIITUV I3 VIATI. +16 171
#note a huge mistake on my part, after playing well up until this point. I think that it would be worth taking IU for 16 points in a vacuum, but here it sets up essentially the only good lane on the board, and IU is a terrible place to start a rack to respond to a bingo on the top file. Maybe he doesn't have the A for AVIATIC, but with five turns to groom his rack for a bingo this sabotages my previous attempts to close the board down. quackle likes it in a sim, and likes AIT at D11 about equally, which I didn't consider, but I think an exchange is in order. AIT might be ok though...
>Evan_Berofsky: AEINOSV 2G EVASION +74 187
#note I might just be biased against VIATIC because of his next play, though.
>Jesse_Day: EGIOUYZ 1L YOGI +47 218
#note I luck out with a great draw.
>Evan_Berofsky: ?AEIORS 1A ERASIOn +72 259
#note there's a better bingo available...can you find it? Give you a hint: it's pretty hard, or Evan would've seen it. however, it wouldn't have rhymed, so this is the more stylish play.
>Jesse_Day: AEMNOUZ C13 ZA +55 273
#note as a hint, his best bingo would've blocked this play.
>Evan_Berofsky: DEEFOOT 3L DOTE +23 282
#note Fine, I'll just tell you - he had FEODARIES.
>Jesse_Day: AELMNOU 2A MELON +28 301
#note not good staticly, but wins by a mile on the sim.
>Evan_Berofsky: EFILORU 6D .OIL +18 300
>Jesse_Day: AGHINTU F9 .AUGHT +27 328
#note now it gets really interesting. I completely forgot that WAUGH was a word. All of the fishing plays have a good static value but quickly lose steam in a sim. Anyway, WAUGH and WAUGHT are pretty much inseparable in a sim. WAUGH seems more volatile because it could give evan an otherwise unavailable bingo on this board. Also, the eses are gone, so WAUGHT isn't dangerous on that count. I need some outside input on this one - what should I do? I think the utility of the T is counterbalanced by taking another shot at the blank and the three points - the T doesn't hurt to expose because there's already one up top...but he could use the blank to score on the triple...
>Evan_Berofsky: EFPRRTU 3A EFT +29 329
#note kind of a neutral play that doesn't tell me all that much, except that he probably didn't have the Q before making it.
>Jesse_Day: DHINORX 4N OX +36 364
#note wow. quite the position. my first thought was that I would lose no matter what if he hits a Q play down from the E - EQUIPS, EQUERRY or the like...perhaps that shouldn't have been my biggest worry, but if he just picked up the Q and he had the blank then blocking up there forces him to deal with the Q his next turn. So my only two sane blocks are dropping the X and playing OX, and while I agonized over it for a long time, I basically just decided that just dropping the X didn't score enough to win. so that's where ox came from. added bonuses were that he can't q stick me (QADI at the bottom left), and it's not guaranteed that he'd get me with an out in two. Maybe this is why WAUGHT could've been a mistake - it gives him big scoring plays with the blank. Quackle takes almost five minutes to analyze this position, thanks to the blank, and comes up with a crazy play as its favorite - THIR at 6I, winning 42% of the time versus the 33% of OX, which is second. To which my answer has to be - wtf?!?! anyone who can explain this play to me will receive a reward. Actually, I put a whole lot of work into analyzing this position after writing that last sentence, and I think I've got it. It comes down to me being able to hit three big plays: EXODOI if I hit the O, DIGOXIN if I draw the I, and either of those/EXONIC if I hit the blank (as well as lucky draws such as EP, which gives EXPEND.) Basically, unless I draw the Q, then even with the blank he has his hands full blocking my big play (if I draw it), and he usually can't score enough to dump the Q and pull out the win. Wow. I don't know if I ever would've seen that. Incidentally, given my actual draw, THIR does win...	
>Evan_Berofsky: EIOPRRU O3 ..PIRER +48 377
#note wow! Pulling Q? out of the bag was one of the craziest turns of events ever. but I was pretty sure that I was safe until he came up with this amazing play to steal the game back by one!
>Jesse_Day: ?DHINQR -  +0 364
#note OU goes out on the left for seven points, and my best play is...let's see, QIs is 34, which puts me up and makes it a two point win for him! I miscounted and thought it was a tie at first, but when I realized it was a loss I looked for my better play, and then was forced to challenge. Here's the thing - I HAD a better play, but it was only 1 better, so it was still a loss! it's not a hard play - just TRANQ at 14F. Not sure why I didn't think of it, but I would've been kicking myself had it been enough. Still, what a fantastic game.
>Evan_Berofsky: OU A7 U.O +7 384
#note he wasn't positive that it was good, though I was pretty sure, but he got it! Made me question EX for allowing EXPIRE, but it just never even occurred to me during my decision making.
>Evan_Berofsky:  (?DHINQR) +38 422
#note What a great game. Ironically, I forgot the next day what had happened in our game while talking to evan, which is kinda hilarious because this was probably my best-played game at all of nationals (9 equity lost, 8 on the crazy preendgame), pretty exciting stuff, and a loss to a really good opponent who made a superb play to pull out the win. What more could you want?
