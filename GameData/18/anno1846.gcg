>Jesse_Day: ADDFIVW 8G VID +14 14
#note I'm surprised how poorly VID does relative to the best play, which is VAW. I suppose the hook makes it too easy for him to score and makes it worth incurring the awkward DDFI.
>Rob_Robinsky: AIILLSV F6 VIAL +23 23
#note thanks to binsky for providing his racks, which I'm sure will demonstrate that he played better than I did.
>Jesse_Day: ADEFMOW 7H MOW +17 31
#note I saw the static equity winner, MEADOW, but it just didn't seem worth giving back such a lucrative triple spot, even with the F in hand. I would think that MOW would be about level with FEW, which sims best by far, but quackle hates MOW by comparison. FEW is a little bit more defensive positionally and it doesn't take any hooks versus the two of MOW, and that alone accounts for all 6 points of equity that separate the two plays (in other words, it's all because of lackluster defense). Also, I overscored my play by one.
>Rob_Robinsky: EILNNSU K5 LUNE +17 40
>Jesse_Day: AADEFIT L8 FATED +35 66
#note debated playing TAFIA here, and while it's competitive just taking the points is better. Interesting to note that AI is only three points better than AA...I've never understood why people dislike the AA combination so much.
>Rob_Robinsky: GILNNOS L1 LINGO +16 56
#note rob plays a really elegant game. LOGIN is available here, but I suspect that he made his play to counterbalance the volatility at the bottom-right with his own opening.
>Jesse_Day: ADEIRTT M7 ATTIRED +86 152
#note lucky he didn't have the tiles to play here. Note that the bottom-right corner is juicy enough that DETRITAL isn't worth considering. Rob seemed pretty frustrated after my play.
>Rob_Robinsky: ADEINOS 1L .OID +15 71
#note oh, that's why he was frustrated. Quackle leaves have it that EINS is a bunch better than AENS, hence why quackle likes plays like ADO. I don't know whether to agree or not.
>Jesse_Day: BEEOORR 3I BOR.E +20 172
#note with plays at the bottom-right out of the question, my play does best, even though it looks anemic and gives him another sevens lane. A way to avoid that would've been playing BOOMIER through MI, which I didn't think about at all; it does worse in a sim but even on win percentage, which suggests to me that it's more proactive about controlling the board and probably the better play.
>Rob_Robinsky: AEIMNOS O1 .OMAINES +86 157
>Jesse_Day: EEIILOR N11 REOIL +20 192
#note My play looks pretty bad, but there are some redeeming factors - he just played a bingo, so his rack will be worse than at any other time, and it's the highest scoring play on the board. if I'd thought harder I would've thought about something like VIE, but EILOR only hits bingos on the board about 30% of the time anyway, suggesting that I should take the points. The other reasonable plays are OILI(ER), which gives back a triple, and OILIER up top one short of the double word score, which just seems stupid. The game goes a little crazy for a few turns hereafter.
>Rob_Robinsky: AHJQSUX 2H HAJ +58 215
#note possibly the greatest leave of all time. Yes, the Q does suck.
>Jesse_Day: CEEHIKP 1E CHEEK +66 258
#note so many big plays available with my great draw!
>Rob_Robinsky: AOQSTUX 15J TAXO.S +63 278
>Jesse_Day: BEFGIPR 14I FIB +18 276
#note this isn't even that close - the play is GIBE at the same because it scores a lot more than my play and closes down the best lane on the board with two blanks unseen.
>Rob_Robinsky: ACEOQUZ 6B ZOUA.E +38 316
#note even though my play was actually really dumb, he should probably play something like COZ at the bottom to make bingos harder.
>Jesse_Day: ?EGPRUY 13C GYPlURE +84 360
#note of course, I get lucky and pull the blank. This was probably my best find at nationals. Unfortunately, too many of my friends know the whole dictionary, so no one was particulary impressed when I casually mentioned this play in the lunchtime banter. 
>Rob_Robinsky: CNNQRWY C5 C.RNY +15 331
#note a pretty interesting decision on his part. His chances are really low anyway, but I guess his thought was to block any bingos and hope to draw the blank and tough it out in the endgame.
>Jesse_Day: ?AESTTU 10D UpSTATE +70 430
#note doesn't matter, but I completely dismissed plays at the top like TAUTEST. However, quackle actually thinks UPSTATE wins more games - I guess the spot at the bottom is easier for him to hit than one ending at the top in SE (no T left) - in fact, there are no possible bingos up top if I play UPSTATE, whereas he could hit INSANER, RASPIER or WASPIER out of the tile pool available. But none of those actually ends up winning! what is going on?!
>Rob_Robinsky: AGINQSW N5 QI +28 359
>Jesse_Day: ENPR O12 PEN. +25 455
#note for whatever reason, I decided not to block his out. I can't remember why not.
>Rob_Robinsky: AGNSW 4E GNAWS +23 382
>Rob_Robinsky:  (R) +2 384
#note While most of my moves in the middle of the game were pretty good, it's still hard to feel that I did anything but get lucky to win this game, especially with FIB, which should've cost me but instead gave me the game. But I did have to make a good find to seal the deal. It was at least encouraging that I was able to recover from the debacle...sorry, game against Webster Phillips and play a solid game.
