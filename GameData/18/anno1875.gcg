#note alright, forget about the last game, just make plays...
>Mike_Baron: ACDEUUV 9H DUCE +21 21
#note mike told me his rack after the game, and I came up with what I thought was the best play - COUVADE through the O. But quackle doesn't think it's quite so cut and dry. What do you think?
>Jesse_Day: AEHMPTW K8 H.MP +22 48
#note yikes, maybe I was still thinking about the kenji game after all. just couldn't see WHEAT for the life of me. This might be the biggest miss I had all tournament that wasn't a bingo or a phony.
>Mike_Baron: AOZ 10F ZOA +36 57
>Jesse_Day: AAAETTW 11E TAW +28 76
#note all of a sudden I'm struck by a sudden moment of deja-vu - did I already sim this position? Existential crises aside, my play is about level with TWAE at the same spot.
>Mike_Baron: AENV 8K .AVEN +36 93
#note now, if I'd just played WHEAT there...
>Jesse_Day: AAEENTT L10 EAT +14 90
#note nevermind, I think I did sim this game! But why would I do that? Also, how would I not notice that I missed WHEAT? this is the best play, incidentally.
>Mike_Baron: BCKOU 12A BUCKO +34 127
#note a bold move given my last play, but the B is a pretty low probability letter...
>Jesse_Day: ?AEEINT C6 pATIEN.E +72 162
#note unless you draw this kind of rack! I think I saw this position while trying to determine if I had a triple-triple or not with quackle. I spent ages looking (closest is THEBAINE) but there really is nothing there. I saw plays like VENETIAN to the triple, but for some reason went with PATIENCE again, thinking that I was closing the board...huh?
>Mike_Baron: EF B10 FE. +29 156
>Jesse_Day: ADGILUU O7 U.GUAL +8 170
#note this might be one of the plays from nationals that I'm proudest of. I don't care how it sims - basically, the game is even, I have a crappy rack and Mike just fished or semi-fished. Given the board dynamics, the easiest spot to hit is clearly the E or the N. UNGUAL plays through the garbage on my rack, and blocks the best two lanes. I certainly saw quackle's favorite of BAUD, but why do I want a 27 point lead with GILU on a wide-open board? Added bonus is that he might challenge UNGUAL if I did block something. you can tell me if I'm just being stupid, but I would play this again any day of the week. He did in fact hold me for a while.
>Mike_Baron: EIIRSTT 6B S.ITTIER +61 217
>Mike_Baron: EIIRSTT --  -61 156
#note I know that this just happens to be how it worked out, but he would've had NITRITES if I didn't block.
>Jesse_Day: ADEIIJS 8A JE. +30 200
#note added bonus of this play is that a fairly high amount of the time I hit a play on column D for 30-some.
>Mike_Baron: EIIRSTT M11 TI +9 165
#note why not at 7F?
>Jesse_Day: ADIIRSS D4 IRIDS +30 230
#note he has an I and an R, so those two letters aren't so bad.
>Mike_Baron: EIIRSST 7G IS +14 179
#note so that's mike's actual rack. can you tell me what he missed?
>Jesse_Day: AAEGORS 13G AGAROSE +80 310
#note Mike missed IRITISES! As far as my play, better lucky than good, as my dad always says (no joke, that's one of his old standbys)
>Mike_Baron: EINRSTY A12 .YRE +27 206
#note his rack is something like this.
>Jesse_Day: BDGNQWY F4 WYND +17 327
#note blocks the biggest remaining spot on the board, the double-double. quackle agrees.
>Mike_Baron: INPST C2 NIP +14 220

#note up by this much there's no reason to play paranoid and not take the points.
>Mike_Baron: ?ANORST 1H .ARONeTS +80 308
#note the cutest play of the entire nationals!
>Jesse_Day: IILLMOR L4 MILI. +14 405
#note not that it matters, but this play is complete garbage. I should play LIMO over on the left, because MILIA gives back plays like...
>Mike_Baron: DEEHRTV 5I THR.VED +28 336
#note ...this one.
>Jesse_Day: ELOR 14G LROE +17 422
>Jesse_Day: ELOR --  -17 405
#note no, seriously, I actually played this. Tried to be all nonchalant and play upside-down. nice one, jd.
>Mike_Baron: E J5 .E +7 343
>Mike_Baron:  (ELOR) +8 351
#note wow, I forgot a note my first time through the game. Basically, I played this one averagely, but I think that one good play completely changed the course of the game. What do you think?
