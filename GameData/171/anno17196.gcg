>Siddharth_Murali: DEGIIRX 8D GRIDE +18 18
#note Saw XI immediately, but I wanted to go for an extremely low entropy game against Mark. I'd do this over 10 times out of 10.
>Mark_S.: AEILP 7C PEAL +16 16
>Mark_S.: AEILP --  -16 0
>Siddharth_Murali: DFGIRTX F6 FR.G +16 34
#note Given the partial rack, FRIG sims best. Both GRIFT's are also worth consideration. I hoped he would just play to the left giving me a good X spot, but I didn't know he had an I.
>Mark_S.: AEILP E3 PALIE. +23 23
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEOOTX 9F .OX +25 59
#note No OXO, no EXPO. I kept telling myself, I want low entropy against Mark. This is really good anyway.
>Mark_S.: MOSTT 10B MOTTS +26 49
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEEIOT D2 DOTE +20 79
#note Struggled on this turn. This is what I mean- the top plays all have extremely high entropy- IOTA, ADO(P)TEE, TO(P)EE, O(P)IATE, OE, (T)OEA, which is a bit lower, O(P)IATED, etc. Yes, DOTE takes a hit in leave, it's 3% off, but I think it's really important to tune the game to the opponent. As long as I'm not providing stupidly easy scoring opportunities, I feel like I have an edge over Mark. After looking at the position for a while, I'd make the same play over and over.
>Mark_S.: ACETU C2 ACUTE +37 86
#note I did get burned here, but I feel I'm still in decent shape with the board as it is compared to other plays on my previous move.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEINRRS 7H SIERRAN +69 148
>Mark_S.: AENW 6J WEAN +34 120
>Siddharth_Murali: EGHINSV K5 V..SING +44 192
>Mark_S.: PUY 8M YUP +32 152
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ADEFHT B6 FEH +30 222
#note I should have played FA or FAD. This time, my focus was more about scoring and clogging the board rather than providing an easy scoring spot, but FEH is probably unnecessary.
>Mark_S.: JLST C9 J.LTS +40 192
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ADLOTU A7 OUD +29 251
#note No bingos. DUO is an extra point.
>Mark_S.: HO B1 OH +24 216
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ABLORT O8 .ORTABLe +86 337
#note PORTABLY is slightly better.
>Mark_S.: AEK J9 KEA +22 238
#note First laid down KAE for 28, then switched to this. I think I can put him on a strong rack.
>Siddharth_Murali: ACINNOW 14L COA. +12 349
#note Why not. I had to manually enter it into the sim. Q likes it, doesn't love it.
>Mark_S.: QU 13C .UQ +12 250
#note Fortunately for me, he can't get rid of his crap without destroying the board further.
>Siddharth_Murali: EIIINNW 12L INI. +8 357
#note Really my only option.
>Mark_S.: ELZ I11 LEZ +26 276
>Siddharth_Murali: EEINVWY 12F WIV. +14 371
#note IVY looks good. Missed it. I was also extremely low on time.
>Mark_S.: ?M D13 .M +4 280
>Siddharth_Murali: BEEIINY 14D .INI +19 390
#note 100% win. I was very scared.
>Mark_S.: ?ADENOR 15E sANED +30 310
#note Turns out, he had multiple bingos with a P or an M had i not blocked.
>Siddharth_Murali: ABEEY F2 YE +21 411
#note 7 seconds left.
>Mark_S.: OR G2 OR +18 328
