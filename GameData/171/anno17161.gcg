>Seth: DEIRUWW -DEIR +0 0
>JD: AENSSTT -S +0 0
#note I exchanged the S because I thought there was a decent chance he would exchange again, and AENSTT hits more bingos than just AENSST. but AENSST is much better for 8s, so not sure. I could also toss ST.
>Seth: CEOPUWW -CEOPU +0 0
#note !
>JD: AELNSTT 8C TALENTS +66 66
>Seth: AADFRY D3 FARAD.Y +28 28
>JD: AACENOT C2 COTAN +30 96
#note I liked playing COTAN here because it takes out some lanes and really cheap scoring opportunities, but given that TA for 9 hits a bingo 74% of the time, the fish must be right.
>Seth: BEN E4 NEB +24 52
>JD: AAEPSSV 10B VAS +29 125
#note sets up the K hook, but I liked that because that hook often gets missed and it could come in handy down the road.
>Seth: ?ADHILN H1 HANDLIs. +89 141
#note held for a bit
>JD: AAENNPS 9F NA +8 133
#note I missed the VASA hook here, LEAN is definitely best with tons of Es left. I did like NA in this placement to set up a nice bingo lane for myself.
>Seth: TUZ 5H .UTZ +26 167
>JD: AEINPQS F2 QIS +36 169
#note even after burning my S my bingo percentage is still 24% thanks to row 10.

>JD: DEEIPPR 11I REPP +23 215
#note I hated opening the easy triple by playing on row 7, but if I put an I there by playing PIP then it's not dangerous at all (the F is the only scary tile there and they're all gone already). my play is not really any more defensive, since it opens up new bingo lanes, and bingos way less, making it a major error.
>Seth: AGII B10 .IGIA +18 229
>JD: DEIILOX 12J DIEL +29 244
#note why not ILEX here? must be worth the points. bad mistake.
>Seth: DEU 11E DUE +14 243
>JD: CIIORWX 7K XI +28 272
#note I was worried about opening S hooks (probably too worried since there's only one left) but this seems most likely to work itself into a useful draw.
>Seth: HORSTVW -HORST +0 243
>JD: CEIOORW 13K CROW +34 306
#note WOO looks scary but only the S and blank go there. the unbalanced leave after CROW cannot be better.

#note his best play
>JD: O 3H .O +6 377
#note I had plenty of chances to get ahead in this game but made some really questionable plays that blew up my leave, like  REPP, DIEL and CROW. I didn't deserve to win this one, but luckily for me I got to play Mike in the last game for the title anyway.
