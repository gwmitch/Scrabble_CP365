>zar: AEGLMRS 8H GLEAM +22 22
#note zar probably telegraphed his rack much more than I had realized on this play, he was agonizing between GLAM and GLEAM. he could also exchange. The fact that the decision is close probably means that he has two more consonants, and also that they're quite likely one-pointers.
>JD: ?BDNNNO 9K BOND +16 16
#note not a good miss here, NONBRAND is a major upgrade. tough find. with the blank in hand I figured opening the triple was reasonable, but again his leave from last turn should scare me a bit.
>zar: DEIINRS O7 INSIDER +85 107
#note my inability to find nonbrand hurt me here, although he still had residing

#note tough to pass up 13 more points for JEHU but EHIRS bingoes wayyyyy more (51% v 9%)
>zar: ABEORST I2 SORTAB.E +65 231
#note cesar missed agleam and also missed taborets here
>JD: DEHIORS J6 HO. +31 173
#note awful whiff on a natural here, I talked myself into passing up DISHORSE# (the csw anagram) but somehow never found the TWL 8. I should play HO at J10 anyway to avoid blocking my lanes.
>zar: AEMNORU 2B ENAMOUR. +74 305
#note huge swing, if I find hidroses he said he didn't see agleam!

>JD: ELQSTUV 5A QUEST +37 377
#note I should really be blocking PEDICURE on the bottom row which he has with any remaining tile in the bag. I also block DEPICTER and DECIPHER. QUEST also has the disadvantage of giving up EQUIPPED for 110 if I draw the C.
