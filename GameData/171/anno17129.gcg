>zar: AEGLMRS 8H GLEAM +22 22
#note jesse: zar probably telegraphed his rack much more than I had realized on this play, he was agonizing between GLAM and GLEAM. he could also exchange. The fact that the decision is close probably means that he has two more consonants, and also that they're quite likely one-pointers. cesar: Quackle does like GLAM better. I wanted to play that, but then I miscalculated GLEAM as scoring 24 points and hit the clock, then realized my mistake. My Quackle-fu must be pretty decent as GLEAM is about 1 point worse than GLAM! (-1)
>JD: ?BDNNNO 9K BOND +16 16
#note not a good miss here, NONBRAND is a major upgrade. tough find. with the blank in hand I figured opening the triple was reasonable, but again his leave from last turn should scare me a bit.
>zar: DEIINRS O7 INSIDER +85 107
#note my inability to find nonbrand hurt me here, although he still had residing
>JD: ?AENNNY M9 .ANNY +16 32
>zar: AAEIOTU K8 ..OITEAU +20 127
>JD: ?EENTTX N1 EXTENTs +81 113
>zar: ABEHIOT O1 HI +39 166
>JD: EHIJRSY 14J J.Y +29 142
#note tough to pass up 13 more points for JEHU but EHIRS bingoes wayyyyy more (51% v 9%)
>zar: ABEORST I2 SORTAB.E +65 231
#note jd: cesar missed agleam and also missed taborets here. cesar: not a good job; ABEORSTT didn't look familiar. (-14) also AGLEAM didn't even occur to me even when i played GLEAM.
>JD: DEHIORS J6 HO. +31 173
#note awful whiff on a natural here, I talked myself into passing up DISHORSE# (the csw anagram) but somehow never found the TWL 8. I should play HO at J10 anyway to avoid blocking my lanes.
>zar: AEMNORU 2B ENAMOUR. +74 305
#note jd: huge swing, if I find hidroses he said he didn't see agleam! cesar: i think i have about a 10% chance of finding AGLEAM if he bingos. my heart was set on MOUNTER before HOE came down (assuming he had blocked the top bingo lane). quackle prefers G2 NEUROMA (-3). Also i screwed up, NEUROMAS is better than ENAMOURS because the overlap at the left would hurt more.
>JD: DEILRSW D1 W.DI +24 197
>zar: ACDOPRT 3C A.OPT +33 338
#note 4H prorated is the awesome play here! 1A PROW is also very good. (-2)
>JD: AEILORS H8 .ASOLIER +82 279
>zar: CDELORZ 10C CLOZE. +37 375
>JD: AFIKSUW G7 WAK. +41 320
>zar: DGGIIRR 13C GRIGR. +18 393
#note equity-wise i'm giving up a bit by not playing GRIGRI at K1, but win% is all that matters here and 13C wins it, just barely. YMMV.
>JD: FIQSTUV 4K FIV. +20 340
#note fish for the miracle Q bingo
>zar: ?ADEFIU 11E FA +31 424
#note yes, i saw FADO. didn't realize it scored 50. i didn't want to empty the bag though. i wonder why quackle doesn't take that into consideration, as it's saying FADO is like a million points better.
>JD: ELQSTUV 5A QUEST +37 377
#note I should really be blocking PEDICURE on the bottom row which he has with any remaining tile in the bag. I also block DEPICTER and DECIPHER. QUEST also has the disadvantage of giving up EQUIPPED for 110 if I draw the C.
>zar: ?CDEIPU 15B PEDICU.e +64 488
