#note I would be scared of me playing NIB if I were steve, and he had been playing really defensively, but it would still be worth doing as a diversion. this increases his bingo percentage too much.

#note tough call, ONO leaves me with a better leave with an ugly pool out there. quackle likes goo at 7A too, but it's a close enough game that I don't want to sacrifice too many points.

#note steve decided to play really fast since I was super-low on time at this point, but letting me plan an out-in-two to win.

#note I was under huge time pressure, but this is my second-best play, second only to VROUW which is clearly better.
