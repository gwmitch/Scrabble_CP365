>Dorcas_Alexander: EIMORRS I8 .RIMROSE +64 64
>Steve_Grob: ADEEEEE 11E ADEE. +16 32
#note Q likes exchanging, and a sim shows a close race between keeping DE or ADE.
>Dorcas_Alexander: AEIKLNT 14C LANKIE.T +74 138
#note FWIW, Q likes ANTILE(A)K at E5 a little bit more.
>Steve_Grob: EEEHIRS 15H H.IR +38 70
#note The simulation from this rack is a testament to King Leave. The highest scoring play is not the best play, and the best play isn't the next highest play or the play after that. The best play, according to a sim, is HIREE for 26 at 12A. And even more surprising to me, is that 15A HEIR, which scores 29, is preferred over my 38 point play.
>Dorcas_Alexander: CGI 15B CIG +15 153
>Steve_Grob: DEEEOOS 11E .....ED +22 92
#note C-Player is consistent, again choosing leave over points. 12I RODEO best for 12, and exchanging four and keeping DES is (a)deemed better than my play.
>Dorcas_Alexander: EFW 10H W.FE +39 192
#note Deserved that, stepping right into it.
>Steve_Grob: EENOOST 9F OE +9 101
#note So much for consistency. Now that I go for leave, Q likes 12E TONE(R). Tis a funny game.
>Dorcas_Alexander: EORZ 12C ZERO +31 223
>Steve_Grob: EIMNOST K3 MOISTEN.. +74 175
#note Look ma, a nine. Was ready to play at 12A before she took the spot.
>Dorcas_Alexander: OVX L2 VOX +48 271
>Steve_Grob: AADERUW E5 AWARD +22 197
#note 2L VAW edges out the pretty WADER for 29 at 10B.

NB: misscored as 24 in the actual game.

>Dorcas_Alexander: ?EIOSSU M9 SErIOUS +70 361
#note 82-pt. bingo available in the O-file. Good luck with that. I'll post the answer after the next play for those that want a crack at it.
>Steve_Grob: AABENNY 15M .YN +18 357
#note Pretty much threw the game away here. Could not for the life of me find a play to the tws from O11. BENNY! Then compounded the error by trying to block a u-less Q possibility. Stupid.


>Dorcas_Alexander: ABGHITU 14L H.B +30 391
>Steve_Grob: AABEGIN G13 B. +7 364
#note Wow. And I thought I blew it on the last turn. The tile gods are bailing me out and I'm not cashing in. Wasn't even looking at bingo possibilities here. Instead I'm trying to block Q plays. I've totally lost my mind. Bad, bad, badinage.
