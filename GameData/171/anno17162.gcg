#note super-lucky

>Mike_Frentz: HNU 7G HUN +24 52
>JD: AIKOTUY 6H YUK +30 128
#note I've already started to achieve a defensive board shape. things are looking great.
>Mike_Frentz: ?EILNTU K2 UTENsIL +72 124
#note I think going for the points (bigarades) wouldn't hurt him too much here.
>JD: AIOOPST 3I PO.ATO +22 150
#note it's surprising to me that POTATO is that much worse defensively than PATIO (4 points) but it does open a new triple letter score, and make it possible to go across on row 2 as well. also, having the I at 3L is better defense.
>Mike_Frentz: EFY 4J F.Y +33 157
#note FEY doesn't go down after PATIO, for instance.
>JD: EEEHISS 12B HIES +27 177
#note with the next S in hand and an even game it seemed worth going for the volatile play here.
>Mike_Frentz: ?AEINST A6 TaENIAS +80 237
>JD: EEEGIOS 8K .IEGE +21 198
#note alright, an uphill struggle from here

>Mike_Frentz: EJPRT N1 PR.JET +40 318
>JD: DEGINOT D3 GOD +25 283
#note I realllllllly need to bingo again. I'm only 17% to win from here and 30% to bingo next turn. he's really likely to block on the bottom-right, so I need to draw something on column B probably.
>Mike_Frentz: EWW B11 W.EW +31 349
>JD: CEINRST O8 .NTICERS +89 372
#note miracle draw here, I actually did have two spots if he tried blocking on the right.
>Mike_Frentz: BFOR L11 FORB +27 376
>JD: ADEMNRT C9 DEN.M +34 406
#note the rest of this game will be super close from here on out. I can't remember if I saw DAIMEN or MAIDEN, but I liked the idea of leaving two in the bag to make his pre-endgame harder. on the other hand, it makes it gives me one extra tile draw to draw the X or the Z, either of which would really help me outrun mike.
>Mike_Frentz: ACILLOZ B2 COLZA +40 416
#note I think that given his rack ACILLOZ he now has a 3.5/36 chance of winning the game (effectively 4/36 since mike was up on me on spread).
>JD: AEINRTX G1 NIX +46 452
>Mike_Frentz: AILV 11E .VIL +7 423
>JD: AERT H11 .ATER +18 470
#note another lucky game in that I was given decisions that weren't that hard - but a great finish to an amazing tournament!!
>JD:  (A) +2 472
