#note Tasha and Jean's Endgame Misadventures Episode 15.  Posted because I think the last few moves are funny as hell.   This was my last club game of the night and I was cracking up in my car on the way home.

#note Heh.  After I insta-challenged, Jean automatically starts taking her tiles off the board.  But I told her to look it up anyway.  Jean:  You think it may be good?  I thought I spelled it wrong."  Me:  "Oh, ASSTAIN* definitely aint good (everyone in the room starts laughing), but we shoud look it up anyway."  I don't want her to get in the habit of just taking someone's word for it.  That can't be good.  I was also concerned about her belief that she  "spelled it wrong."

#note Intentional.  After noticing the I at 10K, I thought of DUOMI.  That made me think to phony with DUOM* to set up an X play if I draw it.  I didn't think she drew the X since I know most of her rack and she just drew two tiles.  She also won't use the spot because it will break up her pretty rack.

#note I laid down BINTS, but before I hit my clock, Jean mentioned that she's going to play KENTS* next turn and so I adjusted my play accordingly.   If I play BINTS, I can play C2 REG next (there's also 15A ERG, but I didn't see that over-the-board) for 8 but 11K TAG is four more.   And CRASS is two more than BINTS.   CRASS is the best play if you know that Jean isn't going to go out next turn! :D
