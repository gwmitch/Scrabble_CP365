>Avery: AABEIOR 8B AEROBIA +70 70
#note I hesitated over the placement of this, since all of them give up some form of X or Z bomb. I figured this would make two spots, so that I can hit one perhaps if he takes the other.
>Andrew: IMX 9A MIX +39 39
#note Nevermind
>Avery: ?CERRST E3 eRECT.RS +68 138
#note Hard to believe there's no double-doubles, but I looked for a solid 5 minutes.
>Andrew: AEGLNTU 7G LANGUET +66 105
#note ANGULATE
>Avery: ?EHLOOR 8L HOLE +44 182
#note I don't know any of the bingos available. BOREHOLE is 78, RHEOLOGY, and HOROLOGE. This actually sims close to borehole though, being second.
>Andrew: IIIII -IIIII +0 105
>Avery: ?ADENOR O8 .NDEAvOR +77 259
#note I didn't even look at D8 bingos.
>Andrew: IPPTUY D10 UPPITY +36 141
#note nice
>Avery: CIORTUY 14B CU.TY +36 295
#note Of note: OUTCITY

>Andrew: EV 7C VE. +29 203
>Avery: AAIKNOT 4D T.OAK +28 343
#note Saw TROIKA, but I didn't like it since the Z and both Fs are still unseen.
>Andrew: EFLW 14J FLEW +31 234
>Avery: ADDILNU 5H AULD +16 359
#note I unknowingly block BANDITS, but I mainly just want to keep a relatively closed board.
>Andrew: ABDINST M1 BANDIT..S +76 310
>Andrew: ABDINST --  -76 234
>Avery: DIIINQS 10A ID +19 378
#note This sims best by about 5 points somehow
>Andrew: ABDINST 9E .IB +20 254
>Avery: AIINQRS 10L QAI. +16 394
>Andrew: ADNST H1 TAN.. +27 281
>Avery: GIJNRSZ 11K JIG +36 430
#note The Z can still score at 2F if I draw an O, so I think it's right to play the J here instead. Quackle agrees.
>Andrew: DEEEGNS L10 ..S +24 305
#note Actual rack. He mentioned he was going for the case A.
>Avery: INORSSZ 2F ZO. +32 462
>Andrew: ADEEEGN 1H .EENAGED +83 388
>Avery: INNORSS A14 SI +17 479
#note I don't know my words. He held but let it go.
>Andrew: EFVW J1 .VE +14 402
#note FEW is a lot better, I wondered why he didn't play it, considering he was going to stick himself with something anyways.
>Avery: NNORS I4 S.N. +14 493
#note Knowing he'll be stuck, I think it's ok to play off two instead of 3, since it only scores 1 less point.
