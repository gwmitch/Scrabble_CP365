#note I didn't want to play DRIFT here because I figured I was likely to bingo next turn, and I didn't want to create a potential lane with ADRIFT.

#note being down 76, I was reluctant to make a 7-point fish without a great level. even if I hit my fish I'm usually down 30-40. playing GILLS here opened a new part of the board for him to worry about and if I do luck into a bingo it's likely to be an even game. problem is that I bingo very infrequently - only about 20% versus 70% after fishing with DEL. Short story is that I should play DEL.

#note further reasons why DEL was a better play - effectively I got back into the game by playing two bingos, but if I play DEL I really have three completely separate quadrants of the board to work with, making it much more likely that I do get to bingo twice. GILLS restricted me to two.

#note from the bag, I didn't see a lot of plays at A1 that I was scared of, and ANT is a great leave in this ugly pool full of clunkers.

#note mike's actual rack, quackle likes it
>JD: AEKNNOT 10E .KON +18 384
#note he blocked banknote, but I figured this opening would give him a headache even though I usually don't draw bingos.

#note mike's actual rack. it seems like his only other choice is ABAMP which empties the bag and lets me plan an endgame to win. but ABAMP may get rid of so many clunkers that it's still the best shot he has, especially if he can draw the H W or Y to score with.
>JD: AEHLNST N8 .THANES +36 420
#note I had about two minutes to figure this play out and figured it was ok because the best play available was YOWE at M11 - indeed, if mike only sees YOWE or YOWIE at that spot I win 5 out of 8 (losing if I draw a consonant). however, under time pressure we both missed YAWP at 12I, and that or YAWPING at the same spot are usually the winning play that I needed to block, which usually reduces my winning chances to 2/8. Best pre-endgame is actually NEATH at 12K which wins 6.5/8, but that's a tough find. HAEN which I did consider is 5/8.
