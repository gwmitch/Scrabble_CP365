#note OE didn't even occur to me for some weird reason! CAMEO and COMAE sim very closely. i guess i should play it a little more aggressive since i'm down a little and i have the S. (-0.5)

#note there's an amazing 9 10-letter words available here. dENITRATES s the coolest one. however, i don't think it is right to play the 10 here. i think SINTERs would make me more likely to win and it's what I was regretting for the rest of the game... by win % it is so close.

#note i was very confident i was going to win after drawing the second blank. it's just a matter of equity and going for the bingo.

#note i was not 100% on CRUMP. i need to learn words. (-3)
>ginzberg: ADDEGIR 2B DREADI.G +80 252
#note that's worrisome.
>cesar: ?CENRUX 3C EX +31 229
#note the leave alone should make it obvious that M12 XU is better. i wanted to try to block up the scoring lane a little at the top left as well as score some more. but i think XU has got to be better. (-4)

#note i completely missed SCoRNFUL and must have forgotten about SCURF because i definitely saw that. this is disappointing... (-13)

#note the only real way i'm going to have a shot at winning this is by emptying the bag and hoping he doesn't block my bingo spot. i see no way to do this, but quackle sees something cool with OHIA 1F (which i still don't see how it would win...)

#note well, i didn't track him and this game didn't count for spread since i'd already won the tourney. but still, i can't just let him go out with JARGON like this. tsk tsk.
