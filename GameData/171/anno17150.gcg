#note scored as 81
>Akiva: BNO O7 BON. +21 69
>Josh: DEEIOTU 11K DITE +22 102
#note I considered OUT(L)IED but why not play defense against a fisherman? Akiva often exchanges or fishes
>Akiva: III -III +0 69
#note Here Akiva draws 4 tiles instead of 3, I handle the overdraw after spotting one of the 4 he laid face up after drawing it (an I). I look at the other 3, HAA, give him back AA naturally.
>Josh: AEJORUU N8 JA.. +22 124
#note G4 JOUA(L)? I missed it
>Akiva: AAEINST 7A ENTASIA +62 131
#note lol AAI drawn and he gets this, what can I say. L7 ANA(LI)TIES. Scored as 61
>Josh: ?ENORUU A4 ROU.N +18 142
#note what a draw. I didn't think UN(S)OUREd was valid. I didn't know RUNOU(T) either, but this looks better than that one at least.
>Akiva: IORT E3 RIOT. +10 141
>Josh: ?AEIRUV M9 V..AE +34 176
#note I spent some time unfocusedly looking for stuff and then just decided to do this as it isn't much worse. I have no excuse for missing stuff though, other than being unfocused. Scored as 32, bringing me to an inaccurate 175
>Akiva: EEEEEE -EEEEEE +0 141
>Josh: ?DINRTU 3B INT.UDeR +72 248
#note I should have played something that would have drawn a challenge, but I couldn't see my options and knew that this one was most likely my most points.

>Akiva: ACEKRSW --  -100 141
>Josh: ?AEEHOO 6E .HAE +31 279
#note I missed OO(T)HEcAE! I also thought Akiva was planning on playing WR(E)CK so I played this instead of seeing EA(T)H for one more.

>Josh: CEEGNOQ 11A Q. +11 554
>Akiva: FITY 13G FIT +21 269
>Josh: CDEEGNO H12 G.N. +17 571
#note O12 (Y)ON for best endgame, next D(I)N(K) instead of G(I)N(K). -2 I guess. If I played my cards right and he didn't play U(N) after YON, I play GEED/YOND and C(ON) C1 to go out since he doesn't track and get 623 to his 306
>Akiva: LUVWY 13A ..L.Y +22 291
#note correct play, and why the heck did I challenge
>Josh: CDEEO -  +0 571
#note I play (R)ECODE and I get 606. Instead I challenge a normal word because Akiva played it. no words... lol
