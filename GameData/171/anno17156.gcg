#note just LOID sims really well, I'll bingo more often than after TABLOID and also avoid creating an easy new lane

>JD: INNRSTT K11 TINT +15 198
#note I could just play TIN for 6, but I thought this play put more pressure on him. maybe he'll sacrifice a lot to block.

#note if john plays at J12 as I expect him to I will not have any good lanes - thought I needed to create. I sacrifice some bingo percentage but I think I need to.

#note if john is worried only about me bingoing, then playing down from the F or playing SERINGA at C9 lead to bingo percentages below 1%.
>JD: ABGIJOO 4A J.. +21 339
#note it would be pretty nice to play jigaboo somewhere. bingo at G10 is a nice way to set up a 50-point J play. I was just hoping to draw BIGAROON and have him not block.
