>Joey_Krafchick: AAILV H11 AVAIL +38 60
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ABEEOS J6 BEE +29 98
#note Knew all three bingos through the L, but only saw EARLOBES at the time, however, BEE sims best regardless.
>Joey_Krafchick: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 60
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AELOSS K8 SALvOES +66 164
#note I didn't know any of the 74 point bingos, but SALVOES is such good defense that it's only 0.8% behind (3rd to both LOESSIAL's, ahead of LOAMLESS), and in that case, I prefer this.
>Joey_Krafchick: EIMTY 12J M.IETY +30 90
>Siddharth_Murali: ?BIILOR 11M BIO +16 180
#note mORBILLI is a ridicously hard find. This is next. I'm working really hard to do the best out what I know.

>Joey_Krafchick: CEGILOT 10B ECLOGIT. +76 202
>Joey_Krafchick: CEGILOT --  -76 126
#note Joey snap played this. It took me 8 damn minutes to challenge. After the challenge, I had only 5 minutes and change on my clock.
>Siddharth_Murali: EENNORT M11 ..NE +19 278
#note Sims best.
>Joey_Krafchick: CEGILOT G3 LOG +13 139
#note Just GO sims best.
>Siddharth_Murali: EIMNORT F2 REM +16 294
#note No bingos here. This is behind only 0.16% because I'm not keeping TINER and shit. But looking at the stats with the CITE leave, this is easily the best defensive play.
>Joey_Krafchick: CEITUX N5 TUX +26 165
>Siddharth_Murali: GINNOST K2 TONGS +18 312
#note Horrible on equity, but sims really well (-0.17%) The only play that scores more than 10 without using the S is TONG f8, which I didn't see any point doing. I opted for TONGS for the future, to make it hard for Joey to play some unblockable setup along column N.
>Joey_Krafchick: DEHI L1 HIDE +33 198
>Siddharth_Murali: AIJNOOQ 14F JO.N +27 339
#note Time to start crunching down on the board. When the sim likes this better than HAJI, you know it's good, lol.
>Joey_Krafchick: EGU 1L .UGE +24 222
>Siddharth_Murali: AIIOQTW G9 QAT +25 364
#note I had less than 3 minutes on my clock at this point. Sim likes OW(L) by about 0.05%
>Joey_Krafchick: CEFFU 2A CUFFE. +28 250
#note Phony. But I figured as long as I crunch this board down, no worries. If this was somehow good, I'd have potential to be screwed.
