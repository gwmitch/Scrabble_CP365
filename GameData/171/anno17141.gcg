#note Unfortunately, the top-simming play did not even occur to me. M10 FOUR makes a lot of sense. I knew that DOER gave back too much, but I guess I was hoping to get lucky.

#note I thought it would be close with burning the S at O8. Apparently it's not. Oddly, 15N HI is second-best. You draw a vowel a lot of the time.

#note I smelled a TAJ setup, but in any case I do this and wait on the big ZA. It's not going anywhere. For some reason I blanked on the DEV option. But they are comparable.

#note Perhaps this is way too paranoid. I could have been reading NOR completely wrongly. Really, he could be making NOR from a ton of racks. And if he has an awesome bingo rack, my blocking the best S lanes won't stop him from winning. I should just play ALIVE and hope to draw well.
