#note A rather bad miss: ACIDIFY D7 is pretty clearly best.

#note Again, not a great move. The ugly 3 vowel leave is always a huge warning sign. UMIAC, keeping the decent FIE, is worth the 6 point sacrifice.

#note Fine, but I really wanted DEXTERITIES to fit somehow on Row 12.

#note SIZE J8 would take a 62-point lead and kill the board nicely. But Daniel had something else planned.

#note I'm not sure this was best, but I had to block the E and R (TAILGATE/AGLITTER), and it looked like I would be able to squeak out enough points in most of the variations.

#note Great game. Daniel really played well - I can't find much to argue with, and NISEI was sweet.
This win put me up by a game and about 300 spread points going into the last day of the tourney, but we all know how quickly things can change.
