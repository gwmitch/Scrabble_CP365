#note This was probably the most interesting decision of the game. HO (2N, 30) is the obvious play, but I think it gives up too much. I suppose HOBO (K10) is better than DHOBI for the extra 1 point. Opening another S-hook on this board is not a big deal, but setting up a huge TWS play could let opponent back in the game. As it turned out, he did have the K along with his known S, so the damage after HO could have been substantial.
