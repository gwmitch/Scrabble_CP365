#note D11 EXEC sims about 1.5 higher because I hold an S.

#note L10 ASCI by about 6, because the leave is ING.
>Matthew: EEEIKNR H11 .IKER +33 141
>Jeremy: ?AILPRU 10K .UP +7 91
#note missed 3 bingos here. 14H EPIdURAL. 14G PEcULIAR, and J1 sPIRULAE. Ugh.  24 points equity slam.
>Matthew: EENRTTU M8 RE.UTE +18 159
#note M: I convinced myself PUPU was CSW. But the plays hooking that are pretty dicey anyways. This forces him to bingo on row 15 or one of the risky spots on column N or row 7.
>Jeremy: ?AILRRW 8M .AW +18 109
#note J11 TRAWL.  12 pts.

#note 12K RUTIN by about 5.
>Matthew: DLMNNTT -IIIUO +0 184
#note M: ex. DLNNT. I talked myself out of KITTLED. And I missed the plays at 9J. This exchange is okay though. Keeping the M for the hotspot at 8D.

#note M: And then I miss 8A BLAM...
>Jeremy: BEIINNV 2B B.VINE +26 211
>Matthew: DFNOOST 1G FOND +29 244
#note M: Risky to take this over the points at 14J, but this seemed like too good a spot to leave open.

#note heads up play that sets up my R.
>Matthew: ?AAEOST 15F AE.ObATS +58 308
#note M: I dunno, 2I AEROSAT seemed too dangerous. But maybe I need the points
>Jeremy: EINNRTZ A8 RITZ +57 334
#note 4A ZEIN, I knew I goofed later because I held the case R at this point for A8 RYA.  Initially it comes at an 11 point loss, but I get insurance at getting a crack at that spot later.  A 17 point error.
