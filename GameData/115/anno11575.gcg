#note A bunch of plays are viable here, but I did not consider 6F FAVA, which seems safest/best.

#note Grudgingly giving up my E hook... exchanging could be okay here too.

>Will: ?AIIRTT 15I IT +6 267
#note Well, I missed ANTIRIOT. Of the blocking plays, 14E IT sims best. My play still yields some nasty responses.

#note I saw both SHORTIA and CHARIOT were playable but for some reason assumed this would score better...
>Ross: ELR 15F REL.. +24 318
>Will: BBGHLOR 10F HOB +29 366
#note I missed BUHR, and sim favors plays that use an extra tile. Given my impending vowel issues those plays would probably have worked out much better.

#note Sim likes RABID, but plays through the A seem okay.

>Will: ADLMRTX A14 AX +56 436
#note AX up top to block. Should have been drop-dead obvious. Sheesh, this game was a slopfest on my part.

#note Just have to hope he doesn't hit something through the L, I guess
