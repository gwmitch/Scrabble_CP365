#note completely missed ZLOTY. didn't like YUTZ all that much because I wanted to score again next turn.. but HAL is a good leave plus UZ is ugly together; my play and those are close together. ZLOTY seems best though. (-5.5)

#note i LOVE clever plays like UNMIXT. would that i were that clever. i think i saw it, too. still, it's not THAT likely to stay. QUINT still sims a tiny bit better by win %, it's a wash?

#note of course WRONG is right here, but i'm a big chicken. plus, i saw the possibility of WORMINGS here. EX actually gives a tiny bit more back than WRONG, on average :) (-16.5) someone once told me something about how i need to not make the only move that has a chance of losing, but on the other side, a 100-pt lead with both blanks unseen and keeping a crap leave playing just one tile probably results in a lower chance of winning. quackle agrees, at least.

#note he did hold me but there's actually a word in here that i didn't see. i'm a dumbass, and also, WHY DIDN'T I GET HIGH WONG WORD FOR THIS??
