#note I spent a while deliberating between this and just dropping the J for 10. Turns out the sim prefers fishing big time! ADELST is 80 percent to bingo next turn; DELS is 45. Pretty huge difference.

#note I thought it was really close between the fishy option (DUO), the scoring option (GHERAOES) and the in-between option (MEOU 6I). I decided on DUO because the board seemed bingo-friendly enough to merit fishing, and because Brian was in time trouble and I figured complicating his thought process with a fish couldn't hurt. But I missed the star play -- IONIUM 2A, scoring 28 and keeping ES, has to be better than all of the above. Just ONIUM isn't bad either. Oh well.

#note Sims best by far. Don't mind keeping the Q here -- there's four I's in the pool to hit QI C2 for 37.
>Brian_Galebach: FKU 3B FU.K +22 243
>Evans_Clinchy: ANQRRUX K4 .AX +31 281
#note Sim says it's slightly better to wait on the X and play QUAG C2 instead. Interesting! Usually I love hoarding QU, but there's little chance of a juicy Q spot opening up on this board, so taking QUAG now does make sense.

#note Sims best. No need to play something fishy like REX 6I... just score in the obvious scoring spot.
