>Evans_Clinchy: CEHQTYZ 8F CHEZ +36 36
#note Quackle ever so slightly prefers TECHY here. I thought CHEZ was more likely to lead to a closed board, which would benefit me with the clunky rack.
>Stefan_Rau: ??EEORU I5 dOU.EpER +67 67
#note Fancy.
>Evans_Clinchy: EIQRRTY H11 RETRY +32 68
#note Just the obvious QI sims best. I don't know why I felt so compelled to hit this spot.
>Stefan_Rau: EF J5 EF +27 94
>Evans_Clinchy: ADIINOQ 14C QINDA. +20 88
#note Again, Quackle wants to keep it simple with QI G10. I thought this was a nifty idea since I'm setting up a spot to score with my I, but these are the first two I's of the game, so it's pretty likely he has one too. Also ADINO is actually a somewhat decent bingo leave with the open C and R for eights.

>Stefan_Rau: AELM 11C ALME +30 132
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEGIOY K1 BOGEY +32 142
#note Sim prefers just BOGY, despite the three-vowel leave. Can't afford to give him an easy scoring spot on an otherwise-tame board.
>Stefan_Rau: KRSU 1K .RUSK +36 168
>Evans_Clinchy: AAABIIO 3J A.IO +10 152
#note Slapped this down pretty quickly without thinking; probably shoulda looked a little more. ABACI is a smidge better.

>Evans_Clinchy: AABEILX F4 LEXI.A +31 183
#note Sim prefers plays that are a bit more closed-ish, like AXE 9G and BA 10F. I considered both, but I'm a little behind and the board is getting ugly, so I thought I needed something a little more volatile. I like this even though it sims about 4 points back.

#note This sims best! I wasn't at all confident this play made sense, so I'm relieved. Basically I want to keep the board closed and wait for him to open, then pounce with the esses later. SEAM just leaves me way too vulnerable to a bingo, especially after his somewhat fishy plays. (I could also leave the spot alone and play SHIV G7, keeping SEAM for later... but he could snatch the spot with something heavy like GNAW, and I'd be in serious trouble.)

#note This sims best many-ply. AG seems like a weird leave at first, but it fits really well with the unseen pool (I's, N's, etc).
