#note Quackle says SOJA 15L is a tad superior... the leave is comparably bad, but it limits his scoring options a little better.

#note Phew... lucky to draw two consonants to bail me out of the bad rack. This play seems right... scores, takes out the most obvious scoring spot.

#note It's either this or TURFED A8. I know he might bingo in that line, but with only one E among the 20 unseen tiles, it's not super-easy. I figured I'd score elsewhere and take my chances, and possibly bingo back if he does bingo.

#note Thought about playing longer for more points, but the three U's in the bag scared me off. Fishing one tile is darn close to 100 percent to bingo next turn. The worst draw would be the L -- only FELLATIO B6 plays, which is both blockable and easy to counteract for a big score. Basically any other tile though, and I'm golden.
