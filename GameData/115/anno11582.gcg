#note Way too worried about Joel possibly hooking LAX. There's just the one F and who cares anyway?

#note My reasoning for this colossally stupid play was that the Z played in a couple cool places on the board and I wanted to save it for those. Seems obvious that if I play ZAGS I pretty much can't lose the game.

#note I thought this was pretty dumb/cavalier too, why create a new heavy-hitting threat? But I'm sure it would have been fine if I had just played ZAGS.

#note Oh, brother. I felt like a total moron to even be in this mess. I saw he had WITHDREW/WITHEROD from the W and only OUTDREW down O - at least I didn't screw that up too.

#note Good - one game closer to actually learning a lesson someday.
