>Amalan_Iyengar: EHINOTW 8D WHITE +30 30
#note After simulation, quackle came up with WHO 8F. Whiten simmed half a point over WHITE. I like to keep the balance, but I guess O is better than ON for the extra two points.
>Mike: RTZ F7 R.TZ +33 33
>Amalan_Iyengar: AABEINO G10 ABO +16 46
#note Well, I have (Z)ABAIONE, but short of having zyzzyva in my brain, there's no way I would have found that.
>Mike: DEWY H12 DEWY +44 77
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAEEINQ -AAEIQ +0 46
#note Again I didn't see the vowel dump A(R)EAE 7E, which would have scored a good 17 points, given the tiles I was playing.
>Mike: ?EFNOOU 7C FOU. +21 98
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEINSTU I6 AUNTIES +75 121
#note I completely missed playing SINUATE  I8. Anyway, I made the wrong play in that spot. Sinuate I6 would have been better.
>Mike: AF 6F FA +38 136
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEGIIOO 6I .GIO +9 130
#note I really should have traded

>Mike: EY 14F YE. +17 153
>Amalan_Iyengar: ADEEIMO 13B MEDIA +21 151
#note OEDEMA and MEDIAE 15A are the top plays. I thought MEDIA was plural of MEDIUM, so I didn't know that

>Amalan_Iyengar: IIMNOPS H1 MIN. +21 229
>Mike: ETV 5C VET +18 268
#note Yeah, the blank was the U
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?EINOPS M3 PEnSION +76 305
#note I wasn't looking at the M at the top, where I had MOPINESS and NEPOTISM
>Mike: GLS 8L L.GS +18 286
>Amalan_Iyengar: EGJOORV L8 .OVER +18 323
#note I was thinking OVERJOG, like OVERRUN. JOG 3C is the best play.
