>NIgel_Peltier: BIIOOSU -BIIOOU +0 0
#note Nigel and I spoke about the options regarding this opening rack. Playing OBI or BIO seemed sort of unconvincing to us both, as it also does to Quackle. The top ten plays involve exchanging, but best, exchanges everything but the S, as Nigel did.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AELORRT H3 REALTOR +66 66
>NIgel_Peltier: AIINOSY 6F OI.Y +9 9
#note AI(R)Y, 9F is Q's top, 1.2 ahead of Nigel's play. Although I wouldn't want to see an X land on F10 from Nigel's perspective.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADEGINO 3G O.GANDIE +70 136
>NIgel_Peltier: AADEINS E6 NAIADES +74 83
#note NAIADES E2 is an extra point, although there might be some effortless counterplay from 8A or from 1D-4D. Plus, I held on NOILY...maybe he thought there was a higher likelihood of me challenging. NOILY, thumbs up, NOILIER, thumbs down.
>Gunther_Jacobi: DFIKPUX 12A KUFI. +34 170
#note Q's next is FIX D11.

>NIgel_Peltier: ABELNVY N2 L.AVY +38 121
#note This or VEALY in the same spot. EV(E)NLY N1 for two points more might be risky.
>Gunther_Jacobi: DFHPSSX O3 SH +29 199
#note This is Q's fourth choice. Plays that come out ahead all involve ridding the rack of the F and X at either J2 or F5. I was still hopeful about drawing a vowel to perhaps bring the X to life for the next turn.
>NIgel_Peltier: BEENOTT A10 BE.NOT +36 157
#note BETOKEN is Q's top here, but looks suicidal being that I've just played off an S. BE(K)NOT seems much better.
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEFNPSX J2 F.X +21 220
#note F(A)X 7D or F(O)X F5 are both an extra point, although I didn't want to see an AZO, ZA or ZOA hit J2.
>NIgel_Peltier: ?EEEOTV B4 dEVOTEE +75 232
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADENPSS C7 PADS +31 251
#note I spent WAY to much time on this rack, and the expenditure of this time hurt me later on. I felt like the O's at H8 or 14A offered something, or the E at E11. This however, wasn't the case. PADS C7 is best. PANED A1 is second.
>NIgel_Peltier: ?ACIIJU L1 JU.ICIAl +100 332
#note And the gavel comes down with authority!
>Gunther_Jacobi: EHINOST O6 ETHIONS +88 339
#note HISTONE M7 for 90 would've been better. ETHIONS scores less and gives significant potential counterplay to those two unseen W's.
>NIgel_Peltier: DNQUUWW 2E WUD +12 344
#note OK, the game just got really interesting! There's a lot of garbage in the bag from my perspective and a lot of gold in the bag from Nigel's. Quackle likes W(O)W F5 or G2. Q also considers exchanging all but QUN. Nigel undoes some duplicates, placing hopes in a high scoring Q play and also saves his second W for N10. WUD is Q's fourth choice.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABEEEIR C12 .EEB +18 357
#note  BEE N10 is Q's top. I considered this move, but being all the unseen R's remaining, I opted out. (F)EEB is third best.
>NIgel_Peltier: GMNPQUW 7J QU.G +16 360
#note Quackle prefers to play off three consonants at F5, keeping MPQU or GPQU, with either G(O)WN or M(O)WN. I guess it figures it can draw a vowel or two and score well with the Q. Nigel disagrees and plays Quackle's eighth choice.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEEGINR 2J .E. +8 365
#note With less than two minutes on my clock, I miss some frightfully easy bingos. ANERGIE(S) 12H and REGINAE I8. Suprisingly, (F)E(U), valuates at 34.9, although of course that's no consolation.
>NIgel_Peltier: LMNPRWZ 5G P.M +18 378
#note Quackle still likes M(O)WN.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEGINOR 15A .A.ORING +36 401
#note This rack mimics my second. I really wanted to play off my O and give myself another chance at bingoing. The unseen pool would compliment my leave. Although playing off many tiles while scoring well could hasten the end of the game, which would be in my favor considering the abundance of remaining clunkiness. (T)A(B)ORING comes out ahead of ORIGAN 1A.
>NIgel_Peltier: CLNRTWZ D11 W.T +13 391
#note WHOA! Quackle likes W(O) 10N! Is it banking on drawing an A for TZAR? I think it also doesn't want to empty the bag. I guess I'm threatening some bingos, so it wants to be able to play off the Z at least.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEILMOT N10 MOA +25 426
#note  MAILE N10 for 40 is the play. I didn't know this word. This rack looked so bingo-prone, so I spent my last minute looking at a mirage. MOA isn't even listed.
>NIgel_Peltier: CLNRRRZ 8G C.Z +14 405
>Gunther_Jacobi: EILT A1 TILE +17 443
#note It's interesting to note that my opponent didn't draw a vowel for his last three turns. The only vowels he did draw,  came the two plays after JUDICIAL, which were three U's. Another fact worth noting: Nigel scored 323 pts in his plays 3 through 7, and only 63 pts in his plays 8-12.
