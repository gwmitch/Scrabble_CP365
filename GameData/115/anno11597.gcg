>Betty_Cornelison: HIP 8G HIP +16 16
#note Already I'm behind, by not being able to go first.
>Winter: EELNORY 7I ONERY +18 18
#note Didn't actually look for the tight, higher scoring play, because I'm trying to play wide open.

#note Now I have some hope.
>Betty_Cornelison: ?BEFLLS 5C BEFaLLS +78 131
#note And hope fades.
>Winter: EGLORTX 6D LEX +57 161
#note Nice, but I need a HUGE win, so Betty's bingo really hurt.

>Winter: EFIMTTU 11J MUFTI +24 247
#note I should have looked for ACT(I)NIAE, but even if I had seen it, I would have gambled that Betty wouldn't find it.
>Betty_Cornelison: AACEINT 12K TA +16 218
>Winter: AEGHIST O7 GHATS +38 285
#note Damn. Huge miss. And even GHATS was bad--trying to block a posible big N10 play. HAGS would have been better.

#note At this point, I'm confident that with the S and blank I can easily WIN the game, if that is all I want. But I don't want 2nd place--I don't care about the extra money or the WGPO rating. ALL I want is to win the tournament, and the only way I can do that is if Betty doesn't have an O and can't block the spot, and if she has to play the Q for a pittance and then I bingo out and stick her with the W and K for a 100+ spread.
>Betty_Cornelison: EKOW 3A WOKE +44 370
>Winter: ?AENOOS 3K .O. +5 337
#note Here I did screw up, not seen the A. I should have gone out in two and not given up the points to play (D)O(G).
