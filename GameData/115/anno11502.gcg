>Matthew_Levine: IRTZ 8G RITZ +26 26
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGINOT J7 A.O +12 12
#note I always forget GENOA is a playable word. It's pretty tight in the sim though. I kinda liked gambling by setting up the N hook.
>Matthew_Levine: CP H7 P.C +7 33
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIINT 10F TEEING +34 46
#note Not worth fishing now, but I stupidly missed TIEING.
>Matthew_Levine: ?DENRST 6B TiNDERS +70 103
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIOORS 11J SORI +28 74
#note This was an annoying turn. The S gives me about an extra 10 points, but it's still tough to decide if it's worth it. The sim is one big cluster, simply playing SO here ranks pretty high. ODA/ADO 5E also are up there at the top.
>Matthew_Levine: EEL 7D EEL +10 113
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACDOOU 5E ODA +22 96
#note That's an AUTO- word I didn't know. Thankfully it didn't score too much. OCA is perhaps better here?
>Matthew_Levine: EMNO 4B OMEN +17 130
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEGOUW 3B WO +23 119
#note Still no plays that stand out, but for some reason COW A2 is leading. I'm not down that much and I have a blank - is that really necessary?
>Matthew_Levine: EFOR 8A FORE +28 158
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEGQTU M9 QU.TE +48 167
>Matthew_Levine: NRU K5 URN +8 166
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACDGKN 4K DAK +21 188
#note I didn't think DANK took an S, but I played DAK just to be safe. Nothing seems to be clear-cut this game. Sim is suggesting D1 CAK(E), 6K (R)ACK, 11E GAD. But it's all extremely close.
>Matthew_Levine: ILOV 13I VOIL. +12 178
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BCDGIN 11E BIND +29 217
#note Nothing else scores this good.
>Matthew_Levine: AU M2 AU. +14 192
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEGIIL 12A CEILI +24 241
#note Hey, what can I say... when I have a brain fart, I like to go above and beyond what people generally expect. One of the more faceplam worthy moments I've had in scrabble, to be sure.
>Matthew_Levine: NW -  +0 192
#note Hey at least he challenged CEILI. Cause he wouldn't have challenged CEILInG.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAGGLP A12 .LAG +21 262
#note Auto-pilot play.
>Matthew_Levine: NW C11 W.N +12 204
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AABGHP N1 BAH +25 287
#note I didn't even know RALPH was a word.
>Matthew_Levine: EIMRSSU 2C MISUSER +68 272
#note I had to hold here. Even though it sounds like the type of word that would likely be in the Scrabble dictionary, you never know. But with the juicy play I had, no reason to challenge.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGOPV 1H PAVE +41 328
#note Sim says V(E)EP for 36 instead.
>Matthew_Levine: EY 14A .YE +19 291
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AFGJOX 15A .AdJO +32 360
#note I thought I was being real clever here, but sim results don't list this as one of the plays that wins 100%. Well, I'm not getting stuck with my X, so I'm pretty sure he can't win. I forgot about GWINE which lets me play out in two moves.

#note Wow, so I didn't get a bingo at all this game (thanks to my stupidity). I've been pretty lucky in all these games with Matt.
