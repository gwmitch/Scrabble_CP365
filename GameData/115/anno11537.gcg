#note I overdrew at the end of this play, exposing the J but not losing it.  Now, if I want to set up a big J play, I'll need to engineer a second option.

#note This is my attempt to set up a second option for the J.  I'd be just as happy to draw an A for 12B TAJ +43. Quackle likes this choice.
>Wayne_Barclay: AAEGLST L5 GALETAS +69 104
>Wayne_Barclay: AAEGLST --  -69 35
#note GALETTAS is the correct spelling.
Thanks to Diane Blackwell for running off to our CSC office to grab our copy of OSPD4 and enlisting some lunching ladies to help her adjudicate this play.
>Ross_Brown: BEJRSTU 10J JUBE +56 150
#note JUT is the correct play here. I had no compunction about hanging out the E here - in fact, I was betting that he would jump on GAL(E)ATES* and lose another turn, which he almost did before remembering the proper anagram in those tiles…
>Wayne_Barclay: AAEGLST M3 STEALAG. +74 109
#note …which he knew was good…
>Ross_Brown: AIORRST -  +0 150
#note …and I didn't.

#note Unlike Game 3, this time I was still able to play my bingo after losing the challenge.
>Wayne_Barclay: ANY 6H NAY +31 172
>Ross_Brown: ?GIORTU 15E TOURInG +88 304
#note I forwent three points to push the bingo as far to the right as possible, knowing that InG is relatively hard to overlap with a bingo on row 14.  Quackle simulation with 5000+ iterations shows that this 88-point play has a valuation two to three points less than the five 91-point bingos, but the win percentage is comparable.
#note Mistakenly scored as +87.

>Wayne_Barclay: OO 4K OO. +12 206
>Ross_Brown: CIIMOPU 8K MI.OU +28 380
#note Quackle prefers C(A)PO for this spot, or a block on Row 1. If I have to open Column O, I'd rather do it with the U.
#note It's hard to believe with 28 tiles still in the bag (and 11 vowels and a blank unseen), but the E that I draw at the end of this play turns out to be the last vowel I get in this game.
>Wayne_Barclay: HI 6M .HI +27 233
>Ross_Brown: CEINPTV 2E VEN.TIC +16 396
#note This is what our club used to call "Rossing up the board", but Wayne informs me that the current epithet refers to Donna Balkan instead.  Could it be because she and I play a constant stream of games on Facebook?
#note Anyway, Quackle likes this play.
