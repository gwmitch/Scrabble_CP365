>deen: ACIIRRS 8D CIRRI +20 20
#note I live on Cartier St. (CIRRATE, ERRATIC), so I rarely miss this word as an option!
>Sue_Tremblay: FIJOORT D8 .ROFT +20 20
>deen: AAAASTW 11D .ATWA +22 42
#note Wow, 3 more A's...LOL, this seems best and Q agrees
>Sue_Tremblay: DEIJORR H10 J.RRED +45 65
>deen: AAASTVY 13B VASTY +33 75
#note Makes the top 5, but Q prefers plays that dump two As for slightly fewer points: JAVA, AVAST, VASA.
>Sue_Tremblay: AINOOOU -IOOOU +0 65
>deen: AABNOST 15E SAN.BOAT +62 137
#note Oh dear, another phony...this one I am blaming on Jeremy's BOAT poster - SURFBOAT was what I was thinking of...surf and sand...LOL. 7H SABATON is the real bingo - I vaguely recall having seen it, but I wouldn't have found it.
>Sue_Tremblay: AANPTVZ J13 AZ. +32 97
#note F5 TZAR is a bit better if Sue wants to score 30 for the Z now - at least it dumps another consonant
>deen: AEILNOU B12 U.EA +14 151
#note B10 ELUVIA is a nice play I didn't see. My choice was 4th.
>Sue_Tremblay: ALNPRTV 15A V.N +18 115
>deen: DGIILNO A7 DIGLON +30 181
#note Another comedy of errors. I had seen LOIDING/IDOLING but couldn't remember if either could be used as or was a verb. IDOLING just seemed wrong, LOIDING 50-50...ultimately I decided to play it safe by going for a 30 pt. play, another phony LOL. Not sure what I was confusing...not TIGLON, but something else!? Hmm. Sue didn't put this on hold either, so is there something like this non-word? 
>Sue_Tremblay: ALNOPRT K10 PLOT +14 129
>deen: BEEIIUW L12 WEE. +27 208
#note Ugh...I deserve this rack for playing another phony...LOL. Kept a horrible leave, but 27 pts seemed like a lot to pass up. WEET is top play re: Q.
>Sue_Tremblay: AFINRUX 7H XU +19 148
#note Q prefers 14L EAUX 22, but hanging that X out there looks awfully dangerous for snapback potential, at least to these carbon-based eyes....
>deen: BEIIMQU F5 QUI.E +16 224
#note I was happy to get the Q when I had a U to go with it, but my play has the obvious S-hook problem. If I'd seen it I think I would have gone for 6I MIB 13 for three less pts, but hoping for a safer Q-play to come.
>Sue_Tremblay: AEFINRS B2 INFARES +79 227
#note Missing M7 INFARES for an extra 15 pts. I was trying to remember ATES myself, not sure I would have risked it - probably not....and Sue takes the lead again.
>deen: BEILMOP A1 PLIE +31 255
#note Best
>Sue_Tremblay: AEEGOOT M7 GOATEE +16 243
#note Best - digging deep for a front hook to QUIRE. The two unseen blanks were making things very tense.
>deen: BDELMOU 8K BL.OM +30 285
#note 8L BOOM 33 for an extra 3 pts is likely better, a more balanced leave as well - but I was getting a bit paranoid about hitting a blank, and went for an extra tile instead.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?CDEGHO 3A ..CHED +24 267
#note Sue hits the first blank, but has nowhere for COuGHED. Tough position. Her play doesn't even make Q's list, perhaps because it shuts off the QUIRE hook when she has a useful tile available? To play is N12 DOG 18, keeping ECH? Maybe a better play can explain this position to us...
>deen: DEHNOUY C5 HEY +31 316
#note Still no blank or S, so points it is!
>Sue_Tremblay: ?EGIMNO 2E MENdIGO +74 341
#note Lots of bingoes here, but some more obscure ones. And which lane is most dangerous: row 2 off ED, or column O thru the M? The highest scoring bingoes are 08 MOdEMING 95 and MiMEOING 89 - these probably would have won, as I didn't see a 7 on my final rack, and actually needed the M in column O to bingo out. Still, neither of these 8s seem that simple to me - I may very well have settled for something on line 2 as Sue did.
>deen: ?DINOSU O5 DIS.OUNt +60 376
#note Luckily I did not hit the K, and got the other blank...of the seven bingoes thru M, I found the lowest scoring! But a win is a win. And 5F QUINOiDS 84 clearly best, but I didn't know it - I was looking for a QU- word. Finally, DOUSINg plays along line 2, so it looks like a fortunate win for me in all cases. But still a very close game, and I needed two phonies to do so! LOL
