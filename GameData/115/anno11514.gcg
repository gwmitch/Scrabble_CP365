#note Seven consonants, but exchanging definitely isn't right here, even though my next rack will probably still be clogged with consonants since I'm keeping five of them. Quackle prefers FEM 9G 34 by a little, and the eight more points are important, even though FEM will probably still be there for me next turn. I also don't mind setting up the S-hook on JAWS, since I have an S. 
>Quackle: ILORUXZ N13 XU +34 72
#note So much for the JAWS hook, but that's okay, my S should be plenty useful elsewhere. Worth noting that COTEAU doesn't take an S, only the X - the good word inthe letters of COTEAUS* is ACETOUS.
>Geoff: ACEFMNS 9G F.M +34 143
#note Now I can play FEM, score 34 and have a very strong leave.
>Quackle: GILOQRZ J10 GLI.Z +39 111
>Geoff: AACENNS -  +0 143
#note Whoops! I played CANNAE#, which is only good in the larger international word list. Two approaches here: either fish off the duplicated A and N and hope to draw a bingo next time, or make a longer play that takes more points now while still leaving some decent letters. I tended to the longer play, since I'm ahead here and ES is still a decent leave. I considered CANNAS M3 28, but wasn't sure CANNA took an S in TWL. (I had the hooks backwards in my mind.) Quackle likes O14 NA 8 a little better, or CANAL 11 D 14. CANNAE# (if it were valid here) would net about four points worse, says the sim, though I like the resulting board a smidge more.
>Quackle: EFOOQRS -FOOQ +0 111
>Geoff: AACENNS 7J NANA +11 154
#note Quackle just traded four, so I expect he/she is keeping three bingo-prone tiles, and I'd like to make the board a bit tighter while preserving an S hook I have and Quackle might not. Quackle suggests fishing AN again, or playing CANNAS (again, I wasn't sure of it), or CANAL. 
>Quackle: ADDERST N2 ADDREST +77 188
>Geoff: CEIORRS 15A CROSIER. +80 234
#note Quackle took my new S-hook, but I drew well and took the best lane on the board, so I'm about 50 ahead at roughly the halfway point.
>Quackle: DDIMOSV 7D VOID +19 207
>Geoff: ?EEILOU 2H EULOgI.E +59 293
#note Only available bingo. Opens up the possibility of a big play coming back. C6 LOUIE 17 forming OVOID and keeping the blank and E wins nearly as often in the sim. After EULOGIAE, Quackle guesses that my winning chances are 7 in 8.


>Quackle: BDHMNST H1 B.TH +39 246
>Geoff: AOOOQRW F6 Q. +31 324
#note Strange rack. Which problem to clean up first, the Q or the W and three O's? 14F WOT 29 scores okay, but keeping a Q with multiple O's doesn't appeal to me and QI scores 31 and blocks row 5. Quackle agrees.
>Quackle: DEMNPST 14C TEMP +32 278
>Geoff: AOOORRW O8 ARROW +42 366
#note Nice to be able to get 42 points out of this rack - easy choice, despite the OO leave.

>Quackle: DEEINNS 3A DESINEN. +70 348
>Geoff: AEIINOO A1 OI.IA +21 387
#note We have ourselves a game, now that Quackle has bingoed again and I have this ugly pile of vowels. However, looking at the tile pool (11 consonants in the 16 unseen tiles), Quackle is likely to be glutted with consonants, so the situation isn't as bad as it could be - if Quackle's going to beat me, it won't be with a bingo, at least. And the D in DESINENT gives me an easy way to get rid of some vowels. 
>Quackle: ABFKPSV 2D KAF +39 387
>Geoff: AEGNORY C5 ORANGEY +74 461
#note Okay, that's just dumb luck. :) Quackle's KAF tied the score, though given the pool I was a clear favorite even without bingoing.
