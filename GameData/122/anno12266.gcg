>Albert_Martono: AAAAAAA -AAA +0 0
#note Albert didn't tell what he was exchanging. Probably already got blank
>Christian_O.B: BEEIOVY 8E YEBO +18 18
>Albert_Martono: ?GINRSU 9C ReUSING +75 75
#note Best bingo although score 2 less points than H8 OUTGRINS
>Christian_O.B: ?EEIIVZ 8A ZEE +38 56
#note F4 VIZIES 38 points leave EE?.....T.T
>Albert_Martono: AFHI A4 HAFI. +24 99
>Christian_O.B: ?IIMNTV F1 VITaMIN.. +67 123
#note C3 MINIVER for 32 slightly better than 2 bingoes 7H MINIVET and F1 VITAMINES for 67????? Don't really understand why quackle generate MINIVER leave T? slightly better
>Albert_Martono: OX 1F .OX +39 138
>Christian_O.B: CDDERSU 7H CUD +12 135
#note 6E DISCURED for 64....
>Albert_Martono: ADEELOR B1 OREADE +33 171
>Albert_Martono: ADEELOR --  -33 138
#note 5D REMOLADE 94 points..... Luckily I know only OREAD and OREADES are valid word
>Christian_O.B: DEKOPRS E4 KOP +35 170
#note Best play, pretty obvious if no bingo can be made
>Albert_Martono: ADEELOR D2 LEAD +28 166
#note D1 DELO leave ARE beat LEAD for 28
>Christian_O.B: DEEPRRS 1A DERP +41 211
#note K7 SPERRED.... DERP* is NOT a word. 2nd best move 1A DEEP. 
>Albert_Martono: ENORSUW K5 UNSWORE +97 263
#note Best play, no doubt on it
>Christian_O.B: AEHNRSW L11 HWAN +25 236
#note Don't know WHEW can be hooked S for gigantic 8K WHEWS 54 points. HWAN leave ERS and open spot for high scoring bingo (only 1 S still unseen with all blank has been used up), so it was pretty safe to set-up S hook.. At least that was what I think... Until shocking fact in endgame
>Albert_Martono: ADLO M12 ODAL +23 286
#note Albert sacrifice 7 points (8k WALDO) to block my possible set-up to safe and high score bingo play
>Christian_O.B: ELNRSTY B5 LYT. +35 271
#note B5 LYTE become best play leave NERS, slightly above B5 LYNE (yes, I don't know LYNE) although leave ERST. See what tile left, it quite reasonable, there are only 1 N, but there are still 4 T, so NERS was better leave than ERST in this situation
>Albert_Martono: AEIV 8K .AIVE +36 322
#note Quite risky play to retain lead since it open floating E for easy add letter to form 8-letters bingo word. However, I think Albert had no other good option than this one
>Christian_O.B: EEFNRRS J11 FERN +18 289
#note H7 CONFRERES for 45... Alien-word extender move.... FERN made another set-up to safe bingo line
>Albert_Martono: BILO I12 BOIL +16 338
#note As I expected, he block EVERY possible set-up I made. Luckily for me.....
>Christian_O.B: AEIRSTT 2H IRATEST +77 366
>Christian_O.B: EIMORST (challenge) +5 371
#note 15C TERTIALS for 85. I was 99.9% sure TERTIAL CAN'T be added S. Adding more funny moment, in day 1 I played with Zulhimi Syarif and made TERTIALS/SENARII for over 100 points bingo words, and I told him TERTIALS was not valid word.... Also can believe Albert TOTALLY forgot about IRATEST
>Albert_Martono: AGJ N10 JAG +34 372
#note I don't know why he chose this play rather than H14 JA for 43. Probably didn't see it, or let it open because he hold Q-U for QUAIL or something, or he know I can bingo in floating E...LOL
>Christian_O.B: EIMORST 1L MOIT +38 409
#note If Albert chose 14H JA I can finish him with 5O TIRESOME
>Albert_Martono: Q M7 Q. +21 393
>Christian_O.B: AAEERSU 15L S.UE +27 436
#note Probably my biggest endgame mistake in this this tournament. I know EXACTLY what he hold, CEGINOT, E15 AREAL for 15 then L15 HWAN/SLUE for 27 was the best I saw to finish in two move, but the time than I want to play AREAL.. Wait, was CEGINOT contain bingo or not, I not find any bingo there, but remembered Jimmy beat me with NOSTRUM (which I think he can't bingo), I start to not open slight chance to lay down bingo. Since I'm 100% CEGINOTL can't form bingo, I start to play HWANS*/SLUE first. But HWANS* was indeed, ANOTHER INVALID WORD. YES, HWAN don't take S hook. 
>Albert_Martono: CEGINOT H11 CONGE +46 439
>Albert_Martono: UNKNOWN (challenge) +5 444
#note Don't know Albert can play like this, don't know CONGE either. But since I calculate I still win by 2 if CONGE valid, I decide to challenge (was 80-90% sure CONGE was not valid)... THIS IS RISKY TO CHALLENGE WORD, REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED TO STEVEN SURYA when playing Fadlan Satria in 2nd ISC
>Christian_O.B: AAER O4 AREA. +6 442
#note Jimmy told me 10A AREA score 10 points, I didn't see it.. Luckily for me, after serious recount after the game, the margin remain 2 for me... Sometimes you can turn defeat into victory by just recount whole play and found that you underscore, or your opponent overscore in some move, JUST LIKE FADLAN SATRIA DID WHEN PLAYED AGAINST STEVEN SURYA IN 2ND ISC
