#note Weak. LED keeps an excellent leave and doesn't open up a beautiful lane for Conrad. Played too quickly this entire game. I was flustered because Conrad was having anxiety attacks and was thinking of dropping out of the tournament. I should not be concerned about these things unless something serious happens. I am not going to be able to do much to help Conrad while we are playing anyway. Just need to focus on the game and play like I normally would.

#note Challenged way too quickly! If I had my head on straight, I would've at least taken longer to challenge, even if I did end up doing it.
