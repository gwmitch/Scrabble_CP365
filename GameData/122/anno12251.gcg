>Steven_Surya: ABDENRS 11I BANDERS +76 203
#note Steven figured his best move, the only bingo available, however according quackle his winning percentage after playing bingo still 0%, it's just too much. Then this play was only bring him more misery
>Christian_O.B: ?AENNOR O8 RAi.ONNE +122 577
>Christian_O.B: ?EIOOVW (challenge) +5 582
#note Only 1 nine-timer available. Overscore by 10..... How can 72+50 = 132. Steven didn't recount. Maybe he was too depressing that RAISONNE was indeed, a valid word
>Steven_Surya: AIX H12 .AXI +33 236
>Christian_O.B: ?EIOOVW N6 WOO +16 598
#note Sacrifice 5 points to keep 2 bingo line. Quackle like 3I WOO for 21 better. The 5th bingo chance was too small, with this tile left and board condition

#note Was it true to just finish to biggest margin? Wrong, KO for 36 followed by APE 12G for 26 to 705 points game. Possibly beat high game Steven by 8 points (his high game 707, but I was overscored by 10 points, and if he don't recount I will get 715 points game). I chose to just finish becasue I can't find a move that combined more than 697 (707), breaking last 4 tiles to 2 move was just shrink final spread if I don't know LIPA
