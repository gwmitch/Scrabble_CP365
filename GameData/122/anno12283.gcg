#note After the game I was pretty disappointed in myself that I didn't play JISM, thinking I was playing too scared. However, it's still a tough call which play is better... championship player, when run multiple times, alternates between the two (with JEST as a runner up both times). At the time, my reasoning for JET was that it blocks huge X and Z spots, leaves a better combo for bingoing, and doesn't open a medium J spot, plus I have a couple decent spots for my M. It's tough to say whether that outweighs the 10 points I'm sacrificing, but it's close. I think I was mostly upset with not playing JISM because I drew the Z the next turn.

#note Another tough decision - leave off the ING for 8 points fewer and an increased chance of bingoing, plus the threat of MAZING for 54 and ZING minimum for 42? This is one reason why quackling bothers me... championship player and 4-ply yield opposite results. It's definitely pretty close either way.

#note MA/MAE is a good play if I didn't expose my rack, but I would be shocked if Charles didn't play through the U or I if I dumped the M, nixing my bingo chances (unless I get a lucky GIRDLING). I think LIM(BE)D is a pretty good option here, leaving an ING possibility and putting the pressure on to block.

#note I was a little demoralized after KAE was blocked. Don't see how I can feasibly win the game fishing off my K for 7 blocking the D... I'm not going to be gifted any bingo spots. Maybe FLAK? 5G KAT? (T)ALK? I guess fishing off the K gives me a 12/46 shot at GLOATING/GELATING... (or RELATING), so it's better than I thought at first glance. INTAGLI plays too, as does SALTING and MALTING. I guess in a situation like this it's a good idea to go for a bingo right away, and nearly half the pool gives me one after a K fish.
