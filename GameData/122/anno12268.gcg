>Ross_Brown: EGIRSTU H4 GUTSIER +70 70
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ADGNRTV 9D GRAV.N +15 15
#note Quackle prefers 9G D(E)V +13 or any two-tile play that dumps the V and another consonant.
>Ross_Brown: ?AHIORU E5 HORA.IUm +90 160
#note It turns out that HORARIUM needs a capital H (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horarium).
#note The alternative bingos are almost 30 points less and open a triple-triple line.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ADMNRTX F4 MAX +58 73
>Ross_Brown: AADEENN D9 .ANE +16 176
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: DEHNORT F8 H.D +24 97
#note Simulation shows this slightly better than I5 NOH +23.
>Ross_Brown: ADEEENN G9 .EE +12 188
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EIINORT I6 OI +8 105
>Ross_Brown: ABDENNY D4 DAB +30 218
#note J2 BENDY +39 is much better, but I have my mind set on this play, and it doesn't open any lines.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EIINPRT J4 RIP +22 127
#note Best.
>Ross_Brown: AEELNNY K5 NE +14 232
#note Best.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EIINRTW L3 WINE +24 151
#note Simulation shows a slight edge to holding back the E.
>Ross_Brown: ADELNYY 2L DAY +23 255
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?CEIRTT N2 .TTERbIC +64 215
#note Simulation prefers M1 T(A)E +16 by 5.3; this play is fifth best.
>Ross_Brown: BELNOTY 8L BL.N +27 282
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: IOUFQST C3 QI +25 240
#note Simulation prefers 13C OF +19, leaving QUITS.
>Ross_Brown: ELORTUY 12G RULY +15 297
#note Closing a line.  Not the best play.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AFGOSTU C12 FUG +19 259
#note Jeremy misses B4 FUGATOS +74.
>Ross_Brown: EIJLMOT J10 JO. +29 326
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ANOPSTT K9 TOP +27 286
#note Best.
>Ross_Brown: EEILMOT L10 TELOI +25 351
#note Fine unless Jeremy has the Z…
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AENSSTZ 14J ZE.NS +68 354
#note … >oops<
>Ross_Brown: AEELMOV 15H VEAL +34 385
#note I miss 14A MA(G)LEV +40, but sealing that bottom row isn't bad either.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AADOSTW 15A WOST +32 386
#note 15A MOSK +53 might seal it, but Jeremy beats me to the spot.
#note Jeremy has M10 ADOW(N) +48 with a better leave, but it's hard to say which is better considering MOSK.
>Ross_Brown: EFKMOOS B4 KEF +26 411
#note This works well - blocks B4 ACEDIA and sets up MOOS in a couple of spots.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AACDEI A5 DICE +29 415
#note A5 AECIA +28 would have made it closer.  I don't know MOS(S)O (which wins by eight), so would have played 13K M(O)O +19 and won by five.
>Ross_Brown: MOOS B8 MOOS +12 423
>Ross_Brown:  (AA) +4 427
