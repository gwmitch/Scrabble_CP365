>Eric_Tran: AELPSTY F9 PALY +32 364
#note This looks better than pretty much all fishing plays, and most everything else, however Quackle brings up another interesting option that I wouldn't have seen, TEPALS O10. Similar idea to PALY, but quite different leaves...

#note best, and with Eric being low on time, gives him an opportunity to blow it.
>Eric_Tran: EOSTZ 9B Z.. +11 375
#note I didn't even realize I was blocking Z(E)O(LI)TE!!!! But I did block ZA too, leaving Eric with no foreseen spot for his Z other than two that I unfortunately just created for him. But with only seconds left on Eric's clock, this was a very exciting finish. He found the win.
