#note This seemed like a thing to try. I am kind of crumbling here since I let it get to me that I'm behind in the score by 100

#note Here my notes indicate I played GO for 11 points somewhere.  Doesn't seem possible.

#note Does anybody see where he might have played WEE for 14?  I don't really think it was here.  Someone probably would have noticed.

#note Ha! this was challenging to enter the game, just as it was challenging to play it.  The beginning was bad, I thought ANCE was such a great rack to keep, but that was dumb.  In entering my record of the game into the Quackle software I really thought SQUALL was vertical.  So was KETAMINE, so that is a problem.  I still have no idea where GO and WEE really were.  Most of the game seems about right besides that, so that makes it more confusing.  I lost 10 points at the end so our recorded score was 345-318.
