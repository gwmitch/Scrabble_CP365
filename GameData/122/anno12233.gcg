#note This is where I'm stuck. My rack is so bad I can't block everything effectively. DOLLAR blocks a bit more, but after a sim Quackle likes my play best.

#note without the O or Y I'm kind of screwed here. I figured my best shot was to make a threat to the G, forcing him to block. If I can draw the O or Y I could then get a nice play next to OXO. Quackle wants me to dump the W instead.
