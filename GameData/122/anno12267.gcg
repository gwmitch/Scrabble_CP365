#note Any number of choices - all of which are varying placements of INFO or FINO) -  are just about identical in the sim.  Everything wins within 2/3% and sims within 2 points of 8E INFO, which the duck declares best.
>Chris_Cree: OPU 9I UPO +13 13
>Jim_Burlant: EEGIIKN L6 EKING +17 31
#note I thought Chris was setting up an N hook down the L column. Thus, I thought that by playing this,  I could take this out and try again.  Q doesn't like this at all, saying that G5 KIEF, which I didn't think of, is best.  I sort of see the point, but to me EGIN isn't too good if I don't draw an A, R, or S.  The last few times I'd kept EGIN, things didn't go too well so I wasn't too concerned about breaking up the rack, especially if I could take out the L column.  Whether or not you agree with my reasoning, it's clear this decision was the inflection point that set this game in motion.

>Jim_Burlant: ABEFINT -  +0 31
#note I knew DEKEING and wasn't familiar with the 6-letter DEKING.  Having inconveniently forgotten that PRESOLD has an anagram of POLDERS, I looked at the board and (incorrectly) thought that, without front-hooking EKING, he had no place to put his bingo down, thus giving him every reason to see if he could get away with this.  Since I thought he had good reason to phony, and given that he's done this to  me in the past, I challenged.  Unsuccessfully.
>Chris_Cree: DIIN H1 INDI. +18 111
>Jim_Burlant: ABEFINT 6J FI. +29 60
#note Best, down to 21% winning chances.  6I IF also worth consideration.
>Chris_Cree: EEGNOOR G8 .OREGONE +64 175
#note Chris's only bingo.   And the scary thing was, he was just getting warmed up.
>Jim_Burlant: ABEHINT 15E TH.BAINE +92 152
#note The only bingo.  26% to win.  The next best plays are BENEATH at 15F and 15D, but they only score 48 and 45.
>Chris_Cree: EHMOY 14J HOMEY +61 236
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIOOT 10F O.ATE +19 171
#note This doesn't do well statically  due to the leave but the sim is a different story:  this or 14D AEON is best, and either play is as good as the other.
>Chris_Cree: JSTU O12 JUST +71 307
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIORS 6E OE +10 181
#note Q doesn't like this but it gets the job done.  While this game was certainly lookiing bleak (Best play of ERASION 14A wins 1.8% to this play's 1.1%), I didn't consider it a done deal just yet given the unseen SQXZ?, and I wanted to make sure that he couldn't shut everything down in 2 turns.  
>Chris_Cree: CELW D3 CLEW +24 331
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMRSU 2G A.EURISM +74 255
#note The only bingo.  Up to 2.4% winning chances now.  Woo hoo!
>Chris_Cree: IQ 1L QI +44 375
#note Amazing Chris didn't have enough of AIU? in his rack to reach to the triple.  I just laughed when this came down.
>Jim_Burlant: AADILRS 11A SALARI.D +73 328
#note The only bingo.  
>Chris_Cree: Z B10 Z. +31 406
>Jim_Burlant: AAACGTX C9 GA.AX +41 369
#note This is just window dressing on the spread unless I can draw into a blank miracle bingo.  Despite that this brings me to within 37 points, I'm  only 7% to win...presumably because Quackle assumes he's got the blank.
>Chris_Cree: ABET 13I BATE +23 429
>Jim_Burlant: ACNRRTV A11 .CART +30 399
#note Fighting and fighting...can I pull it out?  It's this or SCANT.  I chose this because of the slightly better rack balance...but I'm dead if he's got the E's and especially the blank.
>Chris_Cree: W 12C .W +20 449
>Jim_Burlant: DNRUVY M11 RUD. +26 425
#note Best is apparently 6J FIERY.  Makes sense, as it blocks his out play.  But you have to see his out play first in order to block it, which I didn't.  Whoops. 
>Chris_Cree: ?EELTV O2 sVELTE +19 468
>Chris_Cree:  (NVY) +18 486
#note Once I lost the turn challenging his DEKING hook, this game flat-out wasn't winnable.  The small consolation was that, even if I put down KIEF instead of EKING and didn't lose a turn challenging, he'd have still had LEPORIDS and LORDSHIP through the I in KIEF, so he was going to bingo no matter what,  and I'd have been sitting on ABEFINT and trying to figure out how to unload the F and B.  Maybe I win the game if I don't challenge, or maybe I wind up grinding through racks and I don't stage my own mini comeback starting with the THEBAINE sequence?  Who knows?   Regardless, considering the succession of plays I was up against, I'm  astounded that I kept this as close as I did.
