>Dave_Koenig: AELMNTT 8D MANTLET +74 74
#note Game at Chevy Chase Club 8-28-2012.  I let Stefan consult a paper copy of the Collins Official Scrabble Words book during the whole game.
>Stefan_Fatsis: BEE 9E BEE +15 15
#note Stefan: I just did that so I could play TE
>Dave_Koenig: AEHIIOS 7I HIOI +22 96
#note Stefan: You're just showing off!
Dave: Hell no, I'm just managing my rack!  That's a useful word.
>Stefan_Fatsis: DEEFNST L7 .NFESTED +76 91
>Dave_Koenig: AEKNSTU 14E UNSTAKE. +75 171
#note After the game we looked this up and saw it was phony.  Stefan said that he should have challenged since it was only 5 points.  I replied, "You had the dictionary. You should have just looked it up."

>Dave_Koenig: ILNTWYZ H11 WIT.Y +36 207
>Stefan_Fatsis: ?CEELRS M1 RELaCES +77 179
#note I pointed out that the only additional CSW bingo with those seven letters is ALERCES#
>Dave_Koenig: ?DILNQZ 4L Q.ID +30 237
#note NIQAB# would have gone better with my philosophy of trying to play as many CSW-only words as possible against Stefan.
>Stefan_Fatsis: GIP 1L P.IG +30 209
>Dave_Koenig: ?LNRRVZ 12F VR.L +7 244
#note Dave: This time I was just showing off by playing this instead of VIRL.
>Stefan_Fatsis: OWY 10D YOW +36 245
>Dave_Koenig: ?EINORZ 6J ZO +65 309
#note Stefan: Oo, that zo!
>Stefan_Fatsis: AIOV 15A AVOI. +30 275
>Dave_Koenig: ?AEINPR O4 .IPtERAN +80 389
>Stefan_Fatsis: ADEGNRU 2F DUNGARE. +70 345
#note Stefan searched the dictionary for a while trying to see if he could fit a seven on column N.  (He couldn't. The only sevens are ENGUARD# and RAUNGED#.)  Eventually, his eyes shifted to the top of the board, and when he saw this bingo he played it quickly.  I pointed out that UNAGREED would have been even better.  Then we discussed all of the other bingos with that rack: UNDERAGE, UNGEARED#, and RENAGUED#
>Dave_Koenig: BEGLORX N10 BOXER +52 441
>Stefan_Fatsis: OO 7C OO +7 352
#note Stefan had a U, but he chose this instead of OU to give himself more hooks.  Smart thinking, as I held most of the remaining front hooks for OU.
>Dave_Koenig: AAFGILU 13A FALA. +30 471
#note AUF looks best, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to teach Stefan this word and its anagram: just reverse the first two letters.
>Stefan_Fatsis: U 11K U. +4 356
>Dave_Koenig: AAGIOSU 1D SAIGA +33 504
#note I should have played ASIAGO#, because it's CSW-only and delicious.  But it wouldn't have given Stefan such a nice place to play his bingo.
>Stefan_Fatsis: CEHINRT 3B CITHERN +88 444
#note Stefan first tried to play this by hooking ROO#, but I stopped him and told him to look for a better spot.
>Stefan_Fatsis:  (MOU) +10 454
