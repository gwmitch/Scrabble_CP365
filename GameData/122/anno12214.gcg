#note Not exactly sure what I had but it was a lovely flexible Q rack, while Noel's apparently getting dreck.

#note Recorded this one on the back of my scoresheet.  PUDENCY is good and plays forming CHI and YE.

#note There's B[L]UDGE(O)N for 62 or BEDU parallel down for 42 or GUDE there too, but I just wanted to get to the next turn for my Bingo. Tired!

>Kevin_Leeds: ?ADNNOP 10B PON. +12 228
#note Missed DIPNoAN two different places, great bingo, not familiar with it but run across it before in studying.  It's a noun, a lungfish!

#note INAPT 12A is better

>Kevin_Leeds: ?ACDINN 7B CNID. +9 257
#note I was trying to do some minor particular thing with my rack, like stop having two Ns, and make it so the V could be hittable.  Since I have a blank I could be working on opening up bingo lines for myself - Quackle 0.97 Championship Player says DIN(O) is great, N(O)DI (through OLIO) is great too, C(O)NI, NA(N) etc.  If fishing for bingo and have a decent rack, one tile is best, two is next best usually (depends what you can score with them, how decent the rack is - blanks are awesome)

#note A means of travel, in some ways better than driving.

>Noel_Livermore: AEFLOSSW 2B .EAFOWLS +66 312
#note Here I said 'OK' like it was OK and then said 'Hold' like I was worried I'd said 'OK too fast, and then there was further nonsense, where I asked whether I should call the director, and stopped the clock to debate whether I had the right to hold it; but Noel wanted me to start the clock again or else just call the director, but I thought it would be pretty silly to call the director, so I saw his point of view and started the clock again and decided the word was OK since FOWL can be singular or plural, and I was sure SEAFOWL is OK.  Nonsense.  Nice bingo, at least we got some bingos down.  Most seafowl can fly or swim and all of them can at least float.
