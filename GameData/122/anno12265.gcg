>Julius_Wilson: OOZ (challenge) +5 21
#note Not sure about PROP!!!
>Christian_O.B: EEEEIIV K5 VEE. +18 18
#note K5 VEEPEE best for 22 points. I't better to exchange than force to play VEEP leave EEII according to quackle
>Julius_Wilson: OOZ 7G ZOO +30 51
>Christian_O.B: ?AEEIIL 5H ALI.E +8 26
#note 5H ALIVE open another bingo line, however quackle still like 9F ILEA for 15 for same rack leave (IE? more). 7 extra points was too much to sacrifice

>Christian_O.B: ?ADEEIN E4 .EgAINED +82 108
#note E4 REINVADE, REMAINED, REGAINED, RETAINED, RENAILED for 82 points
>Julius_Wilson: IMNT F10 MINT +25 91
#note Offer very high scoring spot for Y (MINTY) to double letter B14. Quite gambling...
>Christian_O.B: ADEGINO 13A GODEN.IA +72 180
#note GODENTIA* was a phoney. Luckily Julius didn't challenge it. The correct one GODETIA
>Julius_Wilson: BEIJR 12H JIBER +61 152
#note Probably this was the reason why he didn't challenge

>Christian_O.B: DIRSSSU M12 SUDS +25 280

>Christian_O.B: CEHIORS 14J CHI.E +34 314
>Christian_O.B: ABELORS (challenge) +5 319
#note Saw COHEIRS immediately. But no play since because of my SUDS!!! Quackle like H1 CHOLA for 30 points leave -IERS. CHIDE was risky play (CHIDER, CHIDED, CHIDES), but since I have S and R already in my rack, maybe I will be able to use it later. Luckily Julius didn't know CHIDE and challenge it

#note Missed O9 LABROSE for 92!!!!. Was sure enough I don't have bingo in this rack, until saw LABROSE in zyzzyva after match
>Julius_Wilson: GN F3 G.N +6 295
#note Julius stressed with vowelless rack here (at least that what he told me)
>Christian_O.B: AEILMNS 1H MANLIES. +83 446

>Julius_Wilson: TTU 3B TUT +8 303
