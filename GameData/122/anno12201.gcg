#note Was a little upset after I noticed I'd picked the 2nd best place for it - third best counting WRATHY
>Roy_Kamen: ??DDLOT J9 DOTtLeD +68 119
#note Sorry, folks! dottled is phony.  DOTTREL or TODDLER would work.  I was thinking 'dottler' but that's a mistake too.  My decision not to challenge had to do with the idea that it's too hard to figure out what to do if I know that the other team has two blanks.

#note score sheet says 'mara'.  Missing I tile would have been very hard to figure out without this rare handy board diagram that I wrote on the scoresheet.

#note should have played THUMB
>Roy_Kamen: EEILLOR 1D OLE +7 252
#note After this I should probably try harder to block the bingo alley with the A but after a few plays Roy beats me to it

>Kevin_Leeds: BEKMNOR 5K K. +32 384
#note My really good play here, instead of trying too hard to keep my rack pretty, would be to block the board and set up my next play with OMBE(R)
>Roy_Kamen: Q 4G Q. +11 285
>Kevin_Leeds: BEMNORY 10B ....Y +23 407
#note ANYMORE would be a good play (which I didn't think of).  ME(A)NY would be good.  BY at M3 would be good.  There are lots of ways I can win here, since Roy has drawn the Q.  Me? I'm thinking about a 5 vowel 8 I studied, AMOEBEAN, and the play I missed at the beginning with JOLTY.  There's an S and a blank out, so why don't I try harder to block the triple line? gee!  Interestingly the definition for AMOEBEAN doesn't say 'having to do with an amoeba', but 'responding alternately', which is cryptic and suggestive of Scrabble.  So Scrabble players are amoebean. Hunh. Who'd a thunk it?
>Roy_Kamen: CEILNRS 2G L.NCIERS +82 367
#note Nice bingo, the S is sticky - it means a French dance (also COURANTE COURANTES COURANT COURANTS are french dances I think, not just 'au courant').  The anagram CARLINES would have played too for fewer points.

#note Our final score was 382 Roy, 451 Kevin
