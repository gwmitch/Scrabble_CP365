#note VETE(R)AN... I really really tunneled here, don't remember why. Meh, not that bad since I wanted Joey on a closed board.

>Joshua_Sokol: ACEFLNU --  -38 39
#note No good plays here. I knew UNCLEFT, thought CLEFT was a past tense of CLEF. CLEF isn't even a verb. It's the past tense of CLEAVE. In the absence of any other palatable options, this seemed like a no-brainer. But Joey is challenge-happy, especially recently. I was just so convinced this was the same thing as UNCLEFT.

#note this was a good play.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEJRSU D4 JA. +25 350
#note This was weird. I considered JA(G) D4 as a play that might win without me drawing into anything, and I considered JURA(T) 10A for maxing bingo chances but also being able to win without one if Joey sacs a ton of points to block the D in DIF. I felt like JURAT would induce more errors, but that I might not even win if I bingo after JURA(T), which is really not true since the pool is so junky. Even if Joey has HOOD for 55 after JURA(T) and I play any bingo like HABIT(U)ES for 64, I win since the bag is empty. But I draw into close to nothing given Joey's range with COWY, especially JURA(T). For bingos I should just suck it up and play (P)UJA. If he blocks I still have a shot at the U or outrunning I think. But JA(G) seemed to be my best shot.
