>Barbara_Bultz: EENRV 8H NEVER +18 18
#note First game of the tournament! I get to play my clubmate, Barbara, here. Good to start against an opponent that I know.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAENOS H7 A.OA +4 4
#note But really not a good rack to start things off. My best play seems to be this, for 4 points. I really don't want to get into  a fishing hole against Barb here. But I really don't have much of a choice, as the other two options are ANOA F7 or 11, which gives back far too much, and exchanging AAO, which gives back a bit less. I'll take 4 points here rather than 0.

>Barbara_Bultz: ABW G5 WAB +22 75
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFGLMW H1 FLAME +44 121
#note I considered FLAME and 12A WAME here. Although F2 FLEAM, sacrificing 5 points for better board control, is worth considering here. But WG is a variant leave. I don't think I'll be able to control this board anytime soon with WG. 
>Barbara_Bultz: J 9G J.. +21 96
>Joshua_Sokol: GHIKMOW D8 MOH.WK +42 163
#note This and F4 WOK have very similar value here. They both score 42 and have the same leave value. I like turning over more tiles here, but this creates an easier lane for Barbara to hit, if indeed she is keeping a very good leave. Otherwise, IG is a better leave here than GHIM, since I draw into many more bingos in the next few turns.
>Barbara_Bultz: FOR 8A FOR. +27 123
>Joshua_Sokol: EGGIIIT 3H .TIGI +7 170
#note I'm actually kind of in trouble here. It seems Barb's leave is pretty good, and there are many places to bingo on this board. I made this play just cause, but also there was a chance it would get challenged. Barbara is not afraid to challenge. Although for 7 points, I guess it's unlikely. At least it creates an S hook she will not want to attempt to make use of. But really, I should take 20 points here and play E5 GITE. This also creates really questionable scoring spots for Barbara, with an X, Q, or a 5 starting in BA, PA or HA being likely avenues for the next few turns.
>Barbara_Bultz: DEINNST K7 D.NTINES +68 191
#note I'm not sure why she took this instead of INTENDS or INDENTS at E2. Perhaps she missed those.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGIOX 2G I.EX +54 224
#note I would have been in a really tough spot here if I hadn't lucked out and drawn the X-bomb. This play is comparable to (L)AX in the same spot. DEGIO is a better leave here for bingos, but ADGO is more balanced. I'll go for balanced.
>Barbara_Bultz: OP F5 OP +26 217
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGLORV E3 VALOR +35 259
#note Missing FORME again. E4 GLOVER, GLOVE are much better than this.
>Barbara_Bultz: DORY 13A DOR.Y +26 243
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEEGSS 14A ESES +36 295
#note Trying to keep Barbara at a distance here by just scoring so well. I should probably keep the S though, and play something more aggressive.
>Barbara_Bultz: TU K3 .UT +8 251
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGRRTZ C3 GRAZE. +34 329
#note 48 for 12K (N)ERTZ. Not doing that after GUT.
>Barbara_Bultz: ET 6I TE +14 265
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEGOPT J10 AGAPE +29 358
#note There we go, that's just about game over. This is a much better play than PEG 15A if I intend to win the game.
>Barbara_Bultz: NO 7K .ON +7 272
>Joshua_Sokol: BCDLOQT 4A CO.T.L +27 385
#note I was kind of at a loss for what to do, so I decided to play this phony. I thought it was valid, as in pertaining to the cortex. I guess not. This could have been very costly. I need to play I12 BOLD, as it is a valid word, and lets me draw into QUI(D) for 42 and QU(I)T for 50 with a likely IU draw.
>Barbara_Bultz: DU A8 .UD +7 279
>Joshua_Sokol: BDILQRU 14F QUIR.. +35 420
#note I should have played 2L QUID. I didn't, even though I was confident that the pool contained nothing that could hurt me. I really just feared that I had missed something and that she would win, and I would blow another tournament. So I played it safe. Little did I see her only bingo. I was very confident she had just drawn II, and that she didn't keep two I's after FUD, so the letter in the bag was without a doubt another I. Crazy III were the last tiles to be drawn.
>Barbara_Bultz: ??EIIIT 15F ITs +22 301
#note she did see ILEITIS, and didn't like it.
