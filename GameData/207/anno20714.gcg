#note I was pretty sure this wasn't that good. I missed M1 ARO(ID), and RA(ID) or LO F9 make more sense than this.

>Joshua_Sokol: ACRRSTY N13 .RY +18 273
#note I was holding Leah on quite a strong rack here. So I wanted to set up points while keeping a very potent leave. But why do that when I have that C at A8 staring me in the face? I could simply play (C)RY if I want to keep ACRST, and that would likely increase my chances of drawing a bingo, since virtually everything Leah would have makes (CLOT)S and opens floaters. But in the same idea as last turn where I felt turnover was a better idea than fishing, B2 CRYSTA(L) is the play. It scores well enough to outrun her stuff, and digs deeper. It's likely the pool contains an S and a blank... I missed CRYSTA(L).

>Joshua_Sokol: ABCIRST M1 BRA.. +25 298
#note Maybe BA(Y)S? I think so. 14A (n)ASTIC still works.
>Leah_Kruley: ADEW E10 WA.ED +24 338
>Joshua_Sokol: CILSSST F9 SIC.S +26 324
#note L10 S(P)I(V)S? Her reaction stays the same, blocking as much as she can unless she can bingo... Looking quite grim from my point of view. I think keeping the Y open makes too much sense. I am not outrunning Leah without a bingo unless she makes a very careless play that doesn't score enough.
>Leah_Kruley: ?AHIRTU E7 UH +15 353
#note Missing the star play, 15L HI(Y)A+. If she is to take the blocking route (which she admitted to taking), she should just play (CLOT)H. That way I don't bingo. This is her actual rack. But any play here is just about a sure win.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEILNST F1 DENTILS +64 388
#note Now I'm stuck with opening 5 really nice floaters if I take the bingo route, or hoping I draw a nice out or two if I take the defensive route (DENSIT(Y) or DESTIN(Y)). Either look quite grim. I decided it was likelier for her to miss than for me to hit outs that score enough after DENSIT(Y). None of my fishing plays seemed to ever work. I have to hope a) she doesn't have the blank or b) she has all the A's or something.
>Leah_Kruley: ?AAAIRT 1D RA.IAnT +24 377
#note whew! -6 to ATARAx(Y), and -7 to a play Quackle doesn't find, E3 oAT, the only thing that manages to block me from going out, from what I see.
