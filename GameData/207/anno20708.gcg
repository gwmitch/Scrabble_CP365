>Johanna: ACEF 8G CAFE +18 18
>Jeffrey: EIRSTTY K2 YITTERS +80 80
#note I knew YATTERS, wasn't sure about this one at all but I couldn't see any 8s, it's early so maybe....
>Johanna: EGLMNOR 2D MONGREL. +68 86
>Johanna: EGLMNOR --  -68 18
>Jeffrey: AEEIITY -IEY +0 80
#note dang this was too silly an exchange- I should have taken one of the two 30+ plays and been done with it (YETI or AIYE(E) [-35]
>Johanna: EGLMNOR J2 MO +25 43
>Jeffrey: ?AEILRT H8 .rTERIAL +74 154
#note ...and my silliness was rewarded, but I missed the hook at 1J for the best points. [-2]
>Johanna: EEGILNR 13B LINGER.E +72 115
>Jeffrey: BDPRRTW F11 BR.W +17 171
#note TW(E)RP 6I best [-3]
>Johanna: EW J6 WE. +29 144
>Jeffrey: DDPRSTV -DDPV +0 171
#note Yucky rack, but I should have squeezed out V(OI)DS 3I  [-10]
>Johanna: IX 10H .IX +26 170
>Jeffrey: AQRRSTU 15A QUARTS +58 229
#note Best play, no E for QUARTERS and I saw 4G QUAR(T)S but worse points
>Johanna: EOV D10 OVE. +14 184
>Jeffrey: AEFGORU E5 FORAGE +22 251
#note Again I miss the 1J hook, which is second best to FUGA(T)O 4G [-14]
>Johanna: ?DENTTU C4 TaUNTED +63 247
>Jeffrey: JLNOPSU 4H JOL.S +45 296
#note I figured an S is not as valuable as a vowel here, but the duck disagrees. best play is JUN(T)O  [-15]
>Johanna: HO F5 OH +31 278
>Jeffrey: DINNPUU H1 PUN.I +42 338
#note I have not played this in a long time, so the Phoney Fear Factor was higher than normal, but I just recalled my Kipling...
>Johanna: AI 8A AI. +9 287
>Jeffrey: ABDNNSU D1 BUNA +22 360
#note I was considering UNBAND* 11J here,  but too risky, holding S UNBAN is apparently the best play [-2]
>Johanna: CDEINOV A4 VOID.NCE +68 355
>Jeffrey: ADEKNSY 2C D.NK +19 379
#note sexy late-game binger by opp.!  I really have to pull out the stops here with the Z-bomb still out.  Star plays are SAK(E) 12A or J13 SKY [static eval ceases to matter, but D(U)NK wins 63% of the time, out of 76% possible
>Johanna: AG 1B GA. +9 364
>Jeffrey: ADEILOS J13 SEI +15 394
#note Only hope here is for the Z-stock, I think, and (R)AZED, (L)EZ and a bunch of stuff are down here, this was the best block I could think of - Johanna was down to a minute or two here IIRC...Q says best move is just A(VOIDANCE), dragging it out another turn (so as to not empty the bag)
>Johanna: AEHIMOZ 5K .HEM +14 378
>Jeffrey: ADLOPY 3A AY +20 414
#note I was psyched not to see any Z plays open up--I was not seeing (T)IZ but that made two of us...
>Johanna: AIOZ N5 .AZO +17 395
>Johanna: AIOZ --  -17 378
>Jeffrey: DLOP 6M DOL +15 429
#note And so what do I do but set her up to play the real one!  Turns out 12C P(E) is the best here, but I knew I had it at this point...
>Johanna: AIOZ N5 ..ZO +15 393
>Jeffrey: P 8N .P +12 441
#note what a tense ENDGAME!  Good times!

>Jeffrey:  (AI) +4 445
