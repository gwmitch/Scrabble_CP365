#note I missed the ACTIONS hooks this turn. ROOF looks good to take it out, but ROOFIES isn't much worse.

#note WOW D4 looked nice, but TWIG saves ZOWIE with an E draw. 6H AGIO is a better version of TWIG. I might be too cute this turn. TWIG ended up setting a hard-to-block S hook that became important.
>Marcela_Kadanka: AENSY A11 YEANS +40 181
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEIOOW F2 WOOED +30 191
#note ZOWIE gives back a lot for overlaps. q likes zowie. It looks fine now, 4 extra points and more balance in the leave, and the OWIE is hard to overlap for 50, a 30 point play isn't too devastating.

>Jackson_Smylie: ADEPUVV 7G V.VE +18 286
#note Simming this with Matt, he said VIVA is the play. I think it's between, VIVE, VIVA, UNPAVED, and DEV. Matt said with 4 A's and only 3 E's, the difference between DEPU and ADPU becomes greater, which I agree with. I think the difference is minute enough that the defensive power of VIVE still makes it better. I can always make ZA plays with the A, and the A can be good for scoring if she plays parallel to VIVE. UNPAVED keeping UV seems ridiculous, and DEV's leave of APUV doesn't seem worth it. I like my play, but I am not sure.
>Marcela_Kadanka: ENOR 3I .ONER +28 272
>Jackson_Smylie: ADIOPUY 2J YUP +35 321
#note She bingoes about the same amount after YAUP/YAUD/YUP. Her bingoes must score more on average after YUP. With a high C:V ratio, I was happy to keep ADIO, as it will help me score. 
>Marcela_Kadanka: MNU 6J MUN +21 293
>Jackson_Smylie: AADDIOU B4 DUO +17 338
#note c3 OUD is 2 more points. 
>Marcela_Kadanka: EFLT 8J LEFT +16 309
>Jackson_Smylie: AADILRS 1L ARID +24 362
#note I wanted to keep the S to block up the board later, but SALAD keeps IR, which works a lot better with the A heave pool. DRAIL underneath LEFT is the equity play, but after her plays I am fairly sure she is holding an S or ?. 
>Marcela_Kadanka: AABHMRS 14A ..B +5 314
>Jackson_Smylie: AAGLLOS 15C AL +7 369
#note AL to block the 15 row bingoes that will win her the game. I was hoping she'd hit a 70 or so point bingo and I draw some scoring tiles and outrun her. LA underneath LEFT was worrisome cause if she bingoes along 15 I lose. I figured my outscoring situation after AL vs after LA wasn't too different. LA blocks F- and T- bingoes. I'm not sure. I am thinking about what she might be holding after NAB. AMRST?, EMRST? AARST? I all see in her range. She was low on time so bingo racks are still in her range, if she didn't want to waste all of it looking. If she's consonant heavy (holding an H or M) she is less likely to his the 15 row. Maybe SLAG and hope she can't find a bingo? i.e. has AAHRST or something else clunky. I think emptying the bag is probably a good idea here, cause with my rack it will be difficult to outrun her. If I do not empty, she can make another fishing play to open another line and win.
