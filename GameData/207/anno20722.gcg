>Joshua_Sokol: EOPQRVZ H4 PROVE +26 26
#note Missing my first opportunity to play PERVO! Damn... That's better than PROVE anyway.
>Jacob_Bergmann: FGL 6F FL.G +16 16
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AOQSTZ J3 QATS +26 52
#note My draws bave been unbelievable haven't they...

Here I considered playing AZO at G2 or at 5D to set up QAT, but neither seemed worth the trouble of maybe having to eat the Q for another turn.
>Jacob_Bergmann: IX 5E XI +23 39
#note interesting. Does K4 XI give back 8 points more than 5E XI? Doubtful.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADIOSZ 4A DIAZO +43 95
#note oops. OZALIDS is worth it here. I missed it, only seeing 8s. I also missed DIS(PROVE), but that isn't the right play at all. The speed and confidence in which FLOG was played indicated a very strong leave to me. I thought Jacob had the blank, and he did. Given this, DIAZO is not a good play. If Jacob does not have a good rack, DIAZO is a very strong play. But AZIDO at K1 is even stronger! Even if Jacob has a the blank, he probaly doesn't have much to score with, so barring a 3x3, AZIDO is great. This was a bad play all around.
>Jacob_Bergmann: ?DEEILT A4 .ETaILED +77 116
#note :/, lucky it wasn't worse
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEHLMS B10 HAEMS +52 147
#note This is the last time that I chicken out of HEMAL! Another bad play given HEMAL.
>Jacob_Bergmann: ORRT 9F TORR +17 133
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CEILNO 12B .LECtION +70 217
>Jacob_Bergmann: ADGINRU C2 GU.RDIAN +74 207
#note I was amazed at how Jacob was keeping up with my ridiculous drawing and timing.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEINWY 11H WINEY +29 246
#note Missing H11 Y(O)WIE. 
>Jacob_Bergmann: AACJLS E10 JA.AL +28 235
#note Jacob said he had the S and JACAL ready to go where I played WINEY.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFGSWY 15E SWAY +45 291
#note Luckily I can't draw badly and I was able to take his spot yet again. I was trying to see if Jacob would play JACAL without an S, and I highly doubted it, which is why I took the hotspot.
>Jacob_Bergmann: BKO 13I KOB +26 261
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFGIOT 14J FOGIE +51 342
#note perfect
>Jacob_Bergmann: EIRUV 3J .UIVER +36 297
>Joshua_Sokol: AIPRTUU O1 PU.I +21 363
#note QUIVER was really bad for me, almost devastating, since the pool was very nice, he had just opened another big spot, and I couldn't do anything about it. I also had QUIPU ready to go. Now I had to keep another U. IR(R)UPT is nice here. I didn't see it. I think it's better than PURI.
>Jacob_Bergmann: CEENS O11 CENSE +34 331
#note I don't think this can be the right play. He's really not outrunning me in all likelihood, and he is holding the case S, a humongous threat. It must be correct to open another lane here somehow and keep well.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABORTTU F9 .OR. +18 381
#note But he blocked TABOUR(E)T and OBTURAT(E)! Impressive. I missed 10J ABOUT, so I had no idea what to do. This isn't really that good of a play, as he might have a bingo somewhere. Anyways, no reason to miss ABOUT. Another costly mistake by me that would likely have mattered much more if I hadn't been running so well.
>Jacob_Bergmann: HNO A13 HON +27 358
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEMTTU 3E BUT +18 399
#note messing up the endgame, following the same theme as previous turns.
>Jacob_Bergmann: ADENT I2 NAE +29 387
#note but Jacob missed his outs.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEMT 10K MATE +17 416
>Joshua_Sokol:  (DT) +6 422
