#note The finals, playing for firs- oh wait nevermind. Whatever, I really wanted to win this one too!
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIKOOQ I8 .OOKIE +14 14
#note Hoping to set up my Q. This was the first of many moves where I probably should have dumped my Q.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: FGINN 12H F.NING +28 52
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAEMQW J10 WA. +33 47
#note damn, blocking WAKAME. I'm saving FAME for next turn.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EILOPWX K10 LE. +26 78
>Joshua_Sokol: AADEMQR H12 .ARM +29 76
#note I probably should have exchanged keeping ADEMR!
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EGHIOST J2 HOGTIES +84 162
#note would have left me much less vulnerable
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEIQT I1 QAT +21 97
#note All my Q plays seem very close to one another. I liked this one best, but QADI would have been much better given the results orientation.

#note Although ACERATES* is phony! Oh no!

#note I guess I just play FEUD. I didn't think it made sense. I thought I had to hope he still had consonants and no E.

#note Maybe try TELERIU(M)*? He might think it's new.

#note I saw C9 VAC. It sets up the X, which is cute, but I can't win with just that, and there are only 11 tiles left unseen, so I can't have a bingo and an X-bomb. There's no time for that. And VAC doesn't score nearly enough. This seems my only shot.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?CINOPX F10 PaNIC +39 364
#note And I saw no fish that would work, unless XENOPIC* is miraculously valid, and even then. I obviously have to draw the blank here, so all my fishes need to win with a blank draw. Nothing wins. He has too many points at 10F anyway, even if some random fish works. I have to make sure I can score 100+ if I hit my fish. But I have NO IDEA how I missed C(O)mIX for 58! I also missed CIN(Q), which I vowed NEVER to miss! There are so many plays beter than this. SOLON is a word! Of course, Josh! 

So I really shouldn't have been looking for bingos. I should have been looking for crazy scoring progressions... If I play F9 OP for 25, and I draw the blank, Mark cannot block CIN(Q) and I will win with ridiculous scoring! He has to play AW or RAW for points, then I play CIN(Q), and then siX(MO) to win by 8! If he blocks with R(AH), I have mINX or jINX making (SOLO)N and blocking his scoring plays! That is a ton of stuff to see, but still. What an incredible possible end to the tournament. Unfortunately the letter I least expected was in the bag... 
Sidenote*, if I play just PEP, I think I win as well, but only by 1.

Anyways, I panicked, and gave up...
