>Brian_Galebach: EIJKNR H4 JERKIN +50 50
#note JINKER and JERKIN are nearly equivalent here.  Putting the E on the center star with JINKER creates a little more risk of a bingo to a TWS square, but JERKIN creates a little more risk of a double-double.  The tiebreaker is that when you're taking a 50-0 lead to start the game, it's better not to create the volatility of giving an extra hook letter. (JERKIN takes -G or -S, while JINKER only takes -S.)
>Dave_Koenig: ABNOOUU 7F OU. +8 8
#note Quackle tells me that I missed BUROO# 6F, which looks like my best play here.  I couldn't find anything I liked, so I just played off my duplicates and set up the BOUK# hook, hoping for the situation to improve.  Boy, did it ever.
>Brian_Galebach: LOPW 6C PLOW +30 80
>Dave_Koenig: ABGNOTU 10H GUNBOAT +83 91
#note He was probably wishing he had played JINKER now.
>Brian_Galebach: AEX 11K AXE +39 119
>Dave_Koenig: CEGNOTY 5H .CTOGENY +78 169
#note This is the second time this month that I have had GONOCYTE blocked, but fortunately I still had this CSW-only bingo.

>Brian_Galebach: IIIII -IIIII +0 143
>Dave_Koenig: ?BFFIIO 8C BIFF +22 239
#note I thought about burning the blank for BIFFIN or BOFFIN 8A, which in retrospect I probably should have, but I was just unsure enough about the words, probably because long ago Matt Graham got away with BAFFIN* against me.  I had vague memories that there was a phony that looked like the real words and couldn't quite remember which was which.  Even without burning a blank, BIFFO# 8B would have been an improvement on my play, if I had known the word.  But it didn't work out too badly for me.
>Brian_Galebach: ADQ 12I QAD. +20 163
>Dave_Koenig: ?CEILOT 3I CITOLEs +84 323
#note I didn't realize that this is actually one point more at 11B, although there is a slight advantage to keeping the other spot open if I think that he might be afraid to try JERKINGS# against me.
>Brian_Galebach: EMW 2L MEW +32 195
>Dave_Koenig: AAELORU 14I AUREOLA +81 404
#note This is the moment where the game went from a blowout to just plain ridiculous.
>Brian_Galebach: HIMS 15L SHIM +64 259
#note At least Brian got to make this nice play.
>Dave_Koenig: AAEORTT 15H OAT +13 417
#note A bit sloppy perhaps.  There are bingo possibilities on the bottom row, and on the top making the EMO# hook.  Considering how safe my lead is and how good my rack is, maybe I should just play OAT 5C to keep both spots open.  Or maybe I should just take the points and play TAO 1M.  In my play's favor, the row 15 spot was the most versatile one, where almost any bingo of his would fit, and I am well poised to hit the row 1 spot myself.

#note An embarrassment of riches.

>Dave_Koenig: ERRUV D11 .R.VE +18 616
#note TROVER K3 is actually the best play for spread, simply because it takes away his high scoring spot for the N tile.
>Brian_Galebach: N L1 ...N. +16 376
>Brian_Galebach:  (RU) +4 380
#note Getting to 380 when you're outbingoed 6-nil is nothing to sneeze at.
