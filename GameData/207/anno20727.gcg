#note Context. Sunday morning, game 1 of the day, and I'm 4 games and 700 spread ahead of 2nd place. So there is a 1/248 chance that I will lose this tournament, all things remaining equal. Thelen has to win 4 games and I have to lose 4 completely unrelated games. And he also has to catch up to my spread, which isn't a walk in the park either. But for good measure, I would really like to win this game.
>Joshua_Sokol: IKRV E5 KIV. +22 22
#note can't remember my leave here. I think this was my only sensible play from wht I saw.

#note ZOO inferred a bingo-prone but vowel-heavy leave. This makes it the hardest for him. I prefer it over 11E W(O)RM and E11 TWIRL

#note 14F SANGHA is nice. I didn't see it, but I had just learned it! I didn't really like the G here, but I lengthily considered AH, AAH or NAH in the same spot. In the end I supposed that the H wasn't as dangerous as the N or the A, and that the G wasn't worth keeping, and that I could just play a 6 down the H next turn a lot of the time and score well. I think that AAH is likely better, come to think of it. The A isn't that bad given that there are very few waves to score very well down column A without a bingo. I think HAG is more dangerous than I thought at the time.

>Joshua_Sokol: AAGLNOS H12 GA.N +21 251
#note I was about to play HOGANS and got really scared of the J for some reason. I had gotten this tell from Michael that he had a lot of points ready to go, and I thought it was the J, but it could very well have just been the H... HOGANS should be my play.
>Michael_Ecsedy: EHNR 15L HERN +41 288
>Joshua_Sokol: AALOSTY 12H .OATY +18 269
#note (H)OSTLY was a possibility that I thought of, but I had never seen it, I had thought. That's a nice play to keep the lead. The pool was looking pretty good, so I thought I would just go for a bingo. Meh.

#note This was probably Michael's game to win, but he gave in to temptation.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEJLNS 15A JEES +43 348
#note And it made my decision process quite bizarre. I know how strong of a leave he has, so he's likely going to fish, especially if I play JEES/GURUS for 43. But what if I play JE(T) for 20? Then he can only really hit something to the R at N15 or if he's really lucky, at 1H. But if he fishes after JET, I will likely hit a bingo! But I decided outrunning made much more sense, and I'd see that the board gets shut down if need be.
>Michael_Ecsedy: AEINNST B6 ANENT +19 317
#note No fish, I'm in great shape to win!
>Joshua_Sokol: AIILNPV 11J PIANI +27 375
#note I was pretty damn sure PIAL didn't take an S, but I wanted to empty the bag. After ANENT, he likely has another I on his rack, and he can't really hit anywhere else. Also, the pool is garbage. I think this has got to be right. He might even challenge.
>Michael_Ecsedy: EFIILST N10 F.LTE. +34 351

#note Gibsonization feels great.
