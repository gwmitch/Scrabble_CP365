>Joey_Krafchick: ACEEILY H6 AYE +12 12
#note LACEY. Didn't even see it...I've had some problems with my 5's at this tournament, meaning, I'm going to get down and learn my damn 5's now. This is ridiculous. (-7.9)
>Daniel_Stock: ACEERRS I3 CAREERS +74 74
>Joey_Krafchick: CEEILMO G3 CLIME +25 37
#note Wins the sim.

>Daniel_Stock: NOPR A1 PRON. +27 113
>Joey_Krafchick: ?BEILTT 4I .BET +12 81
#note I considered (A)LBEIT, but I wanted to keep the rack less broken up. In hindsight, creating more lanes by playing more tiles probably is better given the crappy board. (-1.1)
>Daniel_Stock: ARX 5K RAX +26 139
>Joey_Krafchick: ?BILMNT 6L MIB +27 108
#note Wins sim. 
>Daniel_Stock: AIRSTTZ O1 TZARIST +109 248
>Joey_Krafchick: ?AILNTU 1H rUTILAN. +74 182
#note First off, (P)LATINUm is 6 more, missed that. Second off, (PE)NULTImA is cool.

I could have played UNITs for 63, but I took my bingo in hopes that I would beat him to an S / other blank, because I'm down a lot, as you can see. Quackle likes the 80 point bingo the best by a long ways. (-6.2)

#note Ouch.

#note Championship Player has this second to 3A (O)SE. 
>Daniel_Stock: INR B2 .R +4 458
#note 3C IN for 16 sticks him with the R, interestingly. 
>Joey_Krafchick: EEISV 15G VIES +29 378
>Daniel_Stock: IN 2J IN +10 468
#note Although the back to back 100 point plays were unfortunate, I need to play a little bit less sloppily, especially when I make a mistake on my very first turn!
