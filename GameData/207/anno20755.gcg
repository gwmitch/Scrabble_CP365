#note HELP!    exch. II simes best, with my exchange IIIPP far down the sim list.
I get that keeping a consonant in general might be good, but is there more to this I'm not realizing?

#note (T)ENET L11 sims best without running any iterations.  This seems VERY aggressive for a pretty low initial payout
