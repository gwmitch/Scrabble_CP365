>Joshua_Sokol: EGINNTV H4 VENTING +80 80
#note Something interesting about this play. More to come
>Michael_Ecsedy: AEIOT 10G A.IO +7 7
#note Partial rack info was given to me by Michael afterwards.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFIIMPS 11I FIE +19 99
#note I should keep the E and either play 6F FI(N), I7 IF or 11J IF. I think FIN makes the most sense. This was a dumb mistake, but maybe Michael will try to add an S
>Michael_Ecsedy: AEEISST 11A EASIEST +66 73
>Joshua_Sokol: ILMPRST A7 LIMP.R +33 132
#note Forgot about LIMPET. That's better. Maybe even IMP(E)L. Yeah, I think IMPEL is the play.
>Michael_Ecsedy: GLNTY 5G G.NTLY +20 93
#note or D10 T(I)NGLY for 28

>Joshua_Sokol: ?CDPRSW E4 CR.W +18 224
#note I considered this and W(A)SPS. I liked my leave especially since I held the case S for S(CREW) and I thought this prevented more bingos from Michael's end.
>Michael_Ecsedy: AEERRTT B2 RETREAT +72 227
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DDOPRS A1 POD +23 247
#note Missing 2A P(R)ODDeRS, but I shouldn't bingo I think.

>Joshua_Sokol: EFIMRUU N8 FEM +26 435
#note I wanted to block QAI(D). I preferred getting Q stuck to letting Michael not get Q stuck

>Joshua_Sokol: DIRUU 4B ..R. +12 447
#note This is one of, if not the most complicated endgame I have ever found myself in. But I was so lazy. I didn't want to get U stuck, but I didn't see a way out of not getting stuck with at least one. All I could manage to find was 9L RU(ER), setting up U(R)D, hoping Michael doesn't block, or (S)URD F11 setting up (D)UI, hoping again he doesn't block. But instead I decided it was fine to get U-stuck since I am scoring a lot more if I'm not trying to get myself unstuck. Little did I know, Michael had a few tricks up his sleeve that I haven't witnessed up anyone's sleeve for a long time. How lazy of me. TORC could be correct (I won't go over this endgame again), but after TORC I need to be very very careful.
>Michael_Ecsedy: AAEILOQ 4G A.E +12 355
#note this was very cute. If I play ID/DAGO, I give him a juicy spot for his Q. But I didn't bite.
>Joshua_Sokol: DIUU K7 .I +6 453
#note Instead, I bit the other bait that Michael hadn't yet figured out he was carrying! I need to PASS here, or at least keep my I. Here's why:
>Michael_Ecsedy: AILOQ 2M AI +12 367
#note !! Beautiful find by Ecsedy!
>Joshua_Sokol: DUU G3 D... +8 461
#note If I had kept my I, I would be fine with that opening, since him playing off his Q would give me QI for 33.
>Michael_Ecsedy: LOQ N1 Q. +11 378
>Joshua_Sokol: UU -  +0 461
#note :'(
>Michael_Ecsedy: LO D10 ..L +10 388
>Joshua_Sokol: UU -  +0 461
>Michael_Ecsedy: O 7D O. +5 393
#note So, E(VENTING)+ was a word this whole time! I didn't even think of it, but Michael did. He just didn't know for sure. Wow. So I had HAZIEST, CAZHEST$! and other stuff that played there :)
