>Juraj_Pivovarov: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAHILO H4 AIOL. +6 6
#note Annoying turn, no idea why I couldn't come up with OHIA. I didn't want to give him any big hotspots since none of my plays score well. I thought I would at least keep the H to help improve my chances to score next turn.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AELORST I1 OLESTRA +68 90
#note Nice overlap, I'd return the favour in our next game.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEHRT H1 HA +32 38
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BDEK 4G B..KED +26 116
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENORT J1 OE +15 53
#note I still wasn't solid on all the new 3s, but this scored 8 more points than dumping OE elsewhere so I trusted myself.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?CEFINO J7 CONFInE +74 190
#note He nearly played CONFIdE, but changed it to CONFInE at the last second. To my delight.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEENRT 12E NEATE.ER +66 119
#note Except this isn't even a word! I played it with confidence. Juraj liked it at least.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EFGOR 5K FORGE +31 221
#note He took a long time to play this. It could be trouble for him.
>Matthew_Larocque: DGILMST O1 MIDG.T +36 155
#note I should know GLIMED, but I don't.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: APZ 11D ZAP +36 257
>Matthew_Larocque: DLNNSVY K11 D.NY +24 179
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IX N2 XI +39 296
>Matthew_Larocque: AILLNSV 3C VILLA +23 202
#note I can score 40+ at 14J, but not so sure I'd have been able to play any of those words confidently. I also need to do something to get the board more open, too bad the V isn't ideal for that.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IPRU 9D PURI +19 315
>Matthew_Larocque: ?NOSTUW 13A OUTWiNS +80 282
>Matthew_Larocque: ?NOSTUW --  -80 202
#note :( SWOUN 8A scores well and keeps the blank while opening a dangerous vertical line.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AENV D1 NA.VE +18 333
>Matthew_Larocque: ?NOSTUW 13G WO +20 222
#note Still SWOUN.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ACDEHRR 14B CHARRED +90 423
#note Yikes. I felt charred after that play!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?NNSSTU 15H SUN +24 246
#note Obviously I still think NEATENER is a word, and it looks hard for him to obscure without opening other spots for me to bingo. I did see SUNTaNS here, the only 7, but it doesn't play.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AMOY 8A MAYO +35 458
>Matthew_Larocque: ?JNSTW 5C J.W +26 272
#note Not a good time to draw JW.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BOT 7B BOT +21 479
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGNSST M5 .ESTiNGS +67 339
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGNSST --  -67 272
#note Wow, how do I see SIGNETS but not INGESTS? I doubt Juraj challenges *NEATENERS either. There goes a bunch of spread.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIITUU C13 U. +10 489
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGNSST 14K .EN +6 278
#note Juraj has about 3 seconds left on his clock. I could slow play him and make him go over time..... eh... decided to make a setup and just go out.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIITU A8 .I +4 493
>Matthew_Larocque: ?GSST N10 GiSTS +32 310
#note I never bothered *redesignating the blank, since it was an I all three times.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (EITU) +8 318
