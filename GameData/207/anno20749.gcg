#note HELP!  Why is HULK 7J sooo much better my play (simmed 11th, 4%les to win, valuated at 8 fewer pts.)?    Is it as simple as not opening an extra bingo lane after opp seemed to fish a/o my leave being a little vowel-heavier?

#note HELP!  I'm a little surprised JEE G9 valuates at 9 pts better than mine, only scoring 2 pts better.   Is ENR leave just so non-synergetic?
>Travis_Green: EHO G9 HOE +34 250
#note maybe it was more about not giving opp the chance at the spot...
>Matthew_Ridout: AEFGNNR O1 FRAG +38 309
#note HELP!  Q reallyl, really didn't like my ENN leave.  F(A)NE E2 simmed best.  Mine was eighth, 3% worse to win, and 6 valation pts worse.  But mine scores 11 pts better...

#note Was unfamiliar with BLENNIES.  BENNIS 8A was much better  than my putrid offering anywho.

#note Bad luck for him.  He confirmed later his rack had been vowelless.
