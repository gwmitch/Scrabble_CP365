>Mark_Przybyszewski: HOY 8G HOY +18 18
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IMRTUY 7B YTtRIUM +73 73
#note Revenge will be sweet, Przyzyszewski! I saw the two only bingos in this rack, but I missed FUMITORY. Glad I could finally play this word rather than just YTTRIA :)
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EIRTV B2 VERIT. +28 46
#note Good thing I didn't take the points at 9A, or this would have scored 20 more points!
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGJLNO F4 GOJ. +28 101
#note Lots of plays here, JONGLER* wasn't one of them. Good thing I didn't pull the trigger on that, since it may have been challenged. JONGLE* is a word I keep thinking is valid since it's French for Juggle. 5A J(I)NGLE seemed the other sensible option. 5A J(I)NGO seemed to be asking for trouble.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: DLLR 5D DR.LL +12 58
#note No DROLLEST or DROLLERY? Come on, Mark, draw better :)
>Joshua_Sokol: AEELNRS J2 LEANERS +71 172
#note I had no idea which placement made the most sense. All of them had setbacks. I could have just played E(T)ERNALS C6. I missed it. I was hoping Mark would either miss the hooks or not have something that would sting up there. And most of all I wanted a lot of the board to be sealed away.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: NNOX 3I X.NON +40 98
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFINTU 2F FINA.E +28 200
#note 2I A(L)UNITE is an insane play I might have made if I hadn't missed it! I just really didn't want Mark to have a huge bingo, but huge scores and then bingo threats are also a problem, which is why my play isn't really smart. I overthought this position. I should just play FAUN or ALUNITE.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: BEGIR 1E GIBER +49 147
>Joshua_Sokol: EGHTTUW 4L HUGE +30 230
#note I'm in trouble now, since there isn't anything that I can play at 1K. Or is there... Missing TEUGH for the millionth time. Ack...
>Mark_Przybyszewski: DEINW 1K DWINE +43 190
>Joshua_Sokol: EIORTTW A3 WOT +17 247
#note Here, it was between playing long and playing short. I decided to let Mark blow the board open for my good leave. I made the right choice, for sure.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AAAAA -AAAAA +0 190
>Joshua_Sokol: EFILNRT O3 F.RTILE +30 277
#note ELFIN instead looks nice, especially with all the junk he exchanged.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AM 5J .AM +18 208
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIKNOP N7 KADI +22 299
#note NOP isn't a nice leave. I should also not let Mark play horizontally and not open huge spots with a bingo, instead opening a nice lane most of the time. That isn't going to happen if I don't give him an easy S lane with KADI. This was a weak play. (WE)AK is actually likely the right play. Or maybe N9 DAIKON?
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AQU D2 QUA. +28 236
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDNOOP M8 COOP +21 320
#note POOD is better. That way it only takes an S, COOP also takes a T. But POCO M10 is even nicer. It doesn't take an S.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AP 9H PA +18 254
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEENST 10B STANDEE +72 392
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ACUV D9 V.CUA +20 274
#note oops, empty bag
>Joshua_Sokol: ABIOOSZ 12H BAZOOS +49 441
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ?EEIST 13A IdE.TES +14 288
#note BEASTIE for 18, SETaE, which Mark saw after, and STE(A)mIE+ are all better than this. I would have challenged SETAE!
