#note Thankfully I didn't miss any bingoes here, I had a feeling I might have!

Quackle likes 10B FILO the best by a margin of about 2.5....My play has the same leave, but takes out the LOBELIAS hook that he will know. FILO takes out lanes and 2 hotspots, not sure here. I guess I take the extra 5 points? Not really sure....(-5.4)

#note Championship player says (V)U(M) wins 100% of the time, ZE(E) is second at 97.22, and mine is further down at 94.44.

I played this because I saw EBONITE as a possibility up top for a bingo, and ZE(E) didn't block that. Perhaps I'm not seeing some possibilities, but that's how I saw it at the time after thinking for a while.
