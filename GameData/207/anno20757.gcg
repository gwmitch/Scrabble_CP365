#note ROD sims a little better. Setting up my T is worth something. And there's really not much difference defensively.
>Ted_Goenther: EJTU 10B JUTE +29 53
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEINRX 11C NIXED +50 89
#note Sims really close with NIX and XI which keep some of the rack together. On a tight board I decided the rack wasn't worth building off of.
>Ted_Goenther: ??ACENS J2 CANcErS +81 134
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABDERUU 2J .UBED +20 109
#note UNAU, UNDUE and ex. UU all sim better than I thought. Also EARBUD amd DAUBE which I considered. All these plays sim within 2 points. In hindsight I think I would have gone with one of the plays to dump both U's. CUBED hasn't got much potential

#note I just want to see some new tiles at this point.

#note 14I FEM? Maybe I need to risk it at this point. But it just seems like I'll immediately lose a lot of the time. The sane option is K10 OF or EF, which I considered. But I still wanted to favor turnover to hit something big at 12A maybe. Maybe a mistake
>Ted_Goenther: AHST 12A HAST +31 226
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EFHMOOT A12 .OOF +30 198
#note At this point I'm just hoping he hits a bad rack at some point so I can catch up. There probably wont be anymore bingos

#note Phony. It seemed likely I could get away with it. And it's much better than anything else.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEILRRT 3L RE +23 272
#note I burned most of my time here. It's a tough call whether to go for the bingo or try to win without one. I would have to open the bottom and count on a very unlikely bingo in the top right. The other option is to just take points and hope I draw something more useful than these one-pointers. Unfortunately the scoring plays only turn over 2 tiles (RE and EL). There's also LITER at 5B which scores okay and gets the turnover I'm hoping for. But it eliminates most opportunity for a bingo. And maybe I can't afford to turn over so many tiles. I think I just need to get super lucky on a 2-tile draw. I also briefly toyed with the idea of plays like 14G RETE which counted on Deen not knowing NAES. But nothing really worked that well down there.

#note I can't do much about NAG. ZIG blocks the worst, but I'm still in a lot of trouble.
>Ted_Goenther: AAILRSV 15H SALIVA +54 347
#note Deen was under a minute. He didn't have time to realize that SILVA or SALVIA actually win more often. SALIVA loses to I in the bag.
