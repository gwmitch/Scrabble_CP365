#note I challenged this, a new four.   I wasn't sure either way, but had a homeless bingo on my next rack.   I'm lucky she didn't happen to be familiar with OUTBRAVE.

>Matthew_Ridout: ?ADEILT M2 DI. +8 292
#note LAID 3L bes before running iterations.  After 1000 iterations, UNITS I10 appears best.  
I felt like my rack was strong enough that I should not risk her bingoing from O8 and not have a place for my own likely future bingo.  Still, DIE sacrificed points, and so only simmed 6th.

>Victoria_Bledsoe: IKNO 12K OINK +19 255
>Matthew_Ridout: ?AEHLNT 15D HA +20 312
#note ALPHA 5G best.  Mine just 9th, but there was little difference in the whole pack
>Victoria_Bledsoe: IMSU O12 SUMI +31 286
>Matthew_Ridout: ?DELNST K11 ..LD +6 318
#note LED N1 best.   Mine 7th, yet close.
Even with the tile sunseen to me being vowel-heavy, I wanted to hang on to my E.   With the case blank in hand, i knew I had a big advantage even if I never bingo'ed.
>Victoria_Bledsoe: CIT 10M TIC +13 299
>Matthew_Ridout: ?AEINST 2F SINuATE. +62 380
#note DEISM 14K looked best before running interations.  After, INSTATED simmed best, with my bingo still off the board.  Why?  She could have playable AIRDROP (or PRURIGO, tho Q didn't know it since doesn't have new words like GI loaded).   She can't bingo against INSTATED.
