>Joshua_Sokol: AENPRST H2 ARPENTS +74 74
#note Short term, this placement makes it very very hard for Mike. Long term though, it's problematic. PARENTS is probably right here.
>Mike_Thelen: ?ADEESU 3C mEASU.ED +70 70
>Joshua_Sokol: BFFJOSY 4A JOYS +52 126
#note This play was very aggressive and greedy. I think I missed JO(E)Y, which seems right. I also missed BOFF, and chickened out of B(A)FFY. Not a big deal but not impressive in the slightest.
>Mike_Thelen: CORW 5E COW.R +20 90
>Joshua_Sokol: BEFFGTT -BTGFF +0 126
#note Here is where ARPENTS was problematic. I can't block the S without sacrificing a bunch. I hated FE(N). It left me so vulnerable. But I think I just have to take the points and hope for a vowel or two. I preferred exchanging to keep everything under control.
>Mike_Thelen: GILZ 7E GLI.Z +26 116
>Joshua_Sokol: EKLOOTW 6B KOTOW +50 176
>Mike_Thelen: AFLRTU 2J ARTFUL +27 143
>Joshua_Sokol: AELLMNT 7A LAM +21 197
#note 2D LLAM(A) is nice. M2 (F)LAMEN works too. I didn't know FLAMEN!
>Mike_Thelen: EG 6H .EG +20 163
>Joshua_Sokol: EILNOTU O2 .UTEOLIN +77 274
>Mike_Thelen: ?AEIMRT A7 .AMIsTER +80 243
#note enlightened play by Mike! I like it :)
>Joshua_Sokol: AHIINOV N6 HAO +31 305
#note with one S left to draw, I had a choice. I could block immediately with (R)AVIN and risk getting hit elsewhere and regretting being paranoid, or I can block when it makes a tad more sense to. HAO just does so many good things for me, and the V will be useful later on anyway.
>Mike_Thelen: EEEIIII -EEEIIII +0 243
#note I made the right choice.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIINPV 14A .IVEN +16 321
#note Now Mike is twice as likely to have the S, although it's not that likely. Still, I thought this would be a good moment to block. I hope he doesn't hit me hard with an H...
>Mike_Thelen: ASX 8C AX +22 265
#note I blocked SAX for 60!
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDIINP D12 PI.D +18 339
#note Here I chickened out of PIANIC, even though I had just learned PIANI+. But I missed the star play, 15E ADIPIC! That might garner a challenge, but either way it's just so good. Given those two misses I was at a loss about what to do here. I think I chose the 3rd best play...
>Mike_Thelen: DEOT 15D .OTED +23 288
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEINRU M2 .UCI +18 357
#note My time is starting to run low as I have been looking hard my last two turns for good plays. Nothing sprung out to me here either. I thought for sure I was missing a bingo. Fishing with (X)U looks great here. I hit so much...
>Mike_Thelen: BFIOSVY B9 IF +30 318
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHINNR A1 NIN.A +36 393
#note I finally drew into something I was hoping for for the last few turns.
>Mike_Thelen: S A7 ........S +30 348
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHNRY F5 ...Y +10 403
#note Getting Q stuck would suck, and it seems Mike has opted to try and avoid the letter too. So time to counterfish! (this only hits with an I...)
>Mike_Thelen: B J1 B.. +6 354
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHNQR 5L Q. +11 414
#note it was at this point that Mike realized he had (S)VEDBERG!!! But alas, it did not play.
>Mike_Thelen: BDEEGRV 14G DEV +13 367
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHINR J9 HERNIAE +74 488
#note and I hit. Ridiculous.
