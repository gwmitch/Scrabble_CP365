#note I have never beaten Karl. Everytime I've played him, it's been extremely frustrating. I vowed to not get frustrated this time!
>Karl_Higby: EJRR 12D JERR. +30 30
#note This was an amusing succession of plays. Both of us chuckled.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CLRSTU E6 CULTuR.S +68 100
#note There may be a better way of restricting access to the left side here, such as putting a different letter at E8, but I don't see one.
>Karl_Higby: QS 10D S.Q +31 61

>Karl_Higby: V 9G V.. +17 78
>Joshua_Sokol: ABCDEGT J6 GAB +19 161
#note Karl seems to either have a very good rack after this, or a mediocre bingo leave. Either way, I am not giving him anything to play through with BAGE(L). I want to make it very hard for him to bingo.
>Karl_Higby: LNOO K4 LOON +16 94
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEGLTT L6 TEG +16 177
#note In the same stream of thought as last turn, Karl probably has an S, given his last two plays. He was likely holding something balanced but not amazing with an S after VOX, and just dumped some iffy one-pointers. I want to make it difficult for him, which is why I didn't play 7C GL(U)T.
>Karl_Higby: DNO M7 DON +20 114
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEILTW 10J WILED +26 203
#note Again, he has a bingo-ey leave most of the time here. I'm not playing 8L (GO)WD. WITED and WILED are very similar. I liked keeping the T with the L to play through.
>Karl_Higby: OY N8 YO. +16 130
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIRSTU O2 ICTERUS +104 307
#note A lucky break for me. CURITES may be slightly better.
>Karl_Higby: AE G11 E.A +8 138
>Joshua_Sokol: DGIIIOP L10 .IPOID +22 329
#note Last time I played Karl, he 3x3ed against me. Quite obviously at this point, the only way I can lose this game is if Karl 3x3s. It takes courage to make this play. Courage that I am stronger than the player I was when Karl 3x3ed on me last time we played. Strong enough to overcome. This play, I kid you not, was the biggest turning point for me in this tournament. It brought me the confidence I needed to win it all.
>Karl_Higby: ?AEINST 15H STEA.INg +122 260
#note This is Karl's only 3x3. Nice find.
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEGIRU 4H BUG.ED +26 355
#note This turn, I should have played BURG(L)E. In the same idea as last turn, I should be courageous enough to face a possible loss and overcome it, instead of playing iffy defense!
>Karl_Higby: FI 14I IF +28 288
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIILRV 8A VIRI.E +30 385
#note cause someone was going to play there anyway :P. VIEL(L)E is a neat new word

>Karl_Higby: AE M12 AE +12 312
>Joshua_Sokol: HLNOOUZ D1 ZONUL. +50 467
#note I made up for not playing BURGLE by playing this.
>Karl_Higby: AEEHINN 1D .ENNIA +45 357
>Karl_Higby: AEEHINN --  -45 312
#note As I hit the clock and began to draw, Karl said "This is unbelievable!" and then started to put a word down. I got really really scared until he took his tiles back! He got me good...
