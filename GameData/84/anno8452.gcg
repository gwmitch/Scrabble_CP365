#note Al didn't have SATIRE, but he's obviously about to bingo...
>trashman: AQT H7 QAT +24 24
#note Didn't record the rest of my rack, but it didn't matter. This was the only option...
>al_helfgott: EILNORS 8H .ILERONS +77 77
#note Expected that...
>trashman: ?EOPRTT O8 .POTTERs +80 104
#note Any double-double in column K scores 6 more, but I didn't want to leave an S in the TW column. jETPORTS to the S also scores 6 more...
>al_helfgott: AAMOZ 10M AZ. +32 109
#note Al originally starts to play MOZO here, blocking my double-double. He then makes this play, telling me later he had another A. With those tiles, Q likes N3 AMAZON for 37...

#note Thanks, Al!
>al_helfgott: AIMOX L12 OXIM +36 145
>trashman: CEEEMOT 6J C.EOME +22 220
#note Q slightly prefers N12 EME for 2 fewer points. L1 COMTE scores best, but is riskly. Al challenges, confusing it with COELOME...

#note J8 LOW for 2 more. Derp...
>al_helfgott: ?AGINTU 13D UNITAGe +65 248
#note Q actually prefers passing on the bingo. It likes either M12 TUT 27 or M13 UTA 28. Interesting, given there's only 2 bingo lanes...
>trashman: CDEEGLR D12 C.RD +18 300
#note Struggled with this rack. Doesn't even make Q's list. O1 RECEDE or DECREE for 30 are best options. With the tourney on the line, I prefer closing the board and protecting the lead. 
>al_helfgott: U 13L .U +22 270
#note Is Al close to another bingo?
>trashman: AEEEGLY 15A EYE. +24 324
#note Best. Getting nervous, though...
>al_helfgott: AHH 12F HAH +29 299
>trashman: AEGLOUV B9 VAGUEL. +32 356
#note Board is now effectively dead. And Al's running into time trouble, and I can smell his dispair and desperation. Or, maybe he just didn't shower...
>al_helfgott: DY L4 DY. +21 320
>trashman: GNOORTV O1 GROOV. +33 389
#note Not thrilled with the G in the corner with all the I's and an N still unseen. Considered VROOM, but the 13 points were a big difference. Q agrees by a long shot...
>al_helfgott: DIS 10F DIS +21 341
>trashman: AEFIINT M1 FINE +17 406
#note Tough play. Knew this play would be the key to winning the game. My choice doesn't make Q's list, but I stand by it. Q prefers scoring with 2J FAINER for 34. But it gives Al his only chance to win, opening the triple lane. I mentally went through the 44 8's ending with F and concluded none were playable (not really, but I just checked with LeXpert), and I'll cede a bingo in row 2 or column F...

#note Looking good, leave one in the bag...
>al_helfgott: BIINORS 8D I. +6 352
>trashman: AILNPTU 7B TUP +10 421
#note Saw D2 NAUPLII, which Q prefers, but I blocked KINSBOR, just in case that snuck into the dictionary... The end game is sloppy, but I didn't care. Al went over time, but I didn't care about that, either, and forgot to deduct 10 on the final tally slip. Didn't much care about anything but winning and defending my Danville title. Woo hoo!
