#note another move i struggled wih. in general, i think i'm getting a bit better at these types of moves. i had to talk myself out of fishing with AE, but in this situation i don't think it's that good of an idea. C3 DEAF sims slightly better, though. (-0.5)

#note disaster! ...  i noticed 14J ODEON after i hit the clock. i'm not convinced it's that much better than my move, though. by which i mean, i am not so sure i would have played it. note that QI isn't right. also, node cesar, come on. sheesh. (-7.5)
