#note Amit took a fair amount of time here and found the highest scoring bingo.

#note I was debating between CHINWAG/CHAWING, HAWING to set up the hook, and this play.  I think I got it right, and Quackle agrees.  The leave is a little bit vowel heavy, but I've got lots of friendly consonants to play through.  I also score slightly more than other plays and take away one of the best scoring spots on the board.

#note This was an interesting moment.  Amit overdrew three tiles instead of two, so I got to look at all of them.  They were Q, A, and another consonant.  I threw back the A, but then I realized that he might have QI K5.
>Dave: DDELNTY M1 TYNED +26 144
#note I would have played DIDY L12 if I didn't know Amit was holding the Q, but this play seemed to make sense, both to block his Q spot and to open up the triple lane when he would probably be unprepared to deal with it.

#note So much for my clever strategy.

#note I suspected that ZOECIAL* was no good.  I would have known for sure a few years ago.  My, how the memory fades.  It didn't even draw a hold.

#note Quackle's static evaluator chooses GIBE over this, but this play is much better for a few reasons.  One is that there are three O's and no I's remaining, so there is value in both playing off the O and in retaining the case I, which can help both with bingos and Q underlaps.  Also, with a good bingo pool remaining, this play blocks more bingo lines.  Finally the B has several good scoring opportunities on this board: B6, C3, F10.
>Amit: NO 6B NO +13 326
>Dave: BILNOST 12C BOLTS +21 365
#note I've got enough of a lead that it's imperative to take out this bingo line, but it pays to be careful about how to do it.  His last play suggested that he might be holding the last N and O, and he might be angling to set up an O starting bingo at A6.  I considered playing longer with BIONTS to take away the A lane, but that gives him a friendly I to play through.  I'd prefer to turn over as many tiles as possible in a way that doesn't give him much to play through, and I figured that the O starting bingo was a long shot.  This way I only give him a bingo-unfriendly B, and an O which needs to be sixth position, when it may be a duplicate already.

#note Now I should be able to win safely, I thought.
>Amit: ?DENRSS J10 ....S +28 374
#note A nice play by Amit that shows he still has some fight left.  He was down to a few seconds, and I had maybe a minute or less left.

>Amit: ?DENRS 1G uN....... +54 428
#note I blocked SENDeR 7A, though Amit still had an outplay of DR(AGO)NEtS.  But that would throw in the towel.  If I let this gambit stand and play out, the game is a tie.  If I challenge, I either win or lose.  I had very little time to make my decision.  What would you do?
>Amit: ?DENRS --  -54 374
#note I believed the word was more likely to be phony than good, but one factor that swayed my decision was that I was already 0-3.  I figured I needed to go for the gusto if I was ever to get back in contention.
