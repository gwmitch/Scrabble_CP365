#note Other options to explore: Other placements of EAU, URAEI, and exchanging. URAEI is safer, and I don't know the differences between EAU placements, myself.

#note Guess that's one difference...
>whatnoloan: DEEIINR 5E EDI. +10 16
#note AI is a fine play here. For some reason I didn't think about keeping DEEINR, which is excellent, especially since I open up DNR hooks, and keep GENITUR all open.

#note This might be too cocky--I didn't think Greg would know PLATYS. This is probably a bad idea, since I can't be sure at all of this, and I'm not desperate or anything either.

#note I mainly considered this, HAOLE, and SAITHE. HAOLE seems to open too much, and I like keeping EST to O by a good bit here. Though maybe not? I kind of liked "blocking" FONTANELS, too. HAOLE might be better because I can play HAOLES next turn--that's probably why Quackle likes it so much, because I get multiple S hooks.

#note Only leaves open a couple of nines lanes, ABY, and the A for winning. A mid-scoring play probably won't win.
