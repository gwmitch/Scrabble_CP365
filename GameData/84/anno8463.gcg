#note I considered OX I8 to set up QIS, but I figured that the chance it would get blocked was too great.  I wasn't too happy with this leave on this board.

#note Here I was sitting with what looked like a trading rack, but thinking to myself, "this board's getting closed and tough to bingo on.  I should play LIE M7 because it shuts down his most likely bingo spot and is actually a decent score for what's available here."  But he preempted it.
>Dave: EEEEIIN O2 NEE +14 315
#note An excruciating decision.  I couldn't do anything with the O1 spot, but it's by far the easiest scoring spot for him.  If I trade here, I'm basically saying, I'm gonna hope to draw something to one of the two triples and trade big scores with you.  Meanwhile, he's just drawn seven new tiles, and it would seem like it's no sure thing that he'd have a play to 15A.  Finally, as mentioned in the previous note, the board is getting tight, and the points for this play are not so bad.

#note I ended up just going quietly for the rest of this game because I never found an effective way to open the board.  If there's an improvement to be made, it's probably right here.  VITTA played at 10B improves my comeback chances.

>Dave: AEEFILW M2 FE +22 377
#note I had a cute bingo but no place to play it.  I've got several places for the W (AW 14B, WE 14M) but only one good place for the F, so I cash in the F first.

#note Not gonna win this one anyway, but I made a big mental error in this endgame of forgetting about the DOWN hook.  I was only thinking of LOWN/BLOWN/CLOWN, so I didn't want to play the L there too soon and thereby give a C spot.
>John: CDDENW I4 N.C.D +13 441
#note Nicely done.
>Dave: BEIIL J3 LE. +5 413
#note Ha, so hypothetically if DOWN wasn't a word, this would be a great play which W sticks him and sets up an unblockable BI 2J.  But since it is, this is a terrible play.
