>Matthew_Larocque: CIRRRSU 8G CURR +12 12
#note I wasn't 100% on the doubled R here - but I took the risk because this is one ugly rack.
>Betty_Bergeron: INNOU J8 .UNION +8 8
#note I knew she meant RONION, but I saw the easy bingo through the N so I just let it go. If I wasn't a novice, I could just challenge it off and player REGISTER. Nope I don't think I'd have found that >_>
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIRST 13D STEERI.G +61 73
#note And I didn't know about REESTING, which has better defense I guess.
>Betty_Bergeron: ADT H12 D.AT +21 29

>Betty_Bergeron: EOPRS 15A POSER +27 56
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILMTY K4 MILTY +30 155
#note Simulation says it's pretty close between this, AMITY, LIMY, MITY, and LAITY. All give 84-85% chance to win. I'm really not smart enough to notice miniscule differences in plays like these. The double vowel leave is a mistake perhaps?
>Betty_Bergeron: AH 14B HA +22 78

>Betty_Bergeron: HLO 1L .OHL +33 111
>Matthew_Larocque: ABCEIIP 12A BICE +26 217
#note BICEP is one of those words I find half the time, and miss the other half of the time. CEIBA(S) also works if I knew it.
>Betty_Bergeron: LW 2K L.W +11 122
#note Is she holding onto an F? looks fishy, but I guess there's nowhere else to dump LW.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEIPST 10E DEPAI.TS +63 280
#note Wow, I thought depaints might have had an angram, but this is the only playable bingo on this board.
>Betty_Bergeron: IQ -  +0 122
#note Challenged/laughed at ridiculous sounding word.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEINV E4 INVADE. +24 304
#note Sim very slightly prefers DAVENE(D) in the same spot, but basically any play has me winning 99% of the time. And I chickened out on DOVENING at a recent tournament, so I sure as heck wouldn't play that word anyways.
>Betty_Bergeron: IQ D4 QI +46 168
#note But in this case....yeah...
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABENOO J2 BOA +31 335
#note Must have missed OBOE in the same spot for an extra point. BOOE(D) for 27 also sims at the top.
>Betty_Bergeron: FJOR 8A FJOR. +51 219
#note ouch again, thankfully easy bingos to bail me out.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFNOTZ 6J Z.OTE +36 371
#note Thought I was missing something better, but this seems like the clear choice.
>Betty_Bergeron: EY 3L .EY +26 245
>Matthew_Larocque: ?FIN 3G INF. +12 383
#note Didn't get this rack, but was trying to get a bingo without realising ZLOTES*.
>Betty_Bergeron: EOV 2F VOE +18 263
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADELNR O6 sLANDER +88 471
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADELNR --  -88 383
#note But Betty was aware of it, it appears.
>Betty_Bergeron: AG B8 .AG +15 278
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADELNR N5 R.LANDEd +62 445
#note But she left me the open E so I was able to come up with something...yay..
This and R(E)hANDLE sim the best, with the lesser bingos not making an apperance at all.

She paused to think about this, but then told me "that one actually makes sense".
>Betty_Bergeron: EM O8 ME +26 304
>Matthew_Larocque: EOUW 1H WO +33 478
>Betty_Bergeron: ?INST M11 NITeS +11 315
#note Handy anagrams of NITES I didn't know, NEIST and SENTI.
>Betty_Bergeron:  (EU) +4 319
