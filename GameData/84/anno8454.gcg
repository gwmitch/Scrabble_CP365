#note It just didn't look familiar to me.  I'm 100% on it in my cardbox, but haven't seen it in over 270 days.  At least I can't blame this loss on luck.  I was right in it and goofed up on my own.  If I hadn't lost the turn here, perhaps I might have beaten him to the second blank.  As it turned out, I never had a chance after this error.
