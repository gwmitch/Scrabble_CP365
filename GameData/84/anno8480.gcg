#note There are now 6 I's and zero E's on this board. If I were a different person, my head might be exploding.
>Lisa_Odom: AHO 7G HAO +25 57
>Evans_Clinchy: AIKLNNU 6D LUNK +20 169
#note Sim suggests moves a little too open for my liking, like KANZU. I'm feeling all right about LUNK here. Maybe UNLINK in the same spot? Not sure.

#note Maybe ELEGY/HOWL. MO is a nice leave since there's a spot for it at 14J.

>Evans_Clinchy: LMOPRSW 14I SWOP +41 479
#note Dropping the S here looks like a slam dunk. Only three more points but better defense and better consonant-vowel balance. With two more esses and a bunch of E's still to be drawn, LMR might end up being decently bingo-prone.
>Lisa_Odom: GJU 2F JUG +32 217
>Evans_Clinchy: BEELMRU 13A UMBEL +40 519
#note Sim says give up four points and play it down in the bottom-left corner. Can't argue with that, especially with the Q still out there.
>Lisa_Odom: DEES B10 DEE.S +24 241
#note ...but of course I get lucky and draw the Q anyway.
>Evans_Clinchy: EFIPQRU A8 QUIP +52 571
#note Can't play PIQUE or FIQUE -- she's 4/8 to bingo out with CORSLET, SCARLET, LOCATES or CLAROES. Can't play EQUIP -- everything but the C in the bag bingos. Can't play PIQUER -- it's not a word. So, yeah. This.
>Lisa_Odom: ACEORST 15G ROSET +32 273
#note Quite cool. I had no idea that was a word.
