#note It was the last game of Friday night, and my brain wasn't working that well.  I saw this quickly, but didn't love the two A leave.  So I kept looking for some more plays, but didn't come up with any.  Both CASBAH and VOCAB are considerably better than this.

#note The leave sucks, but taking the points with BEFOGS looks right here.  Again, I just didn't see it.

#note This one was more of a word knowledge fail than a vision fail.  All my best scoring plays were underlaps in this spot.  It didn't seem worth retaining the two I's to get point greedy with OPES.  But if I had remembered and seen PSOAI... that's clearly the play here.  For the rest of this game, my play is fine, but I'm never able to recover from this bad start.
