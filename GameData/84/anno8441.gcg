#note i am feeling quite BOWLLESS today. actually, blow isn't that good. it takes too many things. blew is probably better because i don't block the R and i already have an E. WEBLESS sims best. really? ok. (-8)

#note or maybe DHOBI 9C ? even though that's even more defensive.
>james: AACLTU 3F ACTUAL +25 197
#note interesting move, but i remember liking it. maybe HID is seen as a fish (i spent forever on it) and then he opens scoring spots for himself.

#note i have the case S and am not down by that much. i don't think it's that bad of a situation, but this is supermes i'm playing. OW is best though (-0.5)
>james: CEFY 1A FYCE +42 306
#note dang it, 0.5 equity points loss and he pounces on it
>cesar: AAEIORS 2A AA +19 286
#note another seemingly close decision between my fish and H1 IOTA. IOTA wins by 1 point. it seems close, but even mistakes like this cannot be made against top players. i don't think i understand board dynamics very well yet. (-1)
