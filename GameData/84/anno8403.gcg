#note Though I didn't see PI, this might be opener to bingos next turn. Quackle suggests PIT and TIPI and PI. I am not sure--DEIRT seemed good enough to play this.

#note Didn't see much I liked here, but I would've played U(r)BIA had I seen it, I think. ABOU(T) maybe. I tend to exchange far too much according to Q. There are lots of dumping options here.

#note NAOI and OE look nicer here, because they aren't so open in a game that I lead.

#note Wait, why did I do this? Stupid. JUgA or JAVA is fine, maybe JNANAS, which I didn't see. JNANA 2B is also there.

#note I need to look more. (I)VY, (N)AVY are available here. I liked that this made the top right a lot less volatile, and Quackle agrees with me. Seems decent.
