>Verbie: BCDERVW J6 BR.W +15 15
#note (-4) to WIVED I7.  The guy sitting next to me sug-jested VERBY*.  What's surprising is that this was Wiegand, not usually known for this kind of remark.  Jeff's buzz must have been rubbing off on everybody.

#note Had I made the "right" play last turn, I would have been SOL here.  Then again, I might not have drawn the Q either.
>J_Widergren: FI 15A IF +58 263
#note Second time that happened on the day.
>Verbie: BEHOTTZ K3 HOB +26 227
#note (-6) to BOTH 13I.  I must have been scared off by the Y unseen.
>J_Widergren: CNORY 13I CORNY +38 301

#note any other vowel that doesn't make a phony hook and watch what happens with my rack...
>Verbie: EEHRSTZ M9 ZEST. +27 271
