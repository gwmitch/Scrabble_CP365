>Jim_Burlant: ?EFIORS 8D FORtIES +76 76
#note Best bingo, nothing else scores more than 70.
>Jerry_Lerman: CCILO D8 .LOCCI +26 26
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEGKOY 11D .OKY +26 102
#note Best play is J6 BOSKY, and this play sims 3-1/2-points down.
>Jerry_Lerman: EEP F11 .EEP +16 42
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABEEGN 7I rEBEGAN +64 166
#note Thought I might have missed something better, but the only other bingo is G2 ABNEGATE; this play sims roughly 3 points down.  A bit surprising that these airballs are the best plays, but there aren't any non-bngo options available that score more than 21 points.
>Jerry_Lerman: DEEITU O3 DETI.UE +27 69
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOXZ N5 EX.M +60 226
#note Best, nothing else comes remotely close.
>Jerry_Lerman: Q 13C Q. +22 91
>Jim_Burlant: AABILOZ 10G BAIZA +43 269
#note Best. The LO leave is nothing to write home about, but everything else gives up too many points.
>Jerry_Lerman: AENO 11J AEON +23 114
>Jim_Burlant: AFHLOOT 12L HOOF +40 309
#note Best is 6G LOOFAH 45; I didn't look hard enough to find it.  This choice, which is the runner up, sims roughly 4 points down.
>Jerry_Lerman: HIP 14A PHI +27 141
#note This is one of the two best plays either side made this game - it's probably why I didn't draw into a 3rd bingo and top 500, and you'll see why in a moment.
>Jim_Burlant: AAELOST 15A EAST +44 353
#note I was expecting to play FOAL O12 to draw 3 to AEST and hopefully hit a bingo back-hooking KEEP.  His play of PHI forced me to have to break up the rack, as KEEP back hooks were no longer the biggest threat.  Q agrees with this choice.
>Jerry_Lerman: ADDEINR 6D DANDIER +70 211
>Jim_Burlant: ALMORUV M2 OVUM +23 376
#note Despite Quackle's opinion of it (Q prefers VALOR 13I), I like this play a lot.  I'm more worried about defense and guaranteeing that Jerry can't hit an easy bingo- that certainly seems like reasonable strategy against a vastly superior player, you know?  While ridding myself of my worst tiles, this play simultaneously kills two of his most promising lines and leaves him one that is much more difficult to hit than the ones I shut down.  He probably needs an S to bingo now.  Jerry told me post-mortem that this blocked a bingo he was going to put down.  Also - if I were sitting on the case O, VUM would be the play.  However, with the O unseen I'd rather force him to play through the O rather than give him the hook.
>Jerry_Lerman: AOR O12 .ORA +21 232
>Jim_Burlant: AALRRSW 15F SLAW +32 408
#note I had also given serious consideration to 5I WAR but felt that shutting down row 15 was worth the unbalanced leave - not to mention the extra 10 points.  Q agrees.
>Jerry_Lerman: GIW 12H WIG +24 256
>Jim_Burlant: ARRTTTV 14H TAV +21 429
#note Now that's just stupid - Q prefers 2K TROT - no thanks.
>Jerry_Lerman: GJ 10C J.G +14 270
>Jim_Burlant: ILRRTTU N1 LI +8 437
#note While Jerry obviously could not win this game, I wanted to preserve my spread.  I blocked this because I saw a possible DELUSI(O)N in the pool.  This isn't one of the original kibitzer choices but it winds up winning the 2-ply sim after 1500 iterations.
>Jerry_Lerman: TY J4 TY... +8 278
#note I held this momentarily - with upside-down board dyslexia, I thought he had played TYERS*.  Thankfully I came to my senses. :-)
>Jim_Burlant: DRRRTTU 4J .UT. +8 445
#note My annotation ends here - nothing of note in this end game, as it's all we can do to move tiles to finish the game.  Final score 461 - 310.
