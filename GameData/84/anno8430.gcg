#note quackle is kind of funny. why does it like C10 GIBE so much? i guess IZE is a good leave on this board (maybe draw for zoic even, etc) (-6)

#note i deserve to lose because of this move. it is much harder to bingo if i play on row 2. i was worried about some kind of heavy J play but i don't even know what. prefade/welfare make me an extremely heavy favorite; serfage still does but by less. (-3%)
