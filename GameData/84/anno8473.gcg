>Quackle: EFIIQXY 10I QI +22 22
#note Note: This isn't actually Quackle; I'm playing both sides solitaire. Quacklegeoff vs. Geoffgeoff.
>Geoff: CDEENTT J4 DETECT.NG +14 14
#note Cooler: ExT(I)NCTED
>Quackle: AEFIMXY 11H MI.X +34 56
>Geoff: ?BCIINO 7G BIj.CTION +48 62
#note Other 2x2's through the E: BILECTION, BISECTION, ABIOGENIC (also CIBATIONS# through the T, but that's an 8 plus S so wouldn't get the big bonus)
>Quackle: AAEFRTY M5 FA.RYTALE +30 86
#note Only nine with this rack and two blanks. Recently learned this one.
>Geoff: ABEEKLT O4 BLA.KETED +34 96
#note Surprisingly, no BLANKETER*. BEASTLIKE through the I at H7 was the only other one available.
>Quackle: AEJORUZ 10O .OUZE +42 128
#note This rack plus three blanks: JOURNALIZE!
>Geoff: ADEGOUU H1 AUTOGU.DE +16 112
#note Was bummed when I saw OUTARGUED and no way to play it, but then I remembered this one and it just barely fit. Yay!
>Quackle: AAIJNOR P2 JIAO +32 160
#note I wouldn't have found it anyway, but AUTOGUIDE# blocked JABORANDI!
>Geoff: EFINPRW 1G F.WN +30 142
#note Shortest steal of EFINPRW, says Zyzzyva: POWERLIFTING# (WTF OWL? That's a common word)

>Quackle: AEILNRV Q10 .NIVERSAL +26 186
#note Lots of nines available. UNRIVALED better than UNIVERSAL in same spot. VERNALITY# 3A, maybe? Didn't know it anyway.
>Geoff: EIOPRRS 19J PRIORESS +46 188
#note There are fifty bazillion nines with this rack, but amazingly, only one, MISREPORT H11, gets the big bonus. Just missed it.
>Quackle: ADNNOUW S3 UNWOMAN.D +19 205
#note Lucky to have the E, certainly nothing else with this junk.
>Geoff: AGHIORS 14G ORANGISH +40 228
#note Wanted an ISH nine on row 16, but there wasn't one.
>Quackle: AEHORVY 16K OVERHA.TY +38 243
#note In this game you can even bingo out with 8 unseen tiles, though that's not the case here. Anyway, this out play isn't enough for Quacklegeoff, who loses to Geoffgeoff here 578-537.
