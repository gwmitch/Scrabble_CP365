#note Wow. Just didn't think of JUPON. That's "only" an 11-point mistake, but...
>Adam_Logan: ACIINST H8 .SATINIC +83 83
#note ...Adam points out that if I play JUPON, he doesn't get this. Just goes to show you that blowing a game on turn one is quite possible.

#note BURGEE and PUGREE both play for 30 at N10. I didn't like those. Offering Adam an easy TWS lane looked like a bad idea. But I overlooked that the same two words play at J6 for 25. BURGEE there may well be my best play.
>Adam_Logan: BIIKR N10 BIRKI. +36 239
>Evans_Clinchy: EEGRTTV O6 VERGE +31 269
#note Probably woulda played TREVET if I was 100 percent sure it was good. Wasn't, so I didn't.
>Adam_Logan: EFLU 13K FLU.E +24 263
>Evans_Clinchy: AALTTTZ K7 TAT +9 278
#note Missed ATLATL. Quackle also suggests TATE 7L, which is a really nice play I didn't think of. Sets up ZEAL for 37 if I draw an E.
>Adam_Logan: ?EELMNY L3 MYELiNE +84 347
>Evans_Clinchy: AAAGLTZ 5H AGAZ. +30 308
#note Oh, man. Another cool Z setup I didn't see. AGMA 3J gives me ZA for 65. But you have to think Adam will sniff that out, so why bother? AGAZE is the stronger equity play.
>Adam_Logan: ?AEIORS 3H bIRA.OSE +70 417
>Evans_Clinchy: ADDLOST 6H TOD +20 328
#note Figured the best way to save spread was to block the X hotspot and score decently.
>Adam_Logan: AEITWWX 2M WAW +32 449
#note Best, threatening EXIT up top to go out.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADLOS 1N LO +27 355
#note Best -- scores, blocks EXIT and keeps multiple outs for next turn.
>Adam_Logan: EITX I5 ..X +19 468
#note Yep.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADS F12 DA.S +8 363
#note Uh, oops. Didn't look in row 11 for the better outs.
