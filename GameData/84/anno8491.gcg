#note This doesn't sim very well. A lot of top suggestions are fishy (G8 KA, 7H NIXE, J6 IXIA). Blowing up the rack isn't a bad idea, though. But the way I did it was wrong, I guess. IR isn't that great of a two-tile leave? The main thing, I guess is sticking the A next to the DWS. Parallel plays on row L hooking NIXE are going to be scary, and the placement of the A is going to make them potentially huge. The top simming play K4 CORE solves a lot of problems. K2 CARNIE is fine, too. I'm sure you can also incorporate some sort of inferencing from VEG into this analysis, too.

#note 13H FLYMEN is the play. Didn't see it. FANCY might also be better than my play. Even though N's are scarce, LMN < LMR.

#note Talked myself out of ALLYL. Looked weird to me. And I wasn't even sure it was that strong of a play. Its about even with MALLET, but I think I would still play MALLET.

#note I really felt like I had to close the lines on row 12 and 14. I don't know why. Apparently this was not the play, though. Quackle likes 10E WOP, keeping synergistic tiles. I don't know. I can't seem to properly evaluate when to keep shit like that open.
>Barclay: EH E11 EH +25 245
#note Crap crap crap he has the S and is gonna bingo on the O column.
>Tunnicliffe: BEGOOTU H12 U.BO +27 293
#note I had difficulty with this position. I wanted to kill QUODS. GUYOT was decent, but it gave up too much. C11 OBOE was my first thought, but I really didn't want to set up another S I didn't have. I finally decided to open up a bingo line which didn't require an S. If Wayne does get a bingo on the O column, it will be big enough that I'll need a bingo in reply. The top-simming play is so obvious that I'm embarrassed to say I didn't see it. 8L POUT. Um, yeah, that kills QUOD. Dumbie. -3.5 win%

#note The ironic end to this saga: Wayne was sure that QUOD didn't take an S.
>Tunnicliffe: AELOTUW 4C WOE +21 403
#note Overdrew on this rack and was amused to see the natural OUTLAWED. Lost the D.
>Barclay: ADS H1 SA.D +21 288
>Tunnicliffe: AJLMTUV 14F JU.A +31 434
#note This is fine. Might want to close the top row, instead, though.

#note Didn't spend much time on this endgame, although it's a potentially fun one. 13A OVER sets up some nasty unblockable stuff on column A. N1 BEVY sets up a big OM and threatens the out with MOLTO. My play may be the only one to guarantee an out in two (maybe not, though), but it scores poorly. Probably good practice to try on these endgames, since they might matter in tournaments.
