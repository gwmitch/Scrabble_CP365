#note top choice - best leave and reduces # bingo lines by two
>rob_robinsky: CFIOQST 3G FICO +25 122
#note Worse at K8 due to FICOS*
>scott_jackson: AEGIMNR K8 REAMING +75 269

#note Quackle prefers 5E TEGUA slightly. I like keeping AERT with the current bingo lines.
>rob_robinsky: ?ENOSST H7 ..STrONES +77 253
#note scores four less than 13B TESTONS, but keeps the board open. We both underscored this by ten somehow, which will become relevant later on.

>rob_robinsky: AIOPTXZ J10 ZAP +73 326
#note best, need to save the X for more points later and creates a nice spot for it at L12.
>scott_jackson: AGHLOUY M8 GHOULY +49 426
>scott_jackson: AGHLOUY --  -49 377
#note Oops, HOAGY 43! Nice challenge.
>rob_robinsky: CDIORTX 8K ..DOX +39 365
#note Could've been worse with the L12 hotspot for the X.
>scott_jackson: AGHLOUY 7N YO +19 396
#note This move is awful, I got way too worried about a possible bingo on the N column. 13A HOY scores best and kills the bottom left corner TLS. Another option is L11 AGO. 
>rob_robinsky: ACIIRTV C3 TRIVI. +20 385
#note VIATICA in the same spot is the star play, and denies any parallel play.

>rob_robinsky: ACDEFOW 13A CAFE +43 428
>scott_jackson: HILLOTU 5K T.ILL +22 445
#note B1 THIOL by a mile, denies any counterplay and blocks the A4 line. Keep in mind we both think I'm in the lead by five at this point.  
>rob_robinsky: BDEEOVW 4A VE.B +26 454
>scott_jackson: EHOU 5B H.E +15 460
#note Nothing wins here if we have the correct score. As it played out, I can win with VOE is Rob has 444 instead of 454.
