>Jim_Burlant: ?ABEIMT 8B lIMBATE +76 76
#note Couldn't think of AMBIEnT, which is slightly better due to vowel placement.  But who knows how this game turns out if I put that down instead of ths?
>Paul_Holser: EIOPPST B8 .OPPIEST +84 84
>Jim_Burlant: AEHLRSW 7H WHALERS +73 149
#note The only playable bingo.
>Paul_Holser: FOU A13 FOU +31 115
>Jim_Burlant: ANOQUUV 7C QUA +51 200
#note Best, despite the NOUV leave.  Not exactly bingo prone tiles there...right?
>Paul_Holser: CDEIM N2 MEDIC. +34 149
>Jim_Burlant: AENOUVW 4G UNAVOWE. +82 282
#note When you're hot you're hot.  How often do you draw a W to ANOUV and wind up with a bingo?  
>Paul_Holser: ACILNOT 11B .LATONIC +74 223
#note This is definitely Paul's best play; it also plays at 10B for 64.  Of note:  E5 AN(AB)OLIC 48.
>Jim_Burlant: ADDEEFN L6 D.AFENED +78 360
#note Better to be lucky than good.  With tiles like this, who needs skill? 
>Paul_Holser: OY 6I OY +31 254
#note You'll notice that Paul is averaging just shy of 51 points a turn...and he is still trailing by 100 points and he is at roughly 1-1/2% winning chances.
>Jim_Burlant: ABEGIRS 13G BRIGA.ES +82 442
#note Our club meets in a Whataburger.  After I put this down, Paul started sniffing, and he asked me:   "you know what that smell is?  That's the smell of 700."  
>Paul_Holser: AILT 9E ALIT +21 275
>Jim_Burlant: DGINRTY 12D YID +29 471
#note Q prefers a play I didn't see:  D10 GANTRY.    Besides turnover to go after the blank, it does something I didn't think about too much given my lead:  it defends against something like ZEE C13.  I was hoping for both a favorable draw as well as Paul doing something at H1 to give me somewhere to play an 8.
>Paul_Holser: ORU O1 OUR +15 290
>Jim_Burlant: AGNNRTX H13 .AX +30 501
#note Not sure what I was thinking here.  OR was I even thinking at all?  TAX 3E is much better than thisw. Having said that, Q's preference is D3 GRAN(UM)...but I didn't know it.   Everything has crossed the line from 99.9% winning chances to 100% now.
>Paul_Holser: EEZ C13 ZEE +60 350
>Jim_Burlant: GINNNRT K12 N.N +5 506
#note Probably better at G3 for 4.  Whatever - everyting wins as much as everything else here. Then again, I preserve a lot more spread if  play at G3.
>Paul_Holser: ?EHIRSV 3A SHRIVEn +75 425
#note According to Quackle, Paul has 0.14% winning chances.  What miracle can he conjure up to pull this one out?
>Jim_Burlant: GIKNRRT A1 RI.K +39 545
#note Urp - missing THINK B2.
>Paul_Holser: EGJLOOT N10 JOG. +28 453
>Jim_Burlant: GNRT K2 TR.G +10 555
#note About the only real mistake I make this game:  I mistracked and saw him sitting on ALOT; GRIT or GRIN D1 gave him back GLOAT for 18, and I wanted to not do that.  Whoops.
