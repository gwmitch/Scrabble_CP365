#note 10J knoll doesn't seem right. how many people would make this move? although since vesicants is good i bet it's not too big a deal. it's really close anyhow.

#note spent a bit on this. it doesn't seem right to cash the Z now but J2 URARI seems best. a nice play with my O. i wish i'd thought of it. ZOUK is still a little better than LURK probably. ZOA/ZORIL too. this was tough. (-4)
