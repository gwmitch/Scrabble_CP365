#note I saw BIOCIDE, BIOETHIC, and EPIBOLIC here, and I suspected there might be more.  I spent a long time looking on this play, but couldn't find the only bingo.  Unfortunately for me, this is one of those situations where all of the alternatives are way worse than the best play.  I preferred BOGIE to BRIO I7 because the latter made bingos more difficult.

#note Again, this is a nice play to have, but I was a little disappointed that my last play had blocked JOLLYING.

#note With all those N's remaining, it seemed better to play the N than the G.  I started out with WON but changed my mind because it was the case O and there were two more A's to draw.  I'm not sure which one is better or how much it matters.  Either way I'm staring at a great pool for him and thinking I probably need to get really lucky to win this.

#note As expected.
>Dave: BEGILNO O5 BONG +29 404
#note TE# can't come soon enough for me!  If he wasn't threatening an out, I could have made a little bit of noise with BI H2.
