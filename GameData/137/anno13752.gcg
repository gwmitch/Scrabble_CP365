#note eek, I convcined myself that BUBU was CSW

#note I didn't want to gamble on EXURB at D7, but I guess it's not as dangerous

#note with the pool the way it is there's no value in me keeping ANT over just the A (5 Ns and Ts left!). NIDATE wins the sim.

>JD: AHIOPST D11 .HOP +24 179
#note AHI scores a couple of points extra. I saw it but for some reason chose the AIST leave, which is about as good as OPST.

#note antilock scores most here
>JD: EFGIOPT B11 FOP +15 298
#note I couldn't figure out how to win other than opening a new lane, hoping she blocks and bingoing out on row 3.
>Luise_Shafritz: FGIINOR A8 GROIN +29 362
#note it turns out that the blank was actually in the bag when I made my play
>JD: EGIOTVY H1 VIT..E +27 325
#note I think I had about a 30% chance of bingoing on row 3 - I would've needed to draw the blank and draw the V and Y, I think.

#note low on time, goys is available for 4 more

#note this was kind of a strange game. I made a few mistakes early on, but I'm ultimately not sure there was much I could do differently down the stretch.
