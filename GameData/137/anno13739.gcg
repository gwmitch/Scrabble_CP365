#note BLAND does not take an S, which is good to know. I pondered BLAND 14J but the hook was too much of liability. Considering FLAB and FAB, FLAB seemed to make it much easier for him to fork the board. Though he can certainly make setup plays on column C, I looked at most of the 2-3 tile plays and saw that it was actually quite hard for him to set up an unblockable hook on row 1, so I played FAB.

#note I mainly considered this and VARA. I like this better than VARA because of how much it closed off, and how it would most likely be harder to close all that off next turn, especially if I don't get a 6 tile play or get such a play that puts a less convenient tile at A8. Plus the leaves are comparable, especially with the S going nowhere in particular here (though it is a useful tile if Gunther tries to make an opening). Another good option is SAVIOUR A8. It's probably worth playing. Quackle thinks so.

#note Not my favorite play but there's not much else to do. I'm not really just going to play YON 5H here.

#note Pressed for time here, I make a suboptimal play. One play is far better than another here. Can you find it?

#note MAR or RAH at 5M is best.
