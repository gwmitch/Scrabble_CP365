>Chris_Lipe: ADEGNTU 8B UNGATED +72 72
#note I need to win by 156, not only do I lose the draw for first, this happens.
>Winter: EEEEIIU -EEEIIU +0 0
#note And if his opening bingo wasn't bad enuf.
>Chris_Lipe: ALVVY 9G LAVVY +25 97
#note I can;t wait till I can learn fives. Anyway, I know have a 259-point deficit to overcome.
>Winter: ?AEFGMR 8K FRAME +41 41
#note But since I can't find bingos I have not anagrammed repeatedly, deep tiles don't help me much.
>Chris_Lipe: AEEOU B5 EUO.AE +10 107
>Winter: ?DEGKNO A1 KENDO +38 79
#note At least I'm scoring while his rack fizzles, but it's false hope.
>Chris_Lipe: EIOU A10 EUOI +7 114
#note Oh shizz, I might actually catch up!
>Winter: ?DGIJQT M7 Q.DI +26 105
#note Awesome. Now I'm two turns away from being able to bingo.
>Chris_Lipe: ?BEIIRT E7 R.BEITIc +68 182
>Chris_Lipe: ?BEIIRT --  -68 114
#note Wow. This is an extremely rare instance of my busting Lipe on a word. This is what sucks most about this loss--he was not punished for his mistake.
>Winter: ?EGJMOT F6 JO. +26 131
#note Obviously have to block, but will I finally DRAW INTO A FUCKING BINGO I KNOW???
>Chris_Lipe: ?BEIIRT N5 BRI. +21 135
#note Do I dare hope that his EIT? leave will not yield a bingo?
>Winter: ?EGMRRT 7E M.G +18 149
#note And of course I do NOT get rewarded for my challenge. Note  that Quackle likes plays that use my E, but there's no way in hell I'm burning it given my difficulty drawing into a bingo.
>Chris_Lipe: ?EIOPST 11H rOPIEST +81 216
#note OF-FUCKING-COURSE!!! Q(A)DI was a mistake that reeeeeally hurt me.
>Winter: ?EHNRRT 12C NoRTHER +74 223
>Chris_Lipe: ABCEI O1 CEIBA +40 256
#note Yep.	
>Winter: AEGIILN 13H GENIAL +23 246
#note As soon as I saw this rack, I knew what Quackle would want me to do--fish. Actually, it likes IGNI(FY), but that's a six that's beyond my word knowledge. As for fishing, there was no way. This board has no hooks, and Lipe is to smart to open the board. I'd have to bingo from the K, E, or N, or to the C or E. Also, the bag has three esses and an X and Z. If I fish and don't hit, Lipe will draw those, and with a 50+ lead, almost certainly win even if I bingo.
>Chris_Lipe: OY 14J YO +28 284
#note Ballsy.
>Winter: AEINOSS 15G AINES +24 270
>Winter: AEINOSS --  -24 246
#note ANOESIS is just beyond 1000, and I've only looked at top 200. BUt I didn't need a bingo to win. With a C, F, H, W, W, X, and Z on the board, a 30-40 point play would have kept me in the game. Instead, I draw tiles I cannot score with, and I'm forced to take a chance on a word I'm not sure of, or fall even further behind.
>Chris_Lipe: CIIT K4 CITI.. +28 312
>Winter: AEINOSS O7 S.A +15 261
#note Hate to burn the A, would rather ditch the O, but there's nowhere to score with it, except at B1, and I don't want to kill those lines.
>Chris_Lipe: ARSTZ 2A .RSATZ +70 382
#note And... that's the game.
>Winter: EFINOPS 15G FOPS +33 294
#note Just fumbling around for the rest, hoping to hit a bingo at H1 to the C.
>Chris_Lipe: AD N2 AD +13 395
>Winter: EEHINNO 10L H. +10 304
#note Now I have to fish, and hope NEOTENI(C) plus Chris' rack is enough. If he gets caught with X and two Ws, maybe.
>Chris_Lipe: LWW D1 W.WL +28 423
>Winter: EEINNOR 4I ON.E +12 316
#note Oh well. Time to go get a massage.
