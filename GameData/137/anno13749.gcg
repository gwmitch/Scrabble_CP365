>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>JD: EEEKLTW 7H KEEL +15 15
#note it's kinda hard to find but TEW at 9H is a whopping 11-12 points better on defense than KEEL, blocking QI underlaps and just not leaving much to work with
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: MY 6I MY +32 54
>JD: EEORSTW 8J TOWERS +47 62
#note WOE at 8J limits his options a lot. TOWERS is probably too volatile.
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: AEW 7M WAE +23 77
>JD: ADEEGRX 9K GED +25 87
#note again, quackle prefers the defense of covering 6N by a whole 7-8 points, rather than opening a bingo lane on a now-closed board.
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: CHIN 9E CHIN +29 106
>JD: AAENRTX I9 AX +21 108
#note another interesting play but this jumps to the top
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: AHMO E7 MA.HO +24 130

#note oops, I missed ENGIRDS but...
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: AELNTUV 5K LUV +24 294
#note he would've had EVENTUAL if I made the right play!
>JD: ?AILPST 14F APLITeS +66 470
#note I chickened out of DISPLANT.
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: ABEELNT 13I TENABLE +78 372

>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: IUV 4B VI. +7 379
#note his best play blocking CREED
>JD: CDE 2F .CED +7 521
#note ran out of time, CEDE is 2 better
>JD:  (U) +2 523
