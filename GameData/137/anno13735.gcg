#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: EEGIRUW B6 WU. +15 15
#note So blinded by (a) the UW combo and (b) the fact that any of the rack dumps either saddled  me with a U or G, that I didn't even see the obvious row 7 plays of WE, EWE, or WEE. Sad, but true. In the absence of seeing those plays I figured that the N in his bingo was likely to stay open, so I played this, hoping that I could draw into an 8 down the H column with my remaining EEGIR.  From a defensive standpoint I figured the X was the most likely target for him to take out, or something at A1 if he could reach with this choice.  While the sim says I should have played 7C WEE or WE, it indicates this wins more often than any of the plays that aren't on row 7.  And my resulting draw would have left me with garbage had I played on row 7.  The sim says 7C WEE wins 15%; this wins 14.

#note The only bingo.

>Jim_Burlant: AGHIPTY G7 H.Y +35 111
#note The lesson here is to always look at the whole board, and after he played INFIX I kind of lost sight of the northwest.  The sim confirms this is a very strong play (it's the second best choice I have) but it's not best - 2A EIGHTY, which I never looked for, scores 7 more and clears out more of the counter overload than this.  As you'll see soon, this miss significantly contributed to why I lost this game.  
>Jerry_Lerman: ABDINOT F6 BA.D +26 190
#note This was Jerry's actual rack.   This is a very strong choice for Jerry, but it's not his best play against a random rack.  The sim says it's either this or D4 INFIX(ATION) 40. In retrospect, I certainly wish he'd FOUND INFIXATION here.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AGIPTU 3G P.UG +11 122
#note FAIL.  I'd been planning to play UP(R)ATInG F6 until his play of BARD blocked it, and the old refrain kicks in: you have to know it to play it.  PATAGIUM 2G scores 74 and is clearly best.  If I didn't know the bingo, I'd have needed to bite the bullet and hold onto the G, which I really wanted to get rid of.  In the absence of seeing the bingo, E3 PTUI was the play.  This sucks.
>Jerry_Lerman: INOV E2 VINO +20 210
>Jim_Burlant: ??AISTT K3 STATIng +68 190
#note Lucky me.  And if I'd bingo'd as I should have on the previous turn I'd be sitting on ST? and 4 more tiles and be bingoing shortly.  Instead I have 2 blanks in the same rack.  As it is, this is a soso-choice - while nothing scores huge here, it probably would have been better to play on row 10 - either with 10A fATTIES, tATTIES, etc. or at 10h.  Except I forgot the E back hook on BARDE, so that ruled those plays out.  :-p  This indiscretion cost me whatever remaining chance I had at this game.

>Jim_Burlant: BEOOSST 11D BOS +29 219
#note Best, back up to 33% winning chances.  Not much else worth considering.
>Jerry_Lerman: ACDL 12B CLAD +29 262
>Jim_Burlant: AELOQST C2 QAT +27 246
#note Yikes!  I certainly figured he had the Y when he put down CLAD.  As concerned as I was about that, this rack forced my hand and there wasn't much else to do but deal with the Q.    I gave brief consiederation to 7J QAT for 11, but I needed to stay in the game first and foremost and with my deficit I couldn't justify giving up 16 points just to draw to AELOST.  I might have fished the Q if it left me AEINST, but not to AELOST.  In retrospect, I certainly wish I'd just fished for 11, and you'll see why.
>Jerry_Lerman: EEMYZ 8J E.ZYME +87 349
#note Jerry told me post-mortem that he drew EEYZ to his remaining MZ (not sure what the 7th tile was) after he played CLAD.  Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: AAEELOS L8 .OEAL +29 275
#note It's either this or L8 ZOEAE (plays the pool better with all the unseen E's) but it's a moot point given his next rack.
>Jerry_Lerman: CNRRSTU 11H CURR.NTS +70 419
>Jim_Burlant: AEEMNOS H11 .AMEO +30 305
#note Or COMAE.  Whatever, it's a moot point.

#note I would be very easy to fall into the trap of blaming poor luck with his ENZYME/CURRANTS sequence, but the reality is that there were too many early mistakes on my end.  Perhaps I'd have drawn 2 more U's and had to exchange  if I found EIGHTY instead of HAY.  If I find PATAGIUM, my next rack has ST? plus 4 more tiles from a vowel overloaded pool, and it's a fair shot that I bingo back to back and worst case he somehow forces an end game.  Instead, I made a so-so bingo choice out of my double-blank rack because I couldn't remember the E back-hook on BARD.  Yes, Jerry had some fortunate late draws, but if I had played the mid-game correctly it probably wouldn't have mattered.  The better player won the game, period.
