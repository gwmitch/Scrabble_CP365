>JD: AEIOOQU 8F QUAI +26 26
#note this is definitely one of the games from this tournament that I'm most eager to quackle

>Michael_Thelen: ?CEEERV 10E RECEiVE. +72 98
>JD: EFNOOTZ 6J FO. +29 85
#note I spent something like 7 minutes on this play. on a sim this jumps way out in front. I was wondering if there was some clever setup but I don't see any...FEU at M5 looks unnecessary.
>Michael_Thelen: ADILO H10 .IDOLA +27 125
>JD: ELNOTTZ 12H .ONZEL +32 117
#note ZLOTE seemed like bad news, but it still sims ahead since NT bingoes 23% of the time next turn whereas TT only hits 11%. I might prefer DONZEL anyway.
>Michael_Thelen: COY 13G C.Y +24 149
>JD: EHJTTXY M3 HEX +40 157
#note I wasn't in a hurry to cash the X but I might be setting myself up to play OXY next turn.

>JD: DLLMTVY G7 M.L.T +15 210
#note with the board shutting down in a hurry it didn't seem like I had that much to gain from exchanging.
>Michael_Thelen: ?IINNOT -?II +0 217
>JD: DLSUUVY 14K DULY +35 245
#note michael wasn't that high on time so I started really trying to fastplay him starting with this move.
>Michael_Thelen: AGO 9C GOA +8 225
#note because I threw down DULY so fast, Michael drew 4 instead of 3 and I got to throw an S back in the bag. Then he spent a long, long time thinking about this move and started laying down a bingo using AGP? and picked it up! Finally he put down this 8-pointer leaving P?. I think he was trying to play STOPPAGE or APPANAGE or something.
>JD: DGISTUV C7 VU.G +13 258
#note until he opened I had just been planning on playing DONZELS/VUGS. once he's opened it feels to me like I really have to do something to block that G - after VUGG the only lane is that A and it will be quite hard for him to keep opening for his blank. VUGG comes nowhere close to GUSTY or GUVS on a sim, but dropping his bingo percentage from 40% to 15% with an inference of PT? (I think he exposed PTS on the overdraw) seems like it must be worthwhile...what I'm wondering is, how does GUSTY allow 8% more bingos than VUGS?? what ane am I blocking?
>Michael_Thelen: ?ANPSTT 15C ANTeP.ST +60 285
#note well, he had SPATTING if I didn't block
>JD: DEIIIST 15L TIED +28 286
>Michael_Thelen: EMN 8A NE.M +34 319
#note I'm not in such good shape once he hits this spot
>JD: IIIRSSW N9 IWIS +32 318
#note played almost immediately, what else canI try?
>Michael_Thelen: ABEN O7 BANE +25 344
#note it's interesting - I think he probably has to play here but he's actually sacrificing quite a few points (BALE at 14F). I was really hoping he would leave 3 in the bag.
>JD: AIOORRS J4 SO.. +7 325
#note I didn't have a whole lot of time left, but it seemed like emptying the bag without creating a new bingo lane had zero chance of winning so I had to try something. I saw the possibility of drawing REORDAIN, and then maybe he can mistrack or something. quackle suggests ORA at C13, but quackle is also pretty clearly taking the endgame.
>Michael_Thelen: BDGINPR 4E BRING. +10 354
#note he only has a few winning plays but this is one
>JD: AEIORRS 5D ROES +20 345
#note this is worse than my best play by 1 point - best is OE at E5 blocking DIP and leaving ARRIS next turn to go out. no wins available. I was convinced I was going to win because I saw the prospect of VUGGIER and I figured that as long as I could find a way to block his outs with DP using AORS, I could save VUGGIER for next turn and win. But in the 30 seconds I had I couldn't find a way to dump the right letters, and it turns out to be impossible.
>Michael_Thelen: DP F14 P. +9 363
>JD: AIR H1 RAI. +12 357
#note unfortunately I only found this sequence after going 3 minutes overtime! I lose 40 points of spread.
