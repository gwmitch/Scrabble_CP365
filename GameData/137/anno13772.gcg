#note well, that's unfortunate...alcidine blocked. LAD? AD? LAD wins the sim, I think I agree

#note ugh, my first missed bingo of the tournament. I was really kicking myself over this one once I realized a couple of turns later what I'd missed, but it turns out it's only about a 7 point error on da sim since I'm offering up so many points next turn.

#note that was one hell of a fucking play, carl
>JD: IOPRRRS 5C P.RO +18 298
#note ugh, really bad miss here...I just didn't spot SIMP. SIMP/PRIOR gives me a real chance of coming back.

#note I figured I needed to create some kind of a threat that he might have trouble dealing with...but that said, quackle suggests that RAI at 7G, besides scoring 5 more points and giving up some free points, ends up bingoing LESS next turn...maybe because the SCAD hook is getting blocked? frankly, I'm stumped...I think I pick SIR still.

#note I rather like TUI at D13 here, not that it occurred to me at the time...given how much I'm down I could really use another high-scoring lane.

#note eh, all in all I didn't really play well enough to beat Carl. He even drew poorly enough down the stretch that I had a shot, but the quality of my decision-making wasn't quite up to snuff and I didn't hit my bingo soon enough.
