#note Bob challenged BLINY#
>Bob_Linn: ADEEV H1 EVADE +38 102
#note Bob saw DEAVE but wasn't sure he was remembering it right.
>Dave_Koenig: DEHORRT G3 HERD +30 86
#note I saw DEHORTER# and was pretty sure it was no good in TWL, but I didn't know it in CSW.  THEREFOR would have been a very nice alternate play too.

#note I totally missed the beautiful RECTRIX for 44.  A few bad misses have me falling way behind in this one.
>Bob_Linn: ?EHILLS 1B SHELLI.r +62 210
#note It looks like Bob has only one other bingo here, THILLERS# K2 for 70.
>Dave_Koenig: ?BCGIRU C7 ..BU +18 151
#note I chose this over SCRUB B1 specifically to set up the G for B10-14 plays.  But I missed that his blank tile had given me a much better spot for these two tiles: HABU for 28.

>Bob_Linn: CESY J11 SYCE +21 347
#note Probably a reckless play.  Bob had the case S but had forgotten the SYCEE hook. I wasn't able to hook it, but I was quite grateful to see the E.  I would have played INVADING H8 if I couldn't bingo.
>Dave_Koenig: ADGINNV 14G ADV.NING +76 358
#note I didn't know which was more fitting for me: the CSW only bingo, or the one that starts with DAVE.
>Bob_Linn: EEF 15F FEE +29 376
>Dave_Koenig: DINOOUW A10 .ODOWN +39 397
#note I saw this and played it in a hurry, keeping the time pressure on Bob.  It worked out well, but championship player prefers WOUND N6, which it thinks wins 54% of the time, to this play's 46%.
>Bob_Linn: EOT 13J .OTE +20 396
>Dave_Koenig: AAIRUUW N6 WAIRUA +35 432
#note CSW has so many more vowel heavy words to help bail you out of those bad racks, such as this Maori four vowel six, which means "one's spirit which leaves when dreaming or dying."
>Bob_Linn: AEGIOST 2A GOAT +21 417
#note Bob missed some big plays here, though nothing big enough to win.  The best is GASEITY 12D for 43.
