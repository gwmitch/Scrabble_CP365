#note Noticed AXED right after I hit my clock. It's actually close though, I thought AXED scored lot more than it did. I chose this over WHEEZES plays (namely WAP) because I could do them next turn. I liked WAP over WAX to save the X and open a new lane, but liked APEX better because it seemed more likely I could take advantage of whatever new lane a W play opened two turns later rather than next turn, holding the X.

>Noah: DEGINTW G3 WIG +37 246
#note WIG and WED seemed close in leave. What decided it for me was that row 6 was harder to block by playing on column F after WIG than after WED.
>Nigel: ?EEFFRS 2H .FF +35 347
#note Missed OFFERErS, but this is just as good.
>Noah: ADEINNT 4J T..INE +22 268
#note If I played WED I would've bingoed! As for this play, TOXIN seemed bad because his likelihood of having an E was just too high, and even if he doesn't have an E, the line O scoring spot is not the think I need to get back in the game. I didn't see any great fishes, and don't now, so I'm fine with this play.

#note While the game itself was disappointing, I'm happy that it gave Nigel the spread he needed to win the tournament!
