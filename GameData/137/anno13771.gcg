#note quackle likes playing short with OI for 11 by 2 points, not sure how I feel...he just blew up his rack with EARNED, and KATION gives him really easy points next turn. I think OI is probably fine. OI at 9K is very close too.

>JD: DEEIOOQ 4E Q. +22 191
#note this play doesn't make any sense, unfortunately. There's very little I can hope to accomplish with this rack after dumping the Q. I can just play EIDE, which I did see, or an even nicer idea might be COOEE to set up QAID. not sure what I was thinking

#note can't be worth playing IODINE, can it? quackle says it sims 2 better, I can't see that being the right play.

#note EFFUSING is 6 extra
>JD: ABLMSWX 12A BALM +34 297
#note the biggest priority seemed to be to get the board under control and save the X for FAX or FOX down the road. I thought that BLAM at 10C gave up too many cheap points, put it actually beats FAX by a point on a sim (because it creates a spot for LAX/EX, I think) and beats BALM at 12A by 4. color me surprised.

>JD: EHNOSTX 10D NOH +37 361
#note this is a huge error, I should play FOX first because EH at 10E will basically never get blocked. Drawing the H was a huge break, but I really screwed up on this play, I think. quackle has my winning chances at only 60% after NOH which I think is too low, but FOX surely gives me a better chance.
>Jerry_Lerman: AEEORST H13 .OE +18 342
#note I believe this was his actual rack
>JD: EILSTUX 15A .ISE +8 369
#note I think I overcomplicated this play but I was just trying to keep it safe, this way I have EX/XI for 36 if he blocks my out. But the best sequence is ITS at 14J for 22 leaving two spots to go out with ELUX, which is 19 better overall.
