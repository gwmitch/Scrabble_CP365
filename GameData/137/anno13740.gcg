#note He noticed KVELLED after making this play. I wondered about KVELLER*'s validity.

#note What would you play here? Would you fish with ZAP even though there is only one good lane available? PIN 12C looks pretty strong, and it's probably what I should've played.

#note This is a game-losing mistake. I looked this word up recently and couldn't remember whether it was good. I played it rather quickly.

#note Looking pretty grim here. This is the best opening option I could find, and it sure seems like I need to open something. CHALET might be a better of way of doing it.

#note Fishing for ANTICLINE/CANNOLIS but I maybe should've just not fished here because I'm not close enough for those to win. I also didn't realize the N was in the bag, so I might have played BET D13 if I'd noticed it. Is there any way to get a win chance here?
