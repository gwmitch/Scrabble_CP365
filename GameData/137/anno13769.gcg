#note the lane david just created is potentially worth so many points that I think I have to go out of my way to block. I can get quackle to agree if I give david a really good leave
>David_Pearl: DENSSST 11J .ENDS +18 32
#note I believe he drew DS to a leave of ENSST or something silly
>JD: BDEORTV N5 OBVERT. +20 67
#note he's still signaling a fairly good leave, so I thought it was worth taking a gamble on digging into the bag
>David_Pearl: AELRSST O8 TEA +19 51
>JD: DELPSUU O1 LUPUS +26 93
#note on a sim LUPUS is 3 worse than PULED, but a dig into the numbers suggests to me that they're about equal - the S doesn't do anything on this board and LUPUS scores 5 more points on average next turn!
