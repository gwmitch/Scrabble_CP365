#note ERODIBLE is a cool option. I like this better I think. The board looks nice after ERODIBLE, but I don't think it's much more open, especially in the long run. This keeps a much better leave.

#note CLUBROOM is a sweet play that I didn't see. However, it has disadvantages. This leaves the NESTLINGS hook open and not that easy to block accidentally, and I think he might not know it (I was right). It also leaves the lanes on the top open. I probably need a bingo to win at this point, and I'd rather keep the board open, especially since I think Kolton will oblige, seeming a pretty open player in general.

#note I'm a fan of this play. I need two bingos to win this game, and this scores well, keeps a decent leave and opens the bottom of the board even more. It also turns over tiles for the ?S left. I didn't think just taking PE M3 was correct here.

#note I didn't see a way to win at this point. There is no excuse for missing ZEP 6B though.

#note PERV is the better play. I thought of it, but didn't realize that he could Q stick me after this. Actually, VERA is best, saving QOPH 1G -- a word I saw, but I spot I didn't. (Usually I don't see QOPH at all so I'm getting better! :) )
