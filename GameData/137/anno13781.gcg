>New_Player_2: HU 8H UH +10 10
>New_Player_1: AEJMOOR 9D JORAM +19 19
#note How do I miss things like MOJO? I didn't like MAJOR but MOJO is much much better.
>New_Player_2: ?ADILL D9 .ILL +22 32
#note Here he screwed up. Wrote down what the blank was going to be and realized while putting down his word that it didn't work...
>New_Player_1: EIIOORS 11C O.IO +8 27
>New_Player_2: ?AD -  +0 32
#note Lucky he didn't have anything else yet.
>New_Player_1: CEEIORS I7 E. +6 33
#note Trying to block a bit or force him to open a triple lane.
>New_Player_2: ?ABDG 7H B.G +13 45
#note He said I blocked him. Awesome.
>New_Player_1: CEIORSS 13B COS +22 55
>New_Player_2: ??AENTT K5 iNsTATE +76 121
#note Well then... not too bad for me. I should have something by now.
>New_Player_1: AEGHIRS 10F HI +29 84
#note I almost tried GASHIER. Didn't see HEGIRAS or know HEGARIS, but luckily I didn't miss a spot.
>New_Player_2: DEII 8K .EIID +21 142
>New_Player_1: AEEEGRS O5 GEE. +6 90
#note I should REALLY have something by now, no? :( Well I did, but I didn't see DEGREASE. Error number 2.
>New_Player_2: EINOSTU J9 TINEOUS +69 211
>New_Player_2: EINOSTU --  -69 142
#note Here's my break!
>New_Player_1: AAEORSY N5 AY +29 119
#note Nope, not yet...
>New_Player_2: EINOSTU 10I OU. +5 147
>New_Player_1: AENORST 12G TREASON +72 191
#note NOTAR(I)ES, eh? Didn't even look...
>New_Player_2: AEINSTW H12 .AW +6 153
#note Setting up RAWS? That's no good, is it? Why should it be? Maybe I should study fours after all? Nah...
>New_Player_1: ADFKLQX I12 .X +34 225
#note Thought of FALX, but I didn't like RAWS so I didn't want to open up the X triple spot. Turns out DRAWL was the play, and FALX was next in line. Though EX was still a solid 75% win...
>New_Player_2: EIINPST 15C PINIEST +101 254
#note Nonononono, RAWS can't be good. I'm not in denial or anything...
>New_Player_1: ADFKLQU -  +0 225
>New_Player_2: MO 14F MO. +26 280
#note Now I'm really not happy. I have points to play though, hopefully he doesn't block the best Q spot.
>New_Player_1: ADFKLQU B11 FU.K +34 259
#note I'm not desperate enough to play QUAD. But you should see the play that's blinding my board vision a bit... :P
>New_Player_2: GZ M7 Z.G +25 305
>New_Player_1: ADELQRV M2 VELD +21 280
#note Blocking my Q spots: you're doing it right, Bradley. My best play is only a 14% win according to Quackle. But I hate Qi since it blocks a spot I need to open to win.
>New_Player_2: DEINR 2J DRI.EN +28 333
#note Very gutsy play here. I still have a chance I guess!
>New_Player_1: ADFNQRS L1 Q. +21 301
#note And I drew the S. 
>New_Player_2: OY 1N YO +26 359
>New_Player_1: ACDFNRS 5G FARC. +9 310
#note FARD for 25 has a 15% chance of winning. I still don't like opening good spots at the moment... I was also hoping for a challenge.
>New_Player_2: AENP H1 APNE. +24 383
#note Good move, and nice tiles! :P
>New_Player_1: ADNRSTW 13L WAD +23 333
#note D(O)W is a 16% win. I really need to hope for ae and something else now. In hindsight WAD is horrible, since I give him way too many points.
>New_Player_2: BEILRUV O12 VIBE +47 430
>New_Player_1: AENRSTT 3C ENTRA.T +18 351
#note Goodbye second place! I didn't have much time left, but I didn't have much of a chance to win either...
>New_Player_2: LRU 15L LUR. +5 435
