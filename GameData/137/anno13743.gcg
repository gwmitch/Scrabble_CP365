>Noah: ADDMTXZ H7 ZAX +38 38
>Nigel: ?DILNRW I8 WILD +24 24
#note Nigel provided his racks for this game. Here, he missed DRAWLINg/INWARDLy, but this is pretty much the same.
>Noah: DDEFMST -DFM +0 38
>Nigel: ?AIKNOR J5 IKON +24 48
#note KOA is an option for a more defensive game.

>Nigel: ?ABEMMN N6 MM +26 252
>Noah: ABENSTY 12A BANTY +31 268
#note I thought about BAY N2, but didn't love keeping AENST. I also didn't love giving Nigel first grabs at all this new stuff. I like BYE 12D here, but I didn't see it.
>Nigel: ?ABEGIN 6J .AB +20 272
#note Missed a few bingos on rows B and C.
>Noah: DEEORSS N12 OSE +30 298
>Nigel: ?AEGINT B7 pAGIN.TE +70 342
#note After the game, we talked about this positon and thought it would be better to play something either like TAGlINE 14A or GANTlINE C6. Nigel thought pAGINATE was an adjective, though.
>Noah: DEEEFRS 1J RE.FED +39 337
#note Also DEFFER, which I was unsure of.

>Noah: EEEEISU -EEEIU +0 337
>Nigel: DEERSVY 9D DYE +17 383
>Noah: EHNOPST I3 HOP +17 354
#note I like this play, keeping two lanes open with a pool that isn't too fantastic. I never did catch on that Nigel thought PAGINATES wasn't good, except for a fleeting thought. Having noticed that, should I play differently here? I still like this play myself.
