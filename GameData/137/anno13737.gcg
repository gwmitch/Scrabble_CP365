>Luise_Shafritz: EORTWY 8G TOWERY +32 32
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEERTU K3 AUsTE.ER +64 64
#note A bit of a miss - APERTURE K5 scores 78 and is clearly best.  However, for this game this may have been my best possible choice.
>Luise_Shafritz: ?DDELOR -  +0 32
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: BEEIIJP L1 JEEP +52 116
>Luise_Shafritz: ABU 1L .UBA +39 71
>Jim_Burlant: BIIIIRW -BIIIW +0 116
#note I figured that with 4 I's in my rack, it was safe to keep one of them, and quackle agrees.  This is my best exchange.
>Luise_Shafritz: CFIU 7D FUCI +13 84
#note The only other bingo is 10G INVERTOR which scores 62  
>Jim_Burlant: ?INORTV 10D INVeRTO. +70 186
#note The only choices are this or the 10G placement which only scores 62.  This is best.  I'm already 88% to win, and the scary thing:  I was just getting started.
>Luise_Shafritz: EEFIILZ -EFIIL +0 84
>Jim_Burlant: AADEISS 6G DIAS.ASE +67 253
#note Only bingo.  97% to win.
>Luise_Shafritz: BEEGT 8A BEGET +35 119
>Jim_Burlant: GLNORTT N1 .OTTL. +16 269
#note Strong choice but Q wants me to play the extra consonant with BLOTTER or BOTTLER.  No thanks.
>Luise_Shafritz: DEILO H10 .OILED +24 143
>Jim_Burlant: EGHINPR E5 PH.. +18 287
#note Certainly a reasonable play but not best.  The best play here is utterly sick:  E4 REP(UT)I(N)G 44.  This sims with higher valuation and in reality anything wins as much as anything else.  I haven't hit 100% to win yet, but I'm not far away.
>Luise_Shafritz: ADLN J1 LAND +16 159
>Jim_Burlant: EGINNRW 14G R.NEWING +78 365
#note Best placement by a smidgen over B7, which scores identically to this.  I've officially crossed over from 99.xx% winning chances to 100.
>Luise_Shafritz: ENZ L12 ZE.N +28 187
#note This is the only thing that went right for Luise this game, as she blocked my impending 37-point Q play, not that it mattered.
>Jim_Burlant: AACIOQS F4 QI +15 380
#note Q wants me to hold the Q and play O6 SOCA or 13C SOCIAL, but the sim result is a smokescreen:  everything wins 100%, and this has the highest valuation of everything.
