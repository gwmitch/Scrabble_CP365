#note I'm a bit surprised by this - Quackle wants me to play 8F AVO and keep COOS.  Duplicated O's aren't the worst thing, but I think that could get ugly pretty quickly with the wrong draw.  Q says 8H AVO wins just shy of 51%; this wins 49.7 and sims not quite 2-1/2 points down.  Sim notwithstanding, I'd do this again.

#note Mike had overdrawn on his exchange and, following the overdraw procedure, we turned over EXZ.  After puzzling over what to toss back in, I threw the E back into the bag, figuring that I'd alter my play knowing his rack in much the same way I might if I had challenged off a phony bingo.  Knowing that he had XZ in his rack, I opted to play short, figuring to limit him to a probable worst-case play of ZAX 7H, in which case I would underlap the Z on row 9 or overlap the X on row 6.  ZAXES J4 is a possible comeback for him, but given that I have 2 S's he has roughly a 15% chance of even having an S.  When simmed against his rack fragment of XZ, this concedes roughly 5 equity to 8C DECAYS (sim winner) despite giving up 10 scoreboard points.   Given how this panned out, while I wound up bagging Mike (as you'll soon see), I do think that, in retrospect, the X is what should have gone back into the bag.  Having said all that, I don't know that I like playing long knowing that he's sitting on either the Z or the X.

#note Q prefers that Mike play ZOO 7H.  He told me post-mortem that he was doing this to set up the X.
>Jim_Burlant: ADENSST G5 DES.ANTS +63 79
#note I saw the obvious X setup, but this rack didn't leave me much choice.  This is the only bingo.   Even simmed against a probable INX (which is what he put down next turn) this is my best play.  J6 EAST, which is about the only thing that blocks his X,  still wins 2% less often than the bingo, as I'm drawing a fresh 7 and have another triple to work with.

>Jim_Burlant: ?EHNOVW H12 HOWE +51 130
#note I knew Quackle would want me to play HOVE instead of this.  The V isn't a prize, but I do consider it a hair more bingo prone than the W, which is why I played off the W. Q says this is the bronze medalist to HOVE or H12 HEWN.  Maybe HEWN would have been a smidgen better both in terms of leave and board position, but this came out in the wash.

#note Couldn't think of OVeRMINE, and I debated between OMNIVORE and this.  I settled on this because I felt it was the best of all defensive worlds.  While an O sitting at A15 is certainly not as juicy of a bingo line as, say, putting an R or S there, there still are a few bingos ending in O (a check of zyzzyva shows 156 8's that end in O) where there are only 3 ending in V. But, more importantly, the J is unseen.  If I put down OMNIVORE , a J bomb at 14F scores 55 or 56 depending on where I put the blank, and the A - D columns are still open.  With this, if Mike has a J bomb waiting for me, it will score a handful fewer points at 14B and seal off the southwest for me.  Quackle just wants me to take the extra 3 points with OVERMINE.  I'd make this play again.

#note The 7 doesn't play and the only 8 is REGEARED, which doesn't.   This is best, as the only plays which preserve more of the rack either slot the 3x3 or leave duplicates, or give up too much on the scoreboard.
>Mike_Baron: ?DITUVY E5 V.DUITY +56 185
#note This was Mike's rack and this is an amazing play.  Wow!!! I had absolutely no idea if that was good; I held, but I wasn't about to risk my turn given that I had a healthy comeback play coming.  This is Mike's best play without a doubt.

>Jim_Burlant: AEELNST K7 SELENAT. +66 357
#note Again, Quackle wants me to take the points with the M7 placement.  I didn't mind trading a handful of points for what I considered the better defensive posture.

>Jim_Burlant: BDIJLOP 8A POIL. +24 381
#note Given Mike's last play, my main concern was shutting down the easy run at the A column that FUGIO had given Mike.  While this accomplishes that, there was a much better play available:  BIJOU, which I almost always miss.   That said,  I still don't know why I didn't see 12A JUDO.  This was third in the sim, but JUDO should have been the play.

#note Best bingo is apparently L2 KINETIN and second best is B2 LENITION (blank L)
>Jim_Burlant: ABDHIJR O1 BARD +32 413
#note I was more worried about limiting scoring for him.   Everything wins 100% now.  I played the A instead of the I because I'm sitting on the case I and there are still 3 A's unseen.  The J can wait another turn.
