#note A few things to consider with this play. If I play DANGLY, I have an extra shot at the blank and block the E, but I open a bingo lane that's going to be difficult to block. With GLADY, I'm leaving NT, and limiting the top half of the board, but I'm leaving open the E and opening good scoring spots. I guess I can see the benefits of DANGLY - it's going to be difficult to score points without a bingo and most plays will give me a chance to score and keep the board closed.

#note Tough decision. Obviously Nawapadol is fishing with something like EIRS+2, so I think it's worth sacrificing points and leave to shut down the best lane. If he is fishing blankless, then giving him that spot means it's off to the races, while blocking the bingo still gives me a clear advantage. I might get screwed by a blank bingo, but I think it's worth the risk.

#note Lots of E's unseen and few A's, so the A is more valuable here.

>Rafi: AAGIPST K5 AG +17 274
#note GAP/PROVING is interesting, scoring 8 more points and giving me a better shot at the blanks and X. Not too big of a triple-triple threat through the G. Quackle is liking D4 AGITA/TAIGA for turnover for the X and blanks. Playing only two tiles off with AG was a bad idea... AIPST isn't that great for bingoing, and I'm in pretty bad shape if I draw IE or something similar.

#note Nawapadol's actual rack.
>Rafi: AILOPST 2G TALIPO.S +74 348
#note Is it better to play a lower scoring bingo to avoid opening up a huge spot? Championship player prefers APOSTIL, but many plies prefers TALIPOTS. I just figured that if I draw the X or blank, or maybe even the K, that I'm probably going to be able to outrun some bingoes or bingo back. Not sure how to really determine the best play here... so many factors to consider.
