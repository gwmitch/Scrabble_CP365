>Matthew_Larocque: AEEFOTU 8G FEU +12 12
#note I could have played in Division 2 for the money, but played up for the experience just in case I'm overrated and I didn't get to try it next time >_> Anyways, I hate leaving so many vowels, but I also hate exchanging on the first turn. Maybe FOU is better but it's probably not worth wasting too much time over. Q says exchanging EFOU is just as viable.
>Jason_Krueger: IIMQSTU H5 QUI.TISM +72 72
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENOOT I10 TOEA +13 25
#note Q points out O(M)ENTA, but I'd rather keep a consonant. No real outstanding plays here.
>Jason_Krueger: JKN 6G J.NK +25 97
>Matthew_Larocque: DELMNNO 11H ..DOM +16 41
#note This took way longer than it should have. (SO)DOM doesn't even show up on generate choices, and it doesn't sim any better. Didn't know about JUNKMEN or OMENED. (A)LMOND could get me blown out, but I'm unable to score very well right now, either. The simple (ME)LON is the sim's top choice. Why didn't I just play that?
>Jason_Krueger: DEFT 12K DEFT +27 124
>Matthew_Larocque: CELNNPT 10K PENT +19 60
#note Hey, he wants to play the no s-hook game...
>Jason_Krueger: DEEGSW K1 WEDGES +38 162
>Matthew_Larocque: CCLLNUY 4K .ULLY +26 86
#note Jason comments that I have nice letters. Amazing letters, actually.
>Jason_Krueger: AEL M1 LEA. +8 170
>Matthew_Larocque: CCENOTZ O1 COZ. +54 140
#note I needed this play badly, Jason laments that he didn't play LEA(L) down to the other L. Eh, that could have been just as bad for all he knew.
>Jason_Krueger: EX N4 .EX +26 196
>Matthew_Larocque: BCENORT 1H BRO. +27 167
>Jason_Krueger: ??GHINR 14I sHoRING +88 284
#note Killshot.
>Matthew_Larocque: CEGINPT J1 .P +20 187
#note Yeah ok. This is now just a "limp to the finish line" type game. I'd get used to that feeling later.
>Jason_Krueger: AIR I3 RAI. +16 300

>Jason_Krueger: ELNORSU A1 .LEURONS +77 411
#note Had some confusion between this and pleurons, but they're both fine.

>Jason_Krueger: AEHNOST E10 HAET +29 440

#note Phony, and not really necessary, but it doesn't matter. B4 TERAI for 18.
>Jason_Krueger: NOS M6 ONS +13 453
>Jason_Krueger:  (EIT) +6 459
#note Jason notes that I only drew the Z in terms of power tiles. Considering that, I could have gotten blown out worse.
