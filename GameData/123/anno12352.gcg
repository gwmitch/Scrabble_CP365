#note Despite the two I leave, this is best. I don't have another good way to score on the board.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AEILMST L1 STEAMIL. +78 102
#note The anagram TALEYSIM would have been better.  It does not take an S, as it is a plural of TALLITH.

>Dave_Koenig: DEFGPTT 5J TE.PT +18 160
#note I did not know DEMPT#, which would have been better.  It also would not have given an S hook, though I didn't mind that so much here.

#note There are two sevens with this rack, and neither is playable in TWL.

>Dave_Koenig: ?DEEQUV C2 V.. +9 269
#note With five E's and two U's out, this seemed like a worthwhile fish, but the main issue was that there was just nothing else good to do.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: GIPRS O1 GRIPS +43 311
#note My eyes lit up when I drew the U.

#note At first I was going to play HIKE in this spot, then I noticed that I had the case I and there was another A, so HAKE looked in order.  However, the more I thought about the remaining tile pool, the more I liked holding the H.  I was highly likely to draw an R, and L and R don't go so well together.  Meanwhile, I was likely to have some TH or CH firepower next time.

>Dave_Koenig: CEHIRTU 13H .HRICE +30 407
#note I did not know HEURETIC#, but I only would have been able to play it if I was 100% here.  I'm still almost sure to win without bingoing.

#note Bradley was down to about a second or two, and when I saw he didn't leave himself tiles to go out, I tried to prolong the game to push him overtime.  It didn't work.
