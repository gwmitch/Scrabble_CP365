#note I do completely telegraph my rack (S consonant consonant, likely an R) otherwise HM would have gone down. However it's not that easy to deal with because of the E and O to play through. HERLS might be a tad better, because I can score with the M if I don't bingo right away, and LR is a bit awkward.

>Rafi: ?ALRSTW 12B AWL.oRTS +78 156
#note Despite making a good play (WASTREL for one extra point puts the E in a bad spot) I regret taking 4 minutes or so looking for a better bingo. The other AWLWORTS might be better because of defense.
>Dr._Bing: EOV C12 .OVE +20 127
>Rafi: AACMUYZ 14A CA.Y +24 180
#note Didn't see GAUZY, which is better. Without any blanks unseen, the triple-triple threat isn't great, and an E in the 3rd position isn't super strong. CAVY is definitely the best block though.

>Rafi: AIMRUUV 1M AMU +18 245
#note Considered VIA, but with the 2-U leave and the threat of JIN/KIN/FIN/HIN to the triple, I thought AMU was slightly better.

>Rafi: DIIRRUV C2 RIV. +14 259
#note Another play that took some time off my clock. I was pretty happy about it, setting up the last D to potentially bail me out of a tough rack. VIER is simming best, maybe because RIVE gives comebacks through the R or V?

>Rafi: AFIORST 11J OF +12 311
#note I was somewhat wary about sacrificing points to open this spot, but with the last T it seemed well worth my while. There really aren't many good blocks here, and with 4 E's and 3 N's unseen, my bingo chances are pretty high. LOAF looks like the best alternative.

>Dr._Bing: EEILR 15C .ELIER +27 344
>Rafi: AGIIRST I8 .I. +7 348
#note If I pick up the C, E, N, or O I have playable bingos that could prove difficult to block. GRATIS (quackle's choice on manyplies) might work too... hard to say. T(H)I(O) and TI under DROUK also sim well.
>Dr._Bing: ABCENNO 13I OCEAN +19 363
#note Dave's actual rack.
>Rafi: AGIRSTX N10 GRIST +28 376
#note With about a minute and a half left on my clock, I whiff on the outplay. REX looks like the only win though, but I probably would have seen it if I saw BENNI. Heartbreaking way to lose after a well executed game.
