>Matthew_Larocque: ABEELPT 8D PLEBE +24 24
#note I hadn't quite lost my 1600 yet, but missing bingos like this first one wasn't going help my cause.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DFOR 9F FORD +23 23
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDEEIT 10B CADET +24 48
#note One of those racks where I'm not sure if I should play short or long. But it strikes me as a turnover rack. Either way, TAE 10F takes the sim pretty handily. I can see why this play is meh in hindsight, 2 vowel leave + setting up a hotspot with nothing else for me to have.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: FORV C9 F.VOR +30 53
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIIVY D12 YE +22 70
#note 20 points is kind of like the threshold where I'll make the play even with the horrific leave. Sim actually agrees, yikes, though exchanging is probably just as good.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IOP J8 POI +16 69
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIMRV E5 EVI. +14 84
#note Simply lacking the word knowledge, as none of the excellent scoring plays are in my scope. (P)REMIE, VERMEI(L) and VIREMI(C).
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EMNOW D1 WOMEN +30 99
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIIMR C1 AMA +27 111
#note I hate keeping 2xI or 2xA, but racks like these don't leave much choice. I can play A(M)I or AI(M) sure, but that's a big point sacrifice. Fishing is great when it works, ruins games when it fails. Scoring points is usually a solid course of action.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EINOS 8J .ONIES +27 126
#note He must have had a decent rack here, curious play.
>Matthew_Larocque: CEHHIIR 1A CH.. +36 147
#note Dumping HI was tempting, but I wanted to keep hammering the points to keep him pressured. HIC B12 looks pretty awesome too, had a hard time deciding.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?DGINOU A1 .lOUDING +86 212
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHIIRT B12 HID +26 173
#note DI(S)HERIT, shorter version of DISINHERIT. Good to know.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: GOW A13 WOG +31 243
>Matthew_Larocque: EILRTTX 7K LEX +39 212
#note Sim says even this only lands me a 19% chance to win. Guess I'm going to need a really lucky draw....
>Siri_Tillekeratne: KN 2C ..NK +20 263
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIRTT 3F AIT +10 222
#note Man, I suck. I seem to keep forgetting whether it's ARIETTA, ARIETTE, or both (which it is). 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IQ O6 QI. +12 275
>Matthew_Larocque: AAELNRT H1 AL. +9 231
#note Hate making dinky plays like this, but I missed the only good scoring play - RELA(XI)N for 30. It ends up a little worse than fishing off AL, though.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EEZ 15A .EEZ +32 307
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINRST 1H .NTISERA +77 308
#note Nothing like a RETINAS rack when things get dire! Also, T(ER)NARIES. Obviously nines aren't my forte. Unless it's some kind of extension as opposed to a bingo.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BU 7A .UB +8 315
#note Siri gives me a huge break as he seemingly fishes here...
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGINST 4H SEATING +73 381
#note Literally drawing a TISANE post-bingo rack. Seriously. This game was entirely luck.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: R 13A ....R +8 323
>Matthew_Larocque: AJLSTUY 11H JUSTLY +38 419
#note Sim doesn't like JUSTLY, but champ says it's the only surefire win? He'll grab some points on the J, but he won't win. Yeah, usually I just try to end the game before I find a way to lose >_>
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?AORRTU H11 .UROR +39 362
>Matthew_Larocque: A 12B ...A +12 431
>Matthew_Larocque:  (?AT) +4 435
#note Feels good to win the first round, but those fluke draws will get turned back on me even moreso in this tournament.
