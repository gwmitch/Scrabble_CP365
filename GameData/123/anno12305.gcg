>JD: DELNRRU 8G DURN +10 10
#note I ike playing pretty defensively on the opening move but quackle likes both NURL and NURLED better. LR has bad synergy.
>Noah: IISSTUZ J6 ZI. +32 32
>JD: EELLNRY 9I EELY +24 34
#note quackle likes LEZ a lot more, but part of that depends on noah playing his next move like quackle rather than a real person. Still LEZ could easily be a couple of points better - blocks cheap points on K, and waits
>Noah: DEISSTU 10D STUDIES +81 113
>JD: EKLNRSV H10 .NKLES +45 79
>Noah: GNNOOOR 11C GOON +18 131
>JD: CCEORRV 13G C.OVER +15 94
#note I was looking for any play that looked halfway decent - but CORVEE does the same thing. On the other hand my play makes it hard to block the S down the road and sets up CLOVERY, which he might not see. Quackle's favorite is actually OVER at 8L, which makes sense given that I'm down...my bingo percentage actually doesn't drop that much with CCR compared to CR.
>Noah: AENORRW G1 NARROWE. +64 195
>JD: ?CDEILR 1B RECLI.eD +89 183
>Noah: IIPQUVW K11 VI.W +20 215
>JD: AEFGILX 5I FAX +41 224
#note lots of As left but quackle still thinks FAX at 2F is about as good
>Noah: HIPQTTU 4D QUI.T +30 245
#note Missed PITH.
>JD: BBEGILP 8L BLEB +43 267
#note keeping -IP for 5D
>Noah: AAEHPTU 4K EAU +15 260
#note Didn't think of VAU or CHAQUETA, which looks best. 
>JD: ?AFGIMP 5C GIP +31 298
>Noah: AAEHPTT 7I P.TA +26 286
>JD: ?AAEFMT F1 .F +26 324
#note awful, I chickened out on FERMATAS. On the other hand it probably doesn't hurt my win percentage too much because I'm just about guaranteed to play something or other next turn
>Noah: ADEEHOT 12C ODE +22 308
>JD: ?AAEMNT 15A ANiMATE. +86 410
#note BANDMATE is 6 more
>Noah: AEHIMST 13B HA +18 326
#note Didn't think of HAM. 
>JD: HIIJORY M11 JOY +56 466
#note Wasn't positive of CLOVERY. Shouldn't have challenged. Should've tried to get more spread.
>Noah: AEIMOST -  +0 326
>JD: AGHIIRT 14A HI +27 493
#note just trying to block the obvious hook...
>Noah: AEIMOST 15K SMOTE +41 367
>JD: AGINORT 2I ORATING +73 566
#note ridiculous draw for the bingo in two spots!
>JD:  (AI) +4 570
#note this wound up being high game of the tournament
