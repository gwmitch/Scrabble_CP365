#note I thought of REX 14A but not EX 14B. I like that play because it gives me a decent chance at a good score there next turn.

#note Quackle claims that J(O) sometimes wins. I don't think Nigel is going to let me win after that though, he should have the game pretty handily. I realized full well that this wouldn't ever win, but I probably should've played JOG, which handles spread a little better by blocking huge N column plays.
