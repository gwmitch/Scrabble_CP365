#note CHOOSER leads to a deader board, but I like to play open against Ross.

#note Didn't know HORNWORt or HORNWORm!

#note L8 OAKIER looks good, but I was content to let Ross keep the board open.

#note I knew this would be Quackle's play, but that most humans would hate it. I simply wasn't a fan of 7G FUB. So Ross hits a smallish bingo on row 9, and I potentially have a rack of one-pointers to score on the triple with. Eh. I decided that if Ross didn't have a bingo response this very turn, then he would be in trouble. So I went for broke. And hey, Quackle likes it.
>Ross_Brown: AAEFOTT 14H TA.FETA +26 115
#note Nice word. I definitely didn't know it.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACENRTW 15G CAW +35 233
#note The original plan was to close the board if Ross didn't bingo. But after he turned over six, I felt safe letting it stay open. CRAW might be better, btw, since there is an open R.
>Ross_Brown: EIIMOPS 11E PISMI.E +44 159
#note I can stop sweating about the MAIMED hook now, at least.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EJNRRTT 13I J.ER +47 280
>Ross_Brown: DEEINOS 15L DONE +31 190
#note Glad to see the hooks to that word I was unsure of killed. And the big JEERS play.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: LNRTTYZ F10 R.TZY +27 307
#note ZIT created a new bingo line, which I wasn't excited about.
>Ross_Brown: BDEGIIS 12L BIG +26 216

>Ross_Brown: DEEILNS 13C SEI.E +30 246
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AGILNN 14B GINN. +24 357
#note I actually have a decent shot at hitting a fish for LANGLAUF, which I really wanted to try. But really, fishing for a bingo hooking MAIMED would be more likely. In any case, I'm going to play safe and just kill the bingo lane.
>Ross_Brown: DEELNST D12 L..D +14 260
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ALLOUV 8F VA. +6 363
#note Oh, that sucks. I had a bingo to the N. To be honest, I wasn't even thinking along those lines, as you can see by the play I chose.
>Ross_Brown: EENSTXY G8 .XE. +21 281
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?GLLLOU 2H GOL. +6 369
#note Erm. Yeah, spread doesnt matter.
>Ross_Brown: ENSTUY 7C YEN +15 296
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?LLU 7G L.x +18 387
#note Oh, and I had an out. Look at me bleeding all these points.
>Ross_Brown: STU N1 UTS +14 310
>Ross_Brown:  (LU) +4 314
#note Some bingo fails, like HORNWOR?, and totally whiffing on ALLUVION, but played well enough to win.
