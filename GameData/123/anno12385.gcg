#note Blah, I saw EULOGIAE as soon as I hit my clock. Didn't think to make the blank anouther vowel. Careless, but this pretty much seals the deal anyways.

#note Yuck. Missed OBEAH M3. But also obvious stuff like A1 OBA is fine, too.

#note I thought I was being cheeky by hanging onto the case O, but really, I should just do LOONIE so the B column is less of a bingo threat.

#note Some clumsy turns this game, but I had plenty of breathing room with what I drew. Hopefully I wouldn't have made a play as lousy as REHAB in a closer game.
