>JD: AEGINOT -O +0 0
#note I wasn't sure that this was the best choice here but quackle likes it. Mark is likely to play a little more defensively or exchange, and AEGINT doesn't hit any vowels except the U, but still seems reasonable
>Mark_Milan: ?FIZ 8G FIZ +30 30
#note he told me later he had the blank here
>JD: AEGINTT 9F GETA +27 27
#note the board didn't seem very amenable to -ING bingoes after ETA but quackle suggests that I bingo 30% after ETA versus 20% after -TING. 
>Mark_Milan: DEY H6 DE..Y +9 39
>JD: AHIMMNT 10G M. +15 42
#note not so much a fish as much as a waiting move
>Mark_Milan: EFIKN 11C KNIFE +33 72
>JD: AHIMNTU D6 MANHU.T +26 68
#note this is pretty poor, HAKIM is definitely best.
>Mark_Milan: COW E5 COW +25 97
>JD: ABCDEIU C7 CUE +28 96
#note I'm not sure if I ever would've figured it out over the board, but after BA, CDEIU hits a remarkable amount of bingoes from the D with all the As, Es and Ls left.
>Mark_Milan: EU C11 .UE +16 113
>JD: ABDEIRU B12 BAUD +21 117
>Mark_Milan: OOR 15A O.OR +18 131
>JD: ?EEINOR 14D ElOINER +62 179
#note eloiner is evidently worse on defense than onerier. a big reason might be the S hook - with all 4 esses unseen odds are good he has one.
>Mark_Milan: AAGL 13J ALGA +12 143
#note he had AL? as a leave here I believe.
>JD: JNNQSTX G13 Q. +21 200
#note quackle doesn't like this much at all. if he has an I I'm just giving him cheap points. exchanging and keeping JS or playing QAT are both pretty intriguing. QAT wins a longer sim - along with blocking bingoes it also gives me an extra chance to draw JINX.
>Mark_Milan: ?ALNORT K6 ANTiROL. +64 207
#note ortolan would've been nice for him

>JD: HIIINOR 1L .OIN +33 352
>Mark_Milan: IORSSVV 4H VO. +13 269
#note blocks his S hook, but I guess he gets to create a new lane next turn.
>JD: BDEHIIR 8K .HIRD +39 391
#note hired/hider/bider makes it too easy for mark to bingo.
>Mark_Milan: ADG G3 GAD +17 286
>JD: BEEILPV N10 BEVEL +38 429
#note quackle wants me to fish a P but I'm pretty sure that it's not playing the resulting endgames correctly. BEVEL blocks STRIDERS.
>Mark_Milan: EIRRSST 15L REST +26 312
#note TUNS at B8 is the pretty clever best play here since I can't block or go out.
