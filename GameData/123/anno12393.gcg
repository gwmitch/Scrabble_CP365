#note boleti is the play here (saw it only when looking at it just now), and if i don't see that, BETA 14I is a lot better than my play, which gives up cheap pts for not that good of a leave. (-8). this is a pretty bad mistake; i was partly unaware that EOTT was better than EET, but the main reason BOTA is better than BOAT is because BOAT gives up way more points.

#note ok but GAE is the play at M4. saw it and didn't like the leave and i also wanted to force him to bingo a little more to the left. :P  (-7). another fairly serious mistake; in this case, i really didn't like IIFT as a leave when i thought there was a high probability he'd bingo after MUT, so i mostly wanted a bingo myself next turn. however, GAE scores so much (and blocks a lane) that any bingo he gets will be low-scoring and i'll probably score next turn.

#note i pretty much drew the best possible thing to AEGIT after that bad mistake on my part. DENSELY wouldn't have fit if i hadn't gone there.

#note 6D JAW is much better, even if he has the R i can get a P spot at 8A, if not i score huge next turn too. i started kinda freaking out here and saw that AJUGA would probably win so i left it alone, but JAW is much better. (-13)
