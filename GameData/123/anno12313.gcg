>Matthew_Larocque: ADIIIOR D4 OIDI. +12 12
#note 7I OIDIA turns an extra tile, but you just know he would have an F.....
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BOR 7G BRO +21 85
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIORXY C2 ORYX +42 54
#note 3 vowel leave is never pretty, but it's too many points.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: FIT 5A FI..T +30 115
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEIKNW A5 .AWNlIKE +104 158
#note This was kind of a guess, luckily it's good - it scores much more than the other available bingo. I accidentally announced the blank as an "N", but I had already written down "L" on the slip, so I avoided a pretty big blunder.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DGINP 2B D.PING +24 139
>Matthew_Larocque: EHJOOPZ 6F ZOO +40 198
#note After I quackled this I realized ZOO wasn't the best choice here. I should score with the J first because the Z is a lot more flexible. (K)OPJE sims highest but I don't know - he gets easy points with it. I'd rather do something like JO 1A or JOE 6F. I can't remember if I saw (D)OJO, and I didn't know BROO was a word.

#note Lol really, both vees? 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ILRY 8K .RILY +30 195
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHNTTV 4G VAN +17 231
#note Phony and not a particularly good play. HEAT 1E should be obvious.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EOQU L8 .OQUE +28 223
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGHTTU 13J GUT +19 250
#note I got too concerned with being defensive, just play THUG for 31.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ACEL 1G ALEC +21 244
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHLTTW N6 WE.T +15 265
#note I just got lost here....sim likes B12 THEW but he's too likely to just hammer the spot for 30 points next turn.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EGPS M2 PEGS +25 269
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHLMNT 7M H.M +28 293
#note I basically played this the insant I saw it, B12 HENT wins in the sim though. I don't get it, why does it like B12 so much? Is it afraid of a killer F play?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: OR L3 RO. +34 303
#note I guess I should have played N2 EH if I smelled the set-up, but it kind of eluded me.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEFLNT N1 NEE +17 310
#note This seems like an odd choice, but I saw quite a few As left and was fishing for FATAL B10. I suppose just playing FA/FAN/FAT now makes more sense instead of gambling. I don't have any of the esses so playing FATE or FANE seems a little risky.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ELNSSTT E7 T.NTLESS +68 371
#note His only bingo, and he needed it.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAFHLOT B10 FATAL +53 363
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AABERSU D12 BEAU +26 397
#note I can't win now because he can go out no matter what.
>Matthew_Larocque: AHOU O1 UH +29 392
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ARS J11 RA.S +7 404
#note (BE)ARS or S(U)RA for 8.
