>James: ?EEEOTU -EEOU +0 0
#note I favor this exchange because ET? is a good balance that can absorb a lot of odd letter combinations. 
>Geoff: INOV 8G VINO +14 14
>James: ?AEMOQT 7H QAT +29 29
#note Well, not this one. But not a bad play anyway. 
>Geoff: LO J7 ..OL +6 20
#note I took this to mean a fish... 
>James: ?AEMOWZ K9 MOW +22 51
#note So I decided to hold onto the Z. It a bingo is played right, I can use the Z to punish him in a counterplay. Quackle likes my thoughts... MOW and MAW K9 are rated best, then ZOEAL 10F, if one guesses that Geoff holds an S at this point (not a bad assumption, I think). 
>Geoff: AAEORST 12G AEROSAT +75 95
>James: ?AEINXZ 13C oXAZINE +106 157
#note That's pretty ridiculous, getting to play this. Best. 
>Geoff: ACO D10 COA. +26 121
>James: EHRSTTY 14I THYRSE +43 200
#note I thought to keep the pressure on by playing THYRSE and maybe to get a challenge. Quackle favors THY 14A or HENRY/TENTY H11 most, because they allow for good fishes with an S that can play all over the map. I still like a play like THYRSE or TYTHES though.

Quackle's margin of preference is small, but still significant enough to take into account. 
>Geoff: BEEGI 15E BEIGE +28 149
>James: ADEGIIT M6 DIGITA.E. +76 276
#note I was so proud to find this and then I found out DIGITATE's an adjective (and DIGITATED is good). I felt bad because I thought I had found something nice. 

Other than this, it's hard to really come up with good scoring plays. quackle favors playing GEOID 11B, ID 13M or GIANT I5, because they all leave fairly okay sets of tiles. Plus, you can't score more than 15 points on this turn. 
>Geoff: AINU 10B UN.IA +11 160
>James: EEMOORU 8L O.EE +18 294
#note They're all fairly close at the top - OURIE E7, MOUE L3, ROOMIE E6, OGEE... actually, basically tied. The idea is to score so-so and balance the rack to some extent. 
>Geoff: AW C8 AW. +10 170
>James: EGLMORU 8A OG.M +30 324
#note I was hoping to somehow get a LI at E9 so I could play GLOMERULI... or GLOMERULE along the O-column somehow... but my play is rated among the best. 
>Geoff: AEFLNRS A2 FARNES.L +62 232
>James: DELNRRU 2A .URLED +28 352
#note Again, close to the best. DURN/DURR C7 are rated as better but very slightly. 
>Geoff: JKRS E1 J.RKS +32 264
>James: CFHINRU 7C FUCI +31 383
#note This, FUN or FUR 7C are all best. 
>Geoff: DEIILPU 4C PI.I +20 284
>James: BEHLNRY 11C Y.N +30 413
#note Best, though anything blocking the E would probably be just as good (like HERB). 
>Geoff: ?DEOTUV O2 DEVOUT.r +65 349
>James: BDEHLPR N1 HEP +26 439
>Geoff: NT 7L T.N. +8 357
