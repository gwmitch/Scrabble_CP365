>Rahn: DENOZ H4 ZONED +50 50
>Matt: AEILRSV 5D VARI.LES +94 94
#note One extra hook for VARIOLES isn't enough to open easy comebacks at 4L, IMO.
>Rahn: DGHOTUV C4 DOUGH +24 74
#note Actual rack.  He bemoaned not being able to use the hook and hit the DWS simultaneously.
>Matt: ?AOPRTU E5 .UTOhARP +68 162
#note OUTPRAY is the only 7, and I couldn't come up with it, but I'm OK with this anyway.  
>Rahn: AOV D12 OVA +20 94
>Matt: DEEFRTU G7 REFUTED +74 236
#note No Quackle, I'm not playing FEAUTRED 14B for only 4 more points.
>Rahn: AGLO 15A GOAL +26 120
>Matt: ACEINST K5 .CANTIES +70 306
#note Luckbox...3rd time I've done this 4-bingoes rampage in a game.  
>Rahn: ACERT 13I CATER +31 151
#note Scored as 33.  The coffeehousing starts on his end.  "How have you played 4 bingoes in a row and the board is shut down?  At least I'm playing 9-letter words, none of these baby 8's."  
>Matt: AEHKNOS 12K .HANK +46 352
#note I take some time to review my options, he comes back with "Oh, not so easy to play when you don't have a bingo?"  Just had to chuckle.  Felt the K was OK to float out in the 3x3 for the extra points, and an S in hand.
>Rahn: AFIILMX O8 REYO.ING +194 345
>Rahn: AFIILMX --  -194 151
#note While you can UNYOKE, DISYOKE, and MISYOKE, you can't REYOKE*.  Worth a shot on his end considering the score.  
>Matt: EEOQSUX J9 EX +52 404
#note Super luckbox.
>Rahn: EGINORY 9B OY +27 178
#note Opening another lane and balancing the rack gives him the best shot at coming back...
>Matt: BEOQSSU A3 BOSQUES +113 517
#note ...but I'm a super duper luckbox this game.  That's just a ridiculous draw.  Scored as 103 because I can't add for crap.
>Rahn: EGIIINR O10 IR.ING +33 211
#note And then he gets a killer II draw to his fish and has to kill the 3x3 lane.  
>Matt: AEEINOY I4 A.EE +22 539
#note I think this is what I had, or something similar.  With the case O and the J still unaccounted for I don't mind playing ALEE over ALOE.  Also around this point I said something like "Why am I even bothering to track now", and Rahn jocularly, but rightly, called me an a-hole for that.  It's important to be modest when on a lucky tear against any opponent, IMO. 
>Rahn: AILW B1 WAIL +22 233
>Matt: EIINOTY 1A T.INY +36 575
#note Taking points wherever possible at this point, gunning for 600.
>Rahn: J 9I J.. +18 251
>Matt: BEILMOW N10 MO. +23 598
#note Blocking the easiest bingo lane here, since my own bingo possibilities look slim.
>Rahn: DEFINPR B9 .F +13 264
#note Actual rack...the blank was the last tile he drew.
>Matt: BEIILMW 14B BL.W +28 626
#note Chickened out on NIMBI...I should have been able to deduce it from CIRRUS/CIRRI, but could only come up with NIMBUSES.  BLAW is better than BLAME because it gives me more flexibility in the endgame.  WIG is best since it blocks most bingoes he potentially could have, but I didn't pay much attention to my tracking in this game.
>Rahn: ?DEINPR 15H DuPERIN. +86 350
>Rahn: ?DEINPR --  -86 264
#note No bingoes available, and the only bingo through the G is SPRINGED, surprisingly.  Another desperation phony.  
>Matt: EIIMT F10 ME +24 650
#note Again going for points over optimal play - GIT followed by EMIT appears to be the best out sequence.
>Rahn: ?DEINPR J2 DuP. +24 288
>Matt: IIT 14M TI. +9 659
#note Final score recorded as 649 - 304.  Wish I could bottle this luck for next week's tourney.
>Rahn: EINR 2J .INER +12 300
>Rahn:  (I) +2 302
