>Jim_Burlant: ?EEGTTU 8G GUT +8 8
#note Either this or TUG is best. One's as good as the other.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BDLNOOR -BD +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEERST H8 .nRESTED +77 85
#note Best bingo - the only other option that hits the triple is UnDERSET, and that one is roughly a 1-point dog in a short sim.  Little did I know this was about to be the last good rack I'd see this game until the very end.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACIORST 14H .ROTICAS +74 74
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACIORST --  -74 0
>Jim_Burlant: AIJLQWW 15F QA.I +14 99
#note Looking at his rack, I only saw CAROTIDS as a possible 8; I didn't see RICOTTAS, which influenced my thinking.  No idea why I played this instead of QAID, which wouldn't have given up the easy bingo line.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACIORST 12A COSTAIR. +76 76
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACIORST --  -76 0
>Jim_Burlant: BIIJLWW 11E JIB. +26 125
#note Best play here is a word I didn't know, TWIBIL 13H.  I still didn't see RICOTTAS so I felt I could just unload the J and B and hope to gradually start cleaning this out.  Even this mistake is winning 76%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACIORST 13C RICOT.AS +74 74
>Jim_Burlant: IILNSWW J10 WIN. +15 140
#note Best.  Q also likes G3 WILING...it does a nice job clearing out all the crap, but WILING threatens to give up too much IMO.  I'm going to have to grind through this.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EENN K9 NENE +19 93
>Jim_Burlant: EILMSWX 12C EX +38 178
#note I really want to turn more tiles and end this game, but LEX and ILEX are just reckless as far as I'm concerned.  Q disagrees, preferring ILEX 12Z by nearly 6 points.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EMRT L12 TERM +24 117
>Jim_Burlant: EILMNSW 15L .EWL +27 205
#note Best, nothing else within 6 points in the sim.   Getting a little bit frustrating that, every time I land an E, I can't hold onto it.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AD N13 DA. +14 131
#note Play incorrectly scored as 16.
>Jim_Burlant: IMNPSUV B10 VIS +24 229
#note Best play per Q is apparently C9 VIPER. I was more concerned about taking away easy front hooks to EX than having him hit something down the O column, and his reaction to this play proved my instincts were right.  I don't know his rack, but he told me after the game this did block his intended play.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DO G6 DO. +6 137
>Jim_Burlant: EKMNOPU O10 PUKE +18 247
#note Best, winning 95%.  Yet another E I have to burn.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ORY 6G .ORY +16 153
>Jim_Burlant: AAFMNNO 5H MOAN +23 270
#note Too bad I couldn't think of the anagram NOMA.  This is the right idea with the wrong execution.  NOMA wins the sim, this is runner up just over 3 points down.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: LOOP 4J POOL +22 175
>Jim_Burlant: ABFNOVY 3L NAVY +26 296
#note Best, M3 FLAB also worth consideration.  Nothing really strong available from this cruddy rack.  I'm winning just shy of 98%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: OSUZ O1 SO.UZ +54 229
>Jim_Burlant: BFFHLOR 1L FOB. +13 309
#note These last several turns I'd missed practically every good tile (save for the S and X) and otherwise drawn every piece of crap from a very nice pool.  So I have to assume the good tiles are all in Sam's rack - especially since he's been turning tiles and I haven't been able to.  Given that, I felt the first priority was to kill the easiest line on the board and limit his options to lines that are much tougher to hit that will give me something back.  This choice is terrible statically, but it sims very well. It's the runner up to 1k BOFFS, which I think gives him a few too many easy underlaps.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EEHT L7 THEE +19 248
>Jim_Burlant: AFGHILR 8L .ALF +30 339
#note Auto-pilot play - Q prefers HIGH by nearly 6 points.  Outside of HIGH or this, nothing else worth mentioning.  Still winning 95%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: I 13L .I.. +10 258
>Jim_Burlant: AAGHILR 2J GHI +18 357
#note Terrible statically but once again, a strong choice - this is one of 3 plays - the others being 2I GLAIR and 2I GLIA - that win the most often.  The advantage to GLAIR (which I didn't see, as I was trying to keep the board tight) is that it takes the bag down to 1.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: GI 10B .IG +7 265
>Jim_Burlant: AADEILR 1F REDIA +21 378
#note Championship Player wants me to play RAJ E9, which I saw and passed up; unlike Quackle, I was unable to enumerate every possible bingo in the pool to know with 100% certainty that he wouldn't have an out bingo on row 1.  I saw this, saw that it would push my lead to 113 points, and even if he bingo'd out, it wouldn't be enough for him to catch up.  Q confirms this guarantees the win, though obviously at a huge equity loss.
