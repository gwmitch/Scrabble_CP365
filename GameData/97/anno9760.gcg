#note Best. AI 9F, INIA or ILIA 9G are all interesting considerations for a slightly better leave but the scores are all worse. INIA I actually considered because if I drew an E or Y I could play LEAVE 5I but the chances Nigel could play there were also high, leaving me with trouble if I tried to play out of a defensive board (if in the worst case, he bingoed).

>James: CEIINPU G8 .UIP +16 125
#note Miss - QUINIC G8 is a better play - it's more defensive and also scores better. CEIN is a nice leave but on this board not that great. QUIP, along with a series of other plays including QUINCE G8, UP 5H and CUP 5G, was second after the best play. 
>Nigel: AEEFIR H10 FAERIE +39 142
>James: CEEIMNO 13B INCOME. +24 149
#note I couldn't figure out what to do here. MIOCENE doesn't play but I holding onto most of these tiles didn't look that useful to me. As such, I decided to play for the blanks and Ss (since I saw nothing so far) and see what would come. 

Quackle likes my play best, surprisingly. I thought it would favor a smaller play like ME N2 as CEINO isn't the worst leave.

>Nigel: DNNO H1 DONN. +21 193
>James: DEGGITU D4 T.UGGED +30 259
#note I had a feeling THUGGED was bad, but I decided that it was worth playing for the points. I almost played DUETING but somehow thought that was bad and needed two Ts! 

Not surprisingly, THUGGED is the best play when let go. Of actual plays that are good, DUETING tops the list. Not surprising, as both close off many dangerous bingo lanes and give me a good 60+ point lead.

>James: IOSSSTZ 2F ZO.S +33 319
#note Best - in this case, having three Ss is NOT worth it. It's better playing off tiles to draw some vowels since it's likely to see him play a bingo that I will have to respond to.
