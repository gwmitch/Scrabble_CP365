>Evans_Clinchy: AORRUVZ 8H VROU +14 14
#note Not bad, but URVA# 8F is probably better since it sets up the Z. Either I get a Z play at 7I, or maybe he plays there and I overlap with the Z at 6J. Either way, could be juicy.
>Joel_Wapnick: FGIO K7 F.GIO +18 18
>Evans_Clinchy: AANORYZ L4 ZANY +40 54
#note ZONARY is a little better despite opening more counterplays. Gotta be more aggressive sometimes.
>Joel_Wapnick: IQ J10 QI +64 82
>Evans_Clinchy: ABLOOOR M1 ROBALO +31 85
#note And now I make the opposite mistake! LOBO is tighter and sims better than ROBALO.
>Joel_Wapnick: ?ADEGIL 1F GLADlIE. +80 162
>Evans_Clinchy: BEEFORS N2 FES +38 123
#note Just FE sims better by a point or two, which shocks me since keeping an S isn't usually worth 14 points. But I may have underestimated how strong the BEORS leave is for bingos.
>Joel_Wapnick: EHIMORT N6 MOTHIER +81 243
#note Joel first started to put down MOITHER# but then decided he wasn't sure of it.
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEOORT O5 REBOOT +47 170
#note Or maybe TABOO, close call. With a deficit like this, I tend to desperately grasp at as many points as possible.
>Joel_Wapnick: AAAUUU -AAAUUU +0 243
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEIJMS 12L JI.D +28 198
#note Best by far. JAR looks comparable at first, but the fact that the I is tougher to overlap makes a huge difference.
>Joel_Wapnick: DEORS 13I REDOS +27 270
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AEMPST 12C PASTiME +78 276
>Joel_Wapnick: AX 14I AX +53 323
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEHKNY 11D YEAH +35 311
#note Missed KEYPAD C9, and also probably should have considered DYKE O12 to leave things open. This play isn't so good.
>Joel_Wapnick: AP 10F PA +26 349
>Evans_Clinchy: DIIKNNT O12 .INK +27 338
#note Thought about playing KID 13B and praying to draw the S, but I don't think I'm that desperate quite yet.
>Joel_Wapnick: ELU H12 .ULE +35 384
>Evans_Clinchy: DINNNRT 13B NID +23 361
#note This is strong equity-wise, but the sim gives a higher winning percentage to exchanging. I couldn't stomach that. A lost turn here, and he could make this into more than a one-bingo deficit.
>Joel_Wapnick: AUW 15L WAU. +15 399
>Evans_Clinchy: ANNRTTV 14A VAT +21 382
#note Sim prefers AVANT H1, which is an interesting way to open bingo possibilities (especially because AVANTI# is good). I didn't think of that. This is the stronger play valuation-wise, but winning the game is gonna be awfully difficult from here.
>Joel_Wapnick: ETU O1 UTE +20 419
>Evans_Clinchy: ELNNRTW H1 .WL +6 388
#note Best according to Quackle, although I doubt I'm winning this game unless he royally screws up and forgets to block something.
>Joel_Wapnick: CCGIINS 3G C.ING +12 431
>Evans_Clinchy: EEENNRT 15D RENT. +6 394
#note Thought I was blocking his only out. Missed the other one.
>Joel_Wapnick: CIS 9D CIS +11 442
#note Yeah, that one.
>Joel_Wapnick:  (EEN) +6 448
