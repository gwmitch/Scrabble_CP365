>Judy: ACHIOPR 8B APHORIC +86 86
>Judy: ACHIOPR --  -86 0
#note I had to think for some time before challenging, as I thought of APHONIC, APHOTIC and APHORISTIC. 
>James: EEGINOW 8H OWE +12 12
#note I somehow thought of her having PROCHAIN but not POACHIER with my reply plays! As such, I think OW or exchanging are the best plays, as neither gives her a bingo.
>Judy: ACHIOPR 7G CHOP +30 30
#note Thankfully, she didn't play POACHIER either. 
>James: ?AAEGIN 9G AGE +20 32
#note I saw ANERGIA but somehow missed it played... This is getting to be a gong show. I also missed vAGINAE. 
>Judy: AFILMRY -AFI +0 30
>James: ?AEINRZ 10F ZA +33 65
#note ... and here's ZINgARE. At least playing ZA is actually seen as best, probably because the Z isn't in the triple lane. 
>Judy: DM I6 M...D +11 41
>James: ?EINQRT -Q +0 65
#note I was thinking to play PERE but thought that I had enough of a chance to bingo if I exchanged that the exchange was worth it. However, playing PERE would probably have given her even more of a headache for future turns. 
>Judy: AIV 11D VIA +23 64
>James: ?EEINRT K1 TRIENEs +73 138
#note I missed NERVIEST D8, but I think they're about similar overall. One point less, approximately the same threats in openings. 

Quackle does like REINVENT D7 and its like more, proabbly because it doesn't leave a 3-3 opening. 
>Judy: FN 4J F.N +12 76
>James: DEGKTUV 1H GUT.ED +27 165
#note After a play of two tiles, I think she's close to a bingo, so I'd best block the 3-3. It's also coincidentally the best play. 
>Judy: IY D10 I.Y +18 94
>James: EIKLOVY C6 KEVIL +16 181
#note This is very close to the top plays of YOLK C7 or KOI 10B. Both KOI and YOLK leave EIV or EILVY, which are fairly decent leaves to score with. I picked KEVIL since it looked better for blocking up the top left quadrant of the board and left me with the Y to potentially use at 8A if I got lucky. 
>Judy: EGILNRS 12F SLINGER +80 174
>James: ENORUWY 8A EN.Y +42 223
#note I totally missed WYVERN 8A but my play is second best, tied with WOVEN 8A (RUY is a weak leave too) and YOW 11K (least scoring). Of the leaves, OU is better than RUY which is better than ORUW, which stands to reason why WYVERN is so much better. 
>Judy: DFJL K10 FJ.LD +32 206
>James: ELMORUW C12 MOW +23 246
#note I have no S, there's a lot of them left, and she just drew for four. The odds aren't that bad she just drew one, so I'd rather play to potentially give myself MOWN or something else on the bottom too. It also helps that the leave is good.

Quackle suggests JOW 11K as best, which I can't argue with. The JOWL hook is only usable by me and I already have it. MOW is second best, with MEOW C12 and FLOW 10K. 
>Judy: CDRSU 15G CURDS +41 247
>James: ?BELORU A1 REdOUBL. +80 326
#note Best. 
>Judy: ABEIIOQ -ABEI +0 247
>James: AAEEIST 14I AI.E +14 340
#note Best - I can't really block all the bingo spots so I may as well go for my own bingo. 
>Judy: OX 13K .OX +23 270
>James: AAAEHST 14B A.ASH +38 378
#note Best, but if I play this right it's very hard to lose. She'd have to bingo and have me have no good counters period to really get into the game. 
>Judy: ABINR D3 BRAIN. +30 300
>James: AEOOPST 15A PESTO +40 418
#note Missed PASEO 15A, but the game's all but won. The M4 bingo spot can't be used anymore. 
>Judy: ENO 3C E.ON +12 312
>James: AAOQRTU L8 QUA +27 445
>Judy: IITT M7 TIT +19 331
>James: AORT N4 TORA +8 453
