>Dave_Koenig: AAAEIMR A8 MARIA +32 84
#note Despite the all vowel leave, this makes more sense to me than AMIA$ A6, because that play scores 6 fewer points and gives him a juicy scoring spot at B6.
>Pakorn: AILOU 10E AULOI +10 31
>Dave_Koenig: AEEHHIU 7F HUIA +21 105
#note When I played this, I could not for the life of me remember if it took the S.  That becomes important later.
>Pakorn: OTW 6F WOT +39 70
>Dave_Koenig: EEEGGHN 9I HENGE +23 128
#note Don't believe static evaluator.  GHEE$ B12 is ridiculous.
>Pakorn: AEIRU 8K AUREI +26 96
>Dave_Koenig: AEEEGOR 10A .EE +14 142
#note Similarly, static evaluator likes OGEE$ B11 here, but given how tight the board is, there's no good reason to open things up like that for him.  I dismissed REGAUGE$ for similar reasons.

#note The best bingo.

#note Pakorn taught me a new word.  It's a portmanteau of TELEvision and CINEma.
>Dave_Koenig: AKMNPYZ 12D ZAP +59 364
#note Up to this point I have been very lucky to build up a large lead.  I think I made good choices with my tiles too, but part of the luck was that my best options were all within my word knowledge.  The rest of the game is much messier, but I was just trying not to mess up a won game.  I had some margin of error, and I used it.
>Pakorn: FOX 12M FOX +26 240
>Dave_Koenig: DKMNRTY 4L KYT. +22 386
#note If I had known the word, the best way to play here by far is KYNDE in the same spot.  The key is that I want to make a play starting with K to prevent row 3 overlaps, but KYNDE is much stronger because it also takes away the HUIAS bingo hook.  I wanted to play KYNE$, but I got worried that I was remembering it wrong and decided to opt for the word I was surer of.  KYNE$ is much better because there are two unseen N's, I hold the case T for the OFT$ hook, and KYTE$ gives a front S hook, which I did not know at the time.
>Pakorn: ?CDDIIS J1 DIaCIDS +74 314
>Pakorn: ABELNSY (challenge) +10 324
#note I had already decided far in advance that if Pakorn bingoed here I was definitely going to challenge HUIAS.  After he played, I held for a while and debated whether to challenge one word or both.  DIACIDS$ is of course a word I know, and in retrospect it looks silly to me that I challenged it.  But in the heat of the moment, my memory was shaky.  I thought it was probably good, but if I'm challenging anyway it seemed silly not to challenge it, because the extra 5 points weren't likely to be a difference maker here, but letting him get away with a phony just in the case that I challenged the wrong one of the two words seemed like a huge swing against me.  Afterwards, Pakorn gave me good advice.  He said that I shouldn't have challenged both words because I was holding junk, which could allow him to get much closer in the endgame.
>Dave_Koenig: DMNNORV 2I V.N +6 392
#note I had to do something like this because of the threat of JABBLED.  Holding onto the vowel is important too so I can get rid of more of the junk later.
>Pakorn: ABELNSY N1 SLA.EY +51 375
>Pakorn: BN (challenge) +5 380
#note Another challenge, and I've given him 20 points now.  In total, it looks like I was being generous, but forgetting the history of the game, I think this challenge was quite reasonable.  I couldn't remember for sure if SLATEY$ was good, but I had already calculated that I had a won game.  All I can lose by challenging is 5 points of spread, but if the word comes off, he will probably lose around 50 points of spread.  The rest of the moves for both sides are all best.
