>James: ?MOSTUZ 8G MUT +10 10
#note Best - hold onto OSZ?, which is bound to play somehow. It's better than spending the S, blank and Z for a 50-odd scoring play like ZOOMS. 
>Danny: DNU 7F DUN +12 12
>James: ?AAORSZ J6 ZAS +38 48
#note Best. 
>Danny: COY 6E COY +23 35
>James: ?AAORRT K5 OAR +19 67
#note Quackle thinks this a statistical tie with ROAR K4 (probably because it assumes Danny will play ROAR or parallel anyway) but I prefer leaving myself the bingo lanes. After all, given my leave of ART? I think my 4-letter leave is most likely better than Danny's from COY. 
>Danny: DIU L3 DUI +10 45
>James: ?AEIRTX L7 EX +20 87
#note Best again - AIRT? is a good enough leave and the X is not likely to be played to the triple. XERIC E2 scores better and AT? is about as good, but the X invites playback. 
>Danny: AEEINOR M7 TIP +23 68
>Danny: AEEINOR --  -23 45
#note Danny realized he meant ARETE right after. 
>James: ?AINRTT M8 ITeRANT +73 160
#note The 73-point bingos (INTRANT, INTREAT, ITERANT) are all tied as best, but I preferred this one because it couldn't be pluralized. 
>Danny: AEIPRTT 13G TRIPTA.E +62 107
>James: AEIIIOS 3J OI.IA +12 172
#note Best. 
>Danny: BOO H12 B.OO +27 134
>James: EEHISVV N2 V.V +18 190
#note Bad miss - I missed EVASIVE N1. Chances are, I may have also talked myself out of plays like that or VERVE 11K or HAVE N2 because I was playing cautious about Danny having an S. I think VERVE would be my standard play, though, because most plays to the triple are not likely to hurt me that badly. EVASIVE could still lead to a triple-triple but it is also far better than VAV, I agree. 
>Danny: EFIILLT 4D FONDERs +73 207
>Danny: EFIILLT --  -73 134
#note Oh Danny. 
>James: AEGHINS O8 NEIGHS +53 243
#note It is tied at the best. HAE L12 is also tied up there because the G is likely to be useful after he plays FRONTED or something, and I will have AGINS as a leave. Same with ETH 14L for that reason. 
>Danny: ?DEFNOR 2D FRONdED +73 207
>James: AAEHIRW 1H AWARE +39 282
#note Best - the 9 points for RE is worth playing them off instead of AWA 1H. I also thought this is better because of all the Es lefti n the bag. 
>Danny: CENO 1A CONE +27 234
>James: ABHILPY L12 B.IL +24 306
#note Tied for the best with HIPPY J10. I kind of liked the leave rom this more and thought that HAPPY J10 was less likely to be blocked up (for some reason). 
>Danny: IQU J10 QUI. +35 269
>James: AAHIOPY K9 YIP +35 341
#note Best. 
>Danny: F I13 .F +10 279
>James: AAGHJOW A1 .AHOW +14 355
#note WHOOF 14E is better, from the points purpose. I was just worried about Danny bingoing on the C and catching up. CAHOW limited that kind of possibility by not giving him a triple. 
>Danny: ERS 3A .ERS +20 299
>James: AEGJLNS 9A JANGLES +77 432
#note Huh. Well, that works. I also didn't feel nervous playing it because there was no way for me to lose anymore. 
>Danny: DEEKLLM B7 LE.KED +21 320
>James: EEGT E8 G.EET +12 444
>James:  (LM) +8 452
