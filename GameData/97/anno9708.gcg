#note oh man I really really needed him to challenge. I wasn't even sure this was good but I knew I needed some kind of edge, and that was either going to be him accepting a phony or him challenging incorrectly. so it went on the board.

#note I thought my best chance was to fish for dustmen and have him block the wrong spot. and while there are plenty of wins for him even if I do draw the S because he can block, he may not see it. if he ends up playing GAE as he actually did then I might win.
