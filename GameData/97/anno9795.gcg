>Scott: ADEMNSU 10C AMEND +33 55
#note Scott said he passed up MEDUSAN because it would have given me DUTCHMEN.  He didn't play it at 9H because it would have looked like an obvious mistake.  If not, that's how I would present it.
>Joey: CEHMNTU 7G HM +24 44
#note D9 OMENTUM is better.  This play wasn't too bad, but it seemed to disease game as it progressed.
>Scott: ADEEFSU 6F FA +19 74
>Joey: CEKNNTU G10 .UNK +14 58
#note NUKE 5C looks worth the extra points.  There are plenty of E's unseeeen.
>Scott: DEEGISU 14B GUIDES +30 104

>Joey: ?EEHNOT D3 TE.H +18 91
#note No idea what to do here.  NOH 15A scores some more points, but this isn't an easy board to make an even medium sized comeback.
>Scott: ABILSWX C2 WAB +24 172
>Joey: ?ENNOOV B1 NOO +19 110
#note I didn't think of VOE in this spot.  There are no more N's, so I won't have to worry about a triplicate.

#note LIPREAD is highest scoring bingo.  Playing this game wasn't easy after 10 PM.
>Scott: ILORX K9 XI +28 282
>Joey: EGLLRRS 5H GR.LLERS +68 285
#note "85-82?", asks Scott.  I told him I was 200 off on both scores, even though 85-82 didn't feel very far off.
>Scott: ADILORR O1 ROAD. +24 306
>Joey: ADEFQRU M1 QUAR. +28 313
#note Given the unhealthy looking tile pool, QUA 3M allows me to make a shallower dive into it.
>Scott: AILORTT L10 TRAIL +12 318
>Joey: CDEFGUV 14J GU.FED +30 343
>Scott: AOT 15H TAO +12 330
#note Sometimes 477 isn't enough to win, and other times 344 is too much to overcome.  I wouldn't want this game any other way.
>Scott:  (CV) +14 344
