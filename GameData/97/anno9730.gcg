#note bizarre placement but I wanted to set up ZAP if he underlapped, in order to have something to do with my terrible rack. quackle wants it at 8H.

#note I guess I shouldn't open the board even more against isaac. but it was hard to find anything else to do. maybe idea?

#note aargh why won't my bingo playyyy and quackle likes BEGIRT. ok, sure.
>Isaac_Apindi: EO 2I OE +12 277
#note initially scored as 13
>jd: AGGILRY L8 .AGGY +26 338
#note the leave isn't great, but I was pretty seriously worried about him bingoing and I wanted to leave more tiles in the bag so I could out-in-two. quackle actually seems to agree with this notion, preferring that I actually play a tile less than I did - something like YAG at 2M. I thought I was taking out some lanes, but he has the T anyway. also, I could've considered playing GYRI at 10L as a more defensive play, but he would still have row 13.

#note ok now I am in huge trouble
>jd: FIILRRU N12 FIR +23 361
#note dear god, I only had a minute and a half to figure this out. I am not supposed to win. oddly enough, LIRI is quackle's top suggestion at N12, which I didn't see it. if I see it and he plays what he ended up playing next turn, then I lose by 1. truly bizarre. I played what I did to take out hove/move.
>Isaac_Apindi: HMNOV O1 HON +27 381
#note this is a huge error. he has at least two more turns. by playing this he actually ends up having to only play one tile next turn.
>jd: ILRU M13 LI +13 374
#note well, this is supposed to lose. but it blocks VIS and scores. so here goes nothing.
>Isaac_Apindi: MV 6D V... +7 388
#note oh man he had a winning play! all he has to do is play AM/ALME. amazing. but we had scored it wrong so it appeared to be a 1 point win...
>jd: RU 11J RU. +8 382
#note so I lost by 1. and then...
>jd:  (M) +6 388
#note we recounted. and he scored OE as 13. so we tied. the next game, isaac lost by 1. and recounted. and it turned into a tie. and then I played peter again in the last round, because he had just tied isaac and we were now the two guys with ties.
