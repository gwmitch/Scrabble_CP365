#note Q doesn't like this.  I want it open.  Static suggests FLOG.

#note VIB(R)IO would be interesting to see what he'd do.  He's been playing awfully agressively (for him) anyway.  VIT(R)IC, though 2nd statically, is the star play, I think.  I just couldn't come up with it, settled with COB, 3rd, and the horrible VIIT leave.

#note Wow.

#note 2nd static to P(R)IVITY for 25.  *shrug*

#note Here it comes...
>Ryan_Fischer: EIKNOPT H1 KOP.E +60 231
#note Now THAT was satisfying.  Almost as good: INK(J)ET for 61.  He complemented me before laying down a monster of his own...

#note AM(Y)LOgEN, (C)OrNMEAL and (C)OLuMNEA also play!

#note I was kicking myself all the way home for having thought I missed NITRILES, only now relieved to see it didn't quite fit.  I always have trouble with racks like this, and they're crucial.  It's probably where I lost the game, not leaving myself with a vowel.  I wanted to keep threatening as much as I could.  Champ suggests 12L NIL 16, which looks okay.  I thought with 5 Es, 3As, some Os and Is, this'd be fine.
