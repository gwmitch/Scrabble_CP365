#note she put it down, picked it up for a minute or tow and put it back down. it's collins. there are no bingos in ours.

#note quackle actually likes ETYMA best. I thought that playing QATS to block the most glaring bingo line would be right, but she's quite likely to bingo anyway and quackle seems to argue that I just end up limiting my own opportunities.

#note missing gelatis - I guess it's a good thing I didn't play QAT at N6

#note this ended up being the play that cost me the game. I had UNBAN to close column O but I concluded that this was a more dangerous spot for her to use. As it turns out she had a very unusual leave - CC?. also this play is very bad - NUBIA in the same spot would be a great improvement.

#note what else? quackle says KUNA at H12 may be better since it doesn't give up a big play on the triple.

#note I was fishing for saturnine, but shantung is in there too, which I realized a turn or two later. the h was actually in the bag too. not sure if any of quackle's estimates are really trustworthy given that she will be blocking.
