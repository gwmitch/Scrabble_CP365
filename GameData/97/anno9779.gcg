>Ryan_Fischer: ACIMRRX 8G RAX +20 20
#note Couldn't decide between MICRA and RAX.  You don't get much from spending the X to open, but it's a bit easier to bingo, of course.
>John_Luebkemann: EGILR 9H LIGER +19 19
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CEIMNR K6 ENd.RMIC +72 92
#note Well, that worked.  No 2x2s, but I missed NuMERIC(AL) for 89, and MINCERs for 78.  Thisz 3rd.
>John_Luebkemann: AENO J3 AEON +10 29
>Ryan_Fischer: HLNNOUV 3I H.LON +24 116
#note Such an ugly rack.  This or HON looks okay.
>John_Luebkemann: AQT 10F QAT +35 64
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGNPUV L2 V.GUE +21 137
#note Not playing DUP.  Want to save the P to hit that spot later, maybe through the V I play.  UPD(I)VE looks pretty great though.
>John_Luebkemann: EF L11 EF +24 88
>Ryan_Fischer: DINOPPT 11E PITON +31 168
#note Quite happy with this.
>John_Luebkemann: EJST 12D JEST +41 129
>Ryan_Fischer: BDELPTZ 4H ZE. +27 195
#note Wow, I really missed ZEP/PAEON after holding onto it for that long.  Still being greedy where it didn't really count.
>John_Luebkemann: FHO M12 FOH +27 156
#note Guess he has an N, else he'd play it at 13C.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BDLOPT 13C BOD +27 222
#note Still keeping the P.
>John_Luebkemann: DNRSY 15K RYNDS +49 205
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ILLOPT O8 hILLTOP. +80 302
#note Well, that was fortunate.  Would've had to find POLLIsT 2C otherwise.
>John_Luebkemann: BER 14B REB +26 231
>Ryan_Fischer: AAGIMVW 5E VIGA +27 329
>John_Luebkemann: DEENRST 2C TENDERS +68 299
>Ryan_Fischer: AEMTWWY 1A WYE +29 358
#note No real way to hit 1A-1D without losing a W, so I settled with this.  TEAM is an option.  WAME underneath would work.
>John_Luebkemann: AU 2L .AU +14 313
