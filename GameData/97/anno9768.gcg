>Steven: DELT 8G DELT +10 10
>Richard_Spence: CGHLRSS -CGHLS +0 0
#note Apparently L(E)GS or G(E)LS H7 5 is much better than exchanging CGHLS.
>Steven: DEIRSTV 9B STRIVED +70 80
#note Opponent should've played it at K8.
>Richard_Spence: AAAIMRS K5 AMIA +18 18
#note Well, there goes MA(L)ARIAS. I noticed MAIASAUR but no U's on the board...darn.
>Steven: ELLOR D4 ROLLE. +14 94
>Richard_Spence: AEIIQRS 8A QI +35 53
#note Obviously the best play (by a long shot)
>Steven: ABEU L3 BEAU +18 112
>Richard_Spence: AEIORST J8 .OASTIER +62 115
#note Sucks that (T)OASTIER is the only bingo.
>Steven: IKN 15H KI.N +24 136
>Richard_Spence: BHINTTY 5C B.THY +26 141
#note He blocks my BI(R)TH...apparently THY M1 is slightly better than B(O)THY.
>Steven: LOX M2 LOX +37 173
>Richard_Spence: ?AEIINT 11D rAINIE.T +78 219
#note TENIA(S)Is wins style points.
>Steven: ADY N1 DAY +26 199
>Richard_Spence: DEEGPPR 13I P.PED +26 245
#note Wasn't 100% sure on G(I)PPED.
>Steven: AEOZ 12B ZOEA +30 229
>Richard_Spence: ?EGHIRW B7 W..H +18 263
#note I didn't want to open another S hook with WIG or HEW...should've done (Z)IG.
>Steven: ARW 13A RAW +33 262
>Richard_Spence: ?EGIIRS M7 RInGSI.E +60 323
#note I think I blew this move by playing RInGSI(D)E. SEI scored 36 and kept the blank, but at least I get to play 14B later.
>Steven: AENOSTU O2 SOUTANE +86 348
#note Ouch.
>Richard_Spence: CEGMNOR 14B GNOME +52 375
#note Wow, GENOM. I suck at this game.
>Steven: CEJOOUU C3 JO. +26 374
>Richard_Spence: CCFNNRU 12L F.RN +26 401
#note Even though Quackle likes FUR N6 33, I didn't play it because opponent had F(I)VE 12L. I couldn't really do much with two C's, which cost me the game. F(I)RN is second best according to Quackle.
>Steven: EFGOUV F2 VUG. +19 393
#note This play killed my game. C(OR) followed by CUN(T) is dead.
>Richard_Spence: CCNU H6 CU.. +7 408
#note Wow, (E)CU M14. Still wouldn't make much difference.
>Steven: EFO 15D FE +22 415
#note Misses EF N5 28.
>Richard_Spence: CN 8M .C. +5 413
>Steven: O 4F .O +8 423
>Steven:  (N) +2 425
#note Oops, opponent scored incorrectly for VUG(H) and we ended up 424-413.
