>Richard_Spence: ADEINOS -O +0 0
#note Yup, I exchanged O. Lewis would definitely know ANODISE* is no good.
>Lewis: BEW 8G WEB +16 16
>Richard_Spence: ADEHINS I8 .ANISHED +69 69
#note The only bingo.
>Lewis: EZ 15G ZE. +39 55
>Richard_Spence: AEGOOOY 10F GOO.Y +21 90
#note ZE(D) blocks my GOO(D)Y. I play GOO(N)Y instead. (H)OOEY and OOGE(N)Y are slightly better.
>Lewis: NTX 14H N.XT +29 84
>Richard_Spence: AEFNOPS 11E FOP +23 113
#note Best play in terms of rack balance.
>Lewis: AILNV 15K ANVIL +29 113
#note Blocks my APNEA :(
>Richard_Spence: AAAENPS 13H A.A +18 131
#note A(H)A is the best play. Too bad ANAP(H)ASE doesn't fit...
>Lewis: EL M13 LE. +12 125
>Richard_Spence: AAENPSS 12I .PAS +24 155
#note Darn, didn't know PAESANS was good. I knew PAESANOS, that was it.
>Lewis: B K11 B. +8 133
>Richard_Spence: ADEENOS 12C ODEA +19 174
#note Wow, I keep failing. ADENOSE(S). Time to study.
>Lewis: GT C11 G.T +8 141
>Richard_Spence: AEMNORS O8 SERMONA. +83 257
>Richard_Spence: AEMNORS --  -83 174
#note This was an embarrasing play. I saw ENAMORS and MOANERS, but I thought SERMONAL* was valid (I had also known ALMONERS). The game goes way downhill for me after this point.
>Lewis: ISV J6 VIS +23 164
#note Opponent made sure O(V)ERMANS didn't fit.
>Richard_Spence: AEMNORS 14M .M +16 190
#note Leave is AENORS...
>Lewis: CEIILRT E11 ..R +6 170
>Richard_Spence: AELNORS 7F LO +9 199
#note No playable bingos, I'm screwed.
>Lewis: EIILNRT 6A LINTIER +71 241
#note Ouch.
>Richard_Spence: AAEENRS A6 .EA +9 208
#note I saw ARSENA(T)E and SERENA(T)A but neither fit.
>Lewis: ?DEIOTU C1 OUTlI.ED +68 309
#note I noticed I blocked OUTwI(L)ED A1.
>Richard_Spence: AEGNRSU 1C .URANG +24 232
#note I give up.
>Lewis: EY 2F YE +28 337
>Richard_Spence: CEFHRRS 14D FEH +24 256
#note Probably shouldn't have done FEH, oh well.

>Lewis: ?AIKNQR E5 Q. +22 359
>Richard_Spence: CIKMRRS B5 K.R +16 272
#note Quackle says R(U)M 2B 14 is slightly better, but I didn't like opening an A or D hook. K(I)R is second best.
>Lewis: JN 2B J.N +22 381
>Richard_Spence: CIMRSTW 3F SWIM +32 304
#note Best play.
>Lewis: CDEIIRU 4H DUI +15 396
>Richard_Spence: ?CERRTT 15A CoRE +24 328
#note I finally drew the blank, but neither CRiTTER nor RETRaCT were playable.
>Lewis: ACEIOOU 2I ECU +16 412
>Richard_Spence: RTT B14 T. +2 330
#note Wow, didn't see T(ROW). But who cares.
>Lewis: AIOO 3A OO. +12 424
>Richard_Spence: RT K1 R.T +3 333
#note Meh, terrible game. I should've simply played MOANERS, then the game would've been far different.
>Richard_Spence:  (AI) +4 337
