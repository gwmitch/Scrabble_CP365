>Jim_Burlant: AEEHIPU 8G HUE +12 12
#note Q prefers 8G PIU by nearly 3 points.  Really?  Keep dupe E's with 10 still unseen?  No thanks.
>Mike_Early: DEIK J8 DIKE +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIIOP 9A EPInAOI +66 78
#note Despite the dangerous board position, bingoing is best - the kibbitzer doesn't show a single non-bingo option that scores more than 12 points.
>Mike_Early: EIJNN A4 JINNE. +63 90
>Jim_Burlant: AACIQSY -  +0 78
#note As much as I harp on myself about my word knowledge, I've been through the 6-letter J words a few times and am pretty comfortable with that list.  I'd never seen JINNEE played, and this just looked flat out wrong, so I challenged.  This decision may have been the game.  Assuming that I didn't blow my turn, looking at these options, I'd have probably put down QI 8C even not knowing his rack.  If I don't lose the turn challenging and he doesn't get his bingo down this coming turn, who knows what would have happened?
>Mike_Early: EEIIRTV D6 REI.VITE +72 162
>Jim_Burlant: AACIQSY 14B QIS +35 113
#note Now no choice but to burn the S if I want to unload the Q.  Interestingly, Q says I should play for board position by playing at 12H.  No matter, I'm winning 16%.
>Mike_Early: IMRY K11 MIRY +26 188
>Jim_Burlant: AACGNOY C3 YOGA +18 131
#note Missing the Y back hook to DIKE, and whiffing on CYANO.  Yuck.
>Mike_Early: EFLW D1 FLEW +43 231
>Jim_Burlant: ACELNOO 1D .OCAL +30 161
#note Whiffing on ECOTONAL, not that it would have helped a whole lot.  This or FLACON are the two best non bingo options.
>Mike_Early: ?AEINSV 2H INVAdES +88 319
>Jim_Burlant: AELNOOP 13I PO.NO +20 181
#note Too worried about keeping the board alive to find the best plays.  1K NOPAL and OPAL look right.  This gives up too much for the sake of rack grooming.
>Mike_Early: AGM 14H GAM. +30 349
>Jim_Burlant: ABCDELU M2 .DUCABLE +82 263
#note At least I salvage some dignity and make *one* good play this game.  This is the only bingo, and it wins 1%.
>Mike_Early: BRSTU N10 BURST +34 383
>Jim_Burlant: AADFOST 15E FADO +33 296
>Mike_Early: ERTT O8 TRET +18 401
>Jim_Burlant: AGLSTTW C13 W.T +22 318
>Mike_Early: EX 10D .EX +56 457
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLOST M11 GO. +10 328
#note Blocking LATIGOES on row 12.  Aaaaargh!
>Mike_Early: ADHRZ 6J HAZ.RD +29 486
#note Was expecting to play ASTERNAL as an out bingo and missed an out bingo of STERNAL.  Annotation ends here.  I should have lost this game 423 - 486, but I just gave up a turn too soon.  Final score 353 - 495.
