>Lewis: DEENOT 4D DENOTE +23 116
>Richard_Spence: GLLNRST A10 G.LL +6 151

>Lewis: EH 5D EH +23 139
>Richard_Spence: CNORRST M3 CORNS +29 180

#note Best play, even though it leaves RRT.
>Lewis: EZ 13A .EZ +24 177
>Richard_Spence: GNRRSTT -GNRT +0 208

>Richard_Spence: ?AIORST 14B SAuTOIR +81 289
#note Either TAIlORS, SAuTOIR, SATORIs or RATIOnS. No 9's through the N_E on column B.

>Richard_Spence: EEILTUV H12 VI.L +33 322
#note Quackle likes EVITE 15H 33. I played VI(R)L instead of VE(R)T simply because there were a ton of I's unseen.
>Lewis: DEGGP M9 P.GGED +28 220
>Richard_Spence: AEEFOTU 11K FU. +26 348

>Lewis: CNORT D7 CORN.T +18 238
>Richard_Spence: AEEFOTY 1N YE +20 368
#note I play YE 1N 20 simply to block the O-column. FOY 3C. Darn.
>Lewis: AIJ 8A JIA. +33 271
>Richard_Spence: ?AEFIOT I13 FE +25 393
#note Quackle thinks (G)O 10A 9 is better than FE I13 25, interesting.
>Lewis: AEIINTX 2C XENIA +19 290
#note XENIA was interesting...IXT(L)E 15E 31 was the best play in this position.
