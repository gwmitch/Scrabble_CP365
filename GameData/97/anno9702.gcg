#note unfortunately, i missed MOONPEA here. still, this is second best.
>joe: AHJ 7H HAJ +33 33
>cesar: AAENQTY 9F QANAT +43 59
#note 6F QAT is also worth thinking about, but i thought the difference was greater than it actually is. my move is only like 0.5 better or so.

#note ot L11 YARER looks interesting too for 35.. i prefer my move.

>cesar: AGINORV K4 VAGI +30 122
#note chickening out on HONG is bad. i really should know the 4s. the chances of GRAVITON staying were probably pretty low, but the board is already annoying and i'm down. this happened last time i played him too. the simple 12K TO sims best though, keeping a leave that will work with a large range of letters and taking a scoring spot. of course, that is predicated upon me not chickening out on HONG. i suck. (-6)
>joe: AV 4K .AV +18 160
>cesar: CFNORST L3 F.NOS +28 150
#note i'm aware that joe edley will outplay me if i do this to the board, but i'll probably need some luck too after his second-turn subtone. grumble. 12K TON sims better, but sheesh, that leave. (-2)
>joe: EFIRS 10E FIRES +41 201
>cesar: CDIIRTT E10 .RITT +16 166
#note now i'm putting it in the hands of the tile gods but i really have no other choice. maybe just FRIT? (-0.5)
>joe: EELR M2 LE.ER +33 234
>cesar: CDEIORT 12K .OTED +38 204
#note i have to be doing something wrong when my bingos don't fit anywhere. i wanted to keep the C and also score. TOTED is good, but i think its problem is giving him a fairly easy lane and not keeping that great of a leave. i'm really not sure that 12K TO is better though.  1K DICOT is the other move i could have done -- i wanted to go for the C bingo and score now too. (-0.7)
>joe: EGMSU 15A GEUMS +42 276
#note so much for trying to get lucky
>cesar: ABCINRW 1M CAW +35 239
>joe: EILOPT O6 PILOTE. +30 306
>cesar: BDHINNR 12D B.NDI +18 257
#note not sure what to do here. the lane at 15 is extremely unlikely to stay, so i didn't see much of a point to fishing for the -ING bingo. quackle prefers HIND and BIND by win percentage, but my move has the most 'equity', whatever that means. (-1%)
>joe: AIW 13B WAI. +18 324
>cesar: EEHNNRY 2M .YE +27 284
#note yet another bingo that doesn't fit. this was probably a mistake, though. if i'm going for the miracle blank bingo next turn i need to keep the best possible leave. that's why G12 DYNE is better. it also sets up EH if i don't bingo next turn. (-0.5) 
>joe: GLO B10 GLO. +12 336
>cesar: EEHNNRZ N7 HEN +15 299
#note A11 EH has much higher valuation, but i correctly deduced HEN was going to win more. i just need some luck.
>joe: UU 11A U.U +3 339
#note this was bad for me. i was counting on him having horrible endgame tiles.
>cesar: ?EEINRZ 6F ZEp +38 337
#note quackle likes N1 AYE best, but suggests nothing wins. the only thing i saw was fishing off the I and hoping for REZONEs. but that will lose to D(AMAS)K anyway.  i wish i'd drawn the blank a turn earlier.
