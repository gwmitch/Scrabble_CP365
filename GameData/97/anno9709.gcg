#note i am not sure if this was my exact rack. NSTTVU plus a 7th. i think it was a consonant so i wasn't terribly crazy about this, and i'm fairly sure it was the H. i'm also pretty sure i chickened out on UNVEXT.  (or wrongly evaluated it?) (-6)

#note the most annoying thing is that i saw GUSTABLE immediately after placing this rack into quackle. i guess i just don't look or am unable to maintain focus for more than a few games straight. after playing for more than 6 years i really need to find a way to work through that. (-53)

>alex_j: ?AEHINR A8 .ANIsHER +86 324
#note and here i was blaming luck, after missing SHUTDOWN and GUSTABLE early to put this game nearly out of reach. ugh.
