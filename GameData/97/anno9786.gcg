>Mike_Early: CEHHINR -CEHH +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: AEFOOSW 8G WOOF +20 20
#note Hmm.  Q prefers the 8F placement by roughly 1/4% and 1/2 point.
>Mike_Early: IWZ 7I WIZ +33 33
>Jim_Burlant: ABEINRS K5 BI. +28 48
#note So much for BARONIES/SEAROBIN.  No-brainer best play, but with unexpected consequences.
>Mike_Early: AAEILPR 5F PAIRA.LE +62 95
#note And the man who Orry Swift has dubbed the, "King of the Plausible Phony" strikes again.  I was too preocuppied with where to play my own bingo to pay more attention and realize this was phony.
>Jim_Burlant: AEILNRS 6B NAILERS +71 119
#note I felt it was worth giving up the 4 points on the scoreboard to not give up easy comebacks at 8A.  Q disagrees, docking me 4 points to 9C ALINERS.
>Mike_Early: DEO 9G ODE +22 117
>Jim_Burlant: DHPRTUV C2 PRUT.H +30 149
#note Q prefers PURDAH by roughly 1/2 point.   I prefer this, as it doesn't potentially give back an S hook for a gimme play at 8A like EASY, FISH, etc.
>Mike_Early: BOT 4H BOT +20 137
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEGHLV M1 HELV. +22 171
#note No idea why on earth I couldn't think of VUGH, which was very clearly the play.   And I couldn't remember if HELVE took the D (it does).  HELVED sims respectably, though VUGH is best.  This is poor.
>Mike_Early: EX 1M .EX +39 176
>Jim_Burlant: ?AACDGI 2J CAG.D +36 207
#note No bingos play here, and this is best.
>Mike_Early: LNNOY F9 NYLON +21 197
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAIMRU B4 MA.UbRIA +72 279
#note Best bingo, winning 86% in a short sim.  Other options:  MANURIAL (blank L), and 14F and 10I sAMURAI.
>Mike_Early: JSSTU 14B JUSTS +39 236
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEITT D10 CITE. +14 293
#note Bad, bad, bad.  So concerned with interfering with bingo lines that I wasn't looking at the board.  Of all the choices, 2B APIECE and A1 CITE look best.  While this makes it marginally tougher for him to bingo, my lead isn't big enough to be dicking around for so few points.
>Mike_Early: AIKV A1 KIVA +42 278
#note Just desserts.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEMTU 2A .M.UTED +28 321
#note Not sure I wrote this rack correctly.  Was going after turnover to land a blank or S.  Q prefers a cool play that doesn't turn too many tiles:  (WOOF)ED 8G 30.
>Mike_Early: EFGIITY -EFGII +0 278
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEFSY 1F FAY +35 356
#note Looking at this pool, with only one unseen A and a bunch of E's unseen, I wonder now if I should have played the E and kept the A. Regardless, Q says this is best, winning 99.8%.
>Mike_Early: EEGNORR 11F .ERGERON +68 346
#note The phony king strikes again.   I *should* have recognized this as ERELONG + R (ERELONG only makes 8's with D and I) and challenged this nonsense off the board so I could play LIoNISED 11F.  My gut said that limburger smelled better than this play and I was pretty sure it was bad.  But there was that smidgen of doubt.  And between my rack of DEIINS? and the unseen AEGNOOQT, I figured that the only way to lose the game was to lose the challenge, so I let it slide.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIINS 11A N. +2 358
#note Having burned 9 minutes off my clock deciding whether or not to risk challenging, I didn't have the time to find ShIN(N)IED. Given that Mike drew 7 from AEGNOOQT, he almost certainly has the Q.  If he's left the Q in the bag, I can block the obvious QAT 10A for cheap, leaving 1 in the bag and forcing him to respect the Q.  If I draw the Q, I have S? in my rack for SuQ 6M.  If Mike gets it, I have now limited him to either dumping the Q at K1 for 12 points or making a setup play to unload the Q while I outrun him and go out first.  I felt that this guaranteed the win.  At the time, my mindset was that in a short tournament the win was the first priority.  Q doesn't like this, but it got the job done.
>Mike_Early: GO 10L GO +8 354
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEEIIS H11 .IDES +21 379
#note LOL.  Missing DEI(ON)IzES.  Of course, if I hadn't burned my clock down to under 30 seconds before letting him get away with the most ridiculous phony he's played on me to this point, I wouldn't be in this position.
>Mike_Early: AENOQT 9K QAT +21 375
>Jim_Burlant: ?EI 13H .IrE +5 384
>Jim_Burlant:  (ENO) +6 390
