#note Quackle likes ZAX or AZO most, which I can't fault. The points are certainly more attractive than my play. Mine is in the third tier of plays with ZOON H6 and H7 among others, after the aforementioned and AZON 7I. I had won so I thought to try something different where my A could be used next turn. I also thought that if I got lucky, Ed would not have the right letters on ZOO and thus potentially exchange because of how tricky the board actually is to play on overall. 

If I thought about it again, I may have played ZAX to see what Ed would do in response. SNORE isn't a bad leave anyway. AZO is attractive too, because it opens up many possible bingo lanes for the future. 
>Ed: EJST 10F JEST +40 66
#note This is the big danger with my play. After this, trying to make good openings is tough, since I've just thrown away my O. 

>James: ABELNRS I6 LA. +23 35
#note BAZOOS H5 is a great possibility since it plays off the B. Quackle does favor RAX I6 first, then LAX, which is a bit surprising given how much the R is usually taken over the L. Both are fairly okay because they do score and I have tricky plays. EN G10 is also an interesting choice as an opener. 

Note that after JEST, with this rack I'm already only a less than 40% chance to win the game according to Quackle. This is a good lesson on how to not box yourself in in the start with an overly cutesy play. 
>Ed: ?AEIOOR -?AE +0 66
>James: BEELNRS F10 .EBEL +16 51
#note I couldn't figure out what to do, since I wanted to play off the B and open up. Quackle favors this most. 
>Ed: ?EEEMRT 14B REME.TEd +68 134
>James: AINRRSW E11 WAR. +30 81
#note Well, this was tough. I wasn't sure what to do, but I thought to leave 15A open as much as possible and as such play WARE E11. Also, this creates another bingo lane parallel, which I thought one of my best ways to get into the game. 

Quackle likes WREN H12 most, which makes some sense because it scores better and leaves a slightly better leave (AIRS v INRS) but only slightly; after that are WARE - E11 and 13C in a dead heat. My thought was that since I didn't have anything great at 15H (and I also didn't see WREN), I may as well try to build up a 15A counterplay if I could get one. 
>Ed: AFMO 15H FOAM +43 177
>James: AIINNRS D11 ANI.I +35 116
#note Best. 
>Ed: DOU J4 UDO +10 187
#note In retrospect, DUO 13H is a lot better for Ed, because this  creates unnecessary openings. For some reason, Quackle likes OUD 9D the most, though I don't because it opens up more easy spots for me to score/open the board. DUO doesn't do anything new that FOAM didn't already. 
>James: EHKNPRS C13 H.P +34 150
#note Again, best. With luck, my plays have started to really pay dividends. After HEP I can play KEPIS 15A next turn for another 43 at the least, so in 4 turns I have gotten around 130-140 points (or 3 medium plays and a small bingo). 
>Ed: EINR 7H ..NIER +21 208
>James: EIKNRSS L9 SINKERS +85 235
#note Best. 
>Ed: HU K3 UH +10 218
#note Ed has to make openings, and depending on his other tiles (I'm guessing he has a D at this point too), this is not a bad play at all. 
>James: DILNOTY 2K DOILY +25 260
#note If I am right in guessing Ed has a D, a play like DOTY or DOILY 2K is a strategic block of his plays, and are both fairly okay. I picked DOILY because I thought he was not likely to have a bingo through a Y and wanted to run out the bag as fast as possible. Had UH not been played (and I think he had a D for sure or 5 good tiles, because the play scores so little for an H, which is a fairly easy tile to score with and HO/HE K4 would keep him in the game anyway) I would've palyed YOND 9C.

Quackle also likes DOILY/DOTY best with my inference.  
>Ed: GI 14L .IG +8 226
#note Hmm... either he's signalling he has other good tiles or he has terrible ones. I am betting the former, because it's not that hard to think of him having some kind of -YING 5 letter play or GYRI O1 or something along those lines. Plus, if my guess on UH is right he likes to fish when he feels he is down by too much to make up, even if the game is just 42 points in margin. 
>James: DEENNTY 9A YENNED +27 287
#note I wasn't too sure of TYNE O1 (which Ed told me wasn't good but actually is), but I was thinking of playing DYNE O1 anyway. Then I thought if he played RIG I am likely to see some kind of bingo along the O column that I can't block anyway; even YENNED O2, the best defensive play, can't stop everything (since there are so many Ts in the bag I thought he had a good chance at an -ST bingo). 

So, putting him on DS, I decided to play something totally random and play YENNED 9A for some points. If I am right in guessing he will bingo anyway, I will have at least a few places to play a counter-score. However, I am not evaluating this right as it is - if he does bingo, we both have a Y to a tyiple and he has a bingo on me, meaning he will likely end up leading after the next sequence of plays. As such, I think TYNE O1 is the best option followed with a potential DJEBEL play. Thay being said, I also missed TEPID 15A for the best scoring play!

Quackle likes TEPID or TYNED 9B/O1 most. YENNED is quite a bit back, after many other plays, including YENNED 11J even. 
>Ed: ?AACELU C3 ACAULi.E +70 296
#note Ed tricked me! I was so sure he had tiles he didn't. but then, a blank is the other item I suspected anyway... 
>James: AGIOTTW A5 WITT. +33 320
#note It's a tossup between this and TOWY A6 for best play - mine scores 3 more but TOWY leavest a better leave. However, there being an S and a B in the bag, I thought to go for one of them - the S at the bottom right, the B at the top left. Quackle agrees that these two are the best plays but prefers TOWY more. 
>Ed: AIORV N10 VIRA.O +18 314
#note A pretty big indication he didn't have an S this time...
>James: ABCGOPT 1M TAB +40 360
#note Best. 
>Ed: AGINRSU 3A GU.RANIS +60 374
#note With most bingos at this point, I should be finished, but...
>James: CDGOOPT K6 P.COT +18 378
#note I'm not. The leftover EFQ means all I need is an out in two to win. Anything that restricts it such that he has to play a Q in one spot means he can't play EF 10B with impunity. 
>Ed: EFQ G2 Q. +11 385
