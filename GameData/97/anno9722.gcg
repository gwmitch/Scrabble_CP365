#note Leesa said she tunneled on the front hook and forgot about LEGs.
>dacrON: ?EFITWZ 5E F.ITZEs +72 84
#note Quackle says E4 WEFT for 36. I think my play is better simply because of board position.  IZ? is all well and good, but this board could get ugly fast. I like keeping pace here.

#note Clearly I knew that would happen.

#note (F)OX E5 sims best. I kinda want to dump the U, but points are points.
>Leesa: AILNTTU 3B ANTI.ULT +74 221
#note Nice play!

>dacrON: AEEMORV 13I VE.OM +28 404
#note This play looks alright to me. Quackle suggests VA(L)E(T) H1 or VE(N)OMER 13I. I think my play leaves the least chance for things to "get interesting".

#note (H)ERL is ever so slightly better per Quackle.

>dacrON: LLOPRST 12E P.LL +10 485
#note Some wicked cool stuff can happen in this endgame. TR(U)LL is the best play, which I saw, but held back on jussssst incase DIPAR(T)ED* was good. Didn't know STULL. I figured I'd be good with getting TORS(I) to go out, but unless I make TR(U)LL or ST(U)LL, Leesa actually breaks even in this endgame - potentially T-sticking me in one case.
>Leesa: ADDEIPR N14 AD +13 425
#note Blocking TORS(I) is best by far.
