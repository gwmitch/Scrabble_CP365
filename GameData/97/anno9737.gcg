#note I thought of the word COLLETS as being something feasible, but I've never seen it, so I withheld. 407 iterations later, CLOSET N10 would have been the best out of words I know. This was sixth, including collets

#note Dear Jason,
You really like to exchange, don't you?
Sincerely, Ted.
Also, if you're going to exchange, why keep the O?
>Ted_Barrett: ?CDEGST N6 GE.D +10 160
#note Second best. GEDS N10 was better. I assume because it kills that lane for Jason. .7%

#note "Aw, you blocked my alley"
Le fish
>Ted_Barrett: ?CLOSTU F2 CLOUT +21 181
#note Brutal fail on my part - LOCUSTS, CONSULT, among others. This was the best non-bingo, though that's not very reassuring.

#note LEsIONED, anyone?
>Ted_Barrett: ?AAAFRS O1 FA +26 207
#note Epic rack. WHOA second best play was (C)ARA(PAX) THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOOOOO COOL. This was third - FAS would have been the right move.

#note Glad he kept it. JARRINGS* seemed like it would be good. LOL it fit on the top line. AlASTOR 1G

>Ted_Barrett: EIILQRY 1C QI +16 301
#note Le Fail - 12A QI was the better QI. Best was 1G Riley, which I don't know. Fourth.

>Ted_Barrett: EFILNRY 10D FEY +37 338
