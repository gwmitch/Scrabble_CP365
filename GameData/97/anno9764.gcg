>cesar: EEIIRRS 14A RISE +27 188
#note SHEESH. am i just completely blind? 3J FIRER is far and away the best move here... or maybe 14I RERISE. i am bad when i'm on edge, which i was during this game because of THEY/ZYME/what i perceived to be continuous bad luck. i think i had a severe blank shortage at this point and was letting it get to me. lesson for the future, huh.

#note yes, yes, we all saw 15J DID. it's not the right move. he closes the final lane and the game is over. dammit quackle, why can't you sim correctly sometimes?
