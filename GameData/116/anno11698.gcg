#note Speedy player puts ESS at 13.3, EISS as 12.2, and AESS at 11.8. I know Is are better bingo tiles than As, but it's just too tempting to keep the A when there is the prospect of drawing II, IY, IU, IW, or something like that. Apparently you bingo about the same % of the time with AESS and ESS, but EISS bingos nearly 5% more often.

#note :( Missed (A)BAcUSES. I didn't look for long enough this turn. All of the 74 point bingos are out of my range.
>Vera_Bigall: EGIILNT 11D LINGIE.T +86 100
>Jackson_Smylie: EEEIKLU 10B KUE +19 91
#note Wow I just completely whiffed long words here. UKUE(L)E and UKE(L)ELE are very good, and EEL(L)IKE is better than my play. KUE is best out of the rest of the lot. I assume EKUELE is an alternate form of EKPWELE?

>Jackson_Smylie: EEMNOQT H10 Q. +11 136
#note I played this because of just not seeing anything else. M2 NOME and TOME are a lot better.

>Vera_Bigall: DDI N10 DID +21 173
>Jackson_Smylie: EEGNNRY L12 YEN +28 251
#note This play is a product of my lack of 4s knowledge and bad thinking. I didn't know YENS was valid, and didn't consider the H hook on YOD to be a huge deal. In reality YEN only sets up a better S hook than demeton and ed offer. Something like EYNE 012 could be better, but I suppose YEN is OK (assuming I know YENS is valid).
>Vera_Bigall: AEINRST 15I RETSINA +82 255
>Jackson_Smylie: AEGLNOR -  +0 251
#note I need to learn my fours. If I was any less than 90% sure YEN didn't take an S, I wouldn't have challenged, as she has many places to play. 
>Vera_Bigall: ABJU 14F JUBA +31 286
>Jackson_Smylie: AEGLNOR M3 GO +12 263
#note I didn't know (K)ALONG. I didn't really know how to play this turn, none of the leaves I can keep are amazing, especially with a board primarily friendly to S bingos. I didn't want to fish off one, I wanted a decent leave and not to fall too far behind. M3 ROE is probably better. I missed L(EN)O/(EN)OL at 13K. 
>Vera_Bigall: CHORT O6 TORCH +37 323
>Jackson_Smylie: AELLNOR 15E LO +11 274
#note I didn't see any good way to open the board so I have to hope for an S or for a bingo in the 7 row, and I feel LO holds one of the best leaves possible and scores averagely. I assume 15C LENO and 15B LLANO are to get the ? or S.
>Vera_Bigall: IPZ 7F ZIP +25 348
>Jackson_Smylie: AAAELNR 14N AA +10 284
#note 13G NALA or B9 A(K)ELA are probably better for turnover.
>Vera_Bigall: UVW -UVW +0 348
>Jackson_Smylie: AAELNRX 13A LAX +38 322
#note I debated between LAX and AX for a while, and I think LAX is better because I don't need as much volatility after scoring close to 40 points, I can hope she doesn't score to much on the spot and try to inch my way up, and LAX plays an extra tile.
>Vera_Bigall: EOR 14B ROE +20 368
>Jackson_Smylie: AEINRUV 2L VAU +16 338
#note I really didn't like this play but I didn't see much better. UN(ZIP) looks kind of cool, and 13H AVE looks right. I didn't think this through clearly enough.
>Vera_Bigall: EPSY O1 ESPY +46 414
#note I guess I was hoping to pull something in that triple spot. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EINRRV I13 V.. +10 348
#note My only shot at winning at this point is bingoing, and the only possible places to play it are to the C and through the K. I didn't see any one or two tile fishes (preferably one) that bingoed to the C or K, except for the phoney REDRIN(K)S*. I felt if I got the D and played REDRIN(K)S* she would probably not challenge as it wouldn't put me back in the game enough. There is also the possibility she doesn't challenge and miraculously screws up the endgame giving me the win. I didn't think I could have a great shot at winning but I had to hope. IR(K) sims best but that is the fault in simulation appearing.
>Vera_Bigall: W 13K W.. +6 420
>Jackson_Smylie: ?DEINRR B4 REDRIN.s +66 414
#note Yayyy was that a 1/10 shot? It cuts my spread at least.
>Vera_Bigall: AEIMNRT A1 MITER +29 449
#note She spent a long time one this turn, as anyone would, starting to doubt validities of words when the game is on this play.
