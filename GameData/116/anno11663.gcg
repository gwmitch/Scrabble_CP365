>Meredith_Leigh: DENPTU 8D PUNTED +24 24
>Avery_Mojica: AEESVVW H4 WEAV. +15 15
#note I thought WAVE is bad... It opens the triple. This is bad too, but i don't care.
>Meredith_Leigh: EHIL 4H .HILE +22 46
>Avery_Mojica: ADENSTV 9H DEV +25 40
#note Didn't know WHILED was good. I didn't think there were any hooks for it.
>Meredith_Leigh: AEIORST M3 ORATISE +80 126
>Meredith_Leigh: AEIORST --  -80 46
#note She didn't know that there were no sevens in this rack. I found all 5 playable eights.
>Avery_Mojica: AAFINST F6 FA. +14 54
#note However, most of my finds were post-game. I saw SENORITA and NOTARIES during the game. This play blocked it off. I saw FANTASIA and thought it was a proper noun, being a movie by Disney (a movie which I happen to not like).
>Meredith_Leigh: AEIORST 9C OI +7 53
#note She didn't see VOTARIES either.
>Avery_Mojica: AEINSTU D8 ..U +5 59
#note Knowing she had a good rack (currently only knowing she had AERST), I didn't want to risk opening up the Triple-Triple lanes with my bingos. And I didn't know WHILES was good.
>Meredith_Leigh: ABELRST K6 BLASTER +76 129
#note There wasn't an triple-triple if I played at 10A. If I had played SINUATE at K9, she could have played ARBELEST. That's the only way though. She didn't know BLASTER at M1 (WHILES got the best of us) and she missed STABLER at 3I.
>Avery_Mojica: X -X +0 59
#note Missed my rack here. Surely wasn't the X I traded though.
>Meredith_Leigh: IQ E5 QI +27 156
>Avery_Mojica: AEINOST 12G NOTA.IES +68 127
#note With the K still out and knowing my luck, I didn't want to play ATONIES. SENORITA has a hook. This is best for me. Then again, plays at 13M are dangerous.
>Meredith_Leigh: EGL H12 .GLE +15 171
#note I wonder if I still should have played this. Seems fine.
>Avery_Mojica: ABIMNOX 8K .XIOM +66 193
#note There's the X. And I didn't redraw it or anything. I'm glad I got to play this.
>Meredith_Leigh: EZ 14H .EZ +32 203
>Avery_Mojica: ABEEJNO 10B JE. +28 221
#note Missed BANJO at 3J. Wasn't sure about AWHILE.
>Meredith_Leigh: CCILY L1 CIC.LY +23 226
>Avery_Mojica: ABDENOT 2H OBTA.NED +76 297
#note I like plays where there's only one playable bingo and I find it.
>Meredith_Leigh: GMU 1F GUM +30 256
#note Thank god that wasn't worse.
>Avery_Mojica: DIIOPRW 1N PI +25 322
#note Knowing my luck, I didn't like leaving double Is on my rack. Maybe I should have though. 
>Meredith_Leigh: FGHI -FGHI +0 256
#note Exchanged 4. Not these.
>Avery_Mojica: ?DIORSW 15B DrOWSI.R +64 386
#note Oh Quackle. Cow and Cows at 3L are best? They beat the bingos? Lol - Well I missed Doweries. But I found this which was good.
>Meredith_Leigh: EINO B10 .OINE. +28 284
>Avery_Mojica: ?ORRTUY 12A Y.RR +22 408
#note I really should have played RUSTY. But having the blank, I thought I fould get a bingo along the O column. I didn't consider SHE could block it.
>Meredith_Leigh: AFST N10 FA.TS +32 316
#note She did.
>Avery_Mojica: ?GHORTU O14 HO +20 428
>Meredith_Leigh: AKO 11E KOA +16 332
>Avery_Mojica: ?GNRRTU L11 R.NG +7 435
#note Stupid me. I really didn't find something better than this?
>Meredith_Leigh: AN 3L .AN +19 351
>Avery_Mojica: ?RTU O4 sTRU. +6 441
#note Thrum would have been better. But I didn't know that. I saw both Strum and Trump though.
>Avery_Mojica:  (AE) +4 445
