>Matt_Canik: MNORTUU E4 OUTM.URN +90 118
#note Beautiful. I was almost certain this was no good, but just felt like playing it anyway. I mean, I'm 1-2 and furious. 
>Kevin_Leeds: GW 4D W.G +14 44
#note He counts this as 22, then corrects it to 14 after I give him an "uhhhhh...."
>Matt_Canik: AEEHNPU 6H PAH +25 143
#note Beautiful. Awful play. n1 matt. 
>Kevin_Leeds: GGJ -GGJ +0 44

#note I see the potential for the extension when I play VOCAL, and then I guess I just didn't notice I had it here. 
>Kevin_Leeds: IMNST 12A MINTS +31 75
#note I didn't think OUTMOURNS was good either, but I had a strong play so I let it go.

>Matt_Canik: DEGIIRS 15L DI.G +24 346
#note This was a really hard turn. There was this, GRIND, (R)ESIDI(N)G, and RIDGES. I decided to roll the dice and hole he didn't hit the O12 spot for one turn, and played this. 
>Kevin_Leeds: ??ELOPV O6 PLOVErs +85 389
