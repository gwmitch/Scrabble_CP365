#note Ooh...E5 WARPATH 60 was a beaut 2x2. Matt played it as a bingo against me at one of the club's fun Saturday tmts. earlier this year.
>deen: DNOSUUY 7C YOU +26 102
#note Top play. B4 UNDULY 14 dumps both U's but scores 12 points less.
>Sue_Tremblay: AEEIRRT 9G TEARIER +70 98
>deen: DGNOSUV K5 DOUS.NG +36 138
#note Toss up between my play and 6H VODUN: 11 pts difference. How much is the S worth here, or is it the V leave which makes the difference? Curious that DOUSING comes up again - that could have been the winner last game!? LOL
>Sue_Tremblay: ?GNPTTT 6J T.T +5 103
#note Q favours trades here, keeping NT?, or 6J POT 11. Doesn't seem to mind TT with ?NG as the leave.
>deen: ACDINNV 11F CAVIN. +12 150
#note Kind of a silly miss here. 11E DANCING 22, same spot, again leaving V, obviously better. D6 NOMADIC 24 would have been even nicer! My play still 4th at least.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?EGLNPT 8K .PELT +39 142
#note No playable bingoes. Sue's play best.
>deen: DENOSTZ M3 DOZE +32 182
#note DOZE 2nd, top play N3 DONZEL 36 not a word I recognize.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?AEFGNO O4 FrON.AGE +65 207
#note Sue takes the lead again...One of two bingoes...the other B8 LONGlEAF 76 better scoring, but not one I knew. Boy Q is humbling...
>deen: EGINSTU H11 .UG +8 190
#note GUNITES not playing, fishing UG looks fine: J9 RUNG 11 also possible.
>Sue_Tremblay: BEEEHLX 14H HEX +40 247
#note Here's another position that I would enjoy some discussion of. How strongly does my last play suggest an S? Should Sue turn down 40 pts with 14H HEX in favour of something like L1 HEEL 29, or B8 LEX 26? Comments? FYI Q likes Sue's play best by a fairly large margin, but inferences may not be available to the program - not sure if it considers this or not...
>deen: AEINOST 15B ATONIES +110 300
#note Drew AO to TINES...i had a great leave, but still couldn't have asked for much more.
>Sue_Tremblay: ABEELSY 2J BELAY +47 294
#note Best...still a 6-pt game, another close one.
>deen: AAEFKNU N11 FAKE +27 327
#note This was terrible: KENAF, NAFKA, KUNA, FAUNA all along Row 1 are much better - I was looking there but completely blanked out. Even 5E UNFAKED 32, ditching UN, is clearly superior. CHOKE...lol...but fortunately it didn't hurt me too much.
>Sue_Tremblay: EIIMQST 15L MIST +39 333
#note Q prefers dumping the Q immediately with F14 QI 31. Sue must have decided to take the right corner away from me first, although there is the top row or row 3 as well - with some bingo chances once Q is gone...MISTIER for example.
>deen: AEEJNRU 1H JEAN +39 366
#note 13L JUKE 30 is a better leave, but I wanted to get rid of row 1 plays now.
>Sue_Tremblay: ACEIQRW F14 Q. +31 364
>deen: EIORRSU 13J OUR +12 378
#note Top play! 
>Sue_Tremblay: ACEIRRW 9A CAW +26 390
#note Q prefers RAW, same spot, sacrificing 2 pts to avoid duplicate R's.
>deen: DEIIRSV L1 S.ID +34 412
#note Another interesting position. I thought my play was clear, but maybe not - certainly if Sue has a bingo on row 5 ending in ED, I'm sunk. How likely is this? Q's play, dumping an I, gives me a bingo on row 3 if I avoid one of the 3 I's and draw B, E, L, or R...5/9 chance. And I reserve SLID for the next turn. Hmmm, not unreasonable, but somehow I just know another I would be coming out of the bag...LOL.
>Sue_Tremblay: DEIILRR 14B LID +17 407
#note Best
>deen: BEIIRV B8 ..VE +15 427
#note I played to block the out with A9 CRIER, but H1 JIVER 16 would have been enough as well. If I'd realized LAVER was good, I would have dumped the R as well.
>Sue_Tremblay: EIRR 12B REI +14 421
#note Sue either knew about LAVER or hoped for a miracle challenge...
>deen: BIIR 1N BI +19 446
>Sue_Tremblay: R D6 R.. +5 426
#note Another close one - good match Sue, thanks for being such a pleasant opponent...sorry about the phonies! :-)
>Sue_Tremblay:  (IR) +4 430
