>Lester_Schonbrun: IJNX 8G JINX +36 36
>JD: ILNOSTT 9H TOIL +19 19
#note I liked the defense of toil while also setting up lanes for my S.
>Lester_Schonbrun: KRU K9 .URK +16 52
>JD: INOOSTZ 12H ZON.S +56 75
#note I looked for alternative plays, but I guess ZOOKS just doesn't come up very often.
>Lester_Schonbrun: AHY 13G HAY +37 89
>JD: ABIIOTT 11I TI.O +14 89
#note torii is better than either biro or tiro which are the two plays I thought about
>Lester_Schonbrun: ?EILOPS 14B POLIcES +83 172
>JD: ABILOTU 13A TUBAL +30 119
#note him blocking tabouli is bad news. that said, finding the awesome best play of outjinx would give me more of a chance.
>Lester_Schonbrun: NOW 15A NOW +31 203
>JD: CEFIMOP A8 COMFI. +42 161
#note might as well take a couple of extra points for coempt

>JD: BDIRTVW 2F VI.W +18 282
#note i might as well just play wived here, accomplishes the same goal. view also sets up a Y hook which may allow him to catch up later.

>JD: BDDEHRT L1 HERB.D +32 314
>Lester_Schonbrun: ADE 1L .EAD +24 280
>JD: AADEERT 2N AE +11 325
#note I think AE has to be the play, seeing as it drops his bingo percentage from ~10% to 1%. how else will he catch me?
>Lester_Schonbrun: OY J1 OY +35 315
>JD: ?ADEIRT O1 ..RIvATED +83 408
>JD: ?ADEIRT --  -83 325
#note ack, I totally played the wrong one! I saw DETRAINED but thought DERIVATED was more likely to be good.
>Lester_Schonbrun: CEIQRSU C2 SUQ +35 350
#note this is a fascinating move - if he sees what I'm going to do next in all likelihood (DETRAINED) then he can play FARCI leaving EQSU and have a 50% shot of drawing QUAERES to bingo out with!!
>JD: ?ADEIRT O1 ..TRAInED +83 408
#note I am grateful to see the Q go down - if he had actually played farci I would have had a very tough play to make. TAU at E4 takes away his best Q plays and wins 100% of the time, but it would've taken considerable discipline to pass up DETRAINED.
