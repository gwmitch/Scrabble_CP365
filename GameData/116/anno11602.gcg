#note huge error! I settled for ovolo figuring there was nothing better and realized second later I had voodoo!!
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EEERRRS 6F RE.ERSER +65 97
#note of course, as it turns out voodoo would've given him a 2x2.
>JD: ABEILNO D4 BELO. +25 117
#note JO sims really well but it's hard to see kenji not closing the board pretty dramatically after that kind of play. elbow would be better here.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ACEMNOT 11C CO.NMATE +62 159
>JD: AILNNPU 10J PUN +21 138
#note I could really use a spot for pinnula. failing that quackle likes APIAN or PAULIN more. AILN is not a great leave for bingoing really, and PUN keeps the board relatively tight and messes with some of my best lanes.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: IKUZ H11 .ZUKI +84 243
>JD: ABIILNW L1 LAWIN. +20 158
#note it's not the spread move, but I don't mind trying to open the board a little more at this point. I guess with 5 Ts unseen playing WIN at E3 is probably a smarter way to open.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AGIMRTU 12H .AG +21 264
#note kenji scribbles stuff down for 5 minutes and finally plays this. what kind of read do you get?
>JD: BDILMTU E1 TUMID +26 184
#note really, after kenji's last move, it might be time for me to cut my losses and just block the top-right. that said, I think kenji is also possible of playing ZAG as a fakeout move to get me to close my own lanes. I'll give it a 90% chance that he has a huge leave. that being the case the smart move is probably MIAUL.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?AERTTU 1H TUTE.ARs +113 377
#note he chose the S because he's trying to go for a runaway win to get as much spread as he can.

#note smart play on his part, keeps me from fishing
>JD: CDEORTY 15A COY +34 318
#note TOY is a sharper play, setting up DIRECT to go out and forcing a block.
