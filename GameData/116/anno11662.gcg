>George_Asaka: ?DENORS 8B RODENtS +68 68
#note What a normal way for George to start. A good way. This loses the valuation at only 68.5, while Quackle's top 25 go from UNDOERS at 72.2 to ORDINES at 69.1. Not much of a difference, and this was still a good play. I think Quackle just didn't like the O's location.
>Avery_Mojica: AEEIUXY 7F EAUX +26 26
#note And meanwhile, I have this lovely rack. I blanked on ADIUEX, AUXIN, AND XENIA. I knew them all. Sheesh. My play comes off decently though.
>George_Asaka: AEN 6H NAE +17 85
>Avery_Mojica: EGIILUY 6B GLUEY +35 61
#note Don't care about the leave. This is a fun word to me.

#note Well, it wasn't HEY in the same place...
>Avery_Mojica: DIITUWY 5J WUD +19 80
>George_Asaka: A J4 A.. +6 110
#note I worried when he played this. He's close to a bingo.
>Avery_Mojica: IIQTVWY G2 TIVY +18 98
#note This rack is TOTALLY close to a bingo. I was actually wondering during the game if Nigel would find some bingo in this. I'm glad I was wrong... or I would have been laughing for the rest of my life.
>George_Asaka: AEINRST L5 .ETRAINS +70 180
#note Really? He had the SCRABBLE Player's best friend on his rack? COME ON. Well either way, another nice find. Now my tiles need to improve.

>George_Asaka: AZ 1A ZA +35 233
>Avery_Mojica: ?EFHOPT 9C FEH +30 187
#note FROTH would have been good... If I had FOUND it. I kept forgetting FOH was good, but that would have been my choice. I wasn't even looking at the R for FROTH. Scored as only 22.
>George_Asaka: BGI D1 B.IG +20 253
>Avery_Mojica: ?EGLOPT 8K G.OPE +24 211
#note Scored as 27. My math started getting sloppy. He was nice enough to help me.
>George_Asaka: AEJ N6 JA.E +29 282
#note Really? All the high scoring tiles and good places for them?
>Avery_Mojica: ?LLOOST M11 TOLL +16 227

>George_Asaka: FIO H12 .OIF +27 389
#note It's still open.
>Avery_Mojica: ?NOPSTU B13 .UP +10 253
#note Not a very good play, but I was hoping to get him situated down here while I bingo on the side.
>George_Asaka: MV G11 V.M +18 407
>Avery_Mojica: ?HINOST O2 HIsTON.S +73 326
