#note I just decide to create as much entropy as I can to see if I can get him to freak out. 
>Mike_Early: AG 5N AG +7 277
#note At the time, I couldn't tell if this was setting up an X or just paranoid blockage. He said afterwards that he was "certain" I had an S and was trying to set it up. (He was wrong)
