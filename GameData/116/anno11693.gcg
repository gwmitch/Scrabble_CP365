#note PAE* not good

>Julius_Wilson: ??BELPS F10 PEL +27 65
>Christian_O.B: EEORRST G11 ROE +11 78
#note Saw RESTORE here, but don't know about PEL can be hooked E (PELE). Saw 1F RESTORER but very risky since Julius was armoured with 2 blanks, and it was very easy to him to linking two triples. ROE G11 open triple word, but since Julius already had 2 blanks, he will probably not have right tile to use it and go for bingo, however I forgot about his B
>Julius_Wilson: ??ABDE H12 BEAD +40 105
>Christian_O.B: AEILRST 15H .ILATERS +80 158
#note Although DILATERS was easily countered with another bingo to 8 O triple, other bingo scored LESS than 65, so DILATERS still better than other

#note Quackle like YIN I11 better than exc IY leave GIANT

#note Only 1 bingo available
>Julius_Wilson: ?UVW -UVW +0 159
>Christian_O.B: FIINNSU O12 FIN. +11 243
#note Closing bingo line to triple word will harden Julius bingo, and if he bingo, his bingo will likely open triple word for easy counter. However, the best blocker, is FUNGI 10J for 19 9since FUNGI can only be hooked with C)

#note LUB* not good. Luckily it escaped
>Julius_Wilson: ?CRS N7 C.R +7 209
>Christian_O.B: HHINNOS I11 HON +17 299
#note The only way I can block his set-up car is by sacrificing my S for HOHS in 7H, leave INN. However if Julius can make another set-up by place a word above HOHS, I will have little chance to be able to block again. Another blocking SO/SCAR scored very low. So with 73 points lead, I prefer to let him play bingo if he can, and balancing my rack hoping I can counter his bingo with another bingo

#note L2 TWINED 12 leave RSV better
>Julius_Wilson: EGTU 5E TEGU +11 351
#note Julius blocked the last available bingo line
>Christian_O.B: DEIIRST 6B TEIID +21 372
#note Quackle suggest: 4E ID for 8 give 100% win. I don't know why. Generally what strategically better here is to play long word, dump as much as tile as possible with high score, so you will have bigger chance to finish a game in 2 move, while your opponent only have 1 shot to make a move
>Julius_Wilson: AAELOOS N1 ALA. +21 372
#note ALAC* is not a word. Hovewer if I challenge and it turn to be legal, the final margin will be less than 20, so Julius has a right to recount all score from beginning (under WESPA rules). If both of us underscored his score by 20 points, it will turn my victory to defeat (like game 8 Steven Surya vs Fadlan Satria).
