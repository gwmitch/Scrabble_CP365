>Chuck_Riordan: AFLW 8F FLAW +20 20
>Avery_Mojica: ?ABDERT F8 .AB +14 14
#note Really? I missed ALL the bingos again? Even ABORTED???
>Chuck_Riordan: AEGGI E10 AGGIE +18 38
>Avery_Mojica: ?ADEHRT D4 TRAsHED +84 98
#note Cathedra. How obvious. I didn't know AGGIE before, so I didn't risk S-ing it. I found a good play though I'd say.
>Chuck_Riordan: ADIMU 5D .ADIUM +18 56
>Avery_Mojica: IINPRTY 14B PIN.Y +36 134
>Chuck_Riordan: UX 4H XU +38 94
>Avery_Mojica: IJNORTY 15A JIN +36 170
#note I didn't know FLAWY. But I liked taking the TWS anyway.
>Chuck_Riordan: AEFGORS 7H FORAGES +74 168
#note He found the only playable bingo and the only playable spot.
>Avery_Mojica: ABDRTTY 3I BRATTY +38 208
#note I was worrying about drawing repeat Rs, so I got rid of it. Saving the R to play BATTY only wins the valuation by 0.5, so do I really care? Not a bit.
>Chuck_Riordan: OQU F2 QUO. +34 202
>Avery_Mojica: DDEOORV L7 .ROOVED +26 234
#note I completely missed OVERDO.
>Chuck_Riordan: EILV 15F EVIL +26 228
>Avery_Mojica: ?DEELOO C7 OE +10 244
#note I found DOOLEES, but I didn't think it would fit while hooking onto EVILS. Stupid me.
>Chuck_Riordan: CEIRT 13I CRE.IT +24 252
>Avery_Mojica: ?DEEILO B1 ELOInED +71 315
#note I didn't think ELOINED took a G. Even so, REOILED in the same spot I played at would have been better. But i wasn't sure of it.
>Chuck_Riordan: EKP 1A P.EK +45 297
#note That's why.
>Avery_Mojica: CHILOTU A6 HUIC +36 351
#note Chuck approves. He likes this play. It's one of my personal favorite words.
>Chuck_Riordan: IMN G1 NIM +26 323
>Avery_Mojica: ALNOSTZ 10I AZL.N +34 385
#note I took a while with this play. I had screwed up my tracking, so all I knew was that there were good tiles left. All I could see in it was NEONATES up top. Nothing through the V, O, or G. I thought Chuck might know something through the V or something, so I blocked it. Stupid me, I could have also blocked it by playing AZLONS at O8. I'll show what effect that would have had after his next play.
>Chuck_Riordan: AENRSTW 12A TWAN.ERS +78 401
#note Yep. It was the last play though, so I obviously challenged it. Good. Well crap. Nice play Chuck. Now if I would have played AZLONS at O8, I would have had fewer tiles left (In this case TONES I think. I would have lost by 1, 410-409. This was still good though.
