>sue: BEENNOS 8F BONE +12 12
#note BONE is fine, but the placement is wrong. You should not expose the premium squares by putting a vowel next to them if you can avoid it.
>carl: AADKNRU 7G DARK +22 22
#note J8 DAK 26 scores more and the leave is slightly better. J8 RAKU is also good.
>sue: AEIINNS 9D INANE +18 30
#note ASININE plays in several different places. If you miss the bingo, a play like 9F ANI keeps four nice bingo tiles together, so it's preferred to INANE.
>carl: AIINOTU 10B IOTA +10 32
#note AUTO, INIA, or IOTA at 8A. It's very close among those three.
>sue: ?ACIRRS C10 .RCA +12 42
#note You should have found SCARIER or CARRIES. Also available were RICRACS and CURARIS. If you don't find a bingo, it's better to score well with 8A CRIS than to waste a turn with a low-scoring play like (O)RCA.
>carl: AAINSUU -AUU +0 32
#note 6D UNAU or 12A UN(C)IA are better than the exchange, but the exchange is reasonable.
>sue: ?FIRSTY 12B S.RY +18 60
#note FIRSTLY goes down. If you miss the bingo, the next best options are K5 FRY 31 and 8A RIFT 28. J3 FRIS(K)Y 28 is another interesting option.
>carl: AGIINNS 8A AGIN +22 54
#note SAINING plays in several spots. Carl's play is the best non-bingo.
>sue: ?BEFIPT B6 FI. +15 75
#note Very tricky position. My primary goal here would be to groom my rack and make in order to bingo on the next turn. Unfortunately, there is no way to score well and accomplish this, so I'd probably play something like A7 F(A)B or A7 B(A)P or I4 FIB(RE). Sue's play suffers because it keeps two heavy consonants, something you most certainly don't want when drawing to a blank.
>carl: EILNPSU K1 UNPILES +78 132
#note Very nice find. Also available were SPINULE, LUPINES, and LINEUPS.
>sue: ??BEGPT 3K .EP +14 89
#note It's okay to use a blank in order to get onto the 3W since you have both of them. 1H GET(U)P 33 or 1K (U)PByE are both solid. If you choose not make one of those plays, you cannot afford to spend your only vowel and keep so many heavy consonants with a play like PEP. 4J G(I)B is fine, and will frequently yield a bingo on the next turn.
>carl: DEILORT 1H LIT. +12 144
#note TROLLIED plays through the L at K5.
>sue: ??BEGLT 4J B.TE +20 109
#note GOBLETS, BOOTLEG, and GLOBATE all play. If you don't find a bingo, Sue's B(I)TE is among the best non-bingos.
>carl: DEEEOOR C3 RODE +15 159
#note 11E RODEO scores well and keeps the perfectly fine EE leave.
>sue: ??FGHLW 4B H.WL +20 129
#note 4A FL(O)G is best. Even slightly changing the play from HOWL to FOWL is an improvement since GH is a superior leave to FG.
>carl: EEOOSTV 13E OOT +9 168
#note 11C (R)EVOTE 43 is the star play. Using the same spot, 11E VOE still scores 32. OOT doesn't seem to do anything we want to do: the leave keeps the undesirable V, the play scores poorly, and it opens a hotspot at 14G.
>sue: ??FGNOW E3 F.OWN +22 151
#note WOOFING and FOWLING both play. 14F WOG 30 scores well. FLOWN is fine if you don't see a bingo and don't want to open row 15.
>carl: AEEEIOU -  +0 168
#note Carl exchanged on this turn, but I am not sure what his rack was or how many he exchanged.
>sue: ??GGHRT 14F Hi +26 177
#note Sue has the right idea to take that hotspot, but HoGG gets rid of the clunky GG and makes a bingo more likely on future turns.
>carl: CEEMQSV 15G CEE +19 187
#note Pretty ugly rack. F1 EVES scores well. I don't like scoring 19 with CEE and keeping a rack as unwieldy as MQSV. You need a miracle draw just to be able to make a decent play next turn. 
>sue: ?AEGGRT B2 RA. +14 191
#note STAGGER, TAGGERS, and GARGETS all go down.
>carl: DEELSTU A1 DEL +17 204
#note TELEDUS plays. I prefer F5 DE to Carl's DEL.
>sue: ?AEEGGT G11 AT... +6 197
#note 5I GE(L)ATE scores as well as anything here. EGG is also worth playing in a couple of spots. I don't like ATTIC at all, since GG won't yield bingos soon.
>carl: AEIOSTU F1 TAE +10 214
#note You're so close to a good rack here, but playing the T kills it. A play like 3E FOU keeps AEIST, which will grow into a bingo very often.
>sue: ?EEGGMZ G3 ZEE +47 244
#note ZEE is the best play. Nicely done.
>carl: IIOSUUY -IOUUY +0 214
#note When you leave IUOS, you kind of deserve to have an ugly rack next turn, but this is sort of overkill! An exchange is clearly best.
>sue: ?AGGMUX 14I AX +27 271
#note Sue's AX is best.
>carl: IJMORSV 13I MOR +25 239
#note N2 JO, 14A JISM, and 11F M(A)JORS are all good plays. Carl's MOR is decent, but there's just no reason to keep the cllunky J when it plays for good score.
>sue: ?DGGMUV J12 V.. +13 284
#note B12 (S)MUG scores best and gets rid of one of the Gs. Since no play cleans the rack well, you might as well take the points for SMUG.
>carl: IJOQSSU N2 JO +26 265
#note SUQ at either N4 or 10H looks good. JO is fine, but I hate giving up 13 points this late in a close game.
>sue: ?DGGIMU O1 Mo +17 301
#note 5M GUM doesn't score well, but it sets Sue up to go out more easily than Mo does. B12 (S)MUG is also reasonable.
>carl: IIQSSVY L11 QIS +30 295
#note Or 12A QIS. With an I unseen, I'd probably play it where Carl did.
>sue: DGGIUUU 2I DI. +13 314
#note M9 GUID is best.
>carl: ISVY 11L .I +11 306
#note 14A VIS is best since it guarantees Carl can go out next play.
>sue: GGUUU 1D GU. +6 320
#note So few options, none of them good with this ugly rack. Sue's play is fine.
>carl: SVY 11L ..S +12 318
#note 11G (A)Y or M10 V(I)S set up the out play next turn.
>sue: GUU M3 ..G +6 326
#note (DIN)G is slightly better.
>carl: VY 11G .Y +5 323
#note As good as anything available.
>sue: UU N10 U. +4 330
#note U(N) scores two more points.
>carl: V H6 V... +7 330
#note The only play available.
>carl:  (U) +2 332
