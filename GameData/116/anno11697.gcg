>Jackson_Smylie: ABFINRS 8A FIB +28 152
#note Quackle says keeping INRS is 1.1 better. I can use the I at 010. It's a small deal though.
>Roger_Cullman: EEK 10J EKE +16 183
>Jackson_Smylie: ADENRRS 11J DARN +31 183
#note I missed SERRAN(OI)D, which I assume has to do with SERRANO. Out of the non-bingo plays, DARN is best.
>Roger_Cullman: EN 12K EN +17 200
>Jackson_Smylie: EIORSSY 10B OY +15 198
#note This is surprisingly best: it just keeps a nice leave and scores averagely for this kind of rack. I still have my S hook open, and if he does a play down the A column I can still have my bingo line.
>Roger_Cullman: AEGP A10 GAPE +17 217
>Jackson_Smylie: DEINRSS M3 ......S +11 209
#note (GAPE)RS is better, as it leaves me with one lane and scores very decently. It puts me ahead of Roger, which, on top of the good leave, gives me a great shot. I'm not playing (WED)S as it closes a lane. 
>Roger_Cullman: IU 12A .IU +5 222
>Jackson_Smylie: DEINNRS 14A DINNERS +79 288
>Roger_Cullman: AIIL O10 ILIA +14 236
>Jackson_Smylie: EEFILTT 14L FEEL +19 307
#note I think 15B FEET is best. FEEL doesn't REALLY close off his options, and ILIA may not have been a setup but a dump. I should have focused on scoring and balancing, but FEEL isn't so much equity-wise worse than FEET to make it horrible. Better safe than sorry, but this is a mistake.
>Roger_Cullman: PZ 4L P..Z +50 286
>Jackson_Smylie: ILLOTTV M13 V.T +12 319
#note V(E)T really closes down options along the 15 row. This rack isn't good at all, which may be a byproduct of the FEEL mistake. L(E)V is also fine. 
>Roger_Cullman: ASV 15K VA.S +16 302
>Jackson_Smylie: DILLNOT 15G OLD +14 333
#note I saw BAYOU a few turns later in the endgame, not now. This also limits his H possibilities. 
>Roger_Cullman: AH 14I AH +16 318
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ILNNTW E11 WIN. +14 347
#note I should have used the 13I square with W(AD) or something as he can hit major points with that spot. WIN(E) ended up kind of winning me the game though. W(AD) leaves bad tiles for the endgame though, and LIN(E)N is good for unduplicating.

>Roger_Cullman: ORR 15D OR +14 363
>Roger_Cullman: ORR --  -14 349
#note I didn't see anything with my CLNT? rack so I just hoped to god he would play WINER*.

>Jackson_Smylie: N B14 .N +2 360

#note I played okay this game, the end was a little shaky, and overall fine performance minus that horrible blunder of EQUIN*.
