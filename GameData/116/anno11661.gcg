#note It's time to make up for that earlier game I had with him. I'm hoping I can pull some good tiles.
>Cliff_Smith: EIM G6 MI.E +8 8
#note Vowel-heavy rack? This opens up too much in my opinion. I can't imagine why he didn't play something like ME 9H if he didn't have a load of vowels.
>Avery_Mojica: ADGINRS I5 DRA.INGS +65 85
#note I seemed to miss everything. This was the lowest-scoring bingo. Gradins, Darings (Did see, wasn't sure), all at J2, 5A, or 10 A, E, or F. I even saw SWARDING, but DRAWINGS opened up one triple for him and one triple for me. Good enough to me. I still support this play, considering I didn't find the other 70-pointers.
>Cliff_Smith: AGIO H12 AGIO +21 29
#note There's his.
>Avery_Mojica: ANRTTUY 14F UN.TY +18 103
#note Wasn't sure about YURTA, so I played my play instead. I even saw DUTY. Considering his last play, which is a vowel-dump word, he'd most likely have something to put atop that Y and score big. I'd be really irritated by then. So I like my play.
>Cliff_Smith: HRTU F3 RUTH +30 59
#note I forgot that the H went there.
>Avery_Mojica: ACDHIRT 2B CHART +34 137
#note DICTA takes the triple. I found the second-best though, and considering he's fishing, I don't feel like giving him a good bingo line with a good hook.
>Cliff_Smith: OP 1C OP +19 78
>Avery_Mojica: DEIILNS D1 ..ID +14 151
#note I need to study more often. I didn't know this one. PAID is the second-best.
>Cliff_Smith: BOT 4D .O.BT +9 87
#note What an interesting play.
>Avery_Mojica: EFILNNS 15J ELFINS +44 195
#note Cool - my play won the valuation by 12 points, to ELFINS at 15 A. 
>Cliff_Smith: AEPV J2 PAVE +18 105
#note This play at 13J is better. Eight points less for a play that opens up more (which will later help me) is fine by me.
>Avery_Mojica: DEEEENN K5 NEED +18 213
#note Vendee, Venene, yeah yeah. I should have known them. I had to play this though to block the double-double lane. And this play made it harder to make a parallel play to it, considernig I had many Es and there were only 5 Os. Worth the risk I'd say.
>Cliff_Smith: IJ N13 JI. +20 125
#note Setting up ANOTHER bingo line. He dropped a tile on the floor this turn by accident, exposing a blank. I knew I was in trouble. But I quickly forgot about it.
>Avery_Mojica: EEENORX F8 .OX +31 244
#note I didn't play EXONS because I was thinking he'd have a hard time finding a bingo along that column. OXEN at L3 I just missed. That would have been a good play. My play is 3rd.
>Cliff_Smith: GISV L2 VIGS +21 146
#note This play will also come to help me. Starting to get an idea of what I'm going to do?
>Avery_Mojica: EEEMNRR E9 REM +22 266
>Cliff_Smith: KOR D10 KOR +32 178
>Avery_Mojica: EEELNRY L7 LEY +13 279
#note These Es are getting on my nerves. Its like the Is from the last game. I had all 9 of them. I have had all but 2 so far, depending on what he has on his rack. Now about the play. DYNEL. Didn't know it. Plays at J7 like YEN would have been VERY cool. I was still intent about blocking this bingo line though.
>Cliff_Smith: ADTU C11 DAUT +18 196
#note This next play is my fun play. Can you find it?
>Avery_Mojica: AEEINRZ 3I Z.N.ER +50 329
#note I found this quite quickly, actually. I was very elated to play it.
>Cliff_Smith: ??AEINT O8 ElATIoN. +81 277
#note This was the best play. He drew both blanks and he's still behind? I must be doing well without myself realizing it.
>Avery_Mojica: AABCEIS N9 ABA +24 353
#note I don't like any leave consisting of ACEI. Hence, BA was not played at the same spot.
>Cliff_Smith: Q 11M Q.. +12 289
#note Yeah, the only play. Blocking this would have been better. Or just not opening it up.
>Avery_Mojica: CEEISU N2 C.UISE +20 373
#note Blanked on UREIC. Should have seen it. This is still good.
>Cliff_Smith: ELOOOW L12 WOO. +20 309
>Avery_Mojica: E E4 .E +8 381
#note Best out play. I think this is a pretty good revenge on Cliff.
>Avery_Mojica:  (EOL) +6 387
