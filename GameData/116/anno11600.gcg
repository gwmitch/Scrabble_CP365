#note the N doesn't necessarily help this leave any, KEEN or KNEE would both be fine. quackle actually likes EKE at 8G fine too.

>JD: FLNNOOR E11 ON +24 124
#note for some reason I coud not convince myself that orlon was a word. however, the best play looks like fronton which cleans up a messy rack.
>Jeff_Widergren: EGGNSVW -EGGN +0 104
>JD: AFLNORU 4H FLO.A +24 148
#note close call, flota is quite defensive, other options might be futon or fontal

#note damnit I never see CWM! that or WIMP both sim best. his rack is pretty close to random, but WIMP would take a lot of balls. I would take CWM.

#note hmm. now I have a hard task
>JD: ?AEGIYZ 3L ZIG +37 259
#note I'm not totally sure how trustworthy the sim is here. YAGI at 3L absolutely dominates the sim. That said, jeff is pretty much guaranteed to play on column O (even though he isn't on the sim) and I'm not sure how much the Z scores elsewhere. at the same time, the pool is full of 1-pointers - his average points per play are higher after ZIG than after YAGI! I probably should've given YAGI a shot.
>Jeff_Widergren: ATV 2M TAV +20 282
>JD: ?AAEESY M13 AYE +22 281
#note ohhhhhh man I actually had a bingo here!!! I totally do not know yeasayer - it was literally in the word list that I was studying right before this tournament but it looks totally unfamiliar! I guess if you can have a naysayer you can have a yeasayer too.
>Jeff_Widergren: AMORTTU 15G TAUTOM.R +89 371
>JD: ?AAEEIS O13 AIS +42 323
#note killer! just one more consonant and he might be in a lot of trouble. I don't think quackle is a very good way of interpreting this position because he's clearly going to do his absolutely best to block 15O if I leave it open. I figured I might as well take the points and keep myself in range. maybe I needed to gamble more and play area/areae.
>Jeff_Widergren: EEHR E2 .HEER +20 391
>JD: ?ABDEES N2 ..E +4 327
#note so, I looked at the pool and realized that if I dropped the E at N4 and the N was in the bag he would be unable to play at O4. I was pretty low on time so I went with that plan.
>Jeff_Widergren: EGU 7K .GUE +6 397
#note the key play...just playing agee here would clinch it.
>JD: ?ABDENS O5 BASiNED +83 410
#note wow, what a miraculous win.
