>Cliff_Smith: ADELX 6E LAXED +21 32
#note Here goes the beginning of his phoney plays. I didn't notice this one though until running it through quackle. Why didn't he play AXLED in the same spot for many more points though?
>Avery_Mojica: AEINRTU L4 URINATE +72 86
#note Blanked on a parallel play above LAXED. Damn. This is still good though.

#note Damn Is.
>Cliff_Smith: LOTVY C9 VOLTY +41 177
#note There's number two. It was the last game of the day, and I was tired. My logic was "Well, VAUNTIE has an I and an E ending, and it also takes VAUNT(Y), so it must be good. I held though and quickly released. If it was earlier in the day, this probably would have been challenged off.
>Avery_Mojica: AGIIISY 14M YA. +25 246
#note More Is? This is peculiar. I probably should have made a play getting rid of some of them. Quackle likes GAY at B8, I did too. Why didn't I play it? Not a clue.
>Cliff_Smith: ??GHNSS 3D HiSSiNG +67 244
#note Quackle might be drunk while telling me this. GNASH at N6 wins the valuation? SaGaNASH at N3 is a BINGO and has 2.8 less valuation points. The list is all assorted with different plays. SASHING, SHOGUNS, etc. He found a weak one apparently.
>Avery_Mojica: AGIIISV B6 VIGA +24 270
#note I forgot VIGIA is good.
>Cliff_Smith: CET H1 ET.C +24 268
>Avery_Mojica: FIINOSS 12G IF +20 290
#note FISSION was a no-go. I was so tired that somehow I scored this as 28. Definitely not on purpose, I'm not one of those idiotic cheaters. Our scoresheets said 302-268.
>Cliff_Smith: ABEMNOR 1B BEMOAN.R +65 333
#note Here's number 3. I held this for a long time. My calculations were all crazy and I couldn't figure out what to do. I didn't feel like challenging it and let it be good. But after the game, this and VOLTY were the phoneys I found, and I promised I would get my revenge on him. Which I did. Check out round 13.
>Avery_Mojica: IILNOSS 2A LIN +16 306
#note I missed a lot here. Oh well.
>Cliff_Smith: ABD 10H DAB +31 364
>Avery_Mojica: AEILOSS H10 ...ILE +30 336
#note We both liked this play.
>Cliff_Smith: GNOW 5K W.ONG +18 382
>Avery_Mojica: AEMOSSU 2J AMUSE +23 359
#note I spent about 10 minutes on this play. I thought he had AENTW left, and that he would score well with TWANG. I counted everything again, and my tired mind counted 12 Es, including the one on my rack. I was thinking of AMUSE 2J, but I didn't want him playing NEWT. Well, that's just wonderful that that happened. If it was earlier, this wouldn't have happened. Crap. AMUSES would have been better.
>Cliff_Smith: ENTTW 1L NEWT +34 416
#note Yeah, yeah.
>Avery_Mojica: OS 10E SO +14 373
#note After the game, Cliff and I heavily studied the endgame. It was calculated that I couldn't have won. But I could have made it closer. And if I was smart enough to challenge his 3 phoneys, I'd feel better. Oh well. This was a funny story for everyone though, and I'll be getting my revenge in round 13. Final score showed 388-416, no recount requested.
