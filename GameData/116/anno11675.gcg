>Matt_Canik: EFIIMRY 8D FIERY +30 30
#note Note: We are both 2-3 as the 1 and 2 seeds in our division and are not happy with the way has gone. We start the round 20 minutes early with the intent of "getting it over with and getting the hell out of here ASAP", to put it in my words. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: BEFGO 7H BEFOG +19 19
>Matt_Canik: AILMMUZ 6G MAMI +29 59
>Matt_Canik: AILMMUZ --  -29 30
#note This is truly just awful. Not only do I play a phoney 4, I also miss UMAMI in the same spot for 3 more. FUCK.
>Geoff_Thevenot: DQU K5 QU.D +28 47
>Matt_Canik: AILMMUZ L1 UMAMI +31 61
#note As a jooke, I put down MAMI in the same spot. Then I drop the U in front and am really pissed at myself. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?AENNSW 6C NEWSmAN +71 118
#note He misses SWANNEd/BEFOGS, and WANNESS or WANNEST as a 5-underlap under FIERY. 
>Matt_Canik: AELLTUZ F2 ZETA. +34 95
#note HAHAHAHAHA and now I miss ZEALS (and also (S)L(E)AZE, but that's harder to see). Fucking awful. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: IIIOOOU -IIIOOOU +0 118
>Matt_Canik: AELLNOU 8K .OULA +25 120
>Geoff_Thevenot: DJOTT 3B JOTT.D +32 150
>Matt_Canik: CEIILNW 1J LE.CIN +24 144
#note I just don't really know what I was thinking. I just didn't like the looks of CILN as a leave after WITE, but IW is just a lot worse. Don't know why I played this, except maybe to try to knock out the TWS. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: EGNO 5B GENO. +26 176
>Matt_Canik: EIILNRW N6 WI.L +15 159
>Geoff_Thevenot: OR 4D OR. +21 197
>Matt_Canik: EHILNRS M3 HIS +38 197
>Geoff_Thevenot: IK 4A KI +22 219
>Matt_Canik: ELNORRV L7 ..VERNOR +24 221
#note Let's just open things up. This game was getting boring. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ACGO 14J CA.GO +28 247
>Matt_Canik: ?DEILPV 11J PE.V +18 239
#note VILIPEND? Okay...
>Geoff_Thevenot: AR N3 AR +13 260
>Matt_Canik: ?ADEILU 12D DUALIzE +70 309
#note I don't like giving up the X spot at 11E with this, but it scores more and the other plays all give up *something* to the X. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: HIN 11C HIN +19 279
>Matt_Canik: ABDEOTT B9 BATTED +29 338
#note AR and HIN imply that he's close to a bingo, and the newly-open B column looks threatening. But there's also a very worrisome X-bomb spot at O12, stuff like XYST or EXIST. I decided BATTED may be able to outrun the X bomb and kills all bingos. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEIPRSX A13 PAX +43 322
#note APEX
>Matt_Canik: EOSTY 15L SOY +29 367
#note All in all, I'm kinda happy with this tournament. I didn't play up to my fullest, but I think that was due to a variety of factors- drinking too much coffee to compensate for a lack of sleep the prior night, uncomfortable conditions, and a loud environment. I learned a lot, and any day I go 2-0 vs Geoff is a successful day in my book, even if I end up 1-3 against the rest of the field. Congrats to Jason and Oliver, who finished 1 and 2 respectively in the division as last and second-to-last seeds. It's about time you guys got your ratings up where they belong.
