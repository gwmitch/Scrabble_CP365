>Jim_Brooks: DEMOV 8D MOVED +28 28
>Gunther_Jacobi: CEEGGOU F8 .OGUE +13 13
#note  Q's top, D8 (M)UGGEE, a word I just recently studied, vanishes off into the ether. (V)OGUE is 10.8 back.
>Jim_Brooks: HPW 11D WH.P +24 52
#note Q prefers PH(E)W G6.
>Gunther_Jacobi: CEGNPQU 7G PEC +23 36
#note This comes second behind C(E)P G7. EGNQU looks good; having an E on the rack is helpful!
>Jim_Brooks: AGJNR E4 JARG.N +30 82
#note JAG 6F looks superior. Although JARG(O)N turns over two more tiles.
>Gunther_Jacobi: GILNQTU 6B QUI.T +36 72
#note I really shunned making this move. He's more likely to have an S.
>Jim_Brooks: ?DIKOST J5 DaKOITS +75 157
>Gunther_Jacobi: GILNNTW 8J .WNING +33 105
>Jim_Brooks: AIOR 4B RIO.A +24 181
>Gunther_Jacobi: EILLLOT M8 .LLITE +14 119
#note Extremely weak. LILO K2 is pretty ideal.
>Jim_Brooks: AIM 7A AIM +26 207
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEILLNO H1 NIELLO.. +30 149
#note Missing LANOLI(N)E L2. This is second, however.
>Jim_Brooks: EFFI 12A FIFE +38 245
#note Maybe in the next OSPD, QTIP will be good.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAOOTTX A11 A.OOT +24 173
#note Yeah, TAX for 40 is pretty obvious at 3A, but AOOT didn't look promising. This is Q's third choice. TAXA also looked decent at N11.
>Jim_Brooks: ENSZ B10 ZE.NS +76 321
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABEETUX L11 BEAUX +54 227
#note I thought about holding the X off here, but if my opponent has a T, (which he did), BEAU will look really ridiculous. However, being that there's C3 open for my X, BEAU may have some sense to it!
>Jim_Brooks: ABHT 3A BAHT +32 353
#note I held here, thinking it was BHAT that was valid. Then I came to my senses.
>Gunther_Jacobi: EERRRTY 15K E.ERT +36 263
#note A play without hope for the future...
>Jim_Brooks: V B2 V.. +12 365
>Gunther_Jacobi: ENRRRYY 5J .ERRY +18 281
#note EYRY would've been pretty sick at 13D. (D)ERRY's off by 2.7.
>Jim_Brooks: ?CDIOSU 3H .DaCIOUS +70 435
#note Nice play. Yet a few bingos score more. (N)OCtUIDS 1H for 83, D(I)eCIOUS 2G, D(I)oICOUS 2G. Jim told me after the game that he wasn't sure if NOCTUID could take an S.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AADNRSY H11 SANDY +43 324
>Jim_Brooks: AE 6N AE +11 446
#note ROUGH game!
>Jim_Brooks:  (AR) +4 450
