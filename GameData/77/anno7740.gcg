#note I have my choice of 22-point plays, so I take out the possible ZA play.

#note DAMN!!! So that's why Sam was chuckling, after I started to play TROPI(N)ES but realized it didn't fit.

>Winter: AAEJORV M2 RE... +30 326
#note I consider JAVA and (S)VARAJ, but I decide that if I just play RE(WAX) I've a good chance at scoring 30 again next turn. (S)VARAJ draws 5 tiles which could be drek on this board. Didn't see JO(V)IA(L).

>Winter: DEENOOQ E11 Q. +22 378
#note I consider blocking with Q(I), but it seems like a horrible play given that taking the 22 puts me up a lot. I thought about blocking a different way, but not enough,

#note This was HARD!!! I finally decided that not leaving too many vowels on my rack and not emptying the bag was best, but I really question this play despite what Q says.
