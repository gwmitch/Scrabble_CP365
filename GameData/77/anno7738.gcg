#note I figured Brad had to bingo with an S or T and I'd take the bingo. If I play MY and he bingos, I'll probably not bingo because I can smell the luck.

#note Dang, I was hoping he wasn't clever enuf for that.

#note No choice. I assume he'll bingo so I'm not playing for points and risk a crap rack--I can smell the luckbag coming.
