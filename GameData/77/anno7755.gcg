#note Ooh--an ess. Might I have a chance?
>Kenji_Matsumofo: ?ADMRTW 6G MADWoRT +85 97
#note Suspected it was phony, but the AI leave is far superior, and I couldn't bear the thought of losing the game because I left IU instead of AI. Suspected (DONG)A was good, but I decided I needed to score AND GET LUCKY in order to come back from the deficit.

>Winter: ABILLNR O1 BANI +32 87
>Kenji_Matsumofo: EOT 9E TOE +12 185
#note Looks good for me, right? Of course not, because if Kenji is playing for 13, that means pain is coming.
>Winter: LLLORRZ K10 LOLL +12 99
#note Meanwhile this is what I have to deal with???
>Kenji_Matsumofo: FIX 10D FIX +56 241
#note Of course--would you expect anything else from Famine?
>Winter: DJORRSZ D10 .JORD +32 131
>Kenji_Matsumofo: AEINRTU 13G AUNT.IER +70 311
#note This is unreal. I should have anticipated that effect of Famine and RUN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION!!!
>Winter: AORSSYZ 14F ZA +33 164
#note I'm playing to get lucky here. I want to hit the S at 15A and then use my other S at H12. Q is favoring (D)OZY for the bingo leave, but there is no way Kenji (or FAMINE) is going to let me bingo.
>Kenji_Matsumofo: ENQU N10 QUE.N +68 379
#note Please just kill me now.
>Winter: FORSSWY 15A YOWS +51 215
#note Thought of FROWSY, but again, I need to get lucky and draw an E so I can hit F(U)SE for 45.
>Kenji_Matsumofo: COY 13B CO.Y +18 397
>Winter: EFIIRSV 15L VISE +48 263
>Kenji_Matsumofo: MT K5 M.T +18 415
>Winter: EFIIPRS O7 PERI +29 292
#note Since I have the case S I'm hoping Kenji can't hook (ZA), so I want to take the Q first. Also hoping I can play at H12 without the like (R(U)GA, for example).
>Kenji_Matsumofo: GT H12 T.G +18 433
>Winter: EFIIIRS 10B RE... +17 309
#note This one I didn't thing thru enuf. I needed to ditch the Is first, then open the board.
>Kenji_Matsumofo: ADEEGNR C3 RENEGAD. +78 511
>Winter: EFIIIST B5 IF +28 337
#note So stunned I don't even bother to count the tiles.
>Kenji_Matsumofo: AEHP A7 HEAP +45 556
>Winter: EIISTV 3C .EVISIT +12 349
#note Didn't even bother to check the track. Didn't care anymore. Don't care anymore. Just want to never play Scrabble again and go to another continent far away from Famine and Pestilence.
