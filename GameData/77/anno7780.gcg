#note Playing really sloppy most of the game, but at least I made this one good play, keeping the Z and maximizing my turnover to draw an E.

#note Going to be tight.
>Winter: AEFORUY O13 RYE +27 356
#note I was running low on time and couldn't consider all the possibilities, but basically I needed two spots for the Q, that he could not block. Keeping AFOU, I had (A)QUA at C6 and QUAF(F) at 12A, or QUO(D)/QUA(D) at 5G. Q likes OFAY, it looks like that could get me Q stuck.
>Joe_Edley: E G13 .E +2 309
#note OH SNAP--VERY CLEVER!!! It doesn't win, unless I screw up, and Joe had to gamble on that.
>Winter: AADFOU H11 .A.DO +24 380
#note I would have let him have the play if I had found a solid win, because I was just 99.99% sure of (T)A(R)DO, and I didn't have time to work thru all the math if I blocked with (T)AD or (T)OD.
