#note i knew quackle wouldn't like this too much, i should probably just play ZOIC and move on. this is a pretty greedy play (i draw an A and i have huge points in two places) some other letter combos work too. (-1)

#note quackle says this is a 100% win game. i don't see what he could bingo with, but at least if he bingos from the top (i don't know with what) most likely i'll get the X play. too paranoid for spread building purposes. QUANGO is cool. (-20)
