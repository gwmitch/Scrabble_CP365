>JEREMY: EEKORTU F6 KO. +17 43
#note OKE for 26 seems much better.
>SETH: GILMNSW I7 M.WLINGS +73 121
#note I really had no idea if it took the S, and I had heard before the game that Seth doesn't play many phonies.
>JEREMY: EEORTTU D8 .UTTER +25 68
#note Missed ROU(L)ETTE and OUT(S)TEER.

>JEREMY: EOPQTVW 7M V.W +13 230
#note The S in VOCES really hurt, as I would have had TOQ(U)E for 45. I ended up making a pretty weak play.
>SETH: AEGOT L4 TOGAE +24 295
>JEREMY: AEEOPQT C12 PE +16 246
#note Quackle like (COUNsEL)EE which is kind of stylish.

>JEREMY: AAEINOT H4 AIT +22 292
#note Not much of an opening play. Looking at it now, I prefer NAOI.
>SETH: DEFI E3 DEFI +24 356
>JEREMY: ?AENNOP K3 PAN +22 314
#note Quackle prefers PEN over my PAN by a tiny margin. My thinking is that the S hook on PAN is un-blockable. I guess with the O hook on PEN, I'm not forced to make my blank an S, but if he has the other O, he can block.

#note EsTRONE don't fit. Bummer.
