#note If he'd played GENDY*, I might have let it stay. Note that I passed on GIMP, knowing that he has a Y. I should have gone one better and forwent the 2x2 setup altogether, realizing that YAG blocks. It's hard to say what the best play is here, knowing opp's rack. GAMPS 8D maybe.

#note Too bizarre. After the game, Dr. Meyer told me more about the word. Apparently, it's a disease caused by flies laying eggs in your eye. I hate when that happens.

#note It must be getting late. ZOA at either J2 or G13 is better. OZAL(ID) also sims well.

#note Painful. LOAN wins the sim. I shouldn't have fallen madly in love with the AELNS leave; it's not that great.
>Alan_M: DGIINOS 4A INDIGO.S +74 246
#note Trying to upstage XP Morgan, I guess. I was so stunned that I immediately brought the mistake to his attention, and then regretted it. It might have seemed like coffeehousing, or an attempt to psychologically wound my opponent. The blank isn't always your friend.

#note Looking pretty dangerous...
>Carl: AACEETU 3G .AU +6 242
#note I never know what to do with these racks. AECIA 6D and JEU win the sim.

#note Given my tiles, a BRAVE ACT is in order.

#note Psych! Alan atones nicely for missing the previous 3x3.

#note This was dumb. I could stick Alan with the R if I play PIN. I was in time trouble.

>Carl: ANRT 6E .A.R +9 360
#note If I'm not careful, I might get stuck with the R myself. I missed LORN though, which allows a better sequence.
