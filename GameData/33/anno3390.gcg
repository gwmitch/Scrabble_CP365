>Mike: ABH 8G BAH +16 16
>Cesar: EIKLORT J6 KETOL +30 30
#note i think kilo forces him to open, it's also more defensive and has a much better leave. (-1)
>Mike: ADEMN 9F DAEM.N +30 46
>Cesar: EFIIRRU K5 RIF +23 53
>Mike: GHI K9 .IGH +18 64
>Cesar: AEIRRSU L3 RUER +17 70
#note ruer is kind of sick. i couldn't literally see anything decent but there's a bunch of plays that sim higher. 12J AHI leads the pack. it's hard for me to comprehend how ERRSU > AIS or why it's better, but it seems RUER gives too much back AND ERRSU will score more next turn, or something. thank you, details button. (-4.5)
>Mike: ENQU 3I QUE.N +48 112
>Cesar: AEINOSV 7B EVASION +74 144
#note oh god.. didn't think NIGH took an S. (it's a verb!) taking the 6 extra points at 10A is still better than what i played, though. (although in retrospect, no!) (-10.5)
>Mike: ?GIOPRS N3 SeRPIGO +80 192
>Cesar: ACERTUV 13F CURVATE +76 220
#note i laid this down reasonably quickly. the highest legit word is VUG then VACUA. i'd probably chooise VACUA.
>Mike: OX O8 OX +45 237
>Cesar: DEEIIOP M8 EPODE +30 250
#note keeping two Is is gross but this is the best play.
>Mike: AW 6A AW +26 263
>Cesar: ?ADFIIL 5B ALIF +20 270
#note H13 RIF sims best. i don't remember if i considered it. my move doesn't make a whole lot of sense. (-3)
>Mike: GIN H12 G.IN +21 284
>Cesar: ?CDEIOW 8A WE +22 292
>Mike: EJOS F2 JOES +35 319
>Cesar: ?CDIOTT 3C DIC.T +18 310
#note i'm getting in trouble now. my move sims bad. too much chance for a disaster draw. G1 TOD sims best or 4H DIT. i was low on time and starting to worry... DIT is totally fine. i think i considered it but wanted points in case i didn't draw the bingo, but DIT scores more than DICOT!! (-4.5)
>Mike: IY F12 I.Y +16 335

#note thank goodness
>Mike: BN J2 N.B +7 342
>Cesar: AELLRTU D7 .LULAE +14 407
#note my move has a 100% win chance too, but the highest equity is ALLURE in the same spot. obviously trying to assure the out in two. (-9.5)
