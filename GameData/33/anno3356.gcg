>Deen: ACEOSST 8D COAST +20 20
>Matthew: GIITTTX F5 IXI. +27 27
#note Apparently GTTT is a poor leave. Quackle wants me to sacrifice the points and do F7 GAIT for 7. (-4.2)
>Deen: MMU E3 MUM +22 42
>Matthew: EGLNTTT E7 T.T +5 32
#note Aargh. Chickened out on TONLET. (-1.7)

#note I don't know CULTIGEN. (-8.5)

>Matthew: ?DEGNSW A8 WED.iNGS +167 265
>Matthew: ?DEGNSW --  -167 98
#note Triple lanes to me are like shiny objects to a simpleton.
>Deen: AELNPRS J6 PLAN.ERS +66 153
>Matthew: ?DEGNSW H1 DEW +31 129
#note REDWINGS would be the only real bingo, although DEW sims well. (-3.3)
>Deen: DENW I2 WEND +25 178
>Matthew: ?FGHINS 13C FiSHING. +84 213
#note Only bingo.
>Deen: ?NQR -  +0 178
#note Lost challenge.

#note I was happy to find this.
>Deen: ?NQR N10 Qu.RN +66 244
>Matthew: ACDENOT B5 NOTECA.D +65 294
#note Only bingo.
>Deen: AAHIRTV O4 HAVARTI +112 356
#note Me: "I should have this game all wrapped up! The only bingo lane requires a seven ending in I!"
#note Ulu: "Take this, bitch!"
>Matthew: EEEKOVY A1 EVOKE +53 347
#note I need these points bad now.
>Deen: EJLO K3 JOLE +26 382

>Deen: AAIILPR B14 AA +31 413
#note Dean is very low on time at this point. Take a sec here to try and solve the endgame to find a win for me.
>Matthew: BEEIIOU L3 OI +17 425
#note This appears to be the only winning play. It sets up BEE for 30 next turn and Deen would have to block with L2 PILI, L2 PI, or LIRI or LIP hooking OIL. None of those plays win for Deen after I play UNBE. If I play JIBE, JUBE, or JIB, I'm not able to score enough points to win.
