>JL: ACIITUU E5 U.AU +8 69
#note Exchanging IUU was my other pick here, and the two moves are at the top of Quackle's list though there is a wider margin between exch IUU and UNAU (0.75%) than between UNAU and FUCI (0.15%). That being said, that kind of margin is pretty much meaningless to me. 
>George: MOP G1 MOP +21 91
#note POME G3 - 2 more and very little of any different effect. 
>JL: CDIIMNT C3 IDI.M +22 91
#note Quackle likes DIM 7A a little more but I'm not exactly thrilled with it; DIM I8 I can get behind more since it will leave a vowel open (which is useful given my consonant-heavy leave that way). IDIOM was mostly because I couldn't see much - though INCIPIT 3C sounds like a good idea as well. 
>George: DELY 9F LY.ED +25 116
>JL: BCGHNRT I8 T.NCH +15 106
#note This isn't a great move due to the funny leave. BRING 3A is a good leave and CHIT F4 also sounds like a good choice in my opinion. GENT I8 is also better than my play and is the only actually decent opener of the three (and an open board could be more useful for me if I actually draw something to it).
>George: AEHP H12 EPHA +36 152
#note Rats. 
>JL: BGRTUWW -BGRTUWW +0 106
#note Holding RT, T or R sound like good ideas given an open A. RT makes good sense, though I threw the R in because I could see things going wrong if I drew any of the other 5 left in the bag. 
>George: UV B6 .UV +10 162
>JL: ACNORRR I3 CAR. +22 128
#note I wanted the points for the play a little too much. CARR 11I is a little more progressive-thinking than my choice. 
>George: AGN J2 GAN +18 180
>JL: EEFNORR 11I .ORF +18 146
#note CONFER 11I actually suits my style a little better than this play. FROE 10D looks to be the best balance to me though I think I went against it for some stupid reason that made sense to me at the time, such as that the As and Es would make the F placement there quite tantalizing to George. I think I also played this to create an easier lane for potential future bingos. 
>George: AA 12L AA +14 194
>JL: EEIKNQR B3 QI +25 171
>George: AAG 13K AGA +19 213
#note We both seem to be struggling big-time this game. 
>JL: EEIKNOR 14H .OKE +23 194
>George: IX D8 XI +34 247
>JL: ?EINRRU N6 RUINERs +62 256
#note mURRINE C9 scores 1 more point and doesn't leave as many playback opportunities. I completely missed it again. 
>George: ENTT O5 TENT +22 269
>JL: DEIIJRS M3 JERID +39 295
>George: ADW L4 WAD +31 300
>JL: BEIOSTV N2 VOE +27 322
#note I picked this mostly because I had the B to possibly be used for later. 
>George: EGI 10E GIE +18 318
>JL: BEILOST 11C BLOTS +32 354
#note OBELISM 1A. Or at least BLOT 11C would be smarter so as to limit him from his choice play. 
>George: LORTWYZ C11 .ORTZ +32 350
>JL: EI D11 .IE +12 366
#note There is a moral in these throwings away of spread, though: I lost second place by 5 spread points. So really, any one of these moves that I could've done better likely would've counted. Oh well.
