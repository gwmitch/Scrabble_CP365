#note Despite keeping the triple-E, this is best by a good bit.
>Rahn_McKeown: DEFILST O1 FLITES +45 249
#note DELFTS; he told me he saw it a bit too late.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEOPRR 12G REPO +18 275
#note Instead of ROPE to limit options a bit, I think.

#note Best.
>Rahn_McKeown: DDEIN 11J IND.ED +27 304
#note Excellent play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEGIRR 4L BRI. +12 302
#note First subpar move (besides COAX, but that one's okay).  Didn't know quite what to do here.  BARRE(L) and GERBI(L) are okay, but they leave remote possibilities of big scores, and I definitely want to reduce volatility here.  (I don't know why I thought BRIARAGE* was plausible -- maybe 'cause I once got away with ARBORAGE* or something like it.)
>Rahn_McKeown: ACEKRT 2J CARTE. +28 332
#note He told me he had C(HO)K(ER) keeping a good leave, but that would've killed the last hook so it wasn't worth it.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGPRTZ D11 PREZ +37 339
#note No place for PATZER; this works.

#note Took me a while, had to figure I'd somehow stick him with the Q if he couldn't play it off (though he could -- QUA and AQUA were at least there, and it's not as if it'd be viable for me to play there).  DAW is outta the question because it gives too many counters.  If I *had* the blank, I'd try to set myself up, but it turned out to be the last tile in the bag.  Long story short, I'm pretty sure D(E)W is best 'cause blocking QU(A) or AQU(A), even if I see them, gives up too much.
>Rahn_McKeown: AINNQUU 5G NU... +6 386
#note Bogus (just GAUNT).  I see my out and am like 90% sure of it.  A big risk it turns out, 'cause if it's not good he has QUAI all set up to go and I probably lose.

#note :)
>Ryan_Fischer:  (ANQUI) +28 423
#note (Great ending to a great tourney.)  Don't ask me how I knew DYNAST.  I think, for once, playing video games has been educational.  :)
