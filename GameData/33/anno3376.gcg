>steve: ADEINRT 8F ANTIRED +70 70
#note Nice opening draw. TRAINED, DETRAIN, and ANTIRED are all about the same here.
>moh: AEMNRST F7 S.RMENTA +68 68
#note OK, so my opening draw is just as nice as Steve's, and I have lots of options, too. F7 S(A)RMENTA is the highest-scoring bingo, and it also opens the possiblity for a challenge if Steve thinks it takes an -S (it's the plural of SARMENTUM)
>steve: ABOT E11 BOAT +26 96
>moh: DDENNOY K5 DOY.NNE +44 112
#note The 2x3 seemed obvious, but D8 DYNODE 42 was about as good.
>steve: OPW D10 POW +33 129
>moh: DIINOPT J2 NITID +22 134
#note L1 PINTO seemed unnecessarily risky. J5 ID 17 is also reasonable.
>steve: EVX I1 VEX +40 169
#note Ouch! This is where the game starts to get away from me.
>moh: LLOOOPR E4 POLO +14 148
#note With this ugly draw there's nothing inspiring. I considered J10 ORLOP 21, but I didn't think opening the triple row made sense (but ORLOP wins the sim). 
>steve: CERY 4B CRE.Y +24 193
>moh: ILMNORV B2 MI.RON +24 172
#note MI(C)RON scores better than anything else and turns over tiles.
>steve: GJU A6 JUG +44 237
>moh: ??ADLTV 1A LoVAT +34 206
#note There were some bingos available, but using one of my blanks to hook O-MICRON holds up well in the sim against most of them. LoVAT leaves me down only thirty holding a blank and drawing to a bag with lots of bingo-prone tiles (three Ss unseen, plenty of As and Es).
>steve: EFT C3 F.ET +36 273
>moh: ?DHLSUW F2 WH. +20 226
>steve: EFQU I7 F.QUE +31 304
>moh: ?DEHLSU 15A LUDES +28 254
#note My opp decided to kill the only real bingo lane at just the right time--FIQUE blocked plays like HUStLED/DOYENNES. Considering the score, I should have given more thought to the sim winner 12K SHUL 26. Sadly, I was only about 90% sure that LEUD took an S, so I settled for LUDES for less.
>steve: ACEILSZ L1 ZEALS +52 356
#note Steve considered 10B ZIP 34, but couldn't pass up on the big score of L1 ZEALS 52. After all, it put him up over 100 points on a board with no real bingo lanes. How could it go wrong? 
>moh: ?GHIKOS 1L .IG +13 267
#note The 'obvious' play is 1L (Z)IGS 42, but once I did the math, I realized it was an obvious loser. After ZIGS, I'm down 60, and it's easy for my opp to block the bingos down columns N and O. So, holding the last S and a blank, I decided to set up a huge comeback spot. In the worst-case scenario, opp blocks the big plays down the O column and I settle for ZIGS next play. But there's a huge upside if my opp has to settle for a partial block (or maybe none at all).
>steve: ACI 4L .AIC +9 365
#note My opponent understandably wanted to prevent a big play from ZIG, so he thought he's throw a wrench in my plans for a bingo from the corner.
>moh: ?EHKORS O1 SHO.KERs +236 503
#note Yahooooooo!
>steve: AAEGIIU 9A AI +14 379
#note My opp was pretty shell-shocked at this point, having just been hit with my biggest play ever. Now it's just a matter of playing out the tiles.
