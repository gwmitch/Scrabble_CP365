#note KNOSP is what I'd normally play, but not against Quackle.  Maybe I'm overstrategizing here though.  I think the later moves in this game justify this decision, but sometimes it will also backfire in my face.  Out of all the moves in the game, this is the one I am the least sure about.

#note Quackle likes IMINO a lot.  I don't like it so much.  Maybe LINO i6 instead, but I don't mind GID too much either.
