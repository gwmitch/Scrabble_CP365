#note DORP is so much better.  Prevents him from lucking into an easy 30+ pts later.

#note Misscored as 25.  He made a one-point error elsewhere, too, which I have yet to find.

#note Ugh.  Well... my thoughts are... if he's got it, he's got it.  I can't block with this horrible rack.  That is, can't take out both S-hooks without creating something else.  I don't see (AW)EIGH, which is interesting, but gives an easy comeback.
>Francis_Anum: MO H13 .OM +15 341
#note This really helped me, taking out one S-hook (though it creates that M-lane).
>Ryan_Fischer: EGHIIIM 12K MI +15 374
#note I don't see H(O)MIE, but I think that's a pretty bad play.  So... I figure... if he has it from the M, so be it.  The TAU spot is much easier to hit, so I have to constrict it as best as I can.  My play only sims 4th (when I delete the plays that don't make any sense -- silly Quackle).  If he has something like (M)EDIANTS, he'd have SAINTED anyway, so what's a guy to do?
>Francis_Anum: AEFNS 1C .ANEFS +33 374
#note Phew.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGHIIT 2F HE +31 405
#note I kept looking at the MI(G) spot and saw HEIGHT (lacking that extra H, not that it would fit).  EIGHT was on the tip of my tongue, but couldn't quite pull it out.  A 6-point error, I think.
