>Steve: EIINTUZ 9A UNITIZE +73 73
>Lloyd: EEGINRS D6 GEN.RIES +70 80
#note The bingo that played in the A column would have been devastating to my winning chances in this game.
>Steve: ABEHIST A4 HABIT.ES +101 174
>Lloyd: ?EILMSU 13B MI.rULES +72 152
>Steve: EIOPTTW H11 TW.ET +36 210
#note Took a long time with this play. Duck says it was wasted, as the top four plays all come in with the same 69 percent winning percentage.
>Lloyd: ?AAEIRU 15H .AqUERIA +74 226
#note Lloyd goes bingo, bango, bongo to take the lead.
>Steve: AAEINOP 5D AEON +18 228
#note Purposely keeping the P back for the front hook possibility, and also to retain a consonant. APNOEA B1 is best, however. About a 17-point equity error.
>Lloyd: BD H7 B.D +24 250
>Steve: AHILPWY B3 WILY +40 268
#note With all the A's left in the pool I wanted to play WALY, but didn't have the certainty it was good.
>Lloyd: ADQ N12 QAD. +28 278
>Steve: AHMOOPT 4G OOMPAH +30 298
#note C1 TOOM makes for a nice set up, providing it remains. That seemed doubtful.
>Lloyd: VV K3 V.V +18 296
>Steve: DGGIRRT O10 GRID +22 320
>Lloyd: CO M13 CO. +25 321
#note Ominous play, figured he had the case S.
>Steve: AGKLORT 3B .ORK +22 342
#note GOT, C2 said to be best.
>Lloyd: EORT 3J O.ERT +25 346
>Steve: ACGLOTY 6F YO +29 371
#note N2 O(T)ALGY.
>Lloyd: JNX 11C J.NX +36 382
>Steve: ACFGLNT 10F AG +32 403
#note CALF 2G clearly best. 
>Lloyd: AEO 12H .O +7 389
#note Hoping to draw into a bingo.
>Steve: ACFFLNT 2G CAFF +36 439
#note Q likes blocking the S-hook with N(OD) 14L. I didn't want to give Lloyd another crack at the bag...
