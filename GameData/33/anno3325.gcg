>Noah: ADIKORU 8D KAURI +28 28
#note Missed DROUK, which I might have played. This sims better. 
>Lou_Miller: ABCEERR 7H ACERBER +67 67
>Noah: DEGOUWY K7 .OWDY +24 52
#note Looked at a bunch of options and had no idea what to do. Quackle would preer playing DOWRY, DOWERY or WORDY to this (which woud have worked out well with my next rack). It also prefers YUGA, BUOYED, and WO (I turned down WO). That said, this isn't a terrible play, there are just a lot of options that might be a bit better. 
>Lou_Miller: OOTW D8 .OTOW +24 91
>Noah: AAEGLNU C9 LAGAN +27 79
#note Not Quackle's favorite. It prefers GAUN, EUGLENA, EAU. I don't like any of those leaves that much to sacrifice points. I thought EU was decent. Maybe I am wrong. Quackle prefers GAUN by about 1.5%.
>Lou_Miller: AGILOT B10 GALIOT +42 133
#note Maybe Quackle prefers GAUN because of comebacks?
>Noah: EMNOSUV L11 OVUM +23 102
#note Didn't know the awesome bingo playing here! The only bingo I could think of was VENOMOUS. This is just fine for a non-bingo play.
>Lou_Miller: ADDX E5 ADD.X +38 171
>Noah: DEFMNOS 8M FEM +31 133
#note Didn't see MOONED, which scores signifcantly more than anythin else. 
>Lou_Miller: JT J6 J.T +28 199
>Noah: DINOSTZ D2 DITZ +39 172
>Lou_Miller: HIP A13 PHI +40 239
>Noah: EEFNORS 9M FE +25 197
#note Quackle thinks I should play these letters at 9I instead, keeping things more open.
>Lou_Miller: ACEHNRU O8 .ENU +12 251
#note Lou told me his rack here. I hate this play.
>Noah: EEINORS 2B IN.ORSEE +72 269
>Lou_Miller: ACEHRST 1I RACHETS +100 351
#note Um, RATCHES 1H?
>Noah: ??EELRY 3H RELaYEd +74 343
#note I didn't know bRACHETS, so couldn't play stuff like bERYL instead of this. Why do LEERilY and LEchERY win like 5% more than this. 
>Lou_Miller: ANQT 13K Q.ANT +28 379
>Noah: EEGIIOV 14J VI. +27 370
#note I champ playered it then many-plied the Champ's reslts. Champs prevers EVE 2L, Many-Ply likes this. What do you guys like?
>Lou_Miller: INO 4K ION +19 398
>Noah: BEEGINO F4 EGO +24 394
#note Unfortunately, I can't make Quackle know that I don't know BRACHETS, so I can't see if anything wins without knowing it. Does anybody see a win without knowing BRACHETS? BERG is obviously best.
>Lou_Miller: AILPSSU 1A SPA +21 419
#note SAU E12 is best. This is a bad play, he realized during the post-mortem.
>Noah: BEIN 6N BI +22 416
#note Correct.
>Lou_Miller: ILSU D8 .....S +19 438
>Noah: EN 9I NE. +18 434
#note Our score was off by six points-we got 444-438.
