#note NOUNAL leads to too many shootouts.  I'm not going to outplay Quackle on a shootout.  Again, NOUNAL is correct against 90% of the tournament field, but not against Quackle.  We're giving up 4 points now so that hopefully we can play the game on our terms.
>Opponent: DEEGNPT 8G PEG +12 12
>Kenji: AGLNOOV H4 GLOV. +11 11
#note Much better.  GLOVE because it makes it hard for Quackle to score.

>Opponent: AEIMNOO 3K NOMA +31 115

#note OVA delays the inevitable.  Maybe better, but I feel like delay plays like OVA are not good when behind.  NOOKIE 2f is better though.
