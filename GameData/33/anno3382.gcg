#note I chose this spot based on my exchange 3 to open theory... basically, it usually signals an S.  as I find out, in this case it didn't, but it seemed safer to leave the hook in a safer line than the Duck-approved 8G positioning.
>Stephen_Knapp: AEGIRT E8 .RIGATE +22 22
>Pete: ACDDEOR 14B COD.D +26 48
#note Duck fishes, I play through on a wide open board.  Want to prevent some kind of big play with the TLS at 14F.
>Stephen_Knapp: DLLY 12D D.LLY +26 48
>Pete: AAEEORU 11H AURAE +15 63
#note maybe I should have fished.  I hat these kind of draws. Duck likes EAU in two places... I went the turnover route.  
>Stephen_Knapp: AAJV 10C AJ.VA +23 71
>Pete: ?EEOOOR 13G OE +12 75
#note best.
>Stephen_Knapp: EGN 15F ENG +15 86
>Pete: ?BEOORS I2 BOOmERS +72 147
#note missing BORESOME for 4 some, but this does the job.  Took a minute to figure out what to declare the blank... M seemed safest.
>Stephen_Knapp: EEILNVW 4H W.VEN +30 116
>Pete: ?EIIINQ 7F QI +26 173
#note Well, that sencond blank came conveniently.  
>Stephen_Knapp: BHORT 12K BROTH +36 152
>Pete: ?AEIINO N6 IOdINA.E +61 234
#note Picking the inferior bingo, because despite how the spot at N14, it seemed safer than IDEATION.  Missed IBOGAINE.
>Stephen_Knapp: ADGOS 14J GOADS +38 190
>Pete: AEEMNPS 8L MA.E +24 258
#note Missed bingo #2 for the tourney.  PENNAMES.  I play to kill the last really dangerous spot on board... I'm thinking defense already.
>Stephen_Knapp: ERTTU 2I .UTTER +20 210
>Pete: ENPPSXZ J4 .EX +55 313
#note What a fun situation.  Easy X play, with the potential of two big Z spots if I catch right next turn.  At this point, I'm confident the game is in hand.
>Stephen_Knapp: OWY 1M YOW +34 244
>Pete: EFNPPSZ 3M PEP +33 346
#note Saved the Z play, to try to catch an A next turn.  PEP worked fine here.
>Stephen_Knapp: IL 13C LI. +15 259
>Pete: AFINSTZ 7L AZ.N +50 396
#note Catch my A.
>Stephen_Knapp: CHILNUU 13M L.I +19 278
>Pete: CFINSTU C9 C.N +8 404
#note better safe than sorry.  kill the last plausible line.
>Stephen_Knapp: EHIRSTU 8A HIS +24 302
>Pete: FIMSTU 7A UM +13 417
#note UM Values best, but some how gives steve a .04% chance of victory.  Huh?  
>Stephen_Knapp: ERTU 5I ..TER +14 316
>Pete: FIST 9M S.T +20 437
#note Missing FINS, which nets 1 better.
