>Pete: HILRTTW K5 THIR. +18 42
#note Bad miss here.  WIDTH is the no brainer play here I missed.  Stupid mornings.
>Steve_Krieger: CINV 7J V.NIC +11 26
>Pete: EHLRTUW -LUW +0 42
#note Duck goes for turn over with LUTHIER, or points with CHEW or HUH.  Being that it was morning, I choose the wildly wrong third option of exchanging.  
>Steve_Krieger: FOY 10F FOY +25 51
>Pete: EEHORRT 11G HETERO +32 74
#note Missed bingo #1... didn't know TORCHERE.  And I was all happy with my play here.  Pfft.
>Steve_Krieger: EORRS 12H SORER +33 84
>Pete: AADEFRR 13K FARAD +27 101
#note Missing AFAR, AFEARD... I catch cool word syndrome.  I know about 13 semi-cool 5's, so when I get to play one, I do.
>Steve_Krieger: AEIMM O8 MAIME. +36 120
>Pete: EGINORW I11 ..W +10 111
#note Fish, straight up fish.  Actually, right idea, just wrong execution.  WO L4 is best.
>Steve_Krieger: ?EEIJKS 5D JErKIES. +86 206
>Pete: EGINORY M2 YOGIN. +20 131
#note And, ouch, do I miss.  Y is the last tile I wanted.  Duck wants to fish again... I decided to start over with ER.  May not be duck approved, but I stand by the play.
>Steve_Krieger: OOW 6B WOO +23 229
>Pete: ELNRUVX N10 XU +54 185
#note I didn't see the hella-cool VERNIX, but the brainless XU actually turns out a bit better.  
>Steve_Krieger: IIII -IIII +0 229
>Pete: DELLNRV 7C DELL +22 207
#note Another miss at the H column... this time VERDIN.  Passed on the cool plays through the E column for DELL. 
>Steve_Krieger: AEPPU 9B PUPAE +15 244
>Pete: ENNRSVZ H4 Z.N +22 229
#note can't draw a vowel to save my life, can I.  ZIN is best here.
>Steve_Krieger: ACEL D9 .LACE +18 262
>Pete: EGNRSUV 14F VUGS +23 252
#note This might have been the pivotal play of the game... at least the ensuing draw was pivotal.  I wanted to block the line Steve had just opened, figuring that a bingo ended me.  VUGS keeps me close, uglies up the board, and with S? unseen. and if I catch?  well, I still have time.

>Steve_Krieger: AAGIOTT 4H .OA +16 278
>Pete: ?EENRTT 2F ENTREaT. +64 316
#note Well, that was a fortuitous draw.  Now, I just have to hope I can outrun to the finish line.

>Steve_Krieger: BEGIINT G1 E. +2 280
#note Steve fishes for the Bingo.  fortunate for me.  GENII would give him the best winning chances, especially considering how bad my rack was.  EN requires me be unable to block.
>Pete: AADIILU 1E ID.A +24 340
#note I chickened on AUDIAL, the best play.  IDEA worked well enough however.
>Steve_Krieger: BGIINST 3B BITING +32 312
>Pete: AILU 2B AL +14 354
#note I should learn some 5's one of these days.  PILAU goes out.  Steve ran overtime on his last play.
>Steve_Krieger: S D9 .....S +10 322
#note YOGINIS is one more.  
>Steve_Krieger:  (IU) +4 326
