#note Missed the much better placement at 2D. NEmATODE G8 also sims better, but I prefer my play.

#note After 2500 iterations, LOWER comes in second to OAR C11. I don't know if I saw/considered OAR at the time, but looking back I think I like it better. It moves towards potentially opening some bingo lanes.

#note After 14,000 iterations Quackle prefers TAP in the same spot. I can see the merits to this, not opening up that triple on a really closed board, maybe the leave (idk is AEORS>AOS)? This is really interesting and I honestly don't know which I prefer at this point. Opinions? Other plays?
>Martin_Weisskopf: CGI 10H CIG +15 298
>Phil: ADELOST C10 DOAT +23 286
#note Lots more simming and TOR 7H is on top. DOAT is my highest-scoring option, and being down 35 I was probably only thinking about points at the time. However, 6 in the bag is enough to play a pre-endgame, and TOR keeps a great leave and doesn't obstruct the DJIN hook. DOAT's leave doesn't look bad, but I should've realized the v/c ratio. I think TOR is the play here (Q's other choices are (PI)O(n) for 10 and DO B5. More interesting stuff.
>Martin_Weisskopf: EGP 1M PEG +25 323
>Phil: EKLNSTV M7 VENT +18 304
#note Champ. says VAIN D3 wins 28% of the time, with the next highest LEV B12 at 19%. VENT is pretty bad, at 8%. I have NO clue. What's my best hope here?
>Martin_Weisskopf: AF K11 FA. +20 343
>Phil: DEFKLSS B1 SKELD +32 336
#note He held, it's phony. Idk if I knew whether or not it was good at the time, but a challenge (if it's good) wins me the game, so he probably would let it be, allowing me to close the gap to save spread.
>Martin_Weisskopf: AEIRRUY B12 YIRR +23 366
>Phil: FS 6I F.S +13 349
#note Frustrating loss, I don't think I played that poorly at all.
