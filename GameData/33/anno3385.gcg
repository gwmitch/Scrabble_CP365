>Jason_Idalski: ABEMOUV 8F OVUM +18 18
#note In debating between this and ABOVE, I whiffed on MAUVE. Not the kind of mistake an 1800 should make. But OVUM sims very close. (-0.3)
>Pete: ?AENORT H8 .nORNATE +74 74
#note PZ: Nothing like an easy rack to start. Gets a chuckle and an "excellent find" from Jason. 
#note JI: I believe I said "outstanding find". :)
>Jason_Idalski: ABEGIKL G13 KAB +31 49
#note Didn't know GLAIKE(T) and chickened out on B(A)GLIKE, the star plays. At least I correctly passed on BLEAKING*! (-10.1)
>Pete: AABDINQ 14F Q.. +32 106
#note Thought of playing long with QINDAR, but decided on the one tile play.  Was hoping to 1: catch an eight, and 2: make jason think I was close, and tighten up while behind.  Duck agrees with me, for once.
>Jason_Idalski: EGIILPW 11D WIPE. +20 69
#note Hoping to bait him into wrongly S- hooking it, like Tangredi did to Gibson in Orlando. And another goofy word learned: PE(R)IWIG. (-10.1)
>Pete: AABDFIN D10 B.ANA +20 126
#note well, I missed the fish.  and my play, while stylish, is slightly suboptimal.  BAWD is safer and wins sim.
>Jason_Idalski: AEEGILR 15E GI.. +18 87
#note Took a while debating between this and GI(V)E. Glad Ducky says this is clearly preferred.
>Pete: ADFFILT C12 TIFF +31 157
#note PZ: Another easy play.  Me play good when the right answer smacks me in the face. 
#note JI: Scored as 32. My "rust" showed in that I didn't recount my opponent's plays like I usually do.
>Jason_Idalski: ACEELPR B6 REPLACE +68 155
#note The anagram, which I didn't know, is four more and gives less back. Don't like that ETA placement, but what else? Besides, BBFFGM is gone. Since I'm still behind even after the bingo, I don't mind making this a race to the Z. And maybe Pete panics and makes an inferior OA(F)-like play just to block the spot.
>Pete: ADDLRSU A7 DUAL +34 191
#note I note the hook at 12A mentally.  But DUAL is the easy choice here.  
>Jason_Idalski: EHHIRRT 7I HEH +24 179
#note Missed HITHER. Must've missed HIRER, too, which is kind of embarrassing. (-14.1)
>Pete: DGORSST 6H GODS +30 221
#note Of course, now I forget about the spot.  Jason's aggressive opening play distracted me, and I move to tie the new spot up.  Same word at A12 is best
>Jason_Idalski: IIJLRRT K4 RI..I +16 195
#note PZ: A very nice play here by Jason.  I started to wonder between his last play and this, if he was setting up an X play to the triple. 
#note JI: Pete will probably be stunned at my leave here. Maybe a little FPS, playing a newly learned five. I considered exchanging, but this just wasn't a bingo board ... why leave IRT or something? And I hate throwing the J back. Q likes the aggressive (N)ITRIL (or RI(F)). I like NITRIL. Turnover, turnover, turnover. Try to win the Z lottery. (-9.5)
>Pete: DENRSST L8 DENTS +21 242
#note PZ: Wow, this play kinda sucked.  The potential for IXTLE threw me off here. DINS/REPLACED is better, and kills the 12A spot that I have forgotten about. 
#note JI: Nice to know that 1) One of the two tiles Pete's keeping is an S and 2) He doesn't have the blank or Z.
>Jason_Idalski: AEJLRTX C3 LATEX +61 256
#note PZ: Well, my X suspicion was right... unfortunately I missed the other spot. 
#note JI: Drawing AEX into JLRT was luckbox. It was nice to sit there knowing I had a guaranteed 60 no matter what Pete played.
>Pete: IIIMRST D2 MIRI +20 262
#note PZ: And now, I give away the game, by missing the 12A spot one more time.  Bonehead move, and it costs me.  The 3 Is panic me here. 
#note JI: I didn't "Dunlop" him after the game and ask what his losing play was. He knew.
>Jason_Idalski: EJNRUYZ 4H JER.Y +46 302
#note As long as Pete doesn't bingo or block that Z spot, it's game, set, match.
>Pete: CIOOSTT E5 COT +20 282
#note Duck likes setting up the S hook here with CONTO and TONIC... never crossed my mind.
>Jason_Idalski: AILNSUZ A12 ZINS +92 394
#note PZ: And I pay for my idiocy.  A stretch where Jason score 199 points in 3 plays, without a bingo.  I deserved this loss. 
#note JI: Eh, I made my share of mistakes too. I was glad Pete was making wrong inferences by assuming I was playing like an 1800.
>Pete: ?DIOSTV 2D .ISVOTeD +65 347
#note PZ: The cute IVY gives me my best winning chances.  MISVOTED* got a hold, but it was a situation where I could have played just about anything, and Jason had to accept.  A lost challenge gives me a chance, while the 65 for the bingo pretty much ends the game. 
#note JI: Good spread saver. And I thought this was a perfectly cromulent word.
>Jason_Idalski: AAELNOU 1H LENO +24 418
#note LUNA is clearly better. (-1.2)
>Pete: EEEGNOW F6 WO. +29 376
#note Any tiny winning chances are killed by my last rack.  I take the points, and try to keep the spread reasonable... i foolishly thought it might matter this weekend.
>Jason_Idalski: AAORUUY K11 AURA +14 432
#note Did not realize the better setup I gave Pete. Wrong order; should've played AY at I12 first. AY wins by 55, this by 44.
>Pete: EEEGN 14K .GENE +12 388
#note Missing the better placement of GENE at j10.
>Jason_Idalski: OUY I12 OY +25 457
>Pete: E K11 ....E +5 393
>Pete:  (U) +2 395
