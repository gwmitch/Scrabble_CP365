#note If you give Quackle any decent leaves, Quackle becomes much more amenable to QUEAN.  I can't see JAM happening without at least a decent 4 tile leave

#note Trying to close up shop.  Looks pretty hard for Quackle to bingo.  Of course, Quackle proves himself to be superior to Kenji in the next few moves.

#note FLAK is a better option, although the sim likes FLAN better.  The simulation will of course overevaluate FLAN though, and is not representative of C player.
>Opponent: AEIIORR 15B RA.I +8 384
#note Again, a great example of the success of Championship player in the preendgame. 
>Kenji: AEELOSS 1H SLEA.E +27 374
#note Unfortunately, this is an example of the failure of Championship Player.
