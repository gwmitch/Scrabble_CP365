#note This was interesting, considering I knew his rack. I saw PRORATES, but assumed he didn't and wouldn't see it. Given that, I could played JEWS for 40, but I knew he had ORE as a bick comeback. JEW provides for OR, but I had WENT to counter.

#note I saw PLEDGETS and remembered in my mind that somehow it was good, but didn't trust myself. Stupid. OGLED D11 seems best.

#note KOI is slightly better; I wanted 3 vowels b/c 8/4 consonant/vowel in the bag.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: BEHIINR 6A .B. +11 325
#note He told me his rack after the game. This was a bold fish; EH 14E scores 30.
>Phil: ACELOTT 10L ATT +10 359
#note I had absolutely no idea what to do here. I had to assume worst case scenario; which is SENARII. Of course I totally blanked on the ED hook and only saw YUP, but that wouldn't have changed my inability to make a decision here. TAE 7L would have been a nice block that wins; I feared big H underlap plays though (SHRI and HERNS in this case).
