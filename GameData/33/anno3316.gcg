#note Win this game.  My big mistake thus far is probably trying to play through too many vowel-heavy racks, but I've done an okay job of hanging in there.  Now, I've gotta shut down the three lanes left whilst making it as hard as possible to bingo through what I leave.  So, since there are two left in the bag, any one-tile play I make has to block and give me a good chance to counter if he does bingo.  If I make a longer play, it has to kill all lanes and constrict as much as possible.  I first wanted to play BRANT for 16 vertically which turns out IS the best play.  The only other possibility is BRAN(T) for 14, which kills all three lanes left.  Only problem is it creates one more I considered, but didn't think it was very easy to hit -- through the B.  Anyone got any other bright ideas?  Facing down at LEAST ANTISER(A) and INTERAC(T), I don't see anything else, and Quackle sure doesn't.  That all depends on whether Bruce will find those.  He's more prone to finding "actual" words than "Scrabble" words, as this game will demonstrate.

#note And sure enough, he's got it.  The *only* bingo, well-deserved win.  (*cries*)
