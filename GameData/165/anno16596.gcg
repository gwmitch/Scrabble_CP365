#note poor play, as often happens in these overlap situations it's all about making the next overlap tougher - anything that blocks both 6B and 6F sims well. He turned over 5 tiles and he could've drawn not only the Z but also the J at 6B. Just OE at 6D looks reasonable, although quackle also suggests LEONE or ALONE at 6A.

#note this play sucks, I must just not have been looking at the other side (column N). BETIDE is 44 points! instead I score 13 less and leave garbage.

#note weird play, but this seemed good on this board with no lanes, since I might be able to luck into a bingo on row 9. bingo percentage surprisingly high at 30%.

#note should just take the cheap points for WIT at K4 and wait for him to open.

>JD: EEGORSV 15F GROVE +32 355
#note I should be in good shape, if I take the bottom row there are not that many huge scoring spots and I get to hold onto the S for row 11. quackle's only competitive suggestion with GROVE is VEGO at 13I, but I don't think it's right for me to gamble by creating such an easy scoring spot.
>Neil_Scott: ALNOPTTUYZ 13K YUP +31 372
#note it looked wrong from my perspective for him to empty the bag here, but he was in a lot of trouble - I can't remember his exact rack, we discussed it after the game. 
>JD: ABEEHKS 12H BEAKS +44 399
#note Very lucky to draw all the nice scoring tiles to go with my ES leave. this is my best endgame tied with SEEK at 11I, and if he doesn't play LAZO I get a few extra spread points.
>Neil_Scott: ALNOTTZ 13G ZOL +30 402
>JD: EH 8A HE +29 428
#note some sloppy play early in the game in the closed board positions (ALOE and ACE especially) but all in all a nice competitive contest.
