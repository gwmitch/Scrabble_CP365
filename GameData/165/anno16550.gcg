>Ben_Schoenbrun: BGINR 8D BRING +22 22
>Joshua_Sokol: ACFGILO E5 FLO.IC +22 22
#note (B)IFOCAL was what I was looking for. This is phony. Bnjy held to no avail. I missed F(R)OLIC haha
>Ben_Schoenbrun: AEILRU 5E .AILURE +20 42
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGGIKP F2 GIG. +10 32
#note Two hard turns to start things off. I considered PA(I)KI(N)G, and after way too long ended up playing this, thinking I could score next turn with my leave. It doesn't seem right, and I was having a lot of trouble this turn and last, which I didn't want to have against Ben.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: AIRSW L1 WAIRS +35 77
>Joshua_Sokol: AEKLNPT 1L .ALK +33 65
#note I was pretty sure this leave was inferior to ELPT, and that therefore (W)ANK was the play, but I wanted to set up some extensions I'm not sure Bnjy would see. But maybe this is better solely because of it being less possible to make an overlapping play at J2 for a ton.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: AFHU 10E .HUFA +21 98
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EENPTV 9I PrEVENT +72 137
#note Goddamnit, 3F (I)NcEPT(I)VE. I should have seen that but I was nervous after my first few plays, so I held on tight to PREVENT.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: ABEUY O5 BEAU.Y +33 131
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEELOT H10 .ELTED +33 170
#note L7 DE(V)OTE maybe?
>Ben_Schoenbrun: IRTW H1 TWIR. +27 158
>Joshua_Sokol: EENOOTX 11H .XON +34 204
#note I missed J1 OXTE(R) and I13 OXO for some reason. I think again that it was because of my anxiety, which I tried to control in all of my games.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: OZ 2J ZO. +32 190
#note At least this wasn't ZO(A)RIA.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEOSTV 12J DEVOTE +27 231
#note The game is basically over if I don't talk myself out of DEVOTEES for the stupidest reason, that being that DEVOUTS* is already a word and it would mean the same thing as DEVOTEES. There was so much wrong with that logic, and I think it must have been influenced by how nervous I was. 
>Ben_Schoenbrun: CENNOU 14H .NOUNCE +22 212
>Joshua_Sokol: AMMNOPS 15H .AMP +19 250
#note I missed N5 AMP, N4 PAM/MAP, N6 MM, because I was just so focused on closing this board down. The pool isn't amazing, but my play still seems to be quite decent. I just should have considered other options that didn't really defend as well. 
>Ben_Schoenbrun: AY N5 AY +30 242
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEMNOS 3J AM.DO +31 281
>Ben_Schoenbrun: ADIR 13L ARID +32 274
#note nice
>Joshua_Sokol: EJNRSST M8 J.T +10 291
#note Here is the turning point of this game. The Q is something I fear, a bit more than bnjy even since he probably has the blank. I therefore want to be able to outscore and not draw the Q. The pool has basically no bingos that play, so after a while I ceased to consider playing R(ENOUNCE)S, basically making it impossible for bnjy to bingo if there even is something in the pool. I also didn't want to play more tiles so as to increase my chance of drawing the fatal Q. He has just drawn half of the remaining tiles and hesitated to do so, so I can infer from that that he did not have the Q on ARID pretty well. Looking at the details now, bnjy has OESTRIO(L), LITHOSO(L) and INOSITO(L) that play through the L. He then has 23 options that end in T. playing JE(T) or JES(T) kills any bingo he can draw, and playing R(ENOUNCE)S reduces his bingo% by a ton. R(ENOUNCE)S therefore seems like the right play, since I can still outscore much more easily after it, whereas after using my only vowel it would be hard to pull off a win. My play wasn't as good as I expected because of all of the options bnjy had to bingo next turn that I didn't account for. 
>Ben_Schoenbrun: ?EHIOST 13A THEOrIS. +72 346
#note N9 (N)O has the best winning percentage actually. Very interesting. mOTHIES(T) and HOOTIES(T) are better options than THEORIS(T).
>Joshua_Sokol: EENORSS 14B ERN +20 311
#note At least I found a best sequence.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: IQ 3E Q. +11 357
