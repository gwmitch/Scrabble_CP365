>JD: ?AAENOT -AO +0 0
#note Thacha suggested just exchanging an A to reduce volatility, but I figure I actually want to pick up some high-pointers so that my eventual bingos are worth more.
>Thacha: BGINOOZ H4 BOOZING +94 94
#note guh
>JD: ?AEJNTV 10F JA. +27 27
#note quite the draw. if I was sure about BOOZINGS# I would've tried harder to keep that hook open, although I think JAG is still better than TAJ.
>Thacha: AAIRV I3 VARIA +33 127
>JD: ?ENTTUV F10 .UT +10 37
#note quackle prefers BATTU, the board shape after that play concerns me but it's probably still a little better than JUT.
>Thacha: PUY E11 YUP +28 155
>JD: ?ELNOTV J7 sOLVENT +78 115
#note boozings# would net me 9 more points.
>Thacha: AQT D10 QAT +36 191
>JD: AINNORT K11 NOIR +16 131
#note situation is already bad, quackle's fave is ON at G4, but then he gets to play across there and the board seems very dead. I get rid of some good letters but at least I bifurcate the board with this play.
>Thacha: ACEEOST 15E COATEES +82 273
>JD: AENOOTY 14F YAE +31 162
#note TOYO wins a sim by a little bit, but it's very hard to imagine toyo getting me back into a game. figured I would wait to open with OBA next turn and just take the points. Q likes playing YEAN too, saying that the N never helps me bingo more next turn, but still seems more apt to lead to a bingo long-term.
>Thacha: AGIR 3I .IRGA +18 291
>JD: FNOOOTW G3 OOF +18 180
#note my winning percentages are down to very little, but I don't think it's time to throw in the towel yet (in this case, playing FOOTWORN at 5C). I think OOF gives me some nonzero chance of bingoing twice (what I need at the minimum to catch up).
>Thacha: CDEIMR L7 CRIMED +35 326
>Thacha: UX (challenge) +5 331
#note not an unreasonable challenge since it turns out to be CSW (DERMIC/CRIMED#) and I need a break.
>JD: BDENOTW M9 TOWED +39 219
#note I did not know the delightful NOWED# -> UNOWED# combo until now!
>Thacha: UX 2J XU +52 383
>JD: BENNPSU 4K BUNN +25 244
>Thacha: ?ADEERT O2 TAsERED +77 460
>JD: EHILNPS 2A PLENISH +88 332
>Thacha: EMW 1G WEM +38 498
>JD: ADFIKLL 3B IF +22 354
#note I played IF emptying the bag because I was concerned about him being able to bingo out with PERISHES (2/36), but KEF at C1 still takes out SLEIGHER (4/36) and HERESIES (1/36) and makes it easier to play out in the rest of the endgames (saving at least DIAL at N7). I also give free points on column A for him to score.
>Thacha: EEGIRSS A1 S.RIG +33 531
#note thacha saw his best endgame.
>JD: ADHIKLL 1C KID +25 379
#note 5 points better to play the awesome KHANDA# at M1 blocking see.
>Thacha: EES 5K SEE +25 556
>Thacha:  (AHLL) +14 570
