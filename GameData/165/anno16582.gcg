#note geoff was making good moves but taking a really long time to do so. I should've tried to fast-play him more.
>JD: ?CEFFNS F8 ..FF +20 76
#note believe it or not, I saw EFFERENCES# and passed it up because I could just play BAFF. too bad, it would've been fun to play my first csw 10. BAFF even sims better anyway though.

#note tricky collinses! I missed the saving play here and made my worst mistake of the tourney so far...tacking on the GU for GUQIN#. CHAV at K10 is also not an awful try given the deadness of this board, and prevents him from simply killing the board with a play on row 10. I have no idea why I threw away the C here either, seems like it could definitely help me score.

#note this is definitely not a place I wanted to be in this game.
>Geoffrey_Newman: STUU 4F UTUS +21 218
#note I didn't even realize I had set up SWIZ# until after he played it, collins board vision failure.

>JD: AEINOST --  -67 174
#note I was mega-frustrated and failed to do what I should've, which is either play IO for 4 or CIAO for 18 (likely the latter). instead I just decided to make up words.
>Geoffrey_Newman: OX 5I .OX +26 244
>JD: AEINOST H12 .IAO +18 192
#note I could also just play off an O at H3, but he's too likely to have one of the hook letters.

#note he had LIVEDO# for a lot of points.

#note I was starting to have visions of a comeback by hitting the L, but him hitting it is awful for my chances. YWIS at 6G is cute (YBET# is hard to see) but I think my best chance is likely just fishing the W and drawing for LYSOGENY, with backup draws to NOSEGAY and ERYNGOS. wish I had considered it.

>JD: CEGNSUY 3F GUY +19 262
#note I liked this play a lot because it creates two great lanes (row 2 and row 5). he's likely to play at row 5, but it seemed to give me a fighting chance.

#note a really dreadful game after three consecutive losses in which I thought I had played alright. Pretty disheartening for this stage of the competition. At the same time, this loss was partially due to my lack of familiarity with the lexicon. Still, the worst that can happen is letting my attitude take away winning chances - and I think that happened when I failed to identify my fish and played WO.
