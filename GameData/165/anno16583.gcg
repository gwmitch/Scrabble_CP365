#note I saw drepanid but figured I'd go for the big points...
>Dylan_Early: XZ B8 Z.X +35 147
#note I was devastated when my last play came back no good. I was completely certain of PINDARI and that PINDAR* hooked, and so for the rest of the game I convinced myself that SCARIOUS was no good. It had started to be looking like a big win to get myself back on track, and instead I lost a turn on a word I was almost 100% on. 
>JD: ?ADINPR D8 P.NIARDs +76 224
#note I was shaken up by the PINDARS* incident and whiffed on PRANDIAL.
>Dylan_Early: DDLOY 14B OD.LY +36 183
>JD: EGIRTUW 13B WI.E +27 251
#note I was pretty sure about TWIRE# but again due to PINDARS* I decided to pass it up.
>Dylan_Early: ADEMNTU 15F UNTAMED +91 274
#note things were starting to take a turn for the nightmarish on this seemingly dead board
>JD: GIJRTUW 14I JUT +29 280
>Dylan_Early: ADIQ C11 QA.. +27 301
>JD: GIPRSWY 10G GIPSY +30 310
#note having now successfully convinced myself that SCARIOUS wasn't a word, I sacrifice 25 points on this stupid turn.
>Dylan_Early: EGNT L3 GENT +29 330
>JD: CEERRVW C4 CREWE. +29 339
#note it was starting to feel like I could play scrabble again. CREWEL gives back a ton of points if he has one of the two Hs but also flips over another tile in search of the blank. Q prefers REWED.
>Dylan_Early: ?BEILMO 1E EMBOILs +99 429
#note this was one of the worst moments I can remember in my scrabble career. as he put down scarious it dawned on me that it was a word after all. I insta-challenged because EMBOILS# looked stupid, but if I'd not been so frustrated I might have seen that he had OBELISM for more points.
>JD: AELOORV A9 .OE +15 354
#note I can give up and cut spread, but I saw that I had a good chance of drawing OVARIAL at N9, and if he just plays a long word to empty the bag I could bingo out and win.
>Dylan_Early: AADGHO 5A DA.OGHA +24 453
>Dylan_Early: AAFIIR (challenge) +5 458
#note this was not a word I had seen before.
>JD: AFHLORV 13J FAVOR +33 387
#note ovarial would in fact have won me the game, but in this universe I draw FH. Given what I can see from his final rack, and assuming that his 7th tile was a random tile from those 6, I had a 8/126 chance of winning (~6%). maybe that's not significantly higher than just playing VOCAL last turn at 4A and hoping to draw a miracle bingo.
