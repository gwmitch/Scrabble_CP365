#note my first bingo miss of the tournament, APOSITIC# was outside of my study range although I do know APOSITIA# (aversion to food)

#note It was not my instinct to expect that ACST would be better than ACNS, but it is by about 1.2 in static and offers 5% more bingos in this position. however, the best-simming play is just NED at E11, which doesn't shock me - the significant upgrade in bingo percentage makes it worthwhile (maybe I'll hit PACTIONS now if I'm really lucky).

#note INDULTS gives up huge counterplays, with perfect knowledge of collins, I like quackle's suggestion of BAST at J7 setting up BASTI# and a likely out-bingo.
>Blue_Thorogood: ?EEEIRU D2 .EE +12 371
#note not sure if quackle is playing the slowplay right, his play looks reasonable.
>JD: OOOQR O8 OOR +19 536
#note I shouldn't be in any hurry to play off my tiles since he is likely to slowplay me the rest of the way.
