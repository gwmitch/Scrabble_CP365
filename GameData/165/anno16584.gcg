>JD: EGHLLNR 8G HELL +14 14
#note after a miserable sequence of two games I needed a good game to get back on track. instead, I played this weird game where neither of the two of us ever seemed to draw decently. At least Mohammed was a really good sport about it.
>Mohammed_Inayatullah: MUY 9E YUM +21 21
>JD: ?GNNPRS H7 N.P +16 30
#note I was pleased with being able to find YUMP# after it had given me lots of trouble in study.
>Mohammed_Inayatullah: ACFIL J6 CA.IF +24 45
>JD: ?DGNRSV -GNV +0 30
#note quackle suggests playing through, but I don't think the sim would account properly for the extremely closed board shape. at the very least, with no vowels to play throuh I should also throw back the D.

#note I figured I would set up GRIDDER in case he didn't know it.
>Mohammed_Inayatullah: EEIIKSS 8B SEIK +18 63
#note just playing EIK would be a nice idea here.
>JD: EEIIOTT -EIIOT +0 107
#note TOEIEST# looked like a bad play so I just exchanged. In reality though, there's not much of a point in exchanging because keeping a leave of EIOT or EEIT is not really that much worse than ET, so I should take the points. I should either play ION for 13 or on the left side, significantly lowering his bingo percentage. All of those plays give back big X plays but that's not a huge concern. TIE at 9A is my play of choice now.

>JD: AAIRTTT (challenge) +5 176
#note I believe I saw TAWNEY and passed it up due to cheap X plays at 14F, but maybe I shouldn't be so scared of those since there should be counterplay for me.

#note thus began the part of the game where neither of us could draw reasonably

#note lucky to draw a consonant to salvage the rack
>Mohammed_Inayatullah: EOU 5C .OUE +8 202
#note the vowels are disappearing extremely quickly...
>JD: ACEFGIW 15F WAG +27 295
#note there are only 8 unseen vowels in the pool out of 28 tiles now. interestingly, FEW is a big upgrade because it has a much higher chance of getting redeemed into a bingo draw (20% after FEW, sub-10% after WAG). this is an interesting part of leave-space - ACGI is better than CEGI by .5 according to static leave, but those leaves also improve by a whole point from TWL to CSW (presumably because there are more bingos with them) whereas CEFI, my choice of leave, doesn't actually improve at all going to CSW. In any case, I failed to recognize the decency of ACGI as a leave which comes from the increased bingo percentage.
>Mohammed_Inayatullah: EORSZ O8 ZEROS +50 252
#note this is about the best that could've happened, since he used the case S and apparently couldn't play at B2.
>JD: CEEFIOR 6F FE +26 321
#note hoarding vowels

>Mohammed_Inayatullah: ABT 1H BAT +31 283
>JD: ADDGJNU 3J DUNG +16 404
#note DUNG at H3 accomplishes the same goal of blocking out-bingos, missed ALU

#note it was a relief to finally end my 5-game losing streak and play decently.
