#note Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. G6 BE(NE)FITED. I looked there too
>Matt_Graham: EEHZ 2J HE.ZE +50 136
>Josh: BEORRTX 1H BRO +20 71
#note I considered 5H BRO(OD), but I didn't think it would work. Although if I draw an A I'm in business with L3 (T)AX and he would have to destroy his rack to block a lot of the time. 
>Matt_Graham: AO M1 A.O +33 169

#note 10I EX is interesting.

>Josh: EELRSTT 3D LETTERS +65 161
#note Didn't know two of the anagrams. Not sure the 72 points are worth it.
>Matt_Graham: ELR O2 .....LER +42 241
#note I held this but let it go since I thought I had remembered that SWIVELLER was good. Damn it. That's twice.

>Josh: AEILNPR A1 PEARLIN. +86 317
#note Funny thing is that when I played BERNIeS* I drew really badly afterwards.
>Matt_Graham: OPW 7F WOP +27 311
#note POW is better and Matt realized it after he hit the clock.

#note B6 FO(A)M? Seems better
>Matt_Graham: HNNO 4G OH +20 355
#note He had two n's here. AZO(N)/(I)N was something he missed, and it's better.
>Josh: DIMMSUV 10L VIMS +30 411
#note At least he liked his phony.
>Matt_Graham: KO 9M KO. +27 382
>Josh: CDDMNTU B8 .D +3 414
#note I really think I'm supposed to block. Maybe not.
>Matt_Graham: NO 10A NO +10 392
#note ON.
>Josh: CDDMNTU 4L .NT. +17 431
#note not good but it wins. We were both quite low on time, Matt more than me.
>Matt_Graham: ?AAEINT 2C A. +4 396
#note 30 seconds left for matt. M6 A(YE).
>Josh: CDDMU 7C M. +14 445
#note I had a minute left and I had two easy wins. I thought he was going to try to nickel and dime me so I played one tile. Boy was that disastrous.
>Matt_Graham: ?AEINT H7 ...INATEd +33 429
>Matt_Graham:  (CDDU) +16 445
#note I should have won this by more than 150.
