>Josh: EEFLORW H4 FLOWER +32 32
#note Played this because of the three-letter extensions that Larry probably wouldn't go for. I should have played FOWLER cause of BATFOWLER that Larry didn't know and giving back less points.
>Larry_Sherman: ACIRU 5C CURIA. +16 16
>Josh: EORSTVV F4 V.VE +18 50
#note F2 VOT(I)VE. Scored as 17

#note then again, he can just get the maximum points possible in the spot I opened :(
>Josh: DEILOTW D12 WO +22 276
#note I talked myself out of O(U)TWILED. It just sounded so bad... I also missed (OD)D plays as well as D7 TWO. Urgh...
>Larry_Sherman: AAAA -AAAA +0 218
>Josh: DEHILOT C9 HOLED +40 316
#note I also talked myself out of LITHOED. I missed (OD)D/DHOTI and overestimated IT.

>Larry_Sherman: ABO B9 OBA +28 309
>Josh: AEGLNNS A5 GLEAN +24 417
