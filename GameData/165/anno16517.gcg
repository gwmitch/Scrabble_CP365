>New_Player_1: ENSTTUX 15H TUXES +46 241
#note F12 TUX. UNISEX is a cool play I missed, though TUXES is better because of the double T leave.

#note Trying to keep the most bingo-prone leave, but LUNA 14G wins 10% instead of this, at 5%.

>New_Player_1: ALNORST 15N SO +23 311
#note I've given up on trying to win at this point, since that is virtually impossible. The best play, ALTHORNS, which I forgot about, wins less than 0.5% of the time. I think going for points makes the most sense here.

#note Best, though fishing off the C and the L would be great leaves, they're useless on this board.
