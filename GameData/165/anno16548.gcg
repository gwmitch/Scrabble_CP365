>Sam_Towne: ?ADENOS 8D DEAcONS +68 68
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEGIJS D4 JIBE. +30 30
#note knew it was close between this and 7C JIB, so I decided to keep the board a bit more open and give back less at the same time
>Sam_Towne: AGILOOR J2 GOORAL. +14 82
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEGSU 2J .AUGE +14 44
#note I failed here. Didn't like SUPERAGE*, forgot it was PUGAREES, didn't know REGAUGES, missed REARGUES, etc.
>Sam_Towne: AAACINO E3 CONI +29 111
#note Sam said he didn't realize this opened BIZ.

Sam: NAOI 1L and OCA(R)INA 5G are better, I really should not keep AAA
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIRSTU O2 SUITERs +79 123
#note STUIvER
>Sam_Towne: IIIII -IIIII +0 111
#note Sam: Had AAAAIIL, kept AL
>Joshua_Sokol: CIINORW N6 WO +28 151
>Sam_Towne: AADHLNR M2 .ARLAND +30 141
#note I held this word I had never seen before
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIINRV H4 VIRI.N +13 164
#note I knew this was wrong. I missed (N)IRVANIC. I also missed INVAR L8. I also missed (CONI)N(E) to block BIZ bombs, so V(E)NA. I also took way too long on this turn
>Sam_Towne: EHOOPTZ F6 ZO. +66 207
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDMVWY L1 D.MA +26 190
#note Not a great draw. 3I V(O)W is clearly superior
>Sam_Towne: EEEHOPT K5 EH +19 226

>Sam_Towne: DEEFOPT H11 OPTED +38 264
>Joshua_Sokol: AABCERV 13B ABREAC. +28 231
#note I didn't know (P)RECAVA. 4D (JO)B bingos with a lot of the bag because of PRECAVAE/PRECAVAL
>Sam_Towne: EEEFFNP 12D EFF +32 296
#note I knew he didn't have the X when he played this, or else he would have played it earlier than he did. 

Sam: This time I am aware of the hotspot I'm creating, but I didn't see a decent alternative. The likelihood of Josh having EX is pretty low anyway.
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIQUVY B11 QU.Y +32 263
#note b11 HE(A)VY is something I failed to consider. I like it.

Sam: I like it too.
>Sam_Towne: EEINPSS 15H .ISPENSE +86 382
#note Before playing this Sam showed me the word PENISES on his rack. He wins

Sam: teehee
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIIIRV N10 HIVER. +40 303
#note ha, if this is good Sam might lose. 

Sam: Held this, hated it, but figured I had the win in hand so I let him have it.
>Sam_Towne: ALLTTUX L10 LUXAT. +26 408
#note no E, lucky me
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIIMNT J10 TINGE. +11 314
