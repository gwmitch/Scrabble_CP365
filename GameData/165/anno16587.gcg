>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: EMNTY 8D MEYNT +26 26
#note my confidence was still low in my first matchup against a singaporean of this tournament.
>JD: BBLNNSV -BBLNV +0 0
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: AEIRSTX H6 EX.RAITS +66 92
#note he had MATRIXES for an extra 20. note that this is CSW.
>JD: ?AINNOS D2 ONANIS.s +68 68
#note I had studied PIANINOS# but it was beyond me to find it here.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ?ADGIIU 12D AUDI.InG +68 160
>JD: ADEHOQY E11 Q.AYD +36 104
#note in need of some volatility to start my comeback, I am mystified as to why I didn't leave off the D - there are only two other ones and I set up an almost certain 50 point+ shot for next turn (turn average of 53). missed chance.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ACEV 15A CAVE. +36 196
>JD: AAEHOTT G5 THA.A +28 132
#note there are so many Es remaining at this point that I bingo more next turn keeping AOT than EOT. I could also play TAHA to create a new lane that might come in handy.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: DFILNO 2A INF.LD +28 224
>JD: DEELOTW A1 W.LED +30 162
#note I am already at a big deficit, so perhaps I should consider leaving column A open...but it just seemed to leave a huge play for Zhi Yuan without really giving me great chances.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ABJU 13B JUB. +30 254
>JD: AEEOOPT I5 OPE +25 187
#note I could also play a word I didn't know, STOOPE# at 13H to add a lot of volatility to the board, but this should not be much worse. just need to draw a bingo.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: COPRS J2 CROPS +32 286
#note from this move onwards he did a pretty effective job of shutting the board down. STOOPE may have worked out better to open a new quadrant.
>JD: ABEORTU C2 .UB +24 211
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ETW K3 EWT +29 315
>JD: AEIORRT L1 RIOT +25 236
#note ROE at L2, which I almost picked, creates some kind of lane on column M with OWER#, but I was frustrated and just took the points.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: GGUV K10 VU.G +18 333
>JD: AEEMNOR 13J O.AM +15 251
#note fishing one tile off doesn't seem like it will win me the game, there are enough tiles in the bag that I was hoping to maybe bingo twice in a row by creating a new lane.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: EKR 1F ERK +24 357
>JD: AEEEINR 10J E.E +8 259
#note I could try EE at 14M but it seemed too easily countered.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ILL 1L .ILL +12 369
>JD: AEEFINR F10 FI. +26 285
#note keeping AEIN by playing REF makes me more likely to bingo.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ENOORSZ M4 SNOOZER +82 451
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: HIT (challenge) +5 456
#note I challenged out of frustration
>JD: AEEGNOR 8K GA.ER +48 333
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: HIT 14L HIT +21 477
#note two games into the day and I had played poorly and remained 3 games below .500, although in this one I did not do anything too egregious except for playing QUAYD instead of QUAY.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan:  (ENO) +6 483
