>Josh: BCDESSV -BCV +0 0
#note This move is more trivial than I thought at the time. I would really rather not play DEVS or throw an S in the bag for my opponent. I considered keeping the C over the D, but I didn't think it would yield many options if I didn't draw into a bingo. 
>Tim_Weiss: EPZ 8G ZEP +28 28
>Josh: ?DEHSSW J5 SWiSHED +88 88
#note or SWaSHED.
>Tim_Weiss: DENY K10 DENY +25 53
>Josh: ABEIKRV K4 VIE +21 109
#note 9D KIVA looks good. I wanted to play a bit of defense. 
>Tim_Weiss: AQT 9F QAT +27 80
>Josh: AABKRSY L11 YA +21 130
#note Anyone for 12K (N)ARKY? I didn't know it anyway.
>Tim_Weiss: EI 4K .IE +12 92
>Josh: ?ABKNRS M3 B.ARSKiN +78 208
#note Ridic draw, only bingo. I really had never seen this played but it made sense. 
>Tim_Weiss: OP 8M .OP +27 119
>Josh: LMNRRTX 9L M.X +20 228
>Tim_Weiss: ITV 13H TIV. +11 130
>Josh: ELNRRTU F9 .UERN +16 244
#note Chickened out on RUNLET, and I wanted to shape the board and defend overall, hence my play.
>Tim_Weiss: OO H13 .OO +9 139
>Josh: CELRRTU 15G C.URT +7 251
#note This play seemed perfect, lots of I's for a (COURT)LIER draw, blocking the most dangerous and only really plausible line...
>Tim_Weiss: ALR N2 LAR +17 156
>Josh: AELLMRU O1 LAM +24 275
#note I think I need to block here. I considered MEAL, but I thought that he would be more likely to have a bingo ending in a vowel than an eight ending in AL. Maybe I should just play MURAL up top anyway.
>Tim_Weiss: AOTT 1K TOTA. +10 166
#note Threat removed.
>Josh: EEILORU 15G .....LIER +36 311
>Tim_Weiss: DEGIO 2H GEOID +14 180
>Josh: EFGNOTU H2 .OUGE +8 319
#note Was all set to play FOUNT/FOU E11, but I wanted to remove yet another threat, albeit unlikely he will be able to capitalize on it if I indeed don't block. I just wanted to minimize freak occurances. This probably cost me some spread anyway.
>Tim_Weiss: EEJRS 14B JEERS +45 225
#note Yeah :(

>Josh: IINNOTU N8 ..O +16 389
#note This won all the time, accounting for any bingo he could come up with, but I don't know if it draws into anything. Other plays are simming better than this, but I really didn't know what bingos were possible with the pool.
>Tim_Weiss: ABGHIIN 5C GIBIN. +20 282
