>Pakorn: AGOY H7 YOGA +16 16
#note my first time playing one of the best players in the world! exciting stuff.
>JD: ?DDEGRR I2 GRiDDER +69 69
#note he held me on this for awhile, which was surprising until I realized that he holds on many of his opponents' plays.
>Pakorn: AACIU 2I .UAIAC +22 38
#note pakorn is super-intimidating to play against because he takes so damn long at the beginning of the game that you think he must be playing perfectly. he took at least five minutes to play this with a terrible rack.
>JD: AAEEENV G6 VENAE +26 95
>Pakorn: KORU F10 KORU +35 73
>JD: AEINPSU 12C UNP.AISE +72 167
#note fortunately pakorn gave me just the tile I needed.
>Pakorn: EJLY J10 JE.LY +39 112
>JD: EEHIPRU 4D EURIP. +20 187
#note this play took me a lot of work to find. I was quite proud of it but it started to get me in some time pressure the rest of the way. but PUH at 13A also takes out some bingos by removing the KORUN hook, which I unfortunately hadn't spotted.
>Pakorn: AELQZ E3 Q.EZAL +48 160
>JD: BEHIOTT 3K BOTH +35 222
#note betraying some of my collins inexperience here, I jumped at the chance to undouble the T but it looks better just to play BOH and not open row 1 for scoring (ICH/ACH/OCH/ECH) and maybe a huge play if he has the case B or G. not a huge error though, 
>Pakorn: BHOO 1L BOOH +55 215
#note amazing how fast my lead evaporated.
>JD: EEEINTT F2 TI.E +19 241
#note not an awful play except for 2 things: 1) I was completely unaware of STIRE# (damnit! how is that a word!) and 2) I had not yet spotted KORUN, in spite of being in the Czech Republic. my play basically leaves me needing to hit either row 14 or row 1 to win.
>Pakorn: ADD K10 ADD +37 252
>JD: EEGNRTT L8 TEG +16 257
#note biggest error of the game, with the blank unseen playing REGENT is crucial (not gerent because there are 5 Is left). again, not seeing korun forced me to get into a position where I'm effectively fishing.
>Pakorn: EFIISW 1A WIFIES +44 296
>Pakorn: ?ALNNST (challenge) +5 301
>JD: EEFNRRT M7 REF +22 279
#note really must bingo now, tref seemed too easy to block because he can just play on column N. it does help me get more bingos on the board though. also I finally spotted korun.
>Pakorn: ?ALNNST N9 STANNeL +72 373
#note he chose this lane because he was worried about comebacks on row 15.
>JD: ACEMNRT 14A CREMANT +87 366
#note I have a chance!
>Pakorn: IIIMOTX O14 XI +41 414
#note he didn't try that hard on this endgame because he didn't have to, but DIXIT leaves MICO/MILO.
>JD: LNOOSVW 9B VOLS +33 399
#note I worked hard on this endgame, this blocks MIOTIC and saves a good out for next turn.
>Pakorn: IIMOT M11 MOIT +31 445
#note or MICO#
>JD: NOW 15G OWN +20 419
#note 444-420 final, all in all I think I put up a good showing but a couple of small mistakes did me in.
>JD:  (I) +2 421
