#note Michael came back from lunch a few minutes late. I think he had 18 minutes left. Positioning is as good at 8F as at 8H.

#note shortest word with all of these letters - CLANSWOMAN#. I thought it would be even between GNAWN and UNLAW# but UNLAW# wins by a lot because AGN? gives a great opportunity at a 3x3, and he is not that likely to block column A.

#note there's not really a need to play conservatively at this point, I saw CODES but I figured I would try to add some spread. WOCK at M1 does the same thing but scores two more points.
