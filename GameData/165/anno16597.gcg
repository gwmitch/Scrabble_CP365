#note for the third time this tournament, I bingo when there was no need for me to - just ZED for 54 holding the blank should be better. bingoing certainly won't hurt my winning chances too much though.

#note I now needed to find a way to block GRANITIC in case he saw it, but it took me awhile to spot BOOZED!

#note bingo miss number 2 of the tournament, again a CSW bingo I'd never seen before - SNEESHAN#, variant spelling of SNEESH (TWL, smelling tobacco), also SNEESHIN#/SNEESHING#

>JD: ELNNRST L4 N.N +6 303
#note if I know LENTI# this is an easy play, but instead I figured I would try to interfere with his bingo chances. I thought ELRST was much more likely to lead to a bingo, but quackle thinks LORN is worth playing to make it harder to overlap for a bingo.

#note I draw a bingo 5/8 (O, R or W), but there's no real need for me to create another lane since he can never block anyway (although I don't know if I had seen TWAITES# over the board, maybe just TAWIEST#) and instead I am just giving him free points.

#note the afternoon of day 2 was my best stretch of play since the morning of day 1, although it was more characterized by drawing very well than anything else. outbingoing opponents 22 to 11 is a nice way to get to a 7-1 day. I was now 9-6 in the tournament.
