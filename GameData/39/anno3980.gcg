#note This play worked out poorly, but I don't think it was all that bad. I was loath to use my E with only 1 left, and I didn't see any great Z plays. ZED D3 definitely didn't seem right. The sim winner (never on my radar) is YELD 13G, a good defensive move with the chance of ZINE/ZONE next turn.

#note I thought about LUTZ C12, and maybe that's the best shot, but I judged that I could afford a waiting move.
