#note BISK is a very reasonable alternative.  I totally forgot it was a word.

>Dave: AEHHNVW 1A WHA +34 177
#note There are several reasonable alternatives here, though there's nothing particularly wrong about this move.
>Dan_Stock: GGOY G8 .OGGY +14 229
#note A perplexing move, especially since he had BOGY for a much better score.  Considering his next move, it is plausible that he might have had the Q on this turn and wanted to turn over more tiles to help it.  However, this play definitely makes things easier on me.

#note I don't know for sure how many tiles Dan traded here.
>Dave: ADEGILR N8 DRAGLI.E +62 368
>Dan_Stock: AIJO O5 JIAO +42 334
#note Ridiculous luck for me that he had to trade, I drew another bingo, and he had neither an E nor a U.
>Dave: AADINSS 15L DI.S +28 396
#note Considering that the remaining tile pool is almost all consonants, it's crucial to take out this spot.  Sure enough, Dan told me afterward that he had FLEX here.
>Dan_Stock: LY E4 ......LY +44 378
#note This nice play makes the score close, but the endgame is almost hopeless for Dan because his remaining tiles are so much worse than mine.  Still, I wanted to be careful about timing going into the endgame.
>Dave: AADINRS 6N A. +4 400
#note Considering the drek left in the bag, I didn't want to play long too soon and possibly draw two or three clunkers that would stop me from playing out in one, so one aspect of this move is to temporize.  Also, the X was his only chance to get back in the game, so I looked for the most likely places for him to use it and came up with 6N and 4D-F (BOX/COX/FOX/POX).  Anything else was likely to give me a big comeback off the X (e.g., if L12 EXED, I can front hook the S).  I figured the worst case scenario for me was if I left two in the bag and allowed him to play the X at 6N.  If I forced him to play at 4D and empty the bag, he would temporarily catch up on score, but I would easily go out before him in the endgame.  I also saw another factor that made my play even more tempting, but it wasn't the most important reason to play this move.  Quackle's championship player did not come up with my move, but when I simulated it along with all of the duck's suggestions, it was one of only two moves that the duck thought won 100% of the time.
