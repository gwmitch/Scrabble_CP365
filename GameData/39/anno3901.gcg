#note Suggestions welcome.  Not really sure what to do in an open.  OUZO is the open board aggressive play.  UTE shuts down the board, but I fear how volatile it is.  TOONIE just doesn't look good.  Open boards are good in opens.

#note Open boards are good.

#note I guess I just airballed here.  No idea why I didn't play JAWED.

#note The Q is worse than it appears.  Maybe ADAGIO, but Quackle underestimates how bad the Q is.

#note GOO would normally be better but I'm trying to kill bingo lanes.  In hindsight, I really think I could have gotten away with ISOPODIC* against this opponent also, considering they've seem just enough words to make this plausible.  Sometimes I really don't have any balls, and this is something I need to work on.

#note Trying to hit a blank hopefully, or at least an S.  Would like to kill line 14 soon.  Hopefully my opp will oblige.

#note Still trying to block row 14.  Maybe LIMING but I feel that's too dangerous.  However, it's probably worth it, because GLINT probably has problems long term.  I really just have to draw a blank; simple as that.

#note This is a really bad play.  I understand that you need to make the opponent find the bingo, but the play here is probably DIMETER to race for blanks and hope they miss line o.  DAME and META are also worth considering.  GLINTIER, despite the 34 points and not so bad leave is an absolute farce here.

#note Oddly better than DEmEANOR, as it makes it more likely that my opponent will score next turn and be able to outrun me.  I'd say nice play, but I doubt this was on purpose: sometimes people make the right play for the wrong reasons.  They probably just didn't see DEmEANOR.  Also, apt punishment for a very poor play.  A deserved loss.
