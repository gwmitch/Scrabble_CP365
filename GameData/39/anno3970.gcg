>Mark_Edelson: AHR L3 RAH +39 84
>Brendan_Sullivan: BCNPRSS L9 C.RB +16 81
#note Maybe playing the S is right from a probabilistic standpoint, but I think it's too obvious that I'm holding another one.

>Brendan_Sullivan: ANPSSUY M4 PAY +28 109
>Mark_Edelson: EU G8 .UE +16 161
>Brendan_Sullivan: AENOSSU N1 ONUS +23 132
#note Didn't see I6 OUD 12, which is a smart fish. This spot is relevant in the endgame, too.
>Mark_Edelson: EM O1 ME +26 187
>Brendan_Sullivan: ??AEOST 13G AzOTiSE +73 205
#note 11H ASSORTER or -ED are 1 point more but riskier.
>Mark_Edelson: DEGILOR N7 GLORIED +68 255
#note Passing up the 14A placement to avoid a 3x3 I suppose.
>Brendan_Sullivan: HLLMNOQ -HLLMOQ +0 205
#note Is 5D MOLLAH 22 really right? What will I do with the Q?
>Mark_Edelson: IKO O6 KOI +30 285
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAENPRV J13 .AV +8 213
#note Perhaps a little early for desperation plays like this.
>Mark_Edelson: AIV 15H VI.A +30 315
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEINPRS 4A SPEARIN. +74 287
#note Cool, (VIVA)RIES. All of the bingos score 74, and I need to hope to get another one.
>Mark_Edelson: BOW A1 BOW. +27 342
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADIMOQW F2 QA.D +34 321
#note Ugly draw. I felt like playing the Q quickly was important, but Quackle seems to like 3A WOW. Maybe QAID will be there next turn anyway, and it's too easy for him to score at 3C and block those lanes?
>Mark_Edelson: EH B2 HE. +31 373
>Brendan_Sullivan: EIIMOTW C2 ME.T +32 353
#note Now I reverse my strategy and try to rack up points? What am I doing?
>Mark_Edelson: GIILLNT 14A TILLING +73 446
#note Ugh.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EIIOOUW H11 WI. +6 359
#note Saw WITE first, then momentarily cursed myself for making the blank a Z so that I couldn't block both of his J plays, then realized I could indeed block his J plays! I really had to trust my tracking here.
>Mark_Edelson: CJTT E13 T.C +5 451
>Brendan_Sullivan: EIOOU A14 .O +6 365
#note I'm planning on going out with OE/ETIC, but need to make that play last so as not to open a J spot.
