#note Here I've got the board the way I want it, except I have to block the S-hook on SWARAJ. Oh wait! I forgot to consider whether SWARAJ actually takes an S. Too late. I also didn't see ADZED/DOE.

#note It goes against theme, but still probably best. Either this or GOOK, but I think GOOK is excessive.
