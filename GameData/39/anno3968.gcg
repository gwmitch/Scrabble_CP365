>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEINRY 8G ..NEARItY +86 106
#note I saw this fairly quickly and was excited to play it. Should have settled down and found E5 INLAYER 100.
>Wallace_Schultz: IQ 7M QI +43 149
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?ABCGOS E4 BOSCAGe +77 183
#note I took a couple of minutes to decide to play this, since I honestly wasn't sure about it. I thought that after my last play he'd be afraid of challenging anyway.
>Wallace_Schultz: ERTX 8A EXTR. +39 188
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEFLNOP C5 PAN.OFLE +65 248
#note Yay, my drawing muscles are warmed up.
>Wallace_Schultz: LTWZ K7 W.LTZ +34 222
>Brendan_Sullivan: AABENRS L11 AB +19 267
#note I could have made an S play at 13C but I thought I could bingo again fairly quickly with AENRS.
>Wallace_Schultz: CE 12B C.E +10 232
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEINRRS 13G SIERRAN +73 340
#note Yup.
>Wallace_Schultz: GO B12 .OG +12 244
#note Okay, now I'm thinking he just drew the S and wants to reopen C13.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEOUUVY 14B .UV +7 347
#note So I do this instead of exchanging. D1 UVEA 24 seemed too risky.
>Wallace_Schultz: DEINORT A2 ORIENT.D +60 304
#note He layed down PERIDONT then picked it up. N3 DETRITION 63 is neat.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEHOSUY F4 YEH +39 386
>Wallace_Schultz: OT 2A .OT +6 310
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAEMOSU D2 SEA +26 412
#note Wow, 12H AMOEBA 41. Lack of board vision there, the (WALTZ)E(R) spot should jump out to me more.
>Wallace_Schultz: IK 6N KI +32 342
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEIMOUV I3 VIE +16 428
#note Trying to cut down bingo opportunities.
>Wallace_Schultz: JT I12 J.T +10 352
#note Hmm . . .
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIIMORU J13 .IM +11 439
#note Only HEADFUL fits on column 1, whereas 10 bingos fit with (JET)E. ANTHE(M)ED is the only way to lose after this play (or HEADFUL).
>Wallace_Schultz: EF 15H FE. +35 387
