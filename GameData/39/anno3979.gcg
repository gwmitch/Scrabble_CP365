>Tim: LLLU H7 LULL +8 8
#note I told Tim- boy, 'if you had LULL on your rack, chances are great it was the best play!'
>Jeffrey: AEINPSX 10E EXP.AINS +85 85
#note Luckily, an L was the one letter I knew I needed (didn't know about the M for flashier glory, do you?)  best
>Tim: AEGIRV K5 AVERI.G +44 52
>Tim: AEGIRV --  -44 8
#note I knew this to be VINEGAR and REAVING only, so off it came
>Jeffrey: ?DIMOPR E4 IMPROv.D +98 183
#note What great bango tiles! best, along with PROMIsE(D), IMPORt(E)D and IMPlORE(D) in the same spot.  Interesting DIMORPh(S) for a lesser score.  I thought about blocking REAVI(N)G with L5 PROMI(S)eD but it's uncommon enough, I don't mind chancing it for the 18 points extra.
>Tim: AGIV 4B VIG.A +18 26
>Jeffrey: CDEEHIS K7 CHI.E +20 203
#note I had a sinking feeling there was a bingo here, shirr enuf DEHI(S)CES- I have seen and drilled DEHISCE before, but hard to find. Better plays in the B column like DE(V)ICE or HI(V)ED.  I think I wanted to close the board more and not open it.  -52.7
>Tim: EGRU 8K .UGER +30 56
>Jeffrey: DENOSSU O8 .ESOUNDS +80 283
#note best  SOUNDE(R)S/DOU(R)NESS for fewer
>Tim: AGO D11 AGO +11 67
>Jeffrey: DEILOTT N2 TOILET.D +75 358
#note again great bango tiles, best and only
>Tim: EOT O1 TOE +13 80
>Jeffrey: ?ABEKTY C13 YAK +30 388
#note C11 BAY best- I saw it but didn't like keeping the K -4.2
>Tim: ACNT 8A CANT. +24 104
>Jeffrey: ?BEENRT 14H BaNTERE. +74 462
#note missed the best A8 (C)aBERNET.  I also could have made the B(A)NTEREr/d at 14B  If I had played BAY last turn I would have had 15G KERNiTE(S), so that would have worked too (even more points). -12
>Tim: AN 15H AN +19 123
>Jeffrey: AADEIOU 15A AU. +21 483
#note best 5E (M)IAOUED -9.8
>Tim: AEENRTV I2 VETERAN +67 190
>Jeffrey: ADEIIOS 6E .OI +7 490
#note this was a poor fish compared to 12I OIDIA or even 4K OID(I)A better -13.9
>Tim: HMRY M11 MYR.H +26 216
>Jeffrey: ADEEIJS B2 JI.ED +40 530
#note best
>Tim: IORZ 13G ZORI +34 250
>Jeffrey: ABEFFSW 3A F.B +24 554
#note Right general spot, wrong word.  The duck likes F(I)FE C3 and 5I (E)FFAB(L)E best, mainly because they set up outs on the next turn.  
>Tim: Q 9J Q. +22 272
>Jeffrey: AEFSW M3 WAE +28 582
#note best, blocks his M3 WO and scores
>Tim: IOW E13 WO +14 286
>Jeffrey: FS 5I .FS +12 594
#note best
>Jeffrey:  (I) +2 596
