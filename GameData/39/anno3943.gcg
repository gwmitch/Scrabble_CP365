>Joel_Sherman: DFNOU 8D FONDU +26 26
#note Joel put down FOUND and changed his mind.
>Jason: ?DEEORV E3 OVERD.nE +72 72
#note Wasn't 100% on OVERFEED. Don't know why I didn't play down column I. (-5)
>Joel_Sherman: AEELOPR I3 PAROLEE +74 100
>Jason: AHHJNNR H4 HAJ +37 109
>Joel_Sherman: ADT J6 TAD +32 132
>Jason: ?BHNNRR -BHNR +0 109
#note I debated between this and H(E)RB. Duck says there are better options: BR(E)N, B(O)RN, etc. (-8)
>Joel_Sherman: CIMX 10B CIM.X +38 170
#note Didn't notice he passed on XI at the time. Must've been consonant-heavy.
>Jason: ?KLNRTU B10 .LUNK +22 131
#note Duck likes (P)LUNK instead. (-2)
>Joel_Sherman: DELST K2 DELTS +23 193
>Jason: ?EFGIRT F2 IF +12 143
#note Phew, no missed bingos. All D's out, only three unseen ... I liked the setup. But FIG is better, as per Duck. (-6)
>Joel_Sherman: EEILRSU 1A LEISURE +80 273
#note *sigh* Giving him a spot to bingo ... timing just off all game.
>Jason: ?CEGIRT B1 .RECTInG +74 217
#note Only playable.
>Joel_Sherman: ABO A6 BOA +29 302
>Jason: AEGIOPR C12 PAIR +26 243
#note POI! D'oh! PEA or PEAG are better options. Really didn't want to part with an E, though. Of course, parting with an R isn't great. (-4)
>Joel_Sherman: NOY 12A Y..ON +28 330
>Jason: AAEGNOU L1 GENOA +27 270
#note Lousy leave, but gotta score, open, and hope it fixes itself. (HA)U(L)AGE would've been sweet ... leads in wins.
>Joel_Sherman: AIW D5 WAI. +20 350
>Jason: AGOSUVY M5 VUG +15 285
#note D'oh, the Y hook to CLUNK ... GYRO at 15A. (-19)
>Joel_Sherman: NOW 1L .OWN +24 374
>Jason: AIOQSTY -OQY +0 285
#note Maybe FPS. I figured that instead of playing Q(I) at C9, I stood a better chance of winning by bingoing and sticking Joel with it. Joel says I should've dumped the Q. Duck agrees. I suck. (-21)
>Joel_Sherman: EZ 3A Z.E +24 398
>Jason: AEIISTT N1 .AIT +14 299
#note Or (EN)TIA. (-5)
>Joel_Sherman: B C9 B. +7 405
#note Well, he doesn't have it...
>Jason: AEIRSTY 5G Y.. +6 305
#note EYRA at 15A is best valuation wise. CP says I have no wins. I felt I might be able to keep it close, though.
>Joel_Sherman: EHIMNST -  +0 405
#note Inputting a SATIRE leave, Duck agrees.
>Jason: AEIORST -  +0 305
#note And Duck says I am indeed right. I sat there going, "Great, play ROTARIES and get Q stuck," until I realized "nobody's holding a gun to your head and making you bingo." Then I realized passing would keep spread under 100, since he had HM. As my clock ticked under two minutes, I did the math: 77-20=57 ... Joel needs 57 from his rack. He's got SH or SI at H1, hooks to VUG and 22-point M plays at 14F, and at least 57. (more comments in ensuing passes)
>Joel_Sherman: EHIMNST -  +0 405
#note As soon as we neutralized the clock, I asked Joel if it was correct to pass. "Absolutely," he said. That made me feel good.
>Jason: AEIORST -  +0 305
#note "I assume the tile in the bag is the Q," Joel said after my question of whether passing was right. "Ya think?!" I said and we both laughed.
>Joel_Sherman: EHIMNST -  +0 405
#note I loved telling the story, not because I was right, but because I thought it was so interesting ... never heard of the three-pass rule invoked with tile(s) in the bag. When I told Zeigler, he was impressed and said something like: "That'll earn you Joel's respect. Or, at least, the ability to be spoken to." :)
>Jason: AEIORST -  +0 305
#note Two good games, I was just on the wrong end.
>Jason: AEIORST (AEIORST) +-7 298
