#note In a normal game this is clear.  In an open, you can also make a good case for exchanging here.  In fact, I probably would.  The Q shuts down the board next turn which is bad, so plays like SUQ/URD lead to boards that are too constricted for this opponent.

#note Trying to open up the board.   This is better than VIRTU 7c, which makes the top of the board less accessible.

#note I can't block the S hooks, and I can't really set anything else.  Maybe GIFT, but I should probably give credit for the S, even though he's a 1600 player.

#note No S.  What did he have?  I have no idea.

#note Not the best equity, but I need to keep it open.

#note This looks very weird from my side.  Seems to be playing quickly too.  I think the heuristics are seeming crude...

#note I held forever but accepted.  I was about 80% sure this was bad.  (I was actually even surer, but my opponent was also sure it was good, and I knew that he thought it was good by his reaction) The main issue was that I have no balls, and I have no math to challenge.  Given my rack I'm about 90% to win if I leave it, 97% to win if I challenge it off, and 60% if I challenge and it's good.  Still, given these numbers it's a marginal challenge, especially with spread being a big factor. If it were 75% instead of 80% then I should probably take, though.  My word knowledge has gotten better since this time.

#note Doesn't make sense.  Should have a big rack, but then he shouldn't play this either. 
>Kenji: DEFIMMP B13 .MM +32 348
#note I guess MIMED 14f is better, but I didn't like leaving SE bingos.  Not likely and not that devastating though, although GOA could be a big rack.  Maybe.
>Anonymous: EE 3F E.E +9 249
#note Maybe he has a big rack.  Or maybe he has a mediocre rack like EGINT and doesn't know what he's doing.  Or maybe he has 4 or 5 vowels and nothing at all.
>Kenji: DEFIINP 2E IF +26 374
#note Not so sure, between this and DEFI.  I'd be sick if he bingos STR on 15, or plays ZAIRE at 15d.  He might already have 4 to ZAIRE here, or all 5 letters and be playing a little silly.  I think I made the right move here: not positive though.
>Anonymous: INT I1 TIN. +14 263
#note Okay, let's scratch that vowels scenario.  I guess he was keeping EGINT or something this whole time. *shrug*
>Kenji: ADEINPS M1 PANDIES +82 456
#note I was really attracted to the style points play, so I laid it down and then immediately moved it.  I almost played the style play because this tournament has a prize for most flashy bingo, but I came to win the tournament, not to win most flashy bingo.  This probably wouldn't win anyway.  Then again, if I came to win the tournament I would've challenged on the DOJO turn.  *sigh*
