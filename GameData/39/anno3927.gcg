>Jason: AALNTUY 8F YUAN +14 14
#note Slow down!!! AUNTLY, YULAN, UNLAY, AUNTY. Barely looked for fives (or sixes). (-7)
>Alan_Helfgott: FO F6 FO. +17 17
>Jason: AEHLSTV G7 H.T +20 34
#note Best. Wow. I figured for sure I was missing a bingo or a better fish.
>Alan_Helfgott: III -III +0 17
>Jason: AAEGLSV I6 VA.G +11 45
#note Another embarrassing bingo miss. Why did I have no patience this game? (-45)
>Alan_Helfgott: NW 7I .WN +6 23
>Jason: ABCELMS L1 BECALMS +89 134
>Alan_Helfgott: ?AAINRS 1H cARA.INS +131 154
#note Alan says "Oh!" excitedly, then sighs and says "No. I thought I had a triple-triple, but it doesn't fit. (pause) Wait a minute." Then this goes down. Then another speech. "Wait, is that good? CARABINE..." Then he looks at me. "I don't know, OK," he says. "You probably know, but I don't." Another pause. "Maybe I have something else." Then he uses the board as a workspace, looking for -BARS words. I'm wondering how many rules he's going to flout on one turn. He then settles on this, the only trip-trip.
>Jason: DDEORRW -  +0 134
#note It doesn't take me long to challenge, esp. since I've had REWORD(E)D blocked. Alan was (I believe) genuinely surprised it was good. Meanwhile, I'm running on hot. I considered calling the director after his play, but the cost (holding up play, p*ssing off opponent) vs. the benefit (What good comes from it? No way Jason gives me a free challenge.) didn't seem worth it. (-31)
>Alan_Helfgott: AFLO 3J FO.AL +20 174
#note Alan's muttering "the way I've been playing, it won't matter," so I still consider my win chances at least 50-50.
>Jason: DDEORRW H1 .ROWD +12 146
#note DEW(A)R, 4I, leads sim. (-4)
>Alan_Helfgott: AGIO E3 AGIO +15 189
>Jason: DEEEIRR K7 .EEDIER +16 162
#note Seven power tiles unseen, and Alan's play makes it look like he has one, max. I went for turnover ... Duck likes (A)ERIE, H8, or RE(G)RE(W), 4C. (-5)
>Alan_Helfgott: EET 2G T.EE +16 205
>Jason: CGIKLOR 12J R.LOCK +34 196
>Alan_Helfgott: EOT O12 .ETO +24 229
>Jason: ?AEEGII 5K I.EA +8 204
#note Bad board vision. AE(R)IE, 13I. (-12)
>Alan_Helfgott: Q 5D Q. +11 240
>Jason: ?EGINTZ 10K .ITZ +34 238
#note Missed ZE(C)hIN. (-11)
>Alan_Helfgott: HIN N12 .HIN +29 269
#note Ironically, after this play, I saw (Z)E(CHIN).
>Jason: ?EEGNUU 3A GENU. +12 250
#note Duck approves. I'm very, very happy to make the "right" play here while trying to stop myself from tilting after the EUU draw.
>Alan_Helfgott: EMOPRST 10A TROMPES +72 341
>Jason: ?BEJLSU D8 JU.BLErS +104 354
#note "OK," I think. "Up 14, two in the bag so I have endgame tempo. I know I can play a better endgame than this guy. Approximately even draws, and let me escape." This leads in valuation, but JUMBLE instead has the higher win %.
>Alan_Helfgott: AEPRX A7 PRE.AX +69 410
#note WTF?!?!?! His last nine are ATROPINEX while I have this? Don't get me wrong, I'm overdue for crap luck, but why not against Kate, George, Sam, Rafi, etc. Why against the biggest putz in the division? ARGH!
>Jason: DDIIUVY O8 IVY +45 399
#note I really needed to take a cooler after this game, esp. after Alan said after PRETAX: "Now you'll probably bingo out." I wanted to say: "Look at the unseen pool, moron. This crap plus two of INTO. Exactly what would I bingo out with?
>Alan_Helfgott: INOT A1 IN.OT +21 431
#note I'm still bitter. Even more so after seeing it probably would've been different with SALVAGE/LAVAGES early.
>Alan_Helfgott:  (IUDD) +12 443
