#note I held this, and thought about DEISTIC, DEISTICAL, DEISTICALLY. This one didn't make sense being a word, like MAXIMALS. Turns out I'm not so good at deciding what is and isn't a word based on language. I should just stick to rote memory, apparently.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEIOTU -  +0 156
#note Lost challenge.
>Dave_Koenig: GIV C6 VIG +15 239
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEIOTU 12H AUDIO +20 176
#note What I would have done anyway had I not challenged.
>Dave_Koenig: ALNO A7 ALON. +12 251
#note LA(MINI)N is pretty cool.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EFIOTTU 3B OUT +8 184
#note I wanted to leave columns I, K, L open for bingos. 3G FIT seems like a stronger option, in hindsight.
>Dave_Koenig: AELNNRT 5G LANTERN +66 317
#note Wisely giving up 6 points over the dangerous 14H placement.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EFIIPST A1 TIP +21 205
#note Again, I wanted to leave the I-L columns open for 8s, but this underestimates the huge potential of EIPST to make 7s. 4A IF seems best, but anything is a longshot* at this point.
>Dave_Koenig: EX 11J EX +39 356
>Brendan_Sullivan: EFHISST M1 FISH.ETS +80 285
#note Happy to find this one . . .
>Dave_Koenig: BBEHOTW 2H BOBWH.TE +98 454
#note . . . although it gave Dave the magic I he needed, the only one unseen to him. Director Terry, a big bird fan (as opposed to a Big Bird fan) was thrilled to hear about this one.

>Dave_Koenig: DWY O1 D.WY +45 499
>Brendan_Sullivan: AGMNPQS 7K QA. +12 351
#note Apparently eating the Q is best here, going for points with the P and M to make up for the -20.
>Dave_Koenig: ALOOUV 1A .OLU +5 504
>Brendan_Sullivan: GMNPS 6M .NG +6 357
#note I had mistracked and had Dave for AALO, even though he only had 3 tiles. I didn't even look at his rack to check. I was thinking he had no out and I'd get MEDS or PYAS next turn.
