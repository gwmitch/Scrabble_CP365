>Jason: AAGILOT 8F OTALGIA +68 68
#note Look at AAGLOT (please be I, please be I, please be I) ... yahtzee! That's how I've been running. I was playing upside-down, since Paul's old board is hard to turn, so I play one-tile-at-a-time when I do that. George was sure I was playing OTALGIC, leading to "C bingo" comments that night.
>George_Viebranz: ACIPR 9C CARPI +20 20
>Jason: AEHINVZ J6 ZI. +33 101
#note I never seem to find EVANISH's anagram in study ... small wonder I missed V(A)HINE here. (-3)
>George_Viebranz: EIORSST M2 STORIES +75 95
>Jason: ADEHHNV N2 HAH +35 136
#note I saw H(A)VEN the previous turn ... don't know why I dismissed it here. (-3)
>George_Viebranz: CDEELRV D7 CL.VERED +80 175
>Jason: ?DENRVY 13C N.RVY +30 166
#note I started to put down DEV at O1 and changed my mind. Q says big mistake ... and I'm about to get punished for it. (-5)
>George_Viebranz: AMX O1 MAX +52 227
#note Owie.
>Jason: ?DEFOTU L7 F.DEOUTs +77 243
#note Only playable.
>George_Viebranz: EIQU 13I QUI.E +48 275
#note George needs to stop scoring so much. (I know, I know, that's what she said...)
>Jason: AEEELOW K3 OLEA +19 262
>George_Viebranz: BKR 11C K.RB +20 295
>Jason: EEEMNTW J2 EWE +15 277
#note Duck likes ETWE(E), 10H. (-2)
>George_Viebranz: JW 11K J.W +26 321
#note This board's becoming uncomfortably ugly for someone down a bingo...
>Jason: AEEFMNT N6 FE +32 309
#note Only play. Gives up a lot coming back, but there's no guarantee George has a hook tile.
>George_Viebranz: DGOY O7 DOGY +35 356
>Jason: ?AEMNST N9 AM +26 335
#note Good time for a S? draw. Bad time to miss SArMENT(A). Nearly played AMENTi(A)S/(CARPI)S* but was pretty sure CARPI didn't S hook. Worked out ... George had ABLE for 42 set to go here. (-14)
>George_Viebranz: BI I4 BI +9 365
>Jason: ?EENSTT F5 NET.. +9 344
#note While I'm disappointed in how I played on the whole, one encouraging thing was that in a couple of tough spots like these where I didn't know what to do, I made the right play. Sims neck-and-neck with TE(D), 14B.
>George_Viebranz: IS 9I IS +20 385
#note This may well be George's best play, but I like hanging on to my only S here, for reasons you'll see in a minute.
>Jason: ?EIOSTT 2C nOISETT. +59 403
#note One reason playing off the S can hurt: This bingo's a huge mistake. IT at 14I makes a bingo lane along row 15 (granted, a toughie to hit), a spot for me to score if it comes down to outrunning. CP isn't as harsh as sim, though, giving IT an 81.5% chance, this 74%. (-22)
>George_Viebranz: INN 14I INN. +22 407
#note If George still had the S, I'm a lot more worried. Like I said, IS could well be best as I don't know George's leave. But I like keeping it at the end.
>Jason: ADGOOPU 1A POOD +33 436
#note The first four I looked at were AOOU, and I thought I was a dead duck. To then see all three unseen non-one-pointers was nice. Best.
>George_Viebranz: AELNNRU 1G NU +14 421
#note We started a little late, and we'd both used up a lot of our clocks, so we were "the only game in town". Sam Rosin stopped by briefly to look, the division 2 player who rack-stalked like six of my games made an appearance. Then G.I. Joel comes by and watches as George is shuffling here. Combine that with me now doubting GAUN, GUAN *and* GAUD and knowing I lose by phonying, and I could tell this had Division 12-level endgame written all over it.
>Jason: AGU A1 .UG +6 442
#note Yeah, all three are good. Yeah, I chickened out on them all. I REALLY wanted to win this game ... would've sucked to go from 10-3 to 10-6 and play my way out of the top group. I knew I was sacrificing 20+ spread/equity here and generally looking like a doofus, but I didn't care. It was nothing compared to the embarrassment I would've suffered/lost opportunity to be at table 1 by losing on a phony. (-26)
>George_Viebranz: AELNR 3C ERN +16 437
#note One behind ERA, E5. The good thing about this was that I took a valuable lesson from it ... not only should my Can-Am prep consist of learning bingos, but of some overdue review of the short stuff. No excuse for chickening out on three fours at once.
>Jason: A 7D .A. +5 447
#note Joel had left and returned, so then we had to replay the endgame stupidity for him. Ugh. Like I told Zeigler on Monday night, it was a damn shame it ended like this because the first 11 1/2 turns were great. Ah well.
>Jason:  (AL) +4 451
