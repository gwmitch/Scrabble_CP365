>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEHLNV A8 VEAL +28 155
#note VENAL is 3 more, but I wanted to set up another S hook for the blank.

#note Thought about MAXIMALS, then decided it sounds stupid and has no business being a word; MAXIMA or MAXIMUMS are more appropriate. I've since asked an assortment of math people, and most merely shrugged their shoulders and said they would never use it but could conceive of its existence.
>Jason_Idalski: RSTTUVZ L9 TZ.R +26 195
>Brendan_Sullivan: ??AGLOP 12D GALlOPs +77 272
#note Didn't need this other blank, oh well. Learned LAPDOGS now, too.

>Brendan_Sullivan: ABIINNY 12A YA +24 296
#note Didn't see HINNY.
>Jason_Idalski: AERSSTU 13K US +16 223
>Brendan_Sullivan: BCIINOW 14H CION +10 306
#note I was willing to give him a bingo hooking IMAMS, thinking I could (hopefully) get a nice sidelap* on a TWS, and playing off the C seemed to help my chances of that.
>Jason_Idalski: AAEERST N5 AERATES +70 293
>Brendan_Sullivan: BFINRUW O1 BRUIN +26 332
#note I can't remember why I talked myself out of O8 WIN 37. Most likely, I was thinking that DIF is the only really dangerous sidelap* he could get and BFRU could go nowhere fast if he gets a 30+ pointer from O1 to O5 with the F. There are some E ending bingos in the pool that play on column K, but I didn't see anything reasonable that blocked and scored (like FUBAR), and playing off 5 instead of 3 gives him less opportunities to fish. After 2500 iterations on many-ply, WIN shows 90% wins, BRUIN 89%, BURIN 88% and FUBAR 85%.
>Jason_Idalski: AEEFINT M13 EF +16 309
>Brendan_Sullivan: DEEFIRW O8 DIF +37 369
#note No spot for FIREWEED. My move is not optimal since it gives him his next play of NORI, which I didn't see coming.
>Jason_Idalski: AEINORT M6 NORI +20 329
>Brendan_Sullivan: EERW N13 REE +20 389
#note Duh, FEW is 2 points better.
>Jason_Idalski: AET L4 TEA +9 338
#note Perfect endgame from Jason.
>Jason_Idalski:  (W) +8 346
