>Carl: AAALOWW 11E WO. +31 93
#note These are some nutty letters. I really hated AWA 7J, but it sims best. ALOW or AWOL 11B was a viable option. I liked that WOO made my L more valuable, but it probably isn't worth the horrendous leave. -1.
>Rich_M: GNPR 5E PR.NG +16 116
>Carl: AAALNTW 7J AWA +16 109
#note Positions like this just go to show that I my positional game is lacking. I can't tell the difference between this play and WAN 9C, but apparently, it's 5.4. Total equity lost = 6.4

>Carl: AEELNNT H11 LATEN +27 136
>Rich_M: ETV 9C VET +19 173
>Carl: EFIINNU 12C FIN +19 155
#note FINE I12 is 4.5 points better and, again, I can't tell the difference. I figured the E would be more valuable than that, and I didn't want to shut down the board while behind. -10.9.
>Rich_M: NPT 14G P.NT +8 181
>Carl: AEINQUY J10 QUIE. +34 189
#note I thought this was a nice play because it sets up ANY 13C for next turn. No. QUEAN H1 wins the sim. 
>Rich_M: IIIIIIU -IIIIIIU +0 181
>Carl: AEENSYY 13C ANY +35 224
>Rich_M: IZ I3 ZI. +23 204
>Carl: ?EEILSY 15C mYELI.ES +85 309
#note I nearly missed this play. I flirted with SNEEZILY* for a long time, and then when I saw MYELINES, I hesitated for a few minutes before deciding it was good. Making the best play now cost me 20 points in the endgame because I ran out of time.
>Rich_M: FI 3G FI. +19 223
>Carl: ABDINTU E3 DU. +6 315
#note Here's where the controversy begins. I didn't want to open the board a measly ounce in this spot. BIT 2F wins the sim, but even that seemed too risky for me. What I want to do is close down all the lanes, while drawing to a bingo, so that I can use the lane he is likely to open next turn. The duck says this 8.9 below par.
>Rich_M: DM K5 M...D +22 245
>Carl: AABINTU D2 BIN +17 332
#note On another day, I might have played BAUD, the sim winner. I kept telling myself: I'm up by 70 on an iron-tight board. The only way I lose is if I let him bingo. BIN has the advantage of taking out any X plays. Q says this is -14.3. 
>Rich_M: K 3C K.. +16 261
>Carl: AAACETU 6C TAE +10 342
#note Another questionable sacrifice to keep everything closed. Quackle wants me to trade AAU. The way I see it-- if he bingos, now I'm the one who's down on an iron-tight board. -6.7.
>Rich_M: BO H1 OB. +15 276
>Carl: AACEIRU 1H .URIE +6 348
#note Continuing along the trend of sacrificing points and leave to control the board entirely. Quackle says AIR 7C-- opening a TWS for gosh sakes!-- is better by 8.2 points.
>Rich_M: GOR 13J .RGO +10 286
>Carl: AACEERR M10 CER. +6 354
#note Quackle hates this play like it hates all the others, but this time I have to agree, since Rich might set up an exclusive TWS lane. But what is the right play here? Certainly it isn't RAGE L11, which Quackle says is 22.2 points better.
>Rich_M: T 13J ....T +6 292
>Carl: AAEMRUX 7B RAX +23 377
#note The duck says that AX 14N is 34 points better than this. I made absolutely certain there were no bingos in the eight unseen tiles. AX gives up so many points, at least as many as the S-hook to ERGOT gives. ... how can it possibly be best? And best by so much?
>Rich_M: ACIILSU O8 CAUILS +34 326
>Rich_M: ACIILSU --  -34 292
>Carl: AEHMO 2L MHO +20 397
#note I didn't have time to come up with the best sequence. The right play is OH 14N, 20 points difference. I'll either get MEGA L11 or a big TWS score.
