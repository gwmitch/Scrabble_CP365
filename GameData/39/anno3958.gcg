#note Can't recall the other letter in the rack; notes incomplete. Wasn't sure that LONGE was good.

>Steve: DENOQSS L2 NODES +36 147
#note I debated on this or keeping the N back, never seeing the big front hook to the twl. I just wanted to turn over another tile hoping to get an I for a big Q play at D12.
>Kevin_McCarthy: IIT C7 TI.I +9 138
#note This was an unexpected bonus.

>Kevin_McCarthy: ACEIR 1K CARIE +32 170
#note I was so surprised to have missed the A/NODES hook that I never paused to consider whether CARIE* was good.

#note Not knowing LONGE cold costs me six points this time.

#note Missing a sweet paralell play starting at m1 for an additional dozen.
>Kevin_McCarthy: ARV J2 VAR +18 212
>Steve: ADEEERY M3 YE +25 339
#note If I played in that Minnesota marathon maybe I would have seen the best play here, coming down from B2. Along with the extra points it also turns over tiles with both blanks still unseen.

#note Q likes PE at 14N, but says I'm still 92 percent after this play.

#note Both blanks still unseen. Ruh Roh.
>Steve: ABDELRU A1 BEDU +33 400
#note Took about 7 minutes to make this crucial play, and chose wrongly. There is a play coming down from A1 that wins by a single point, but Q's championship player curiously chooses to play (ET)A at 7b. It says that wins 100 percent of the time, but that isn't true.
