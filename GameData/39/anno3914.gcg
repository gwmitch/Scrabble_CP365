#note COrnROW leads sim. (-2)
>Joel_Sherman: DEENORS E4 ENDO.SER +86 86
#note Neutralizing my double-blank advantage.
>Jason: ADGKSTU 12A KAGUS +40 118
#note I like Joel even though I think we have different senses of humor. For example, after lunch, looking at WSCQT standings, we were wondering if Stu Goldman had played a Worlds. I said: "I say if Paul Avrin's played a Worlds, then Stu Goldman's played a Worlds!" Joel gave me a "now now" look. "That's not good logic," he admonished.
>Joel_Sherman: ADEIMOT 5A DOMI.ATE +61 147
#note Yeah, this is gonna be a shootout.
>Jason: AADLLTW H1 WALL.D +33 151
#note Duck likes ALL(O)W, B2. Sets up the T- hook. (-3)
>Joel_Sherman: AEEN A11 A.ENE +27 174
#note As I said goodbye to Joel, I asked if he was coming back for a three-peat try. When he said yes, I joked: "Up your standards next time! 17-3, 17-3 ... what, you can't go 18-2?" Another "now now" look. "Jason, don't be ridiculous," he said.
>Jason: AFMTYYZ 10B ZYM. +38 189
#note Missed the star play, MAT(E)Y at 4B. (-5)
>Joel_Sherman: AALN A1 ALAN. +21 195
>Jason: ADFNTXY 6B DAN.Y +48 237
#note Nooo...! FADDY is good! Chickened out. (-16)
>Joel_Sherman: AEILRRS 3F RA.LIERS +70 265
#note Of the six bingos Joel played on me in our two games, I think this was the lowest prob. Hmph.
>Jason: FIIPTVX -FIPV +0 237
#note PI(MA)? XI at B1? Dropping the F at 4D? F(L)IT at 4G or (L)IFT at 4H? They're all simming 10+ points ahead of this, but I like none of them. (-11) 
>Joel_Sherman: IO C10 .O.I +16 281
#note Joel said in the post-mortem his rack was crap here and he hated this play, but I think he said his purpose was to stop the big potential X play along row 9. I'd done the math: An O to go with my X scored 62 minimum.
>Jason: EEHIITX B1 HIE +23 260
#note Missed (L)ITHE, 4H. (-6)
>Joel_Sherman: BEITTTU L2 T.IBUTE +20 301
#note (Joel's exact rack.)
>Jason: EIIQTVX J2 Q. +31 291
>Joel_Sherman: BEOP 5J BE.OP +22 323
>Jason: EIITUVX 8L .XIT +33 324
#note Damn drawing the U after playing the Q! Damn Joel blocking (QI)VIUT! Yay for a consonant-heavy pool, though, which made me feel better about playing this.
>Joel_Sherman: FI 9M IF +21 344
>Jason: EGHISUV O1 VUGHS +60 384
#note After this game, I was 0-3 against Joel. All three times, I've been ahead late.
>Joel_Sherman: NO 9A NO +16 360
#note Ruh-roh.
>Jason: EFGIPTU 10N FE +30 414
#note Argh! Sim's and CP's pick is what I almost played: TIEP(IN) to leave one in the bag and limit Joel's fishing options. This doesn't even make CP's list. Shoot. Don't think it would've made a difference in this game, though. (-15)
>Joel_Sherman: AEEINTV 14C NAIVETE +77 437
#note Dangit, dangit, dangit.
>Jason: CGIJPTU I11 JUP. +16 430
#note JUIC(E), G10. Joel saw it in the post-mortem. Didn't visualize the blank, missed the out. Only four worse, though.
>Joel_Sherman: ORR G8 .ORR +4 441
#note "I don't know how I won this game," Joel said just after the clock was neutralized. "I was just gonna say: I don't know how I lost this game," I said. Drew well, felt like I played well. Just wasn't enough. Stupid FADDY.
