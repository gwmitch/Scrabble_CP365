>Matthew_Larocque: ?AACEEK 9A CAKE +20 20
#note hm ok caretake is a verb. tEACAKE is there in my rack but who knows how long it would take for me to find that and I wouldn't be all that sure anyways. Regardless KAE for 19 at C9 is probably better. I felt like making the board dangerous with an opening blank.

>Bill_Payne: JTU 7I JUT +35 98
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEEIOQ 9H OE +17 76
#note plays like these always stump me. I realise I prolly won't bingo with the Q  hanging around, but dumping a couple vowels for 15-20 points usually seems worth it to me. Anyways, this is the only scoring play that sims near the top.
>Bill_Payne: INT 6J NIT +11 109
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEEIQS L6 .EE +15 91
#note Same dilemma, dump vowels  or just pass a turn to scrap the Q? This wins the sim. Surprisingly, burning the blank to play QuI(T)E for 37 is second. That looks preposterous! If my opponent has an I, I've effectively gained zero ground with my most valuable tile.
>Bill_Payne: DIT 8L .DIT +15 124
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEIQRS 7N QI +24 115
#note Just what I needed...
>Bill_Payne: DE 10F .ED +18 142
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEMNRS A6 MER. +24 139
#note Although I kind of made the board awkward to bingo on after that play. This play simulates at the top by a pretty clear margin - thought for sure I was missing better stuff here.
>Bill_Payne: ?DEINRS 11H SaNDIER +70 212
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CGNOSX B5 COX +29 168
#note Quackle likes this too, guessing the NG synergy makes it a winner.
>Bill_Payne: AEPR 5B .APER +18 230
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGLNS 4E bANGLES +62 230
#note I took a lot of time here, but you wouldn't think so since this is all I could come up with :/ ANGLERS should have been an instant find at least. There's also a pair of nines for 60 and 80 points...
>Bill_Payne: INW H1 WIN. +24 254
>Matthew_Larocque: ADFILOS N10 F.AIL +32 262
#note At the time, I don't think I was aware that this takes an S - simulation still favours it pretty heavilly.
>Bill_Payne: ABN M13 BAN +20 274
>Matthew_Larocque: DMNOSVV L10 V.NO +19 281
#note Holy what. Quackle is telling me that my winning chances are getting destroyed by not throwing those vees back in the bag. Well, close games always compel me to keep scoring when possible. 19 points seemed pretty good, this isn't a board rife with hotspots you know, better take what I can get while I can still get it.
>Bill_Payne: ATU O13 TAU +18 292
>Matthew_Larocque: DHLMOSV C3 OV.L +19 300
#note Bill noted that I did good in shedding the vees for reasonable points. Quackle is on my side this time as well, with an expected win 53% of the time.
>Bill_Payne: IOTTU 1E OUT.IT +9 301
#note Not sure if he was blocking or dumping or both, but this play caused him some major pain that  swung the game way in my favour.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEHLMS 2D EDH +31 331
#note It's somewhat close between this, HM, and SH. I'm confused as to why SH is so good, isn't that a complete waste of an S?
>Bill_Payne: GISW 3J WIGS +23 324
>Matthew_Larocque: AHLMOSY C9 ..YO +11 342
#note Now I'm just getting a little insane. I was pretty sure he couldn't do anything to stop me here, but I certainly didn't expect him to give me an even juicier hotspot... anyways there's like 8 plays that claim victory 100%... HOY or HAY 11A, (AB)YSMAL (AB)OHMS etc...pretty sure I can't lose unless I play a phony, really. HOY looks cool, allowing me to play out with (H)ALMS or (KAY)S/SLAM, and giving me more spread than my ridiculous set-up.
>Bill_Payne: AIRRU 12C .UR +6 330
#note Uhh.. it said (KA)YO only gave me a win 89% of the time, but his best play here gives him a win 1% of the time? That doesn't even make sense. There's no tiles left in the bag and Quackle doesn't take human error into account like playing phonies. How does Quackle think I can lose 11% of the time... or Bill can win 1% of the time...
>Matthew_Larocque: AHLMS 13A MASH +47 389
#note Scored this wrong... gipped myself 5 points
>Bill_Payne: AIR A12 A.IR +21 351
>Bill_Payne:  (L) +2 353
#note So, despite a disappointing 2-point loss in the previous game, I was doing decently in this early bird tournament. Unfortunately, in the remaining 3 games I make some of the most unthinkably bad plays in my short history of tournament games. These are the kinds of games you wish you could unthink, but at least they serve as a reminder of what never to do in a scrabble game.
