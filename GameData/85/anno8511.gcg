#note yes, yes, the play is CATENATE. i thought of the T but got too lazy. lazy is bad. yes, it's a (pretty bad) mistake, but what happens is annoying. (-11.5)

#note maybe i have to do N9 OPPOSE because it scores a bit more and it gives me more options next turn. otherwise she's likely to go there. i wish i could concentrate/play better. this is probably a worse mistake than it seems. (-5.5)
