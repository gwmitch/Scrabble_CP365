>Fran_Silver: AEFRY 8D FAERY +30 30
>Jim_Burlant: CEFGGNO H4 FOGG. +17 17
#note Despite all the clunk, there are no good options.  This is best, with G3 FOGGER being the next best available play.
>Fran_Silver: AEU 6G A.UE +7 37
>Jim_Burlant: CCELNNT E7 L.NCET +16 33
#note Another poor position with no good options available.  Couldn't think of CANCEL, but this isn't a really terrible miss.  This sims within3 points of E7 CANCEL 20, which wins.
>Fran_Silver: AQ 12C QA. +24 61
>Jim_Burlant: CEIKNTV 13A KNIT +40 73
#note Initially saw VIE F6 and ruled out playing the V this turn, wanting to save it for something at F6 on the next turn.  I figured 13C had to be taken out.  Q prefers KIT by a statistically insignificant margin.  My rationale is that it's always better to force someone to play through whatever you put down rather than give an easy hook.  Especially with SSSS?? unseen, given how I'd been drawing most of the day, I wasn't taking chances on an easy S hook.
>Fran_Silver: ALOPS A10 POL.AS +39 100
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEIJV F4 CAVI. +37 110
#note With the duplicated E and the J in the rack I didn't think there was anything that could be salvaged in terms of rack building; hence the decision to play CAVIE for 37 instead of VIE for 33.  Quackle agrees, as this is best and VIE is the 4-point runner up.
>Fran_Silver: HNORT K3 THORN +26 126
>Jim_Burlant: EEEIJPU J2 JEU +33 143
#note Best, nothing else worth considering.
>Fran_Silver: AADDEOU -AADDE +0 126
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIIP 10C AE.IA +9 152
#note I could have just as easily exchanged here.  However, given the lines on rows 14 and 15 as well as the easy line to hit down the L column, I didn't feel this was opening up anything that wasn't already available.  Q agrees, and says this is best.  My winning chances are now 54%.
>Fran_Silver: HMOSSS 8K SHMOS +51 177
#note OMG!  SHMO doesn't take the S?  How can that not be pluralized with an S?  Fran told me after the game she had 3 S's in this rack, btw
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIPRX 11G EXPIRED +86 238
#note Best bingo, and despite my blunder of letting her get away with SHMOS*, Q says I'm in the driver' seat - this wins 80%.
>Fran_Silver: LO 10J LO +10 187
>Jim_Burlant: EINRRUV O4 VIRU. +12 250
#note Surprisingly, this is best.  Also - hoping to draw an O for REOVIRUS.  I'm winning 81%.
>Fran_Silver: ?EINSTU 15A .UnNIEST +74 261
#note Best bingo for Fran.
>Jim_Burlant: AEENNRZ 12L NENE +17 267
#note I wanted to turn 4 tiles and land an I or O so I could play AZON or ZIN on row 9 on my next turn.  Or, failing that, to draw into a Z play down the O column if I missed an I or O but landed the B. Or even if this gave her a distraction to take out for 27 or 36 points worst case,  I thought that if I hit the Z for 45+, it would clinch the game.  Q says NENE J12 21 is the play.  Not sure I agree...but then again, maybe this game turns out differently if I make that play.
>Fran_Silver: BIO 14E OBI +25 286
>Jim_Burlant: AEIRRWZ 9C ZI. +49 316
#note Critical position.  Do you take the 49 now? Or block row 13 and hope she doesn't sniff out the Z bomb?  I figured I'd take the points and block cheaply if I had to on the next turn.  I put this down, feeling confident that WAR 13G on my next turn would cinch the game.  I was in for a rude awakening.
>Fran_Silver: ?AEGILT 13G TILlAGE +84 370
#note Play incorrectly scored as 83.  Fran is winning 81%, but that's bogus - she can't lose this game now.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEMRRW O11 M.WED +33 349
#note I think we can ignore the sim and trust championship player on this one.  The sim claims DEWAR O11 wins 53%.  Champ is more realistic, saying that nothing wins.  DEWAR is best, this is third.
