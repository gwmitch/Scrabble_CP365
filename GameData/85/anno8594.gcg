#note almost missed this. I don't think I've ever played it before, and I wasn't sure if it was a verb (it's not). This is what I call an "airball" bingo.

#note Keeping ZA for the D4 spot on the next turn. AERTZ is a very dynamic leave, though the star play is T(U)YERE still leaving AZ.

#note yuck. Quackle likes this play, only second to (C)UE, which makes some sense in that it dumps two vowels instead of one. With my play I pretty much have to draw a consonant. Also TIPI works against me a bit, in that if he blocks on row 14 it makes it harder to bingo underneath on the bottom right.
