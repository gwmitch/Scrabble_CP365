>Matthew_Larocque: DMNNOWZ H7 DOWN +16 16
#note I can see why MOWN is superior, DOWN has a few hooks and scores less, but M isn't a bad tile to keep either. I'm surprised exchanges even make the list of choices here.
>Wendy_MgGrath: IOV 10F VI.O +15 15
>Matthew_Larocque: EIMNRTZ G6 ZIT +19 35
#note This wasn't a great play, I somehow missed NERTZ, a word I play all the time. MIZEN I can excuse because I didn't know it.
>Wendy_MgGrath: AG 6G .AG +22 37
>Matthew_Larocque: EIMNOOR 11I MOONIER +72 107
#note wow this has an anagram
>Wendy_MgGrath: AF 10N FA +28 65
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADIQS J2 QAIDS +53 160
#note 50 points and keep a blank while dumping a Q? That's always a desireable result.
>Wendy_MgGrath: LPSU O6 PULS.. +24 89
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABGOYY L9 BO.Y +18 178
#note double Y what, get out of here yuck

I couldn't find much here, sim likes (D)OGY better, I guess because BY is a word. Or GO(OM)BAY ok, what is that a beach where goombas hang out
>Wendy_MgGrath: AIR F10 .AIR +7 96
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGLVY M3 VAGuELY +97 275
#note holy I bingoed with V + Y, I don't think I've even done that before. I gipped myself 2 points though, scoring 95.
>Wendy_MgGrath: AELORST 13A RESTO.AL +68 164
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAEEGP A11 AG.EE +24 299
#note Had to take that line out, PA(R)GE sims about the same, didn't know that one.
>Wendy_MgGrath: CEILOX D9 CILO.EX +48 212
#note She was thinking of CELOTEX, and I don't know 7 letter X words so she can have her 48. My lead was pretty big, I just needed to keep hammering decent scores to put the game away.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEENPU H12 P.EA +27 326
#note EUPNEA nice dump, not sure how wise it is though. I kind of just looked at the obvious hotspots.
>Wendy_MgGrath: DH B13 .DH +25 237
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHNTTU 14H .TH +14 340
#note Have to cover my tracks here since there is still a blank to be played, but sim wants me to play H(A)UT for 16, I guess in an effort to build a bingo rack?  I've tried bulding bingos before when I already had a ~100 point lead, and it backfires all too often.
>Wendy_MgGrath: DEINSU 15J INDUES +32 269
>Matthew_Larocque: AENNRTU 14N NU +10 350
#note (D)UN(G) for 2 more. I could just block the B column here and really shut the board down. AENRT is a super strong 5 letter leave though, high chance of a bingo. The B column here isn't nearly as dangerous since it offers me the TWS if she does happen to get something there.
>Wendy_MgGrath: CEITW B7 TWICE +18 287
#note Well that certainly kills her chances...
>Matthew_Larocque: AENORTT A5 TREAT +34 384
#note Too focused on the red square to see TENTOR(I)A :/
>Wendy_MgGrath: K 7F K.. +8 295
#note The plot thickens huh
>Matthew_Larocque: BFIJNNO 13M JOB +32 416
#note She does have 3 bingos, however none that end with S.
>Wendy_MgGrath: ?EEMRRU E3 MURRs +20 315
#note But incredibly, these letters do form an 8 through the Q. Neat.
>Matthew_Larocque: FINN 4L N.IF +22 438
>Wendy_MgGrath: EE 3D E.E +5 320
#note BONY hook
>Wendy_MgGrath:  (N) +2 322
