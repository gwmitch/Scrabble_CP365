>moh: AAADEIO -AAIO +0 0
#note This is a pretty obvous exchange since no play scores well or leaves a decent rack. It's a tossup between keeping DE and ADE.
>rebecca: EEJNNSW -EEJNN +0 0
>moh: ADDDELV -DDLV +0 0
#note Major mistake. I was irritated that I triplicated my D, but there were plenty of good plays. ADDLED, LAVED, or DADDLE are all fine.
>rebecca: BPU H7 PUB +14 14
>moh: ADEEOTT I6 DATO +19 19
#note No standout play here. I7 ATE was probably better.
>rebecca: GOX J5 GOX +30 44
>moh: DEEGIOT K3 EGO +14 33
#note I didn't have a lot of options here. EGO keeps bingo-prone letters and is as good as anything else available.
>rebecca: AOT L4 OAT +16 60
>moh: DEILMTZ M2 ZED +31 64
#note Tough spot. My initial hopes of nursing decent tiles to a bingo are now gone. ZIT and ZED (both from M2) offer too much back to you if you have an A, but I didn't see much else. The star play was 3I IT(E)MED 26.
>rebecca: EEW J9 WEE +16 76
>moh: IIILMOT 12F LIMIT +17 81
#note 2M (Z)IT isn't terrible, but your previous two plays made me thhink that you had bingo-prone, flexible tiles, so I didn't want to open the 3x3 lane. Plus, ZIT does keep two Is. Obviously, I also could hae slotted LIMIT at 12J, but I didn't want to give you a huge spot for an S (none have been played and we're about a quarter of the way through the game, so it's likely you have an S by now). 
>rebecca: IN 2M .IN +24 100
>moh: EIIOOVY H12 .OVE +27 108
#note I missed all of the good plays from O1. Embarrassingly, E(N)VOI, E(N)VOY, and E(N)VY were all available. 
>rebecca: ACEORT O1 E.ACTOR +36 136
#note E(N)ACTOR is just too risky. ENACT scores almost as well and avoids the huge hook risk.
>moh: ?FIILOY 8M FLY +66 174
#note All of the decent plays hook ENACTORY. FOY, OILY, and FLY are all really close.
>rebecca: AIINRTT -  +0 136
>moh: ?EIIIOS -IIO +0 174
#note Nowhere to score; almost guaranteed to bingo next play with an exchange. Easy decision.
>rebecca: DQU G10 QU.D +21 157
>moh: ?EEIORS M8 .ORESIdE +72 246
#note FORESIDE scores best. Also available were 14H VOLERIES, N7 ELOINERS, and 2E SOIREES.
>rebecca: CFGLNNV 15M .LF +18 175
#note Given your current rack (the only one that's correct in the re-creation), it was probably better to exchange on your previous turn. And even though I've opened up a 3W, it's still better to exchange now. You're going to be paying a big price for several turns by keeping this drek.
>moh: AEHLRRY L11 YAH +32 278
#note I wanted a D for HERALDRY, but no such luck. Computer sim likes YAH.
>rebecca: MR N1 M.R +12 187
#note That rack is still haunting you. EXCHANGE!
>moh: AEKLRRT K13 KAT +17 295
#note Very little available. I almost played RELIMIT*, but I didn't think an intentional phony was in good form given the scores.
>rebecca: GW I11 W.G +21 208
>moh: EILRRRU 15D RULI.R +7 302
#note Weird spot. Hard to believe, but the computer verifies that RULIER is the highest-scoring possible play here for a whopping 7!
>rebecca: AAEEIIN -AAE +0 208
#note necrous

>moh: CENORSU -U +0 302
#note No real scoring opportunities here. 15B UN(RULIER) is fine, but I prefer to just shed the U and bingo next turn most of the time.
>rebecca: S 5J ...S +19 227
>moh: CEENORS 2E ENCORES +68 370
#note ENCORES and RECENSO(R) are the only bingos.
>rebecca: ANN 1H NAN +19 246
>moh: ?DEINPU F1 U.PInNED +62 432
#note I was surprised to discover that the only bingos available were all from F1 (so I didn't miss anything like I suspected at the time).
>rebecca: AAATV D10 AVATA. +18 264
>moh: BEHIIN E4 HIE +21 453
#note 8A BEHIN(D)! Duh.
>rebecca: IJS -  +0 264
>moh: BIJN 6N J. +25 478
#note JO was played earlier, but I forgot to enter that play at the time. I entered it here so the scores would be correct.
>rebecca: IS G2 .IS +17 281
#note CIS is best.
>rebecca:  (BIN) +10 291
