>Jim_Burlant: AEGILOR 8G GO +6 6
#note Not one of the original kibitzer choices, this sims very well.  Best play is GOALIE 8D, and this is not far behind.  Regardless, it wasn't going to stop him from coming back with something big.
>Carl_Davis: ?DEIOTV H5 DEV.TIOn +61 61
#note Carl's best bingo is F3 OuTVIED for 72.
>Jim_Burlant: AEILLRS 13B RALLIES +78 84
#note Can someone explain why Q says SALLIER 13H (which gives a juicy hook down the O column) sims within 1/2 point of this?  I would think that needlessly opening up an S hook down the triple line should make SALLIER a 3 or 4-point dog.  Regardless, this wins 52%.  But not for long.
>Carl_Davis: AEGILNR 11D REGI.NAL +86 147
#note Best bingo for Carl, and he's now winning 72%.
>Jim_Burlant: AHIPPQT 10J HAP +31 115
#note This rack was so unbalanced that I felt I had to wait on the Q, especially since this was a reasonably Q friendly board (one of QI 10G or QI G4 was going to be available on next turn). This sims in second place, 5 points down on J10 QAT.
>Carl_Davis: IWY B11 WI.Y +20 167
>Jim_Burlant: EIMPQTT 12J TEMP +25 140
#note Or TEMPI.
>Carl_Davis: ?CEHRRS 6B SEaRCH.R +70 237
#note Best bingo is N9 CRuSHER 85, which wins 92%.   This still wins 89.
>Jim_Burlant: EIIQTTY M12 .ITY +18 158
#note Coming on the heels of San Diego, I was thinking, "Here we go again."  As a result, I missed my best play, probably out of frustration.  YETI 13L is clearly the play.  I was too busy trying to open a new line that he hopefully wouldn't be able to defend.
>Carl_Davis: EEF 7C FEE +22 259
>Jim_Burlant: EIIQTTU 15H EQUIT. +57 215
#note This is nice, but not best - QUITE 14J scores 68 and would have left me a nice hook Carl may not have been able to block.
>Carl_Davis: AEMT A8 META +23 282
>Jim_Burlant: DDFIJNT B2 DJIN. +26 241
#note OR N10 DJIN.  I'm winning 11%.
>Carl_Davis: DGNNNSU 3B .UG +22 304
>Jim_Burlant: DEFNOTU 14E OF +28 269
#note Realized after I hit my clock that this was too much of an auto-pilot play.  FINO 4A, which I saw after the fact, is indeed the best play.  This is runner up, but a 5-point dog.  I really need to make it easier for myself to hit something on row 2 by placing the O underneath the G.
>Carl_Davis: BO A14 BO +19 323
>Jim_Burlant: BDENRTU 9K DUB +18 287
#note No really good options available and this is as good as anything else, though Q says BUND 9K is 3 points better.  I wrote this off as a negative-equity position, figuring to play for 18 and probably give back 30, hoping to hit something big on the triple line he was going to open.  I didn't expect his next comeback, but given how the game had gone, I shouldn't have been surprised.
>Carl_Davis: ADNW 8L DAWN +42 365
>Jim_Burlant: ELNNORT 4A L.NO +18 305
#note Best, winning not quite 4%. 
>Carl_Davis: AEK 7M KAE +33 398
>Jim_Burlant: EENNORT 2D ENTERON +65 370
#note Too little too late.  At least it allows me to salvage a little spread.
>Carl_Davis: ORSU K2 SOUR +16 414
>Jim_Burlant: ACIOVXZ 15C AZO +25 395
#note Hoping he whiffed on his out play, I was thinking I could sneak back in with VOX on the next turn, but alas, not.
