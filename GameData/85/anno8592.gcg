>moh: AEEHNOT H7 HOE +12 12
#note Nothing scores well, so keeping the most bingo-prone leave (AENT) is best.
>rebecca: DLOR I6 LORD +21 21
>moh: AEHLNRT 9A ENTHRAL.. +65 77
>moh: AEHLNRT --  -65 12
#note I was planning to bingo with ENTHRAL or LEATHERN, but you killed everything will your overlap play. I should have just taken the points with J6 ANTHER, or maybe kept a reasonable leave with J7 NTH. Instead I decided to play an intentional phony; it was a pretty bad one, though, since success relies on your knowing an obscure spelling of a common word (ENTRHAL instead of ENTHRALL) and breaking the standard rules of making adding -ED to a word pronounced that way. Basically, I knew you would challenge, so I should not have played the phony. That said, I thought it was very likely that I would bingo on my next play since almost any change to the board would have allowed it. 
>rebecca: ACGMRUU -ACGMRUU +0 21
>moh: AEHLNRT J8 AH +15 27
#note J6 ANTHER is best. My leave (ELNRT) just doesn't justify such a paltry score.
>rebecca: GIRT G5 GIRT +17 38
>moh: EILLNRT -LL +0 27
#note This is kind of a weird spot. I have six very strong bingo letters (LINTER), but the doubled L kind of kills everything. 10J ILL is probably best, but exchanging LL (which I did) is pretty close.
>rebecca: ENOOORV -ENO +0 38
>moh: AEINNRT -N +0 27
#note The strange rack-board combos continue! I have ENTRAIN, but it's stranded on my rack. The computer sim likes my single-tile exhange about as much as the other options (10J AN or IN).
>rebecca: DIK 10F KID +26 64
>moh: AEINRST E4 RATINES +73 100
#note There are tons of options here (RETINAS, ANESTRI, ASTRIN(G)E, etc.). RATINES is as good as anything else.
>rebecca: AEL D7 LEA +11 75
#note I'd like to know what other letters you had here. LEA seems unlikely to have been the best play (why not play it at D3 for more points?), but I can't say for sure without knowing your rack.
>moh: AEFRUWZ D3 FEZ +45 145
#note C9 WAFER is slightly better since FEZ leaves such a problematic rack (the WU combo is possibly the worst two-tile combo. Those letters late each other, and they don't play well with a host of other letters).
>rebecca: AQST K5 QATS +31 106
>moh: AIRUUWY C9 WAUR +21 166
#note WAUR has got to be the play here. L3 WAIR scores more, but the UUY leave is horrendous.
>rebecca: EEGV 12A VE.GE +26 132
>moh: GIMTUVY B7 MITY +37 203
#note With a lead, it was probably unnecessary to open up such a huge spot with MITY. L4 VIM scores pretty well without the risk. (In general, it's better to keep things locked down with a lead and play more wide-open when behind. I would definitely take the extra points and the added volitility if behind here).
>rebecca: ADEMNOT A3 TANDEM +46 178
#note TANDEM is a great play. Some players might prefer to keep your bingo-prone tiles together with a play like A6 NOM, A6 DOM, or A7 OM. The computer sim judges these plays to be equal to TANDEM. That said, the value of bingo-prone leaves decreases if a player doesn't know and find all of the high-probability bingos. So a player who has taken several years off of the game (um, like you!) is probably better off just taking the points with TANDEM since you know that some of the benefit of keeping ADET or ADENT is lost when you draw a high-prob bingo but don't know the unusual scrabble-specific word.
>moh: EEGLOUV A12 .OLE +21 224
#note Huge miss here. H1 VULGO is obvious. I just inexplicably missed it.
>rebecca: FO C3 OF +26 204
>moh: CEEGNUV 14A .UV +12 236
#note F2 CUE is clearly best. I am not proud of the way I played this game at all. It only gets worse over the next few plays.
>rebecca: BDI L4 DIB +27 231
>moh: CEEGNNY F2 YEN +21 257
#note My play scores best, but if I think you know EYEN, I should avoid setting it up. That said, I have another E and there are only two unseen Es, so I thought it was worth the risk (and there really aren't any other places to score here. Maybe 12A (VERGE)NCE or F2 GEN).
>rebecca: ?EIIJNO 1F ENJOIn +43 274
#note JEON is clearly best. Just a case of re-mastering the words.
>moh: CEGNPRT F12 REP +21 278
#note The ONLY places to score more than 11 points on this board all require my playing from F12 and opening up the triple lane. I probably should have played REC instead of REP since REP takes so many hooks. I'm now behind, so I need points, but I'm really trying to throw the game away by giving you so many chances to score big here.
>rebecca: ?ABCEIO 15F OBI +21 295
#note You thought about BIOtA, and I'm really glad you didn't play it. It would have been a really bad waste of the blank. Your goal at this point in the game should be to make sure you bingo with that blank; if you bingo, you're going to win the vast majority of the time. Since you don't usually have time troube, this is probably the kind of rack where it's definitely worth looking for awhile. You might have seen AErOBIC or AmOEBIC. Short of those bingos, COBIA is the play (again, just a matter of relearning the word list).
>moh: CGNTUWX 14H TUX +28 306
#note TUX is pretty obvious, due mostly to the dearth of plays that score anything.
>rebecca: ?ACO J11 COA. +13 308
#note I really don't like COA(X) here. At this point (close game where you have the critical remaining blank), every play you make should either score really well or open a bingo lane. With only one bingo lane on the board, it's a disater if you don't open a second and then I kill the only lane. Since there really aren't any decent places to score, a play like O(X) really puts the pressure on me. O(X) essentially ties the game while opening a really nice bingo lane along row 12 (COX, GOX, POX, SOX, and LOX are all available with the unseen tiles, not to mention your blank adds other hooks). If I play from OX, I will probably open up places for you to play an 8 vertically along column M or N. 
>moh: ACGINSW 6A .AW +21 327
#note With the dwindling bag, I felt like I could pull out a win as long as you didn't bingo (I have a pretty big edge in close games like this because of my pre-endgame and endgame experience. At some point I'd be happy to discuss endgame and pre-endgame with you, as I'm the only one at the local club who plays anything resembling an endgame. I don't mean to sound condescending, but it's just a fact that the other club members tend to just play out their tiles in a somewhat haphazard manner, and I usually win close games because of that fact. Last night I won a 4-point game against Glenda because of this, and I stuck Ellen with a W because she just didn't look ahead to see where she could play her sole remaining tile. Of course it's easy to avoid getting W-stuck, but if you're just playing tiles to end the game, it can happen if your opponent is aware). Anyhow, it's pretty close between my play and M5 SAW.
>rebecca: ?AEILNU H1 .EU +10 318
#note You weren't sure of your rack here, but there are bingos on most of the possible racks (ANEURIN, AURICLE, or ALUNITE, depending on which tiles were in the bag. You said the P was drawn last and that you were vowel-heavy, so I think your rack had to include one of those. They are all pretty high-probabilty, and they are definitely the kind of words you will start playing as a matter of course as you continue refamiliarizing yourself with the game.). If you don't see a bingo, and if you don't score really well, you should try to maximize your chances of bingoing out on your next play. Doing this requires opening a second lane and avoiding drawing the last tile (if you empty to bag, I will know your entire rack which makes it a lot easier to block any possible bingos). Something like 12J (O)I, 13J (A)N or 12J (O)R (depending on exactly what your rack was) will accomplish this. Ideally the two bingo spots would be in entirely different areas of the board, but that's impossible here.
>moh: CGINOSS M3 COSS +32 359
#note It's incorrect for me to leave row 12 unblocked, just in case you find PR(O)LAmIN. 
>rebecca: ?AILNPR 11J .ARP +16 334
#note PR(O)LAmIN is the only win. Weird word; tough find.
