>Matthew_Larocque: DEEILLZ E8 .EILED +20 20
#note This sims decently, and I slightly favour turnover plays at the start. LEZ/LO seems like a huge waste despite how well it does in the simulation. I didn't know DEIL because I'm awesome.
>Richard_Charach: OPU 9G UPO +14 28
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEHOTZ D12 HAZE +47 67
#note ZOEA(E) performs quite a bit better in the sim, but plays such as that offer the opponent an easy 40 - I'm not really building any kind of lead by doing that.
>Richard_Charach: ABELN 15D .NABLE +24 52
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFIOTY 14A OYE. +32 99
#note I must have missed FOY for 41, that's a clear case of taking max points.
>Richard_Charach: AERRRST 7H TARRERS +64 116
#note Yikes, I honestly couldn't challenge this with confidence :/ Not like I've studied bingos with 3 ars :/ But still, I don't think anyone I've played would let this go. Thankfully I didn't lose the game...

>Richard_Charach: DOW A12 WO.D +36 152
>Matthew_Larocque: DEKMNRT C9 MERK +24 158
#note I couldn't find anything on this turn. It doesn't do awful in the sim - about 6th place.

M(E)T 13C is the far away top option, kind of a tricky hook when the word is pronounced completely different. I also seem to miss KNEED a lot when it comes up.

#note I'm not usually one to obsess about defense, and the B column bingos fork the triples anyways, so I should have just done that. But I did miss OxIDATE in the same place for 73 - I always neglect to consider the blank as high point tiles such as X.
>Richard_Charach: CPU B8 CUP +27 292
>Matthew_Larocque: BEINTUX C3 UNB.X +44 328
#note Crucial find, this play likely made the difference between winning or losing - 10% higher winning chances than the next best option.

>Richard_Charach: GOS O1 GOS +29 350
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEFIST K2 FACT +31 397
#note I took a good amount of time on this play. My lead isn't very big, so I need max points, and it wouldn't hurt to go out next turn, which is usually pretty easy to do with an S.
>Richard_Charach: AEGIORT A1 RIO.A +36 386
>Matthew_Larocque: EIRS E1 REIS +16 413
>Matthew_Larocque:  (EGT) +8 421
#note So I was able to prevail but leaving tarrers on the board made it harder than it needed to be. That's not even a bad blunder compared to some of the moronic things I've done in scrabble tournament games though! Some are almost too awful for me to even quackle them. But I do it anyways. Heh.
