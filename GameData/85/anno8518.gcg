>Matthew_Larocque: BCDEIMN H4 MINCED +28 28
#note Other options include BEDIM, CEBID, and IMBED. Not that I knew those words anyways heh.  MINCED has the edge in the simulation, though.
>Brian_G.: AOTU G3 AUTO +13 13
>Matthew_Larocque: BFGLNPT 8F BL.NT +7 35
#note Bad move, missed playing through UM, and P(E)LF simulates better in this spot. Still, exchanging isn't a bad idea here since there's no way to score decent points.
>Brian_G.: EEP I4 PEE +18 31
>Matthew_Larocque: CFFGPTU F6 PU. +25 60
#note Taking the points here even though I run the risk of having no vowels next turn. I didn't know of TUMP, which allows the excellent play of PFFT. Quackle also likes CU(B) better, but if he has an S he's going to make a good scoring play next turn and I might have crapola.
>Brian_G.: ?EIIRTW J8 .WIsTIER +64 95
#note Well that opens things up doesn't it
>Matthew_Larocque: CFGLRRT 13H CL.FT +11 71
#note Yuck. I misguidedly thought CLIFT didn't take an S hook. Or at least I thought one of CLIFT or CLEFT didn't. They both do, so I'm not sure where this idea sprung from. This simulates poorly, while GR(I)FT is top, ahead of a variety of exchanges.
>Brian_G.: EIW 15H WI.E +21 116
#note I remembered WIREHAIR once he put this down, and sort of tried to fish for it from here on.
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGGIRY 9J .IGGY +15 86
#note Pretty sure I saw EGGY for 30, but I was still obsessed with getting (WIRE)HAIR and didn't want him to block it, so made the inferior play. Quackle also likes taking the gamble with just playing EGG at L12.
>Brian_G.: AAH 8M AAH +26 142
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFNORS 7M FRO +32 118
>Brian_G.: ARV F2 VAR +24 166
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENRSZ J2 ZAS +41 159
#note I'm still under the impression that I can't S-hook CLIFT. Yeah...
>Brian_G.: BINRU 11E BRUIN. +14 180
>Matthew_Larocque: EEENORR 2J .ONER +28 187
>Brian_G.: DEX 1M DEX +38 218
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEHLRU 3M LEU +17 204
#note Got the last H *snickers* just need AI now
>Brian_G.: DO 6N DO +25 243
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHJLRS 12D JEE +26 230
#note I know this sucks, but I figured it would keep him occupied while I keep fishing for AI because that's all I cared about at this point lol
>Brian_G.: ANT C11 TAN +17 260
>Matthew_Larocque: AHILRSV 15H ....HAIR +54 284
#note yay
>Brian_G.: AEM 12J .EAM +21 281
>Matthew_Larocque: DLOSTVY 11L VOLT +17 301
#note holy yuck, going to be tough to win with this garbage now. This sims best though and says it wins 51% of the time.
>Brian_G.: IQ B10 QI +33 314
#note He was extremely paranoid about this play thinking I'd score big on that TWS.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADENOSY A11 DYNES +43 344
#note And I did, thinking this was the obvious play to make. However, it turned out to be the wrong choice. DOYEN scores well and keeps the S. I didn't know DOYEN at the time of this tournament unfortunately. I also wouldn't have used the S on CLIFT because I'm silly. 

Other options include SYNOD, DONSY, and NOSEY. In this scenario, anything to avoid the death knell AOO would have sufficed...
>Brian_G.: ?GIKOSS 14C GOoKS +24 338
#note He took a lot of time before playing here. I can't go out, I can't score for crap, and I can't stop him from going out. Pretty brutal. If I draw anything except another O, I can win, and there was a 75% chance I would draw something that wasn't an O... blah

>Matthew_Larocque: AOO C11 ....O +6 350
#note Figured I would stop is best out play of (TANG)S/SI/(O)I, doesn't really matter much. I guess the best play is to block (CLIFT)S, but for some reason he didn't play that....
>Brian_G.: IS 9E IS +10 348
#note Indeed, an instance where going out isn't the best play, maybe he wasn't sure about CLIFTS either?
>Brian_G.:  (AO) +4 352
