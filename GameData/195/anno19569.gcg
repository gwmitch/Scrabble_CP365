#note well, you can, but I'm not. At this point I was trying to focus, but it was damn near impossible since my good friend and clubmate was facing my good friend and superior player at table 1. So I obviously wanted Jason to win in theory but I knew that it would destroy Conrad if he lost because he's a huge favorite, and at any given point his anxiety might have gotten triggered and he would have fell victim to something he has been trying for a long time to ward off. 

In short, I was really anxious myself and at some point in this game I just decided to hurry up and fish for TRANQUILISER, which isn't even a word, so I can see what was going on at table 1.

#note Sorry to end my games on such a bland note. I had an amazing time at Nationals and the only thing that sucked is the way the games I played went.
