#note Major error.  Didn't even think of HANDLIKE.  Probably would have liked it.

>Sean_Wrona: ADGHIIS N3 DASHI.I +23 83
#note Major error.  I was happy I found this and somehow didn't look for smarter plays that didn't burn the S for so few points.

#note I was leaning toward this not being good but wasn't completely sure, and she wasn't sure enough to challenge either.  I suppose this is an example of a 'smart phony', unlike PURATED against Diana Grosman.

#note Had I been thinking of -ING bingos here, I would have just dumped the X, but I don't think I saw the XI/XI spot.  I don't think this is a major error though, although SNOW would have been a lot more defensive here.
>Brenda_Casey: Q 7M Q. +42 251
#note Well, there's the real problem with not playing the X there on the previous turn.

>Sean_Wrona: ?NOSTUU 15F tU.NOUTS +58 437
#note Oh, OUTSUNG would have prevented her from playing BARFING in the same spot.  I think that's a major error with two Gs left but I don't think it matters.

>Sean_Wrona: ACEORSV M12 VOE. +14 451
#note Somehow I missed VACS.  Major error.

Major errors (4): ALIKE (rack vision), DASHIKI (strategy), TURNOUTS (rack vision), VOES (rack vision)
