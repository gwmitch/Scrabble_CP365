#note Major strategic error.  I shouldn't hold on to the Z when the one high-scoring spot is likely to be blocked.

#note Major word knowledge error.  I do know ALDRINS is a word but I don't think of it.  This is better than 10I ALDRINS for sure though.

#note I missed a pretty common word bingo and played a phony (thought it was good).  Oops.  Having said that, since FUTZY* wasn't challenged, this is not much worse than bingoing.  Since it actually sims better and it wasn't challenged, I won't call this a major error, but it's still an error.

#note Major word knowledge error (I didn't know GAMELANS).  In fact, all I saw was this and ANTIMALE but I definitely preferred this.

Misscored as 66.
>Carole_Denton: IX 14F XI +51 275
#note Well, she'd have had this after either LAMINATE or ANTIMALE but she *might* not have had it if I played GAMELANS (having said that, if she had an A or an O, she'd still hit the B5 spot).

>Sean_Wrona: BCIMOTT 12H MOC +17 381
#note Major strategic error.  Since I don't have a great block for the column O S hook (which I didn't notice) I need to outrun it and I'm blocking a line that almost has no value.  Playing the other MOC (which I didn't see) ends up blocking the bingo line that she was actually able to use.

>Sean_Wrona: BENORTT 2M .OT +14 395
#note Okay, the sixes starting with R essentially prevent columns A and B from being used and those were clearly the bigger threats, hence those were the better plays (which I didn't even consider or think about) and I paid the price for it.  Major strategic error.
