#note Good thing I didn't play INGROWS! 

Quiz: what are the front hooks to ROWINGS?

Note: I'm going to autopilot this game... I'm already gibsonized and after I (spoiler) bingo 2 times in the first 3 turns I just play really fast. 
>Robin_Lewis: IIK 9F KI.I +13 13
#note Answer: Nothing! Would you have been confident enough to play ROWINGS at H2?
>Matt_Canik: ACDNRTU 10E CAN.D +23 99
#note I saw DUCAT(S) and was like "No I'd rather play this". 
>Robin_Lewis: EIOU 7F OU.IE +7 20
>Matt_Canik: DEORRTU J1 REROUT.D +63 162
#note Of course you're allowed to make bad plays holding RTU if you draw DEOR into it!
>Robin_Lewis: EEJ 1G JEE. +33 53
>Matt_Canik: ADGIOTT 2F GOT +19 181
#note Wanted to play a word to the S in ROWINGS to shut more bingo lines down but I didn't see anything except DITTOS
>Robin_Lewis: HRTU 6C RUTH +28 81
>Matt_Canik: AADEIOT 5E IOTA +18 199
#note Would anyone play B2 IODATE?  
I know some people would play 3E IODATE.

>Matt_Canik: AADEEHN 12D AAH +29 228
>Robin_Lewis: EIV 14B VIE +27 142
#note Robin debated setting down one more tile here... presumably an S, so presumably she has two. 
>Matt_Canik: BDEEENV 3I B.EVE +26 254
#note Didn't want to open BREVET and the E, but this play is way better than other options.

#note Two blanks out... let's go get them!
>Robin_Lewis: AWY C4 WA.Y +24 229
>Matt_Canik: ?EEFINQ D1 FINE +34 334
#note I really don't want to play FINE because it holds EQ? and I probably won't bingo with QE?.... I'd better draw the second blank!
>Robin_Lewis: BPU J11 PUB +17 246
>Matt_Canik: ??EMNOQ M1 Qu.ENdOM +68 402
#note yay second blank!
