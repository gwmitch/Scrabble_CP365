#note I saw GADOIDS, but I was more than 50% sure this was good and thought it might draw a challenge.  Instead, it won me the prize for most outrageous successful phoney

#note Tricky spot.  Juicy hotspots, but no good plays.  Simming best is C12 IF! It bingos a lot, and sometimes even an x3x3.  Not an intuitive time to fish 1.  Opponent average score is quite identical no matter what I play; might as well maximize my own bingo/future score.

#note Scores, keeps a good leave.  Though he's not likely to have the X now, blocking easy pts is still important.

>E_Tran: AINRSTU 4A ANTIRUS. +68 390
#note He'll likely find DINGIEST on a second try, and I don't think he'll find DIGESTIF (I didn't even spot it).  Should I do ANTIRUST and give up a counter-bingo, or should I do U(N)/(N)U, to block him, while being very close to a bingo.  With these assumptions, Quack says ANTIRUST -> DINGIEST sequence is slightly being NU/UN.  But ANTIRUST -> DINGIEST also has the benefit of removing more tiles from the bag
