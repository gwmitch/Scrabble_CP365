#note Lucky guess, I think I've seen this before but I'm not sure.  It was challenged and came back good.  The board over was 2 old ladies who were also very skeptical of the play but hell, it was good.

#note So I often have problems with board vision, where I can't see anything, and so eventually I'll find one play that isn't horrible, and I'll just get stuck.  So here for example, I for some reason completely ignored the 6B spot and couldn't find anything down at 15A and so I just stopped thinking and of course made this horrible play.  I think I have a really bad problem of knowing whether or not the play I just made is terrible and can't determine whether the board is useless or I'm just not seeing anything.  Just playing OP B5 is waaaaay better and is something I obviously could have seen.

#note CRE(ES)H is a cool word.  I didn't really know what to do hear  because I didn't want to keep all consonants and the J, but I didn't really see anything better that was worth doing.  JE(ES) I think is a better play but all of the plays here are difficult to discern.

#note Again JEES is better here, but this is really close behind.  JEES is a much better blocking play though and so I think that puts it ahead by a good bit, even though its relatively even with JERID according to quackle.  CP also says JEES but not by much.
