#note ooh we meet again -_-
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEIORV 7H .I +12 12
>Matthew_Ridout: AOZ 6I AZO +34 56
#note nice
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEORVV K5 C.VE +18 30
#note I did draw a V, nice observation, observer! :)

Guess I should have considered K5 V(O)E. I don't know how comfortable Matthew would have been had I done that. I think I wasn't in the mood to waste my energy on another board I should be winning on every game.
>Matthew_Ridout: ADO J8 ADO +8 64
>Joshua_Sokol: EMORTVW K10 WOVE +25 55
#note It was between this and 5E VOWER. I didn't want a baby bingo to mess up my winning chances, but playing VOWER makes sense in that respect since he's likely to not be holding much scoring potential that would hurt at H1. Also, if he does in fact bingo after ADO, A(VOWER) is still an escape route from the silliness of a post-baby bingo-on-a-closed-board syndrome. Still, the synergy of MRT compared to MT, the reduced variance and average score that exists in a vacuum after WOVE compared to VOWER and very similar bingo chances that exist for Matthew after both plays seem to make WOVE a slight favorite here.
>Matthew_Ridout: EGP I10 PEG +14 78
#note This is good.
>Joshua_Sokol: MORSTUX J13 OX +27 82
#note PEG implies no Y and probably no O, but this is just stupid compared to (V)OX or G8 or L13 XU. Did I miss the fact that this doesn't block bingos ending in S? I guess so. Not a very good play.
>Matthew_Ridout: AKRT G8 KART +15 93
>Joshua_Sokol: EMRSTUY 15J YUM +24 106
#note I actually didn't know TUYER. This is still the right play, in my opinion, but I should know TUYER. Keeping the right side of the board closed off here is a good idea. 
>Matthew_Ridout: EIOPRSU 11C BLIN. +14 107
>Matthew_Ridout: EIOPRSU --  -14 93
#note Was so eager for him to hit the clock
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGIRST 12A AIGRETS +77 183
#note Given the inference I should actually play at F2. I failed to consider that I was still giving him a G to play through, here, and that E on the 2x2 lane is not good. This was a pretty decent mistake on my part even though I did consider that I shouldn't play GAITERS. F2 TRIAGES is the play. 
>Matthew_Ridout: BEILNN B12 .NN +6 99
#note I think he laid something else down here and showed me an E. Or maybe I just imagined his leave was BEILS or BEIL?.
>Joshua_Sokol: CDFIINT E8 CITI.D +18 201
#note A8 FINC(A) seems like a great play. I had forgotten about that word. This is great if it works, though, and it will probably work a large majority of the time. I decide to go all out defensive here, despite not having the energy to earlier, due to my lead. I also thought that Matthew might very well challenge this word. So I'd take this over FINCA, actually.
>Matthew_Ridout: INPT A8 PINT. +21 120
>Joshua_Sokol: EFLNNRR 9A .NN +4 205
#note Same line of thought as last move. There are places that he might bingo but it's very remote after this play. Especially since he drew 4 tiles. But there are two blanks out and three esses out, so this may get troubling. Perhaps F12 (T)ERN is a better idea. I didn't consider that.
>Matthew_Ridout: BLOW C5 BLOW. +11 131
#note was happy about this
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFLRRR 5G ERR +6 211
#note I missed 5C BRR and BRRR here. Wow.
>Matthew_Ridout: BEIJ H1 JIBE. +45 176
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AFGLNR 2C RAfFL.NG +73 284
#note But I can't go wrong when I draw like this. Despite this not scoring very well I think it's right to not give anything back here, and in case he doesn't bingo next turn, I can keep the board down to one bingo lane for the rest of the game, which means that I should win with ease. I didn't know the highest scoring bingo here, INFRUGAL.
>Matthew_Ridout: ?ADEETU L14 U. +4 180
>Joshua_Sokol: AELMSTY 15J ...MY +15 299
#note Given that Matthew is very strong here I decided to do something unusual. Instead of taking the outrunning route with 1A YLEM or the blocking bingos route with 11K (O)Y, I block a few fewer bingos, score a bit more, and keep a really strong leave. I think that Matthew wasn't necessarily going to hit B15 next turn, despite it being likely for him to do so, and that he would play A(Y) or O(Y) at 14N or something next turn, giving me a very likely bingo. I should have just played YLEM and outrun everything. I'm likely enough to bingo next turn with YLEM too. I'm making mistakes, but at least they have yet to amount to the mistake that Matthew has made this game.
>Matthew_Ridout: ?ELOOST 15B STOOLiE +75 255
#note aha, he bingos anyway. I think he has to play something at 3H here to have a fighting chance. He likely missed the spot. Interesting how RAFFLING didn't do what I thought it would do. But yeah, this is a very significant mistake on Matthew's part.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILST N14 A. +10 309
#note I have an 11/17 chance of bingoing next turn, and at least I calculated that, but I'm no longer close to being out of the woods. I may miss and he may have something like A1 DEAF that will really hurt. Because of this I should always play 1A ELATE. Why I chose the aggressive route when the game is supposed to be won and variance-less, I have no idea. This is so terribly wrong.
>Matthew_Ridout: AE C11 A.E +12 267
#note missing the 5-point superior option, B8 A(N)E.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEILST O8 ISLETED +80 389
#note lucky for me I didn't have to worry, since I hit.
>Matthew_Ridout: AADEEHS B8 A.E +17 284
#note -8 to SA(N)E in the same spot. For some reason Matthew spotted this a turn later. 
>Joshua_Sokol: FHIORUU D1 H.IR +22 411
>Matthew_Ridout: ADEHS 1A SHA. +32 316
#note deceptively -2 to N5 SADHE. I didn't know that word, but maybe Matthew did.
>Joshua_Sokol: FOUU 14H FO. +18 429
>Matthew_Ridout: DE N10 ED +12 328
>Matthew_Ridout:  (UU) +4 332
#note At least I can sleep tonight knowing that there is at least one more game in which I outplayed my opponent in Div 1 Nationals.
