>Siri_T: KRSU 8G RUSK +16 16
>E_Tran: ADEEFIN J6 FA.ED +25 25
#note Sim also likes FA(K)E, though Siri's play suggests he'll have a hook to it.
>Siri_T: AGSZ K5 ZAGS +45 61
>E_Tran: BEEILNN L6 BE +16 41
#note The leave is worse than 9/7F BEN, but this kills easy points on L, forcing Siri into more mistakes.
>Siri_T: ADY M7 DAY +21 82
>E_Tran: EIIJLNN -JIILN +0 41
#note I don't want to be stuck exchanging 10 pt plays.  Better to exchange, prolong the game, and get some bingos down.
>Siri_T: NW 8M .WN +18 100
>E_Tran: ??EIILN O1 LENItIo. +71 112
#note Only bingo that scores 71.

>Siri_T: OOP M3 POO +25 156
>E_Tran: EEEILMT N8 .EE +13 157
#note 9L EYE is definitely a better dump to give less back, and give back fewer easy plays.  This is so easily punishable.
>Siri_T: EIORRST L9 RIOTERS +72 228
>E_Tran: EIILLMT 15H MILL. +21 178
#note Missed bingo #2.  Also, this play isn't that good.

#note The quackle play is VAGUS/JINS.  Given his last few fishy plays, I wanted to try to kill bingo lines.  Quack agrees that this play best reduces his bingo%.  Since this is close with VAGUS, I prefer this play
>Siri_T: O L5 O.. +17 304
>E_Tran: AAEMRSV 8A VARA +28 343
#note This play kills line 7, but gives up a juicy V and A.  It's a one time shot though, as if he doesn't bingo, I can play through B and kill both lines.  It seems counter to my previous comment of reducing bingo%, but I still need to score.  The other option is GAVE, to try to eke out a close win.  Quack likes VARA, though inferring a rack of, say, AEORT, puts VA(NE) on top.

>E_Tran: EGMOPSY 13A POGEYS +37 380
#note 7B POGY should be automatic here.  Siri still has line 14 to make NEEM, but he may miss that spot.  
>Siri_T: O 11K ..O +6 323
>E_Tran: CLMNTUV B7 C.LM +14 394
#note Sim likes ditching the V: V(A)N or V(A)C, and also LUV 7D.
>Siri_T: AENOORT A11 TO.ER +24 347
>E_Tran: INTUV D12 N.VI +16 410
#note Best sequence.  Block his out, and preserve a good out.
