>Scott_McDougall: EH 8H EH +10 10
>Sean_Wrona: ADEFOTU 9F FADEOUT +72 72
#note Yeah, I can see why 7F is winning the sim because EH can't be hooked while HE can and I paid for that on the next turn (although he'd have still had OUTLINER/TROTLINE...)
>Scott_McDougall: EILNORT 10I RETINOL +75 85
>Sean_Wrona: AADILLT 11E TIDAL +19 91
#note I didn't know LATILLA.  That's certainly not high probability OR playability.
>Scott_McDougall: ACDIT O5 DICTA. +27 112
#note Sounded reasonable to me.
>Sean_Wrona: ACGHLOS N5 OH +29 120
#note Major rack management error.  I almost certainly wasn't looking for plays using the S and I guess I have to agree AGHAS is superior.  CGL is an ugly combination with only one vowel.
>Scott_McDougall: ABJ M3 JAB +30 142
>Sean_Wrona: ACGLORS K5 RAGO..S +32 152
>Scott_McDougall: EENP J3 NEEP +24 166
>Sean_Wrona: ACLMSWY H11 .LWAY +36 188
#note I believe this was held but he did not challenge.
>Scott_McDougall: INOQU 12B QUOIN +32 198
>Sean_Wrona: CEGMOSX I13 OX +25 213
#note Should I be playing defense when the score is basically tied?  And if I intended to, wouldn't COAX be better and give me a more synergistic rack?  Yes, it would, but this is still okay.
>Scott_McDougall: ENW J13 WEN +29 227
>Sean_Wrona: ACEGMSU B12 .UAG +28 241
#note Major word knowledge error.  I'd never seen MUSCAE before.
>Scott_McDougall: DO K14 DO +17 244
>Sean_Wrona: CEIMNNS 13A C.MIN +31 272
#note CUMINS is simming MUCH better?  Well, I'm still wouldn't do that.  This isn't a great board for an S but I want to at least keep it to use on a later turn since inevitably one of us is going to open the board again.
>Scott_McDougall: EGV 7F VEG +13 257
>Sean_Wrona: EEENOPS 15A O.EE +18 290
#note Same deal.  OGEES is simming better but PANE/NAPE are simming better than even those.  I want rack balance at this time and I still would, although I was well aware of the clever DICTAL*-->EDICTAL crossword opportunity.
>Scott_McDougall: AF G14 FA +26 283
>Sean_Wrona: AEEINPS 4L N.PE +33 323
#note Even though NAPE is winning the sim sometimes, I think I needed to play APE for the greater rack balance.  It's alternating between NAPE/APE/SNIPE.  SNIPE I didn't see but that might be better than either.  Having said that, I thought he might not know EDICTAL so that made a play hooking DICTAL more valuable.
>Scott_McDougall: RTY -  +0 283
#note It is funny I didn't know DICTAL was bad and he didn't know EDICTAL was good.  A real comedy of errors.  EDICTAL is definitely the more important word to know though.
>Sean_Wrona: AEIIRSZ G3 ZAIR. +24 347
#note Major strategic error.  Missed NAZI but this makes it easier to use this quadrant to eventually set up bingos.  I think I was wanting to block plays off NEEP but the odds of him hitting that based on the tiles left are actually not that great.  Doing this I make it easier for him to create setup plays.
>Scott_McDougall: RTY 4E TR.Y +11 294
>Sean_Wrona: ?EIIMST D2 MISEdIT +84 431
#note Good thing I didn't waste the S on CUMINS or OGEES, right?
>Scott_McDougall: EIKRSSU C7 KUE +26 320
>Sean_Wrona: ?BLRV H1 BRa. +34 465
#note Major errors (3): OH (rack management), QUAG (word knowledge), ZAIRE (strategy)
