#note DANG is a cool find that I missed, but no way would I have played that and left a V on such a closed board.

#note REDOX is a msis, but this is okay.  At least I didn't pay for this by him having a Y on the next turn.

>Sean_Wrona: ?AEGIRS M8 REImAG.S +68 256
#note Major strategic error.  I must have played this to block as many lines through RALLIES as possible.  However, I created so many lines for 8s with this play in addition to plays parallel to REIMAGES, whereas playing anything at L6 would make the board a lot more closed despite leaving the S open (which is probably what I was excessively paranoid about).  Not to mention those plays all score more too.

#note With him holding the O and the blank, there is nothing I can do about OPUS so now all I can do is hope he doesn't draw into a bingo.  Luckily, having the O in the 6th or 7th position does make this hard, and looking at his rack I didn't see anything close to a bingo so I just decided to score.
