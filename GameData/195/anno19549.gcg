#note I suppose I should ahve kept fishing but at this point I don't think I'd be likely to hit any bingo I drew, so I think this is okay.

#note I misread my play.  It was actually VIE, not VIG (my handwriting is atrocious, and I didn't even have a G), so I didn't miss COVETING as it looks like here.  I'm not correcting it because there were 15 or 20 plays in between and since I'm going through all my games at Nationals and have much more important stuff I need to do, I'm not going to go through the rest of the game and fix it.  So a G he plays later is erroneously listed as an E (GIES instead of GIGS, which he actually played).

#note This sims really badly (57% winning percentage vs. 66% for VULPINE).  This time, I refuse to buy it.  VULPINE, PUNIER, PUNNER (all of which I didn't even look at) seem much more dangerous after he makes this setup.  Not calling this a major error even though this ugly, ugly board led us both to make many more significant errors later.

>Sean_Wrona: AEEILLN 7M LEI +11 172
#note Der...  Now after seeing his obvious S setup last turn I missed it this time.  Clearly VILLAE is the standout play since it blocks SCORN bingos.  Major error.

>Sean_Wrona: DEGINRW 15D GR.W +10 352
#note Well, it isn't pretty but it works and it prevents him from putting his last S there and even if he does I still win after I accept it (which I'm essentially forced to regardless of how ridiculous GREWS looks) - and I'll call that a major error, but at this point I needed a win *so badly* after that horrific string of choke losses that I had no choice but to let GREWS go.
>Mark_Garrod: EEILOSS 1L .IES +15 313
#note Oh, the play I wrote down as VIG much earlier in the game was VIE (I can't read my writing).  So the last G was still available for him to play what was actually GIGS here, but I'm recording it as GIES.  His actual rack was EGILOSS.  So my scoring error wasn't a scoring error, and this play is going to be listed as 15 when it was actually 18, so I actually have 2 points less and he actually has 3 points more but I'm not going to go back that many turns to fix two transposed tiles so many turns apart when I have many more important things I need to do.  Sorry.

#note Major error, but it is a rare example of me playing it safe, which is something I need to do more often.

#note Major errors (1): LEI (strategy)

I actually played this game way better than I thought I did.  I thought we both played incredibly sloppy, but actually it doesn't appear either of us played as sloppy as it seemed like we did.  Well, we both seemed to be tremendously lacking confidence after not achieving what we thought we should have at this point.
