>Joshua_Sokol: ADEERSS H8 RESEDAS +70 70
#note Taking the 70 points sims the worst out of the 7 placements of this word! That is why I played it for 70, obviously.
>Fern_Lindzon: IQ 10F QI. +32 32

>Fern_Lindzon: AI 11E AI +15 47
>Joshua_Sokol: CEHMTUX 14B EXHUM.. +50 146
#note Although this is nice, MUTCH(ES) in the same spot is possibly better. I didn't actually know MUTCH, nor did I know SMUTCH, but if Fern knows both, a play next turn that doesn't block that S hook will be responded to by a very strong X play.

>Fern_Lindzon: AA 13C AA +27 148
>Joshua_Sokol: ADINPST D2 PINTAD.S +72 237
#note Three cheers to me for missing a word I did in fact study. I'm losing hope, I think the only thing left to try is study a ton and see if I still miss stuff like SANDPIT(S). I saw PANDITS, at least. -17
>Fern_Lindzon: ?BDELNU A1 BLUNDEr. +83 231
#note I wondered if she had missed BUNDLEr(S) or chickened out. -3 for Fern.
>Joshua_Sokol: EINOTTV 12A VET +20 257
#note The spot that this blocked seemed very scary. In fact, Quackle says that my play reduces Fern's next score by more than 10 points.
>Fern_Lindzon: EGINRTV 3C R.VETING +78 309
#note Quackle also said that with a random rack, Fern had around a 3% chance of bingoing after my play. 
>Joshua_Sokol: CIINOOT H1 OT.C +27 284
#note around 97% of the time here, I would not be at such an immense disadvantage, this turn. But I think I needed to push through my deficit and score as much as I could here rather than hope for a very good rack next turn.
>Fern_Lindzon: AINU 15A UNAI +35 344
#note oh wow
>Joshua_Sokol: BEIINOT 2F BI.E +26 310
#note A good draw. Now it's imperative to keep the pressure on. Even with this draw, which is probably in the top 10% I can ask for, I'm less likely to win this game than I was last turn, which shows how ridiculous UNAI was.
>Fern_Lindzon: AEF B6 FE.A +28 372
>Joshua_Sokol: FILNOTZ I12 OF +26 336
#note Now whatever I do I have to open up the board. I unfortunately only saw (G)INZO when it was too late and I had made my move. That is clearly the right play. Another decent draw even though it doesn't seem so, since I am now more likely to win than I was last turn.
>Fern_Lindzon: HMO 1G H.MO +20 392
>Joshua_Sokol: ILNOTUZ J3 .INZO +35 371
#note Since there's only one A left, it's not necessarily a bad idea to play J10 ZIN or ZIT here, but I wanted to make sure Fern was scared that, rightly so, I was going to bingo here and that she couldn't do much about it, so I think (G)INZO is most definitely the right play this turn as well. She just used up pretty good tiles in her last play and I drew a U, so I'm now less likely than last turn to win this game.
>Fern_Lindzon: AERTY K4 TEARY +35 427
#note okay, now I am truly lost
>Joshua_Sokol: GLOTUWW 5J ..W +6 377
#note Especially with this horrible draw. I immediately saw that my only hope at this point was to A) J stick her, which didn't really seem possible, or fish for something that she doesn't manage to see/block. Which is when I saw OUTGLOW. That's the only thing I can potentially hit, and there are three O's for me to draw. 

But perhaps the J stick is possible, but even then, I would have to a) draw the E and the I or the Y so that she has no J plays or b) block one of the spots and draw one of the necessary tiles for a J stick. She can actually only play JOE at J10 or JI(V)E/JI(V)Y at A10. But even then, I can't score enough to win despite the J stick, since that's 16 points. I can only score 24 points with J10 WOW and draw the I and/or the Y, and be 32 points down with nowhere to score. Therefore, J-sticking will not work, unless some miracle occurs and I fish off my W at B11 and she opens a spot since she has no J play or doesn't have the J at all and I don't draw it and she can't use it, which is basically impossible. Therefore my only shot was to fish for OUTGLOW and hope she can't block or doesn't block or messes up some other way. 
>Fern_Lindzon: O 8K .O +6 433
>Joshua_Sokol: GLLOTUW 12H ..L +4 381
#note When she played YO, first I was like "damn it I won't draw an O... Then I realized! She must either have completely mistracked, made a lackluster block that she thought would work for anything AND she must have forgotten that YOU existed over a Scrabble board, one of the most common English words!

I still had to draw the O though... The way this game was going-
