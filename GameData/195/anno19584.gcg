>E_Tran: ENOQVWZ 8D WOVEN +30 30
#note Not often does the star play keep exactly QZ.
>Wayne_C: GP G7 P.G +11 11
>E_Tran: LQRTUVZ -VULTQ +0 30
#note 2ply slightly prefers keeping just Z.  I considered this, but liked keeping the R to reduce the chances of completely horrible draws

#note D12 IRIS keeps the board closed, while holding two key eses.  But against Wayne, I don't mind blowing the board open while the game is still pretty early.

>E_Tran: AAGINST 9C GA. +17 137
#note Simming best.  14E SAG is 2 more pts, but should lead to much bigger scores by Wayne
>Wayne_C: DIOT K11 DOIT +25 198
>E_Tran: AIJNOST L8 JOIST +50 187
#note The best fish would be i14 JO, but JOIST is 30 more.  Gotta go for it.  Also considered L9 JIAO or JA(TO)S, but there are not enough strong bingo lines.

>E_Tran: AEEETVX M12 EVE +16 268
#note EAVE in the same spot is favored by a bit by duck.   I'm not sure why.  I figure with EVE, if I get an I or U, I can cash my X.  Not sure why Quack likes EAVE.
