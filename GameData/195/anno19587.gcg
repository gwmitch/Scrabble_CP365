#note Matt was shuffling his rack a lot, so I wanted to play something defensive.  This kills 11 and F.

#note I didn't want to blow open the board with HAH e5 just yet.  This scores, and prevents Matt from scoring too well.

>E_Tran: EFIILST 8A FLE. +42 337
#note Matt is low on time.  My plan is to score with this, and hope he goes over time and makes enough mistakes in the endgame for me to win.  I can also fish with 4H FIL, or score and open lines with c5 LIFE.

#note worth a shot, as I likely don't need spread.  Maybe FISSURED stays open.  Playing short also ensures Matt goes over time, increasing my win%
