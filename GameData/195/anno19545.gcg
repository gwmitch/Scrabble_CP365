#note I just missed KINGED, and this isn't as defensive as I may think it is because of PECS, albeit still acceptable.

#note 8L NUN sims better but I can't imagine anybody actually doing that over the board in this position.

#note I missed the NOILIER hook, but maybe counterintuitively this is actually better since it leaves very few lines for 8s and shuts down this quadration unless he hits a bingo in column A.  However he actually did that.  Having said that, this still sims better than ELASTIN/NOILIER, which surprises me.

#note I think this was my rack but the exchanged letters were smudged on my scoresheet so it might not have been.  Keeping the A is probably a mistake given how many As are remaining, but keeping the I is definitely not since there's only one left.  I really should have considered A14 AI/AT for defense though.  I think that's the play, especially since he hit that spot for 50 on the next turn.  Not calling it a major error though.
>Stephen_Sneed: AHSY 15A ASHY +50 247
>Sean_Wrona: ?AEGIOT 4A .AvIGOTE +68 325
#note I was so proud of finding a high-prob semi-uncommon word that I missed the higher-scoring, more obvious spot with three much more common word bingos.  Major board vision error.
>Stephen_Sneed: OO N7 O.O +15 262
>Sean_Wrona: IMNUVVW H1 WIV. +30 355
#note Wow, that was stupid.  Ws are obviously much better on mostly closed boards than Vs are.  Still just a minor error but I should know better than that.

#note Did I remotely think it was a word?  No.  Did I think I could afford to challenge?  Also no.  Still a major word knowledge error.  Having said that, I was a lot more conservative in this tournament than I often have, letting him get away with UNEXCITE* and Mark Garrod get away with GREWS* just to secure the wins.  I was trying to intentionally avoid choking, which I guses is what you're supposed to do, as much as I did want to challenge it.  This one's still major though, since it possibly did give him a chance to come back.
>Sean_Wrona: ADNOUV 5D DON +30 447
#note Missed DONA, but I do *not* want to be V-stuck, so I definitely prefer this.

#note Well, at least I wasn't fooled twice.
>Sean_Wrona: A 1G A. +5 464
#note Major errors (2): RAVIGOTE (board vision), UNEXCITE (failed to make necessary challenge, but did still win)

Still much better than most of my games at Nationals.
