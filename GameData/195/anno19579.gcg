>Dick_Popper: DFJRS E6 FJ.RDS +34 34
>Sam_Masling: EILRSTT 6E .LITTERS +65 95
#note (S)LITTERS is one more.
>Dick_Popper: LOYZ I3 ZLO.Y +31 65
>Sam_Masling: ?EGHLOV 4H G.OVE +22 117
#note I forgot HOVEL was a word so L1 is best here.  Although I do like H's better than G's on this board so far.
>Dick_Popper: ADIW M2 WADI +27 92
>Sam_Masling: ??EHILV H8 .EVILisH +92 209
#note (D)IsHEVeL to not give him an S lane
>Dick_Popper: FLNO 2J FLO.N +38 130
>Sam_Masling: AENOPRU 1G PURE +23 232
#note Plenty of better plays equity-wise but besides PAREO which I didn't know I like this best because it takes out the most volatile line and doesn't give him a vowel to bingo under like APO and UPO would.  And no Quackle, I'm not playing 10H (V)APOUR.
>Dick_Popper: AAW 2E AWA +18 148
>Sam_Masling: AEIINOR F10 OI +11 243
#note Richard telegraphs his plays a lot, and right after he played AWA he looked pretty pissed with his draw, and so I felt justified playing this off, with the lack of any great blocking plays.  I also bingo 49% of the time next turn.
>Dick_Popper: AQT 3C QAT +26 174
#note I assume he drew the Q here.
>Sam_Masling: ACEIMNR 14A CARMINE. +76 319
#note It was that kind of game.
>Dick_Popper: KMO A12 MO.K +45 219
>Sam_Masling: ACEINOR L6 .CENARIO +72 391
#note ...and I draw into SCENARIO.  (V)E(R)ONICA 2x2 is sweet.
>Dick_Popper: Y D3 .Y +10 229
>Sam_Masling: ABEERTU 1A BRUTE +27 418
#note Somehow I scored this as 30.
>Dick_Popper: AEGINST A1 .EATINGS +86 315
#note Whoops
>Sam_Masling: AEINOST 15H .O +5 423
#note This is the last line that he could bingo with that would score enough to put him back in the game.
>Dick_Popper: UX M13 XU +36 351
>Sam_Masling: ABEINST J9 BASINET +69 492
#note Yeah....
>Dick_Popper: AEEGINU 8K G.NUA +18 369
