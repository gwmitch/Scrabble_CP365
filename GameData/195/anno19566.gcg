>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEGIT H8 GEE +8 8
#note I think this game was the beginning of my NSC inner breakdown, when I finally realized how terribly I was playing.

Interesting decision between this GEE and the standard H7 GEE, and a ton of other options. Decided to be aggressive?


>Tom_Bond: AQT 7G QAT +28 28
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEFIIT 6I IF +15 23
#note I missed FI(G) for 3 more, felt like I needed to open lanes cause I had nothing better to do. I missed 8F DI(G)IT. Those are better plays. Way too aggressive already.
>Tom_Bond: CEHORY 5G OCHERY +39 67
#note I pay
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEILRT L1 DIRT. +22 45
#note L4 L(Y)DDITE looks right

>Joshua_Sokol: ADELLNU --  -70 45
#note thought I could get this by. I didn't see or know 2G UNALL(I)ED but I would have tried it for sure. Whoohoo...
>Tom_Bond: GUU 3J GU.U +10 110
>Joshua_Sokol: ADELLNU 10G L.U +3 48
#note H1 ADUN(C). Why am I playing for 3 points with a pretty bad bingo %? I missed ADUNC obviously but I shouldn't even think about making this play especially when my opponent knows exactly what I am attempting to do.
>Tom_Bond: ?EENSSU 8H .ENiUSES +84 194
>Tom_Bond: ?EENSSU --  -84 110
>Joshua_Sokol: AABDELN O1 .ANDLE +12 60
#note I was about to play WANDABLE when I decided that someone who would attempt HITE might challenge WANDLE given that WANDLES* would be a bingo they would have studied. How else would someone who doesn't know all of their 4s become rated as high as 1600 without some basic high prob bingo knowledge? Turns out Tom knew WANDLE. Swing and a miss... He was going to hit a bingo or play another phony regardless but if he doesn't challenge this play this is terrible.

#note Maybe B2 ZI(N)EB instead, but I like this better.
>Tom_Bond: IKM B2 MI.K +32 208
#note scratch that, ZINEB.

>Joshua_Sokol: AGIILNS C4 .AILINGS +67 206
#note Given the inference this is a better play than NILGAIS at N6
>Tom_Bond: ELTVY 8A VE.L +24 232
>Joshua_Sokol: AEJMNRV F2 JE. +26 232
#note 1) hoping he has no a or 2) hoping he misses AJEE. I know he has TY so it makes it more likely he has no A and/or can't do anything about AJEE, but I should play N6 MAVEN I guess even though he's likely to have TI(V)Y. Maybe I should play 6A VE(I)N even, but I don't see what that accomplishes, although AJMR isn't that bad. Meh. Dunno.
>Tom_Bond: AOSTTWY 2N Y. +20 252
>Joshua_Sokol: AIMNORV 1E MAVIN +41 273
#note Given the prevalence of O's in the pool I should probably play AVION instead of MAVIN, but maybe not.
>Tom_Bond: ?EIRSTT E8 SITTERs +70 322
#note seriously though? Small error on his part, at least, for not playing TeSTIER
>Joshua_Sokol: BEOOORW N6 WOOER +31 304
#note For this turn, I had a very interesting decision to make. I could play N6 WOO and hope tom doesn't have an F or a P, or play WOOER in the same spot, and hope Tom can't score a bunch and that I could either outscore or bingo. I guess for bingoing purposes WOO may be better but if Tom has the F I'm basically a goner. I misised 13B BOR(R)OW which seems like a great counteroption. All in all I think I made the right play since I am confident that I can still win this game if Tom doesn't have something really bad for me.
>Tom_Bond: FOP 8L PO.F +36 358
#note but alas, here is one of the worst things that could have happened.
>Joshua_Sokol: AABCNNO 13C CA.BON +22 326
#note I was starting to lose my sanity here, but I knew it was between B(E)ACON and CA(R)BON at 12D and 13C respectively. I felt like I was more likely to bingo if I could both overlap and underlap CARBON vs. only underlapping BEACON, and also that it was hard to block bingos after CARBON and easier after BEACON.
>Tom_Bond: DIR D12 R.ID +19 377
#note ?? I don't understand this play
>Joshua_Sokol: AANOOPR 13C ......ARA +14 340
#note I finally just gave up

#note -2
>Tom_Bond:  (N) +2 404
#note After the game Tom confirmed my thought about him knowing bingos but not shorter words as well, by saying that he knew UNDERALL* was invalid but was shaky on his 4s. When I asked him about WANDLE he said he knew it and that there was no reason to challenge a 12-point play.
