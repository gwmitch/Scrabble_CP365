#note Once again, as with RAVIGOTE against Sneed, I was excited about finding 8s I just recently studied or something and didn't look for more common words that scored much more than this.  Ghastly board vision error.  I believe now you can understand why I usually only get about 80% on the 'short common words' test on Aerolith, which is barely better than I usually do on the 7s and 8s which include the uncmmon words as well.

Misscored as 61.

#note Hmm, I didn't look at QIS (at least I don't remember doing so) but that's got to be better.

#note If I'd thought of REBOOK, I wouldn't have played this.  I'd have maybe just played BOOK since she might not realize EBOOK has been added.

#note She obviously didn't think of REBOOK at this point of the game, but did so later.
>Sean_Wrona: AENNOTU 1G TAU.N +15 193
#note Well, I instantly saw TONNEAU before anagramming it this time.  I didn't see the spot though until I ran the kibitzer.  So obvious no less.  Grrr, my board vision flaws disgust me.  Massive error.

#note So lazy and this is a terrible thing to fish with (expecially with 5 Rs left).  I needed to look harder.  Major error.

#note This is not bad luck.
>Sean_Wrona: EEFILRR N6 FE +28 304
#note I missed RELIEF, but while that's not very safe, neither is this.  I'm gonna call this a word knowledge error because FERREL/FERLIE are the plays and I don't know those.

#note The sim says I'm supposed to dump the E s well and I guess that's correct.  It's not worth the 7 points I'm forfeiting here especially since I could draw another.

#note Have mercy on my atrocious play-finding ability.

Major errors (5): GASLIGHT (board vision), TAUON (rack vision), OBE (strategy), FE (strategy), EMIC (rack vision error)

I was clearly really lucky to miss everything I missed in this game.  Wouldn't "Ghastly Tonneau Mercies" make a great book title?
