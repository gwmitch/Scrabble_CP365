#note Another example of me overthinking the early turns. Trying really hard to not miss bingos, but at what cost? Nothing here anyways. I thought about dumping an I too because of the strong leave, but I always draw a Q or a J or the same letter I just dumped. Oh except J would make JASMINE haha. N5 AMI sims best but it seemed way too easy for him to score big. I thougt MI was a compromise between scoring and fishing.

#note Wes chuckles and tells me it's going to be a blowout. I'm at ~96.5% to win after my fifth turn.

#note sNOUTED doesn't open up the dangerous TWS. I flip-flopped between this spot and DUoTONE at 14D. I didn't find TONgUED and forgot DEmOUNT was a word.
>Wesley_Yocom: BEILRRU 14D BURLIER +67 241
#note So DUoTONE wouldn't have stopped this but the other bingos would have.

#note For some reason it took me so long to find this, and yet I'm not sure what I'm aiming for. I might get a bingo through the H if it stays open, but that doesn't look incredibly likely. I should just play N6 YA.
>Wesley_Yocom: DIU 7D DUI +8 282
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEISTX N6 XI +52 463
#note Silly error, take the other spot.
>Wesley_Yocom: IKLT 6F KILT +34 316
#note So this doesn't happen.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEINST 12G S.EITANs +70 533
#note I thought CODA didn't take an S so I just played it safe. This has got to be the first time I've gotten 8 bingos in two games back-to-back.
>Wesley_Yocom: AGINRRU M10 .U.ING +14 330
>Matthew_Larocque: W 9N W. +10 543
#note For reasons I cannot explain, I never added this play to my score.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ARR) +6 549
#note Then I lost 20 more on time, so I scored 519 instead of 549. I feel like I'm doing myself a great disservice when I basically handicap my score every game. Also he had 333.
