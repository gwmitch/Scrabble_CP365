#note I should probably play PENOCHE against this opponent, who generally prefers closed boards.
>Roy: ABRT 6C BRAT +19 41
>Mike: AEEEINN -AEEIN +0 29
#note No need to panic here; CANINE is plenty good enough.

#note FOPS J4 is the play here.
>Roy: IJLT 4A JILT +44 137
>Mike: DIOSSVY B2 VO.D +19 120
#note Pretty much have to block; I can't afford him getting 40+ more for the J.
>Roy: ?ADEELX B7 rELAXED +67 204
#note Roy wondered after the game if he wasn't supposed to bingo here. Turns out he's not; LAX 1A wins a few percentage points more.

>Roy: AGILNNO N4 LOANING +67 374
#note I'll admit to having a bit of a 'what on earth just happened?' reaction to this play (especially given the previous one; Roy said he was keeping the NG for VAUNTING and drew into this). Until I saw my rack, that is.
>Mike: ?AGLNRR 14D .NLARGeR +60 393
#note Quackle doesn't want me to bingo here, suggesting BRR 3E as the sim winner. Quackle can go jump in a lake.
>Roy: AEIKMOU H12 KO.E +39 413
#note Find the win. (This isn't it.)
