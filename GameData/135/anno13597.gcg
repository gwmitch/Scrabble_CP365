#note MARVY! Don't see that one very much.
>Emil_Rem: EFH 7E FEH +31 31
>Matthew_Larocque: CELNNVY E7 ..NCY +26 56
#note Or N(ER)VY.
>Emil_Rem: INO 10D I.ON +8 39
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEJLNV 9H AJEE +24 80
#note I suddenly take note of IN(FANCY) and then make this seemingly awful play to try and draw an I.
>Emil_Rem: ?IINRST K3 NITRIt.S +64 103
#note He missed some double doubles here.
>Matthew_Larocque: KLLMNTV 4J M.LK +20 100
#note That didn't work, at all.
>Emil_Rem: HO 10I OH. +36 139
>Matthew_Larocque: BLNSTVX -BLTV +0 100
#note Still not working. Might as well keep the X, it's useful.
>Emil_Rem: AIT M3 I.AT +16 155
>Matthew_Larocque: LNOPRSX 6F POL +30 130
#note Choosing to keep the X again in case he gives me something.
>Emil_Rem: EORT 8K .ORTE +15 170
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANRSXZ 5E ZA +28 158
#note Close between playing off the X or the Z.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?LNRSUX N8 .UX +26 184
>Emil_Rem: EGINPST O5 STE.PING +76 261
#note As if...and the pressure's still on.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?LNRSTU 12H RUSTLiN. +68 252
#note Thankfully this plays because the lack of vowels was starting to get worrisome. I entertained the S hook on STEEPING but it's no good.
>Emil_Rem: DEER H11 E.RED +18 279
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGOOWW 3G WAGO. +19 271
#note Forgot GOWA(N). Kinda just crossing my fingers here.
>Emil_Rem: ABORU 13C ARBOU. +18 297

#note Well then.
>Emil_Rem: AD 14E AD +18 315
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEOTVW 15A COVET +38 357
#note Emil bails me out here.
>Emil_Rem: AE 12C AE +10 325
#note Ruh roh.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEILVW B10 VAW +23 380
#note Didn't look like there was any bingos in the bag to my relief - but now that I investigate, there was one possibility - ISOGENI(C). Sim says play W(O) or VIEW in place of VAW. *shrugs* ok sure.
>Emil_Rem: GIIINOS 15H .OING +9 334
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIL 7I LE. +9 389
#note Play (N)IDE first.
>Emil_Rem: IIS 1H .I +11 345
#note Emil must think I cannot go out.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEI N12 .IDE +10 399
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IS) +4 403
#note I kind of stole that one - If Emil blocks QU(A)D the game would have been way different.
