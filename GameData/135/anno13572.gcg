#note I SAW THAT. nooo. he accidentally turned over a blank. should i use that knowledge somehow?

#note it took me about 10 minutes to figure out where i'd played FIT. that's how bad this play was. something like LATEENS seems scary, and i gotta protect against worst case scenarios, right? emptying the bag with FLINT would just lose if he had one of several bingos. FONT may be ok too. (-17)

#note i didn't see EVEN until after i played TWA, so WENT is better at 9I. (-1)
>stu: ENV 9I N.VE +8 418
#note he missed it too. somehow i had him at 418 points after TELS after a horrid adding mistake on my part so if he had found EVEN it would have been a "tie". i wonder if i would have recounted it. probably, i wanted to win the tourneyyy. also i don't like ties. my lone tournament tie is a blemish on my record.
