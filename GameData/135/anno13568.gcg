#note these are the hardestof all positions for me, i think. i'm never quite sure whether to go for points, leave, what a good position would be, when to exchange, etc. i usually end up going for pts, but it seems like i rarely recover and will probably fight through crap for the rest of the game.... so this sims a point ahead of -IIW and two points ahead of WILIER, but who knows?

#note again, what to go for? keep ER and score 0? why not take 28 pts then? do i play OYER and keep it a bit more controlled? AII is to ugly though. YO sims best again, but i'm not getting out of this.

#note i am seriously going to vomit here. i asked JD if i should exchange and he laughed. sooo... should i exchange? isn't 33 pts enough? i think this is the first time i've ever purposely kept this bad of a leave. my play only sims (-1) less than -GUUUW.

#note that was gonna go down anyway and i'm more screwed now.

#note well this is more obvious. maybe i'll draw the other U and get SUCCUBUS for 101.

#note this time i seem to have been way off; i let myself be misled by the Z, but ZETA is much better than this. if i had just looked at the scores a little closer; STUU and being 36 pts down is not that bad. (-10)

#note i suppose 10L JAW maximizes my luck factor here, or something; B6 JOT also looks better than JATO. (-3.5)
