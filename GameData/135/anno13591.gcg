#note Maybe she won't be sure about the word and thus the hooks.

>Matthew_Larocque: CEEIORY 3C IRO.Y +24 177
#note The R hook is phony on A(D)JUDGE but nothing is worth trying there anyways. Sim prefers dumping OY but I wanted turnover to draw a hook for A(D)JUDGE.
>Noella_Ward: AEIILOR 5C LOA.IER +18 87
#note She played AIOLI first, I think at K11? but *IG, either way she took it back. With this rack she's probably better to dump OI.

>Matthew_Larocque: ACDEOTU K4 COUD. +23 233
#note Ok, I know I looked for an OUT bingo. It can't be that hard to anagram ACDET into ACTED? DOUCE is a word too.
>Noella_Ward: ?ILMNRS H8 .ReMLINS +83 211
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AELSTU 6M .U +4 237
#note I'm so low on time already it's not funny. I see SALUTEd and SALUTEs, but blank on playing SALUTEr to the open S. Really. There's all kinds of alternate choices but I'm in such a panic that I can't find ANYTHING. So I dump the U with about 2 minutes left on my clock.

#note Gets the job done, but the best play is (W)ASTAbLE which I didn't even know.

>Matthew_Larocque: AIILRTT 14J TIR. +24 335
#note It didn't seem like she would challenge, and this scores better than anything else.

#note FAR(C)I(E)! I didn't know that spelling.
>Noella_Ward: APSZ O12 SPAZ +54 352
#note This is weird. I glanced at her play and didn't even notice *GOTS. The fact that she scored 54 points makes this kind of inexcusable. I need better time managment.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFIOORT J10 FOR +35 397
#note FAR(C)I(E) still available.

>Noella_Ward:  (IO) +4 388
#note Surprisingly I only lost 10 points after OT, but this game shouldn't have been close in the first place - missing all those bingos without enough time and then GOTS*..... could have been a real disaster.
