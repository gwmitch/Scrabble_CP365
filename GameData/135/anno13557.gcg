#note exchange 7 seemed bad, but somehow I missed YOGH for 33 instead of this! awful!!!
>Peter_Armstrong: ALOR 1A RO.AL +27 256
#note not only that but peter said he probably would've exchanged if I hadn't given him this play - doubly bad

#note it is impressive how bad this play is. FOHN at 13A wins a sim by 13 points, keeping a much more useful ARY leave, bingoing more and not giving cheap points up. Yuck!

>JD: EIINPQV I3 Q. +21 317
#note I was really hoping to find a play that would hold the Q going for QIS at 10B next turn. But exchanging keeping EN is given much more of a chance of helping me here - I could hit a bingo on column J or N. Either way exchanging does seem best since I'm unlikely to score much the rest of the way with these tiles.

#note I need to block PEASEN (although he didn't know it) and blocking SNEAP is a bonus - so JIVES is the play setting up an out
