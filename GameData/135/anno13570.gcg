#note UVEA is a better play. i was aware here that this was going to sim uglily but i am always too nervous for tournaments. PEEVE is also better than VEEP. (-5.5)

#note A1 SINNER is simming best. i like it even though it's giving him a small shot at something big. if i can't block A12 effectively might as well try to score. i really wanted to play it but couldn't bring myself to. also don't want to draw three Us or something. this is a hard move. i chose INN because it's a bit tighter and i keep the S but honestly i can't figure out what's right here.
