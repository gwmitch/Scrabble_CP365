>New_Player_1: AEOR H5 AERO +8 8
>New_Player_2: EGHIPTX I6 HEX +31 31
#note EXPAT sims first, a bit better than HEX.
>New_Player_1: GOO J7 GOO +18 26
>New_Player_2: GINPQST 10H GIP +25 56
#note I really had the urge to play defensively here. PING is much better though, since GIP doesn't actually block every possible lane.
>New_Player_1: GIR H10 .RIG +7 33
>New_Player_2: DLNOQST 12G Q. +11 67
>New_Player_1: EFLOR 13H .OLFER +22 55
>New_Player_2: DDLNOST L8 TODDL. +18 85
#note I should be in control after TODDLE. He just played 5 tiles on a closed board.
>New_Player_1: EE 12J EE. +10 65
>New_Player_2: BNPRSTW -BNPW +0 85
>New_Player_1: AEJN M7 JANE +28 93
#note I was hoping he still hadn't drawn a bingo here. JANE makes me even more confident that I'm in control.
>New_Player_2: AEFNRST 14I EFT +36 121
#note Totally missed FEAST. Wow. Championship player still likes (EL)F, even though there are three S's in the bag. EFT is next on the list. This was a difficult move to make, but I definitely like FEAST a lot now that I see it.
>New_Player_1: LUUV 5D UVUL. +16 109
#note Lovely.
>New_Player_2: ACNNRSV N10 VAC +31 152
#note I really like VAC here since it opens up another lane and scores well. I need to keep my S. VAN opens things up a bit too much in my opinion.
>New_Player_1: EINZ 4A ZEIN +50 159
#note This complicates things.
>New_Player_2: ADNNRST B2 TR.ND +20 172
>New_Player_1: EEIMRST O4 METIERS +94 253
>New_Player_2: AEENSSW -  +0 172
#note Here's where things go sour. I was pretty sure of METIERS, but I hated DEVS. Really bad challenge.
>New_Player_1: IRT 4L TRI. +12 265
#note Neither of us came close to seeing GRIGRI.
>New_Player_2: AEENSSW A1 WE +17 189
#note Didn't see WAENESS. Really bad.
>New_Player_1: AHSY 15F HAYS +33 298
>New_Player_2: AENOOSS A4 .OONS +47 236
#note I chose ZOONS over ZOEAS because I had the last E.
>New_Player_1: AK F4 A.K +17 315
>New_Player_2: ?AAENSW C6 AW +13 249
#note Didn't know SEAWANS or SEAWANT but I had no excuse to miss AWAKENS. I can't close the board though.
>New_Player_1: AIILM 14B MILIA +25 340
>New_Player_2: ?ABENNS 15A BAN +21 270
#note Keeping the possibility of bingoing on lane D alive.
>New_Player_1: AY 13B AY +27 367
>New_Player_2: ?BDEINS 3H BaNDIES +76 346
>New_Player_1: ?CIOTUU 15K sCOUT +33 400
>New_Player_2: P N2 P.. +10 356
#note I did well in the beginning, and messed up later. I need to work on that.
>New_Player_2:  (IU) +4 360
