#note GENERA is best here I guess, A5. I was setting myself up with AR, though I knew AEEGR was a better leave if I played AN. I also knew that I'd have GENE there next turn at least.
>New_Player_1: CM E3 M.C +18 160
>New_Player_2: ABEEGIN 4L GENE +45 248
#note At this point I feel like I have the game more or less under control, as long as I keep drawing fairly well. GEE was of course too dangerous.

>New_Player_2: AABEEII C10 .AIA +8 256
#note I like raia since it doesn't open anything big like tibiae would, and it also blocks two lanes for him. In hindsight exchanging is better.
>New_Player_1: ?EILMRS O3 M.aSLIER +77 255
#note It was bound to happen. I still should have the advantage here, only I didn't exchange last turn, and the other blank is still out there.
>New_Player_2: BEEINTV B5 VIBE +16 272
#note I was really thinking about mob or invitee here, but I chose to go with VIBE since it was a good leave, blocked another lane, and MOB wouldn't have guaranteed a thing really.
>New_Player_1: FIX C6 FIX +37 292
#note He needs to score here, which he does. Now I'm losing a bit of ground. Let's see what I draw.
>New_Player_2: DELLNNT 12A .L.NT +10 282
#note Horrible draw. I don't want it to happen again, so I play three consonants instead of two.
>New_Player_1: NP G3 P.N +20 312
>New_Player_2: DEELNTV N10 ELVEN +24 306
#note I'm screwed at this point. I need to get a lucky draw. I play a phoney since he probably won't challenge and try to add an s maybe. I needed to get lucky with EVENT I guess.
>New_Player_1: ?ADQSUU K7 SQUAD +41 353
#note Fortunately, emptying the bag here wasn't a fatal error.
