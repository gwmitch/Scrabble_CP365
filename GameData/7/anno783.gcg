>Cesar: BENOOSU J10 BOO +25 306
#note at this point i have about 5 minutes on my clock, and since i'm a slow player, i could not see all the possibilities and did not want to spend so long on this rack. i was also worried about QI. i'm absolutely certain i would have found BOUND/BOUNDS 5C with just a few more minutes, but my heart was racing. top players are cool as steel. -8 (thats it??)
