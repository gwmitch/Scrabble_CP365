>Carl: AEIORWZ 8D ZOWIE +54 54
>Bing: DEGHLOY 7G HOY +28 28
#note Missed YODH (9E,33).
>Carl: ADEIRRT F6 TA.DRIER +76 130
#note Carl played too fast, overlooking the 2x2 ADROITER.
>Bing: DEEGLNO D6 LO.ENGE +34 62
#note My worst miss in recent memory. I looked at the I and could only think of LEGIONED*.
>Carl: ABEEGOS 6I OBE +16 146
#note Lots of possibilities, but BAGGIE (11B,20) seems to be the best.
>Bing: ADKQTTT 5G QAT +18 80
>Carl: AAEGNOS E4 GOA +11 157
#note Another interesting position. AGO (E4) scores 1 more point and sets up the N. I sort of like OSAR (13C) - the GANE combination has good synergy and there are still 3 more S's to draw.
>Bing: DDKRTTX K5 K.X +28 108
#note These racks must have been punishment for missing ELOIGNED. TEXT would have been a slight improvement.
>Carl: AENNNST 11F .NN +3 160
#note Or NENE (12C) for the extra point.
>Bing: DDEMRTT H1 DERM. +33 141
>Carl: AEEHNST 1A HASTENE. +89 249
>Bing: DIMORTT 2E MOT.T +19 160
#note Several plays sim fairly close: MOTET, DOIT (2B), or INTORT (H10). The I-heavy tile pool should have swayed me toward one of the other choices.
>Carl: AADEUUY H10 U.AU +5 254
#note Interesting...this 5 point dump to a non-bingoish leave sims best. I guess its strength lies in preserving scoring options for the next turn, such as DAY (L4) or AY (2A). Nice judgment!
>Bing: ADIIORU L1 OIDIA +20 180
>Carl: AADEFIY C3 EDIFY +48 302
>Bing: ?FIPRSU C12 PFUI +22 202
#note Pretty much forced, given the deficit.
>Carl: AABLLRV 15A VA.L +24 326
>Bing: ?ACILRS 14H SCALIeR +75 277
#note Better than uRACILS (L7), since I wanted to leave the board as open as possible.
>Carl: ABEJLRR 13M RAJ +24 350
#note Tough call. While RAJ looks fine to me, sim shows JEER (M12) has the highest win %, and it probably is a good idea to block the M5 bingo spot.
>Bing: ?CGINSW M5 SCoWING +70 347
#note The bingo I'd been hoping for, but it still gave me almost no chance to win. Could something like GOWNS (1K) be best?
>Carl: BEELRSU 8L E.E +7 357
#note A nifty setup, threating BLURS or BURSAL (J10). BOULE (1K) actually comes out a few points better.
>Bing: EINOPTV 9J PIN.TE +12 359
#note Wishing now I hadn't played MOTET earlier...I could bingo out with PROVIDENT!
>Carl: BLRSU O8 R.BS +39 396
#note Carl said he was 95% sure of BURSE, but he wasn't about to risk a game over 3 spread points.
>Bing: OV B1 .VO +14 373
>Bing:  (LU) +4 377
