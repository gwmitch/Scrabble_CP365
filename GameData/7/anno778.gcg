#note Highly questionable move (but it worked well this time).

>Bing: DEHNOPT 6A HEPT.D +31 287
#note OPHITE (A1,33) was a possibility, but HEPTAD had the advantage of taking out the X spot at 6F.

>Bing: ?AINOPR 4G PA +14 301
#note The only bingo was the pathetic PROTAmIN for 59...I don't think it was wrong to pass this up, but BOAR (1L) would have been a better play.

>Rusty: ASTV 12A VAST +36 335
>Bing: DIMORRU N5 OM +22 406
#note I should have just played ODIUM (N5) and emptied the bag, but I was seduced by the chance of drawing EH for HURRIED (13D).
>Rusty: EY 7J YE +23 358
>Bing: DEIRRUU J10 I.URE +9 415
#note This set up my D and a possible outplay, but by failing to consider the worst-case scenario, I actually set myself up to lose!
>Rusty: AEEHNOX 14J .H +5 363
#note Just brilliant (dammit!)
>Bing: DRUV 15H URD +19 434
#note Now I knew I was in trouble: since I had to block AXONE, I would be stuck with the V. Luckily for me, Rusty was very low on time, so I made my play quickly and hoped he wouldn't find the best sequence.
