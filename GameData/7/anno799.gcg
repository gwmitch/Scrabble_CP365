#note top plays are exchanges.  chickened out on MERK.  but with what I drew out of the bag, drawing to QE? wouldn't be that much better than to QR?
>Inborn_Veil: IOP 9D POI +9 9
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: ?HNQRRT -HRNQ +0 20
#note yep, this is a time to exchange.  interesting:  the top leaves are HR?, HRT?, and R?.  I never thought of keeping the H.  R? seems okay, but I'd keep the T as well in case I get hit with a bunch of vowels.

#note better:  15F WAIL 38.  was trying to get the W in there but nothing would fit.
>Inborn_Veil: ILSUUXY 10F XU +54 281
#note yipes, i totally missed that X spot.
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: AAGLNUW 13I WAUL +25 346
#note i'm surprised that this is the top play.  it's super risky with the S still out, but it puts me a bingo ahead.  but if she bingos on that line next turn, i'm in trouble.

>Edward_S._De_Guzman: AEGLNP 12K PANEL +25 371
#note wish i knew what my 7th tile was.  my guess is that she has the S.  i want to make it difficult to use column N but I don't want to give her another S hook.  So I hang a letter in the triple lane and make her play an 8 to win.
>Inborn_Veil: EGIIRST M9 GRI.S +32 344
#note whew!  she didn't have anything
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: ABEFGH O11 G.EBA +24 395
>Inborn_Veil: EIT -  +0 344
#note she was unsure and it was the only way she could win so she challenged.
