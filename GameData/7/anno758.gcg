#note I remember spending forever on this rack.  Again, no clue what to do.  I was tired of being in this situation over and over that day.  I could feel that making the wrong play at this point in the game would be costly.  I was feeling tired and my brain was beginning to shut down.  Best play is 14B MESON 28.  It seems like I'm playing for the bingo too often and keeping my S for longer than I should.

>Edward_S._De_Guzman: AAHNSUY N12 HAY +23 264
#note why this and not L12 YUAN 26 (top play)?  This essentially kills two bingo lines when i could have kept one open.  did i really think i could block up the board and win the scoring race?  not sure where my brain is at this point.
