#note  I labored over this one for a while, but went with HAW over WHIM cause I liked the [IMU?] over [AU?].  Don't really know why.

#note  I missed the d(OS)IMETER and M(ET)EoRITE.  There were some hihgher scoring bingoes hooking an S to ZAP, but I took this spot becuase it was a much easier line to score on.

#note  I liked this over ENAC(T) for 30, because it kept things pretty closed being up ~100.

#note  *  I held it, but I thought PERVE* might have been an alternative form of PARVE. Plus I was holding the X.  That was the tipping point for letting it go through instead of risking a challenge.
