#note Okay, Quackle's saying I should have kept a T instead of the N, and I think I get why.  It's because I had two so the odds of me drawing another one would be much less.  Still, every exchange leaving any 2-4 tile subset of NRST has to be really close.

#note I didn't know RECROSS.  I don't know how I missed CORS/ORCS/ROCS, which are the obvious plays and don't instantly telegraph that I have another S.  I was way too concerned with avoiding duplication here and not enough with scoring.

#note Talk about not going through all my options.  I could have played the exact tiles at 14G for 13 points and blocked three different bingo lines.  That's clearly the play, but I didn't consider it or look for it.  Sigh...  I don't think I'd have thought of FOZIER even though I know FOZY and FOZIEST, and I don't know why, but that ALSO blocks 3 bingo lines and scores more, and it doesn't open a fairly dangerous line like FRIZ does...  FRITZ isn't a horrible play in itself, just compared to the other options...  But what other options!

#note SODA's cool but not the sort of play I would normally find.  TONNAGE does what I'm trying to do here better obviously...

#note I didn't know OXALIS and I definitely didn't want to block a couple bingo lines with an M2 play, but come to think of it I'm blocking a lot more bingo possibilities by partially blocking row 14 probably for fewer points, so this is a mistake...  I'm going to bingo on my next turn regardless unless I BADLY screw this up.  And given how the Ben and Teresa games went, that's certainly possible.

#note Wow, I missed QUA, and what's worse is I wanted to make sure after playing this that I still certainly had a place to play my Q, so given that, I totally should have taken the next step and found QUA.
