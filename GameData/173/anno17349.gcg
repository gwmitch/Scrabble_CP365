#note I spent a lot of time debating what leave to keep, or if COQUET was a good use of the blank.  CEENT? bingoes with a lot of letters - I forget why I didn't like it.  It sims best.  Keeping EENT? turned out to be pretty bad.

#note I think this is a good time to phoney.  I know he hasn't study that many 8s, and there is a higher reward for the risk.

>E_Tran: AEOORSX 12G AX +38 184
#note AX or AXE?  valuations are close, but EOORS bingos about 9% more.  The upside is much huger than the downside of slightly more unbalanced racks.

#note keeping E looks good, for the VAGINAE AXE spot.  also debating keeping an I for Q insurance, but QI wouldn't play anywhere anyway.  Sim likes WAI(L).  This is also a spot where keeping a highpointer like W could work, but i thought it'd be difficult to score well with it.

>E_Tran: EEIKMPS 9M MI. +18 331
#note Tempted to phony with KEMPIE.  I have the case E's, which is good, and can score with (N)EE.  I want to block the Q spot, since Q'sticking is a legit winning strategy.  MEL, NEE, and MIL all sim very close.

>E_Tran: EEIKNPS I11 .E +12 343
#note Tempted to phoney with SKEINE, but even after that, I don't think I can win.  With 2 in the bag, I considered (N)EE to score and fish for PINKIE.  But I also double my chances of getting the Q.  Since its so many more pts, I think (N)EE might still be right here.  Either way, I need to hope he can't hit SQUIRE or SQUARE this turn, and I hit PINKIE next turn.
