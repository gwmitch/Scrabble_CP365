#note Quackle has its stupid impulses, such as arguing for ROVEN 14H or VENT M7 when this would seem to be clearly better than either of those considering giving up the column H scoring spot and/or the EVENT hook when I don't have an E in my leave.  I firmly believe this is the best play, even seeing all the other options now.

#note I just played this backwards.  I played SEX on this turn, AWEE on the next turn instead of vice versa.  AWEE is certainly better since it gives me two different X spots and it would be hard to block both.  Thinking of that would have been a much cooler play and it is obviously superior, but I still think this hardly counts as a miss.

#note Cool, I can still play AWEE!  And this time it's a lot safer since unless Matthew has a bingo ending in E, I, or O there isn't much he can do here.  If I'd played AWEE on the previous turn, I'd obviously have to worry about row 3 bingos.  It blocks very little.

#note I don't remember what my exact rack was, but it was probably this.  I had reasons to be concerned about row 2 bingos ending in e and row 1 bingos, but I didn't really have anything worth doing to block bingos on the triple.  I mean what, ET N1?  He could still bingo on row 2 and he could still have a nine.  And I'm not even sure I had the E.  The OORTUY is what I'm more certain about.  I got burned here, but I still think it's okay.  Having said that, OUTED and YOD are still simming the best so I underestimated how much more significant that threat was.  Probably my most major error in this game, but it's still not THAT major.  Killed my spread for this game though.

#note Yikes, what monster play am I missing?  Apparently UREDO, DUO, and UDO on row 1 always win but this only wins 80% of the time?  I realize this play was uninspired but I'm failing to see what makes it a major error, as I'm failing to see how I lose after almost ANY play here.
