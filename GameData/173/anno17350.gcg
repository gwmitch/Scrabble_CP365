#note Nice phony by Matt.  I held for a long time, but reasoned it had to be good.
>E_Tran: ?ENPQST I5 Q. +11 23
#note Which QI?  This gave back the least; given my blank, I'm not too worried about opening up the board yet.
>Matt_L: AANO 5B ANOA +14 98
>E_Tran: ?EENPST 11F SErPENT +74 97
>E_Tran: ?EENPST --  -74 23
#note Stupid stupid stupid.  I thought there was a chance this might be bad; should just play it safe with a bingo at B1.
>Matt_L: CO 10F .OC +7 105
>E_Tran: ?EENPST B1 PEnT.NES +72 95
#note hEPTANES is better for defense

#note 4E GAWP is a good way to dump.  Should've thought more about cleaning up this junky rack.  Given the board, we're racing to hit a play at H10
>Matt_L: IRU J3 URI. +17 200
>E_Tran: AAEGLPW 2J AGAPE +29 201
#note This scores, turns over, but is pretty damn risky.  Sim likes conservative plays at 2I: WAG, GAWP, WAP, PAW.
>Matt_L: DEHIR H10 .HIDER +39 239
>E_Tran: ?HLOORW 1L HOWL +60 261
#note Definitely better than bingoing, so I didn't even look.  WORMHOLE is neat.
>Matt_L: KR L1 ..RK +22 261
>E_Tran: ?DNNORR 11H .ORN +14 275
#note It took me a bit of time to decide on this, but it's definitely right.  Opens more bingo lines, which is +EV for me with my blank.

>E_Tran: AEIMSUV J11 .AMI +8 369
#note His last play suggests bingoey tiles.  Looking at the pool, I can't afford him to hit something like RUDDIEST.  Should I do UREMIA?  I'll be drawing into a pool with UUBFZXG.  Keeping ESUV is still gross, so UREMIA is probably better.  It also avoids him opening another line, and me having to block again.  I did like that the hooks on RAMI are a bit tricky

#note Best; this leave gives me the most chance to go out in 2.
