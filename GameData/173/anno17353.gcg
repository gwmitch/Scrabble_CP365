#note OI is simming ahead.  It does have decent defensive aspects.  Sim also prefers exch OI to exch I.  Interesting stuff.

#note a risky option is 7L FIX.  INFIX, TOXIN, also better.  This sets up a situation for a big Y play = more variance = more luck = bad for me

#note sims top exchanges:  keep nothing, keep E, keep EPT, keep T.  The E looked valuable to hit a line 15 bingo, so I kept that.

#note FIGS is doing better.  The board is already closed, so I strongly like IF here.

>Siri_T: AEGIRST 4L .AG +15 281
#note this, (F)IG and (K)I are ahead of the pack.  This is obviously pretty risky.  I could play it safe and try to grind out a close win.  But I thought the risk was worth it here.  PAW suggests he had a below average rack last turn.  If I bingo at O, it seals the deal; if he takes the spot with a bingo or for pts, I can still come back.

#note STERILANT.  yow.  I was looking, and missed it.  Weird position here.  Do I fish again?  If I do, there are no bingo lines.  So instead, I opt to kill my rack and score what I can.

#note Wasn't 100% on CENSER. Not worth the risk.  The bag is vowel heavy, so keeping RN is less bad.  So many of quack's choices are fishes; then you hit sim, and the scoring plays jump to the top. Lawl.

>Siri_T: AENNRRU N2 RE. +29 398
#note REGNA is interesting (but obviously wrong).  I think it comes down to RE(G) or NE(G) and which leave I'm more likely to go out in 2 with.    Sim likes NEG by 1%
