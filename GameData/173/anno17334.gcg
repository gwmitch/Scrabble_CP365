#note Wrong word, right spot.  I do this stuff all the time.  Obviously I can understand how a word starting with W and not placing the A next to the DWS is better for defense...  I continue to be surprise that AGL is a better leave than EGL though, so even thinking like that, I still would have chosen WAFTS over the correct WEFTS.

>Sean_Wrona: DEGPTTV J7 V.GED +12 106
#note Yikes!  This is phony?  Would not have guessed that.  After a fish like AA I need to play here to block AUSTERER bingos I think, but J7 VETTED is I think the play, not H4 VETTED, which Quackle prefers.  Of course I didn't even think of VETTED, which is grossly superior.

#note Yeah, TIPOFF would be a hard find for most people and considering board vision is obviously the worst part of my game, no shock I missed this.  I sure paid for it though.

#note I guess Ricky didn't know HALALA?  Well, neither did I and he knows a lot more words than I do...

I believe he changed from QAIDS to QADIS before hitting his clock and I have to say I think the consecutive vowels is better defense.  Too many -ine, -ire, -ise, -ite bingos are allowed by QADIS and not QAIDS.  But I've made more than enough errors like THAT myself.  I wish I didn't though.

#note Ben Schoenbrun before the tournament told me I needed to be more aggressive at challenging things.  I had never seen this before, so I challenged it, and poor challenging instinct was I believe my biggest issue in this tournament, which is an improvement from some of my past tournaments when it was finding plays...  I seemed to have MOSTLY done that better at Poughkeepsie.

#note My stereotypical error is not finding my clever high-scoring plays, getting lazy, and fishing.  Here's an instance where I saw my fishing play of OI, rejected it because there were no L's left when it was STILL what I needed to do because of the BEE hook and HALALS hook.  I didn't know the HALALA hook, but HAD I known that I would have seen why keeping the A was a massive priority.  Even though the game is already lost, this is a rare instance for me of me finding a clever high-scoring play and totally being in the wrong.  "When in doubt take the points" is not always a worthwhile maxim, and this is one instance where it is NOT.  OI and VITTAE rank similarly on the kibitzer, but definitely do NOT on the sim.  Major error but the game was lost anyway, so I don't really see it as a CHOKE.

>Ricky_Sirois: HM 14N HM +28 365
>Sean_Wrona: AEIIORS 5J OI +7 263
#note Now looking at this and seeing that I did play OI on THIS turn, I have to wonder if I actually failed to see it on the previous turn, and I admit at this point I don't remember.  I'm rather surprised this sims so badly compared to longer plays that burn the S and don't score much more.  It probably sims so badly because I need more points than that to win, but I don't see how any of the preferred plays like ARIOSI/HALALA really help with that.  I don't think this is an error, but maybe I'm wrong.

>Ricky_Sirois: ES 13K ..ES +28 393
#note Based on this Ricky clearly didn't know HALALA or else he would have made blocking row 15 a much higher priority, especially since he had to be able to guess I had the A at this point.
>Sean_Wrona: AEIJORS 13E .AJ +18 281
#note Quackle likes C6 SO.  I don't really understand why.  Probably because of potential high-scoring J options in row 15.  I guess this scores so little that it effectively forfeits the game even though I got ridiculously lucky after this.  I still don't consider it a major error even though the winning percentage is 0.01 for this as opposed to 2.02 (for some reason) after SO.

>Sean_Wrona: DEINORS M6 INDORSE. +66 347
#note hahahahahahahahahahahaha

Ricky complimented me on finding INDORSEE, probably because he thought he blocked that spot, but we apparently both missed the much higher scoring SORDINE.  I closed the game to 44 after INDORSEE, and it would have been 24 after SORDINE instead.  D'oh.

Cumulative winning percentage loss via Quackle: 68.9%
Average winning percentage loss: 5.3%
Significant mistakes (6): FLAWS (rack vision - didn't consider ramifications of all possibilities), VEGED (phony when non-phony VETTED is even better at what I WAS TRYING TO DO), SOFT (board vision error - missed TIPOFF), PUNTING (rack vision error - missed GUNPOINT), challenged CORNPONE, VITTAE (needed a much better leave to fish with)

5:11

Well, it is quite possible that this was my worst-played game of the entire tournament, and I still only lost by 44, so I'll take it.
