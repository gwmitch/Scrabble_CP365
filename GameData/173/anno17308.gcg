>Steve_Grob: ABHIJPQ 8F JIB +24 24
#note Note to self: start studying J words. Second game in a row with a big whiff on the opening play. JABIRU in the previous game, I knew and didn't see. HIJAB I saw, and doubted myself, thinking I was confusing it with HIJRA. Then tried to get cute in setting up the Q(I) possibility.
>Steve_Krieger: EFGOR 9E GOFER +36 36
#note Made a wrongful challenge here, not remembering that FORGE has an anagram. Scored as 35 in the actual game. Way too many scoring errors in this tournament that went unchecked.
>Steve_Grob: ACHOPQU -  +0 24
#note Bad challenge.
>Steve_Krieger: ETV I7 VE.T +24 60
>Steve_Grob: ACHOPQU 6H QOPH +32 56
#note One of those rare times when it's right to hold on to the Q. Top three plays are POH, CHOP, and HOP on row 6. Championship player says QOPH is 8th best, about three percent behind in winning chances, and seven points back in valuation.
>Steve_Krieger: TU 5K UT +14 74
#note Looks rather fishy, don't you think?

>Steve_Grob: AAAACEU -AAAAU +0 56
#note There is a wonderful play available here, but you have to be  both good and ever vigilant over the board to find it. Answer after next play. This exchange is second best.
>Steve_Krieger: ?EGNSST J9 SiGNETS +70 144
#note Best available bingo for Steve here is 10G SE(T)TiNGS for 73.

Answer to last play is ACA(JO)U for 23.
>Steve_Grob: CEIRSYZ 12H ZI.CY +58 114
#note Love the ERS leave after this play, but it's wrong to sacrifice the 17 points. Best is (S)IZERS for 75. Roughly a 10-point error according to Q.
>Steve_Krieger: IOR H12 .ORI +39 183
#note Highlights the problem with my last play.
>Steve_Grob: EENORSV 15J .EVERS +39 153
#note (S)EVENS is the top choice, probably due to there being one more N than R left in the bag. Would have liked to have seen (S)OEVER.
>Steve_Krieger: DOT 10D DOT +21 204
>Steve_Grob: AAAILNO 11E AA +23 176
>Steve_Krieger: AK L3 KA. +14 218
#note More fish in the water.
>Steve_Grob: ADDILNO M2 NIDAL +30 206
>Steve_Krieger: EMT N1 MET +21 239
>Steve_Grob: AADDEIO O1 AE +21 227
>Steve_Krieger: EEFILRS O8 FIRELES. +86 325
>Steve_Grob: ACDDINO 12A CANID +28 255
#note Q says NICAD in the same spot, sacrificing four points. May be for 3x3 considerations, but hard to see that line staying open against a capable human. An interesting dink play is 4K D(AD)A for 19. NADI(R) at N11 is also nice.
>Steve_Krieger: EGNORTU B8 OUTR.NGE +72 397
#note That pretty much does it.
>Steve_Grob: ADEOOUY A7 OY +30 285
#note YAUD

>Steve_Krieger: ?BILMNN 11J ..B +13 474
>Steve_Grob: EIILOPU D3 PILEI +23 363
#note POILU in the same spot rates three points better in valuation.
>Steve_Krieger: ?AIMNNR E4 NAMs +29 503
#note Wrapping up a dreadful tournament by letting a phoney go unchallenged. Perfect. 
>Steve_Grob: OU 14F OU. +5 368
