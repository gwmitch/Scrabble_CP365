#note I didn't even really look for plays and maybe I should have, but I couldn't bring myself to take a low score where I would still have duplicate letters.  Of course, if I had just played ABO/AG or something I would have delayed his bingo.

#note So many plays, so hard to distinguish.  I liked this one because it largely shut down the upper quadrant of the board which plays like ghat, hem, and hat would not.

#note Colossal board vision miss here, that's for sure.  FUNDS is unbelievably obvious, although as it turned out I lucked out from my stupidity.

#note G5 DUI sims as a 51% win while all other plays have 25% winning chances or worse, so this is apparently a massive error?  I don't trust Quackle's pre-endgame calculations at all though.  They don't always make sense, but this makes a bit more sense.  I still don't see what other spots he really has once I block the r though.  I certainly found a way to lose, but I don't quite think dui makes a Matthew win probable.
>Sean_Wrona: AEINTTT A13 TA. +3 368
#note So my instincts were at least right here.  This sims as an 88% win FAR beyond any of the equity-based plays AND I drew the blank as the last tile, but I still found a way to lose...  It might not be the best play through the r, but it has to be one of the better ones.  I spent 8 minutes on this play mainly trying to work out my tracking and properly figure out Matthew's rack, but that arguably is the reason I lost as I was down to slightly over 2 minutes after this play.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EILNSSU 15G ...ULSINE +39 369
#note I absolutely held this and didn't like it much, but figured I could still outscore it so I accepted it.  I was blissfully unaware of his reputation for phonying, I should have KNOWN he'd have no choice to do something like this after I blocked the last bingo spot (and I spent time carefully making sure he didn't have a possible bingo ending in a at B2, etc...) and although it sounds flatly ridiculous after the fact, especially because -ine words are usually derived from some smaller word and there's no small word that would make sense in this case...  The game wasn't lost after I accepted this, but I still needed to find my win in 2 minutes.
>Sean_Wrona: ?EINTT 13I TINs +15 383
#note Looking at my possible plays here I don't know any of my outplays although I could have guessed that tenuti was a word.  The high-scoring options in row 7 are not obvious finds and I don't know if I even remember tawed is valid even though I HAVE seen all the fives multiple times.  INKJET isn't an easy find either.  Missing all the row 7 stuff I found nothing better than TINS/ZAS.  I played it and hit my clock with 0 seconds remaining, seeing no out plays for him better than DOBIES (I missed SHAMES).  Due to still having inexperience with blank slips, I forgot to mark it and was ordered to by the director, causing me to go over by 2 seconds, at which point the game was lost...

Essentially I failed to follow Ben's advice about challenging, maybe after getting burned on CORNPONE, maybe because I assumed I could win, but I spent WAY too much time trying to block Matthew's bingo line when TAR is a play that should not take 8 minutes.  I'd have probably been better off if I simply hadn't tried to track knowing the kind of stuff he had left and just blocked his bingo line much sooner giving me more time to react to REVULSINE.   REVULSINE sounds flatly ridiculous and I don't know what I was doing...  I largely controlled this game despite some outrageous mistakes like FUNKS and was very angry after this loss.

Since I lost 100% winning percentage on this turn, my cumulative winning percentage loss was -156.7% (12.05% a turn).  Measuring this way certainly emphasizes screwing up on the more pivotal plays and will hopefully provide a numeric incentive for me to stop choking.  Matthew's cumulative winning percentage of 62.65% wasn't all that hot either because he lost 40.35% winning percentage from OI instead of DUI.  He still only made 2 major mistakes (REV instead of VIVA and OI instead of DUI), while I made at least 5 (exchange - it was more important to score points than remove all duplication, BY - board vision error because BUTYL was much better, FUNKS - horrific board vision error because the obvious play of FUNDS scores more, blocks more, and provides a better leave, PROUD - provides apparently much poorer defense than I thought it did, and TINS - chokes the game).  Still, on the flip side, I suppose I was just happy to control most of this game, but I'm so sick of choking when I tend to stay in the game with pretty much everyone...  If I could just resolve my perpetual glitches and consistently see things and close my endgames, I'm a 1700 and I know it.  Sigh...

Matthew apparently mistracked as well because he suggested NITON/JO/IN but I didn't have that and INTO/JO wouldn't have been enough to win.
