#note This is pretty bad. I was getting really nervous about the easy points hooking this word (in part because I was pretty sure PENSIONEE* was good). But Kate could have done DEAVE last turn. Maybe I should not sacrifice the equity. 11C GIE. I guess GHEES isn't that bad. Makes the board pretty gross.

#note DECRETAL takes an S. :( need to be more sure of stuff like that. WOW outsims TROWS in any case, but missing the hook is bad mojo.

#note Bad time for that draw. Also bad time to miss 6K RADII, which is better than this.

#note Didn't have time to go through every possible rack for my 1-tile fishes, but it looks like 7B OY only loses 1/9, while this loses 2/9. Regardless of draws, both lose to QUOTIENT and OUTLINE, obviously. Which means I should be dropping my A at B7 to eliminate the remote QUOTIENT possibility.  I'm lucky the wasted win% didn't cost me here.
