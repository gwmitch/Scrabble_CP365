#note I'm overthinking here.  After Q(I), I have a VERY high shot at a bingo, thereby averaging ~40 pts in 2 turns.  After STEP, my average score will be much lower

#note lucky to get the I here

#note Worth the risk?  Sim says no; just play BRIDLERS or BRAIDERS.

#note Sim says our bingo% is higher with the E and R open, so to play (T)WO or WO at O11.  hmm.  interesting.

#note Yea; there was a good chance GUAIACOL would be blocked.  This leave is horrible, but the board is so dead, I love it.

#note Taking defense too far, or just right?

#note This one is definitely needed.

>E_Tran: AAEEEOR I13 AE +7 352
#note I thought the pool looked pretty safer, that I didn't need to block the D line.  Turns out STENGAH would have really killed me.  I figure he does'nt have an H, or enough vowels to use this spot and mount a comeback.
>Wayne_C: GR 12A .R.G +16 296
>E_Tran: AEEHLOR D8 AL +11 363
#note At this point I realized STENGAH is still available and freak 
out.  Gotta block it.
