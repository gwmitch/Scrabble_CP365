#note Talk about not even LOOKING for sevens.  Clearly playing something defensive was a better idea...

#note Here's one of my better examples of my stereotypical tunnel vision where I only consider one play and don't look for other options (relatively high scoring fishes like ho or hod, longer words like equity, but regardless of what Quackle suggests there is no way I'm playing quirted in that position...)  This is still fairly acceptable though.

#note Yikes.  Why was I so certain this was good?  Well, it scores well, is good defensively, sims better than any of my actual words, and he didn't challenge it.  So I guess that's okay?

>Larry_Sherman: AB 12K BA +24 201
#note Okay, missing AB must be his own board vision error.  One of my biggest emotional problems in a game is underestimating my opponents' mistakes relative to my own...  Not that I thought of AB after he played BA, so I might have done the same thing...

#note It's lucky that I drew an A there, huh?  Talk about benefitting from a mistake.  And yes, I fully understand why JUDO is better, but I didn't consider it...  See what I mean in the strategy groups when I note that I go 'Oh duh oh duh oh duh' when I see what my correct plays were?  Having said that, my errors are less significant than they used to be, and even this isn't a MAJOR error (I've made several errors in this game, but none that I'd probably count as MAJOR up to this point...)

#note I didn't see GIFTEES and might have doubted its validity, but I am surprised it sims that much better since it seems it would be a lot easier to bingo through, and there aren't exactly many massive scoring plays he can make there - VINES would be about the most dangerous and not by enough to lose...

#note Quackle prefers fishing to this.  I definitely don't.  This pretty much blocks the row 2 and row 3 and column N threats and cinches the game.  I'd be a lot more worried after a fish.

#note And after this play he probably thought I was a complete idiot.  I seriously remembered OUTEN* as being good (I guess I was thinking of OATEN).  He challenged and I said something like "Wow really, you're challenging?"  He said "Yes, I'm challenging" and after it turned out no good, I said I was embarrassed that I let FLOCS go or something and he said, "What's wrong with FLOCS?"  I suppose in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter since he had no wins at this point, but considering how much I'm always going on about not embarrassing myself, this certainly did.  Much like when I lost to Sean Baizana after he challenged SOM, I feared Larry was thinking 'How could I lose to a guy who played OUTEN and thought FLOCS was bad?'  But truthfully, apart from this brain fart, this game was not embarrassing at all.  Sure, I didn't find the best play very often but I at least found the 2nd or 3rd best play - a good play at least - almost every turn, which is a lot better than a lot of my ISC games where I play something random and awful and way off the charts...  My consistency was a lot better than usual...

#note Cumulative winning percentage loss via Quackle: 16.8%
Average winning percentage loss: 1.3%
Significant mistakes (0-2): Just OUTEN and HITE, but he didn't challenge HITE and it simmed the best and the game was already over when I played OUTEN.  I'd say 2 though.
