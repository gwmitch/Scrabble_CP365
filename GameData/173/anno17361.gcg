#note Optimal placement (unless you think vertical openings are inherently evil...)
>M_Howard: ADIO 11E OID.A +12 12
>Verbie: DEJNNRW F9 DJ.NN +29 95
#note Not sure why better to leave the D off here
>M_Howard: AQU 9C QUA. +24 36
>Verbie: EEGKRSW B9 SKEWER +61 156
#note At this point it starts getting weird.
>M_Howard: ?ACEEOT J5 COATEEs +68 104
>M_Howard: ?ACEEOT --  -68 36
#note Yes, that happened.  This is a plyer with actual tournament experience.
>Verbie: GHLMNNY 14E GYM +42 198
#note Not sure why I opened the triple for something like ECOTAgE but that was available last turn
>M_Howard: ?ACEEOT G1 lOCATEE +65 101
>M_Howard: ?ACEEOT --  -65 36
#note Stop doing that.

>Verbie: CEHILNN 15G INCH +31 229
#note No second chance at the triple here.
>M_Howard: ?ACEEOT 9H .ElOCATE +61 97
#note At this score she needs a nine-timer to get back in, but an E 2nd is just asking for it.
>Verbie: ?DELNRT O8 R.LENTeD +131 360
#note Um, anti-self-descriptive play anyone?  Things are about to spin out of control.  And you thought that already happened.
>M_Howard: ORZ 13A Z.RO +26 123
>Verbie: BEEGILO G1 OBLIGEE +65 425
#note Well that was obvious.  Here, have an open trip-trip lane back.
>M_Howard: AORT 5G .AROT +12 135
#note Phony but with what I'm about to I don't care.
>Verbie: AEEINUX H1 XI +58 483
#note Not sure why EXINE for a point less is better?
>M_Howard: EF 6I EF +28 163
>Verbie: AEENOTU N4 OUTEA.EN +70 553
#note And there's still a bunch of tiles left.
>M_Howard: MUV O2 VUM +18 181
>Verbie: ABDEFII A11 FA.ED +70 623
#note This took me over a minute to count up, mainly due to the bystander who interfered with my concentration.  Saw the play right away, just shocked by how much it was.  This is turning into pinball.
>M_Howard: LPSW K7 PL.WS +20 201
>Verbie: BIIIOVY 1M BIO +42 665
#note It could have gone the other way, that O draw...
