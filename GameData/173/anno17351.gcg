#note Given his last few fishy plays, COULEE is out of the question.  I didn't even like CLUE because it opened the board for him, but there are literally no good plays.

#note M(I)TT .  duh.  INOS is better synergy than IOST.  Blocking at 14N also has merit given the score.

#note Emil puts this down, verbalizes "G" and hits his clock without designating the blank in writing.  I tell him he has to write down the letter.  He realizes his error and marks "I".  I'm up by enough that I don't care.  But: fair or foul?  What would the ruling be?
