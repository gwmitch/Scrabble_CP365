>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEINTU 8H EAU +6 6
#note Exchange EU sims almost a point better than 8G EAU. This is apparently the wrong placement because of where is sticks the A.

#note No, the blank is not an R.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEEFLO L1 LEAF +33 139
#note FOETAL is a miss. Not a huge error, though.
>Sean_Wrona: AEGMOOR E9 MOORAGE +77 130
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACCEORS 15A RECC. +36 175
#note Interestingly, ACEROSE for the same score sims tied with this. Because of all the unseen esses I guess. COERCE sims better than both by about a point. I thought it'd be close. SCARCE is also playable.
>Sean_Wrona: AEHM N2 HAME +45 175
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEIJOS D6 JIAO +16 191
#note Lots of close plays. RIOJA and JO are worth considering. All three are fine, I think. I ended up regretting blocking this spot.

#note Mistakes so far have been minor. This is disastrous, though. No explanation for missing VIVA other than annoyance at the OVV draw to RISE

#note Spent the rest of my time trying to find the best chance to win. I decided my best chance was hitting the blank and getting UNISSUED, since there's no way I could rely on a bingo to the R. After some time looking at this, I still can't find anything better. Looks like a ~9% shot to win (drawing the ? and forcing Sean to block column A).
