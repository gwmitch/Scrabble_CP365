#note I had a tough time deciding what to keep.  My leave instincts are not as good as they should be.  I was mostly debating between EZ, EHZ, EHIZ, and EIZ.  Staticly EIZ is in the middle, but it jumps to the top in a 4ply.  Weird.  EOZ jumps to 2nd.

#note 2B UNVEXED.  well then.  I was too distracted by the x3 lane.  Bad miss.

>E_Tran: EEIIJNO J8 E.JOIN +29 208
#note Sim says this ENJOIN is much worse than the other enjoin.  I disagree.  I think I'm still a slight favorite to win this game, so prefer to close bingo lines and have the board closed.

#note 2B RIVAGE is a play.  IG(N)ORE uses the same tiles and scores 1 more.  ORGIAC.  Lots of better plays.  Turnover is so important given the ??SSSS in the pool

>E_Tran: ?AACEEO 7G ACE +15 240
#note Bag is consonant heavy; I thought I could get away with this.  But, I should try harder for a play that leaves a better v-c ratio.  Sim prefers AE(R)O, OC(R)EA COOEE.
