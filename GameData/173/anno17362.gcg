>Sean_Wrona: AEMNORU 9H ENAMOUR +63 63
#note Which ENAMOUR is better?  Quackle claims the 7H ENAMOUR is better but I don't really see why.  Sure, X plays are a threat here but Z plays are a threat after the other ENAMOUR.  ENAMOURS bingos are a major threat either way.  This ENAMOUR prevents the possibility of hooking an S on NE, while the other ENAMOUR allows SEN and I guess that was what led me to choose this one.  Maybe it doesn't matter much.

#note Great example of not looking hard enough.  I certainly don't know sokeman or sokemen but I should have been able to think of koa.  At least I didn't play sake.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: ABILNTU E1 UNITABL. +70 161
#note This game could have been VERY different if not for this.  I held this play and REALLY didn't like it.  I've been studying high-probability 8s.  I remember studying DUTIABLE so that means if UNITABLE was a word, I should have seen it, and I didn't remember it.  That should have been enough for me to challenge, especially because Benjy Boy himself told me to challenge more confidently, but maybe the stench of CORNPONE lingered and caused me to chicken out.  I only held it at first because I misread it.  I was assuming it was derived from unit instead of derived from unite, which is pretty ridiculous.  I was halfway there and since I knew that was in my probability range and it didn't sound familiar, I should have challenged...
>Sean_Wrona: AEEINSV 4C VE. +12 99
#note Digging in much deeper.  This isn't even THAT great a leave and I didn't even consider my scoring options.  Total intermediate garbage, and I played better than this in most of my other games, but it gets worse.  And looking at my fishing options, UVEA is obviously the play since it scores more, closes down a scoring spot, and gives me a better leave.  What's not to like?  This is the pinnacle of one of those 'Oh duh' turns.

>Sean_Wrona: AAEINRS F1 .A +8 114
#note Digging myself deeper.  I left ARSINE on the previous turn and overdrew.  After the previous two turns, Ben clearly knew what I must have and gave me the A back, knowing that it would be hard for me to finally to hit my bingo.  I didn't even see what the other tile was.  I didn't realize that was a rule, but Ben didn't do it on purpose and was more absent-minded.  That's okay.  If I had known what my other tile had been, I probably would have gotten even MORE angry at myself and played even worse than this, but how much worse than this can one play?

#note Same rack and no options this time.  In fact, at this point, I was lucky to even bingo afterward at all.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: AEQTTTU L8 T.QUET +32 339
>Sean_Wrona: AEFINRS E11 FA +25 149
#note hahahahaha.  Oh wow.  The pain continues.  I certainly saw infares but at this point I guess I wasn't even looking for 8s or noticing that he opened another line.  This is my worst set of misses in ages.  At least FA is a fish that scores, but even my chances of bingoing at this point aren't very good.

#note I'm done with my attempts to clinically measure cumulative equity loss percentage as I was doing.  I want to upload these games more quickly although I'll still sim the plays and this is a very, very bad measure.  Since I was behind Ben for almost the entire game, I only lost a cumulative 25% in winning eprcentage because my possible winning percentage was so low for almost the entire game.  This was clearly my worst-played game, and the only kind of measure that would be of value is (as I said in the Scott Appel game) the sum of the ratios between your plays' winning percentage and the best plays' winning percentage...  That might prove this was the worst game...  But I need to focus more on getting better than attempting to calculate how well I've played which most legitimate experts would probably tell me is largely impossible, as many times as I've tried...  I'm going to stop doing this in the remaining games and try to be less self-loathing as well.  And I'll inevitably fail...
