#note QI at 7B sims better by 1 point. it's strange because I thought it was much better than the 21-point difference would indicate but in the end I decided an S couldn't be worth 21 points even with it making the leave a lot better + the open tiles. weird move.

#note I was not happy with this move. it gives up too much and puts me in a bad spot. i did see C3 DUPION but i wasn't totally sure i was just inventing a word; it's new. C12 PIU is a little better than mine defensively, but DUPION is definitely the winner. -8

#note C7 ON is what i considered. i don't think it will work, though. it is too desperate and easy to block and i'm pretty sure Quackle is wrong on this one. however, E8 ADO is probably better than my move. -2.5

#note i was too close to missing this as i kept looking for SWAGING words, but i wasn't even 100% on SWAGING. ugh.

>cesar: CEEIOSY 4H YE +21 308
#note i saw OGEE at 6B but always forget that YOGEE is a word! 3A YES is also a good play. 4H YE is just scary as hell. i really wanted to try blocking there but in the absence of that i should either score or keep a decent leave.  -4

#note luckily he didn't have a bingo
>cesar: CEFIOSS L2 F.IC +18 326
#note very clearly 3A FISC, but as I mentioned, I wasn't sure of SWAGING :( massive mistake. FOLIC L1 is also better than my play, but guess what word i wasn't 100% sure of again. -18.5

#note the best play here is the amazing K8 PERSON. it's surprising how easy that was to miss. -6
