#note strongly considered FEEBLY here. it sims better. i overestimate the hotspot i open when there are already other open hot spots. BELAY 6B sims a little better too. -1.5

#note of course i drew the X now. the REVALUATED spot is going to be an equity bleed for the rest of the game. 13C XI sims better than my play though because EGLRSU is a good leave with those i's. -8
