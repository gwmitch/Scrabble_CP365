#note Ugh I saw HELLIONS but chickened out. HELIO D1 looks good. I considered HILL to set up the O but idk, ENO isn't very attractive. EILLN is also really ugly so I am pissed at myself for playing NOH, cause it's super volatile. I overestimated the volatility I need to beat these Yanks. HILLO is stupid, but maybe HOLE? Idk. HELIO is probably the play, besides the bingo of course. The more I stare at this position, the uglier EILLN gets. Even HILLO just feels so much less restricting.

#note I spent so much time worrying about the validity of AGEN I completely whiffed PIRE*. this position is quite interesting, but ofc JAP cannot be right. GIO could keep a lot of things, a ? and S are definitely in his range... AEIS or AEI? are reasonable, and unless he kept AEIW or something, he wouldn't keep a W cause he'd play WIG. I'm putting him on AEIS or something, so I am not surprised if I pull a ? or S. leaving one in the bag is always good, but a 1.5 times better chance at drawing the ? or S is also huge. SKI 13c is gonna be big. I considered mainly JA and FOND besides JAP. JA is nice because FOND stays open a lot cause his letters aren't very good for the spot, unless he has SIEVE. FOND keeps two placements of JAP in reserve. I think I like FOND. Adam pointed out FAP is also available, and although DJNO isn't very flexible for the J it still scores very well.

#note Nice. Chris played acai cause I stupidly took my courtesy tiles, showing him the pool. So he played such that he'd had REVIEWS or PREVIEWS unblockable.
