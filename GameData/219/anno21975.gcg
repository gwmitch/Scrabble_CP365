#note (H)ENGE or this? This is obviously the Quackle play, but bingos are not likely to happen and Gibson is not likely to open.

#note Since I have the S inference, this play is bad for me. 
>Matt_: IJNNOPT 7H T.NPIN +31 230
#note Since Gibson has that S, I feel I want to make the board more dynamic. If he bingos ending in an S, I can cash the J back in a lot of the time. I like this play quite a lot right now. Thoughts?

#note Hate holding the Q here, but I've got to play in the 3 row, I think. A(G)LOO partially knocks out the S spot I'm worried about.
