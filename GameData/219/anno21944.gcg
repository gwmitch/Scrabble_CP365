>Matthew_O'Connor: AILMNR 8D MARLIN +22 22
>Jackson_Smylie: DGIOUWY F6 WO.DY +28 28
#note WAGYU is the play. I wasn't sure of MARLING as well for YUG or GUY.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AGH J6 HAG +25 47
>Jackson_Smylie: ?FGISTU 9H FUGuIST +89 117
#note FUSTInG/SHAG is a bit stronger to not open the triple and float the big S hook. Fuguist got +10 though.
>Matthew_O'Connor: CEENORT L3 NEOTER.C +72 119
#note Matthew knew the S hook, I didn't.
>Jackson_Smylie: AAEILOZ K4 AZO +54 171
#note I considered AZIONE to keep both balance an a slightly more open board, but his immediate score rises and I'm not sure how much mine does. AEIL could work okay with the M/T.
>Matthew_O'Connor: KRSTU O5 TURKS +38 157
>Jackson_Smylie: AEILLQV 9C QAI. +30 201
#note The bag is slightly vowel heavy, so I was more comfortable with ELLV. A U draw would be nice for VULN.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ADM N4 DAM +24 181
>Jackson_Smylie: EEELLRV D8 ..RVEL +22 223
#note I struggled with this type of position most this tournament, not being sure whether to take a bit of extra equity for opening the board. HAGGLE is nice to set up the R, and MARVEL scores more than anything else. I didn't know MALLEE or VELE (g3). VELE seems nice to me to keep things tight and force him to open. Against Matthew I think VELE works, but I felt my lead wasn't enough to sacrifice too much. MARVEL also gets paralleled a lot, if not by matthew definitely by me. Q likes MALLEE then MARVEL.

>Matthew_O'Connor: BEEHILO (challenge) +5 221
>Jackson_Smylie: EEEIILP 13B PI.EI +14 237
#note I didn't know ILLIPE and wasn't sure of RELIE. EPEE is also okay but IIL seems extra-terrible on this board.
>Matthew_O'Connor: BEEHILO -BEEHI +0 221
>Jackson_Smylie: EEILTXY F12 T.X +26 263
#note I was close to playing RILEY but wasn't sure of it. I think TIX is extra good cause Matthew can't score very often. the R and P are the only spots and they aren't great. Q hates TIX. I like RILEY best, or TITELY which sets up the X.

>Jackson_Smylie: DEEEIIO (challenge) +5 316
>Matthew_O'Connor: ABIN A7 BANI +23 268
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEEIIO 14E E.I.ED +20 336
#note He probably has a fairly balanced rack after BANI, maybe ANT, ENT, or NOT or something. He could have a blank but it's not a big chance. I'm not sure how to play this. IDEE blocks the best bingo lane, but is least likely to outrun a bingo. The V:C is 11:11, so keeping vowels is extra bad. Perhaps EXILE is the best for outrunning cause I setup a 30+ score. EXILED blocks most of the lanes at the bottom and reaches an xtra tile for the blank. BEEDIE looks nice for equity and playing tiles, which wins the sim. There's a slight risk of stuff like HONAN but I still probably outrun that.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AENORTV B2 VENATOR +80 348
>Jackson_Smylie: AEINNOU C3 AUNE +18 354
#note AYIN now seems like the play, I simply missed it. I can't be worrying too much about bingoes cause I need to just outrun him and hope he doesn't hav e a bingo (he has 7 random tiles from a not very good pool with a blank). As long as I draw consos and not AEE after Ayin, I'm probably okay. The J doesn't score very well. I considered UN/NY, but it keep the awful AEINO and plays just two tiles. At the time I liked AUNE cause a play like JOTS could still give me plays from the J. Q doesn't like AYIN or AUNE, and likes EONIANN and AUE best. I liked EONIAN for a bit cause it scores and reaches for all the tiles. If I draw the J or maybe ?, I could pull it through. Eonian sets up J plays, which is great if I draw it cause it might make him unable to play an out in two. I should have probably played EONIAN to gamble that he drew a less-than-stellar rack after bingoing. I'm not sure what to do here.

#note I was thinking after the tournament that I was happy I didn't play a phony three. well....
