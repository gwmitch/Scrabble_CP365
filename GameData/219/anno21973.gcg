#note Not sure why I decided to phony here. Could have been bad, but she had a good comeback play so I got lucky she didn't challenge. I have very good options here, this isn't much better than ZLOT(Y) or T(I)Z

>Josh: ?DEGILT A13 TEG +16 170
#note Was fine with keeping it closed here. I can also make aggressive plays, but that leaves me open to losing to easier made plays.

#note Given that she is very likely going to play FE or something like that at N10, I wanted to be able to best respond to that by digging for tiles that scored better. Perhaps since there are only 3 more I's left and the Q is lingering, I should have opted to keep DEIS, but I think this exchange was definitely worth it over 3K I(C)Y. Maybe I should just play ICY for the hight chance that I can end the game next turn, but no, I think I am more likely to be able to end the game by scoring and/or getting a bingo than I am by keeping a bingo-ey leave that doesn't score.

#note I don't remember what I had here, unfortunately, and this is my best guess, but this exchange makes no sense if this is what I did. I wanted to keep the M and T together but that didn't seem like a good idea, that''s what I remember.

#note thinking of AFEARD
>Josh: AAAEMNN 2M ANA +8 335
#note I should just keep a worse leave and not give her points here. I hoped she didn't have a W or V with having played ARD and holding an S last turn.
