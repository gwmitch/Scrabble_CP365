#note JD: difficult to open for him here with a big lead, but my other plays like WON left what I thought was a weaker leave. WON actually sims a tad better and bingos just as much, so probably not the best idea to play a move opening the board.

#note I really wanted to save the PLATINIZE hook for future turns, which is why I didn't play FOP at 14H. he has enough other potential bingo spots, and I may outrun him if I hold onto the P for next time.

#note I think this is my best try here, I have to draw an out to win but it's not impossible.

#note it took me about 8-9 minutes to make this play to make sure i wasn't screwing up (I said hold forever on PLATINIZE). stoicism goes out the window when i play JD.
