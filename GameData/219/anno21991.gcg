#note Well, I dislike the A placement, but I have to do something. Plus, it seems more like you have bingo things than scorey things. 
>chris: ACDEIST 11A ACIDEST +79 267
#note Oh hey I was right!
>Randi: ELMNRSU A6 NUMER.LS +83 400
#note Any difference between NUMERALS and MENSURAL? I didn't see one, but this one didn't put the M in a double line for you and your fresh new rack.

>Randi: AEGIINU 14B GIN +22 422
#note Oh good I have the last 2 I's so if I draw the Q now I've set myself up with a fancy spot. No other power tiles around, right? No other silly G 2s, right?
>chris: UX 15A XU +30 327
#note Ohh right. :)
>Randi: ?AEHIUU 14I AH +28 450
#note Well now I have a rack that would normally be awfully ridic, but the Q is still out and I have the last I and the last U's and the second to last A and the blank so I'm pretty solid. I can take out this silly Q spot so that if he has it, he's screwed and if I draw it, i'll be fine. Yea, good plan.
>chris: AQT 13G QAT +27 354
#note Ohh right. :)
>Randi: ?EIOTUU 6A .U +4 454
#note Well now that I've been soooo clever the last couple of turns, I kind of have no idea what to do. There are two in the bag though, and they look rather... consonanty. So I'm pretty sure you're not going to hit anything when I play off this U here, and even if you do, I'm likely to be able to bingo out afterwards, or at least score enough to salvage a win.

#note I cannot figure out where you played this. I also think I forgot to record something somewhere because I have myself with two plays after this. The end.
