#note 2F LUR(E)X is clear as crystal here. I wasn't that focused and I was trying to be cute. E2 NURL is definitely better for the purpose I was following, especially given Ella's previous move. NURL is probably right actually.

#note Now I was in trouble. I saw a bunch of bingos beginning at A1, and I didn't seem to be able to outrun them with 2K J(E)NNY. I actually can outrun a few of them, so that seems to be the play. Although if I draw the Y, I'm usually screwed. So I wanted to make it hard for her, and I honestly didn't even see the lane at C3, which is actually the most likely, so I really needed to try and block that too. So something like DOYE(N) 6B comes to mind. But she can still hit the D... JENNY wins most times, as I outrun a lot of stuff. Threw it here.

#note Ella has 4 not-so-easy-to-see words here. Much easier when you know there is something. I had completely disregarded the C as a possible lane and in all honesty didn't really see the word she had to the A. She has 1:59 seconds overtime to see a bingo and win, as they all score 64 and bring her to a final of 444 to my 414. She will get there one day!
