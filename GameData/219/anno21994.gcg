>Winter: ADDINOZ 14F ZO.I +33 151
#note Despite being down, I have this feeling that Rick is going to draw well, so I decide to play defensive. Also, there's only one A unseen, which means I can score with the Z.

>Winter: LOOPSUY M4 O..S +28 251
#note I actually though tof PLOYES, but wasn't sure. Good thing I wanted to block that spot and didn't look for POSY hooking (BEER), because Rick had (D)EFUSING.

>Winter: LOOPRUY N1 PLOY +31 282
#note Dang, missed YO(D), which would have tightened up the board further.
