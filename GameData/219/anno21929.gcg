#note quackle prefers 9H HOVE. It's definitely a better leave, and it's actually more defensive than POZOLE points-wise (and I have the L hook). -2.5

>cesar: ?HKNRSV 4D H.NK +22 47
#note i should talk more about this move i guess. Is this right? It's hyper-volatile because of the Y hook. is RUKH better? probably not because I'll bingo significantly more often with the R.

#note I wonder if there's anything I can do here with knowledge of her rack. maybe I can assume she'll miss MADRONE, but I don't see a way here to block ENAMORED that makes sense. perhaps VERSINE at 12C is the play, then. VERSEMEN is also better than revenues because of the S. -0.5

>cesar: BDEIITU L5 TUBED +25 198
#note ok, fine.. TUBED is a terrible move. I did see MEDII but did not want to open the board even more, especially after JUT. i was kind of playing scared. i guess TUBED wouldn't be so terrible if there weren't that many unseen i's. -13

>cesar: HIIIIIY -IIIII +0 198
#note at least she made my choice clear; if she hadn't played there, i may have been the first scrabbler in history to make a play keeping 5 i's. HEY is 35 points!! .... keeping HY or Y is clear here and shows how much that spot is worth!
>jeannie: AEGILNR 14H .RIANGLE +72 234
>cesar: HLORRTY H1 HOLY +61 259
#note should I try to take the E spot here? I figured that i'm giving up a lot of points, but I need to take the 61 points + take that spot already. this was a really tough move actually. I didn't see LORY, which may be a little better.
>jeannie: AX 15N AX +56 290
#note i'm in trouble now

#note and she blocked stringer bell. anyone like REX here? also considered J3 RING.

>cesar: AGNRSSW 2F WR.NG +21 301
#note i don't really understand the logic behind closing a board when i'm down. i justify it as i can hope to outplay on a closed board, but M12 WAGS scores more and i'm actually reasonably likely to bingo after it! -12.5
>jeannie: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 314

#note yes, i should probably exchange all of them.  this was pretty automatic for me, as it blocks the last bad lane. i underestimated how much she could get for the S at F12 though, plus exch 7 gives me a good shot at the S or blank. For some reason, quackle likes keeping a V rather than exch 7. I don't see a good V spot, is this because the bag is vowel heavy?  -6

>cesar: ?AIIIIO 13D OI +9 387
#note jesus. i think quackle is messing this endgame up; i'm not sure there's any win here. it likes NOIRs then RAKI and ANI best (says 100% win). those result in losses for me though when i switch it back. i spent forever trying to find some out in two then decided to block the easy F spot and pray.

#note I blew it here; shuld play just 1H HI. If she finds FRICOT then I can go out with inia/ilia/something; otherwise i have AIOLI. :( -6
>jeannie: EFIORT B12 .OIF +18 399
#note FRICOT is her only winning play. luckily, it's new. she mistracked my blank.
