#player1 Emanuel Emanuel
#player2 Josh Josh
>Emanuel: BEUZ 8G ZEBU +30 30
>Josh: DEHIORV 9H DOH +21 21
#note Eman had overdrawn after ZEBU. I turn over ST?... Given that he has an S, maybe I shouldn't be maintaining a very s-heavy board here. I should probably play something like VI(Z)ORED or OH 9I.
>Emanuel: DEMSY K4 EMYDS +38 68
>Josh: BEIIRVV J2 VIBE +25 46
#note I guess 4J R(E)VIVE. I preferred keeping it closed now that he has shed his S.
>Emanuel: OTY L2 TOY +28 96
>Josh: ?AIKRUV 2H VI.A. +11 57
#note I really wanted to play G3 KUVAs(Z) here. Maybe I should have, cause it really would have messed with Eman's head. It looked like he had something through the ED, so I played this. Maybe he did, and this was right, but maybe he didn't and I should have played (T)URK or (Y)UK on the right.
>Emanuel: CU G6 CU. +15 111
>Josh: ?EKPRSU 10B PUcKERS +74 131
#note Emanuel seems as close to a bingo as he can hope for here, since he didn't play CU(ED) with his lead. There is no way I'm giving him an E to play through with 10B PeRUKES, for 8 points, for 15 points, for 20 points! (Maybe for 25).
>Emanuel: ALO H1 O.AL +24 135
>Josh: AENOOTU E7 OTA.U +18 149
#note Seems oval sort of broke up his rack
>Emanuel: AEQR C9 Q.ARE +48 183
#note I was right! ...
>Josh: EENNOOW D12 ENOW +28 177
>Emanuel: J 7D J. +9 192
#note I somehow knew he was going to block my bingo
>Josh: ?ILNNOO 5I L..ON +14 191
#note oh, I also had NONOILY! didn't know it, good thing it didn't play anywhere. 
>Emanuel: AEGIRST N5 STAGIER +70 262
>Josh: ?GIILNO 3A GLOxINI. +68 259
#note also pIGNOLI(A). Didn't know that one either.
>Emanuel: AEMNR A3 .ERMAN +30 292
>Josh: DFNOTTX O7 TOFT +39 298
>Emanuel: DEF M7 FED +36 328
#note took him a long time to play this. Maybe he a) didn't realize how much it scored or b) left his vowelless or something.
>Josh: ACDLNRX B1 CA.X +35 333
#note This might have been a colossal mistake. Emanuel cannot score after DRA(W)N, and although the X seems very inflexible, I can use it, I won't get stuck with it, and DLRN is going nowhere fast. Damn. I really misjudged this position.
>Emanuel: ANPR 15A PRA.N +30 358
>Josh: DHILRTW 1A I.H +24 357
#note I really wanted to make it hard for Emanuel here, so emptying the bag seemed like it was out of the question. For some reason, I apparently win 1 out out 4 games after E2 W(I)LT.
>Emanuel: EGIS F12 EGIS +18 376
#note smart move
>Josh: DEILRTW 13F .RID +9 366
#note I was fortunate to have enough time to try and figure this tough endgame out. In the end, nothing looked like it won, so I had to attempt to get Emanuel, who was low on time, to mess up.
>Emanuel: AEIN 12H AI +9 385
#note There may have been a better way to induce mistakes.
>Josh: ELTW J12 TEW +24 390
>Emanuel: EN B6 EN +12 397
>Emanuel:  (L) +2 399
