>Michael: AGHLU 8H LAUGH +26 26
#note this is one of two games I was playing simultaneously.
>Josh: ADINORU K6 RI.AUDON +70 70
>Michael: ADEIMNR 12G RADI.MEN +74 100
>Josh: ?BILOOV 6H OVe.BOIL +64 134
#note Naturally I take the worst of the 4 bingos here. OBLiVIO(N) was available! Also, BOILOVER is a word too.
>Michael: OPW O5 P.OW +27 127
>Josh: AEELMNX 13I AN.EXE +58 192
>Michael: ARV 11M VAR +22 149
>Josh: BEGLMPR 11E PLEB +22 214
#note I only saw this play as I was not focused. I think N10 M(ANE)B is the play, since Michael may not know it and would hesitate to either let it go or add an S. Otherwise, I can be proficient and play J5 B(e)G(U)M. 
>Michael: INRTT M2 TRIT.N +14 163
>Josh: AACCGMR 4J MAG.C +20 234
#note H1 MACAC(O)! Didn't know it, another word for MACAQUE :)
>Michael: JO 10N JO +54 217
>Josh: ACEFGIR 2J GIF.ER +28 262
>Josh: ACEFGIR --  -28 234
#note This would have been a great play if perchance Michael did not know it was a phony. This isn't a swing, Jesse Day, it's a seesaw.
>Michael: AEHRSTW 5B WREATHS +78 295
#note Dunno why he second guessed himself and decided to play for 4 fewer points.
>Josh: ACEFGIR C2 FER.IC +28 262
#note I considered playing GIFTCARE* here, but I think he would know that I was confusing it with GIFTWARE. This is not a good move.
>Michael: ?DILSTU 13A DILUTeS +70 365
>Josh: AGIINOT A8 GANOI. +27 289
#note GONI(D)IA
>Michael: EINS B1 SINE. +30 395
>Josh: EFOQTTY 14E EFT +32 321
#note Oh damn, 2J FYT(T)E.
>Michael: ESZ O13 SEZ +50 445
>Josh: DIOQTYY 2J DOT.Y +26 347
#note Last move I was attempting to set an EQ combo or something, but ERSTE* isn't a word. The best play here is 6B Y(I)D, and that might even get a challenge.
>Michael: AEEEKOU A1 OKA +40 485
#note This is a mistake of around 20 points or so.
>Josh: IQY A1 ...Y +25 372
#note I should play QI/(D)I(M) first because he can play (D)U(M) and reduce my next play's score. -1
>Michael: EEEU L8 .E +7 492
>Josh: IQ 3I QI +27 399
>Josh:  (EEU) +6 405
