#note Not sure what's right... I missed PRETASTED/DOE, which is good. I should be scoring more here, OIS felt weird. Q says OI making EXON is better, and that I bingo more after it. I simply don't understand that, I must be missing something. Fishing here can't be right, I should just be scoring. I saw DATO, but CEIR didn't seem very nice here. oi/exon and doe and die sim the same, about 3 points about ois.

#note Q likes DEAD/PRETASTED. I'm not sure what's right, I was trying to play tiles to go for S?, cause now acder doesn't do very much.
>Stefan_Rau: BIM 10J MIB +26 339
#note I'm assuming at least S at this point, apparently he had neither ? nor S

#note Apparently this is the top play according to champ, at 2.42% winning. I think I can't win if he plays right, I'm just going for some miracle UNAGILE or something.
