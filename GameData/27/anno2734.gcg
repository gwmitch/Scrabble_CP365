#note He deliberated on the positioning for 2 minutes! Turns out he's wrong even if the dictionary is TWL06.

#note Forgot T[O]AZED F7. Didn't like JAPED E8. Saw DZO moves later, but even DZO doesn't come close to TOAZED. This is the first of many a time when I realized a better move turns later. Was I tired?

#note Wanted to keep ENT but the score was too low to justify it.

#note Best, but gives Pakorn a bingo.

#note He showed me all his tiles whilst trying to maximise score with a bingo in row 11. I asked him why he forwent a bingo, and he told me later that JOTA opens a lucrative row 12 while scoring 30. 30 is above average for this board. After maybe DIASTEm 5C, he allows me to come back with a high-scoring play. Even mISDATE 5B might not prevent a high score from me. Also, there is no guarantee he'll score >30 after his bingo, so JOTA is best.

#note Pakorn wasn't expecting the N. Something along the way was underscored by 10, and I think this is the move.
