#note Boo.  Totally wrong.  Now, let's talk about the English language, shall we.  One cannot be nakeder than naked.  Either you're naked or you're not.  And I have never been one to knead anything.  So to be a NAKEDER KNEADER is not in my lexicon.  What does it say about me that I saw the DAKERHEN that HANKERED and HARKENED, yet didn't play?  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEKNR --  -92 134
