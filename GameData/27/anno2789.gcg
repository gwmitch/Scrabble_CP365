#note 2nd/-0.3 here, BECAP 8H best, but I disagree with AI leave. I wouldn't see BECAP anyway, so it's no loss to me.
>Dewin: AQT 7F QAT +31 31
>Me: ?AAGPTU 9G AG +14 38
#note Best.
>Dewin: HRTW D8 .RWTH +26 57
>Me: ?AEEPTU I9 EPUrATE +65 103
#note 4th/-4.4 here. The choices before CRWTH were PECULATE (PECULATES SPECULATE PECULAED PAEDEUTIC) and PERACUTE. Cheah, who was observing me, saw the former. I saw AMPUTEE (-3) and EPURATE which curiously sim below EPAULET and AUE C11 (-1.7). I don't know why AMPUTEE > EPURATE, but it doesn't matter here.

>Me: DDFJLXY 9B FY.D +18 191
#note 3rd/-1.7 here. I didn't see JEDI K10 because I tend to leave the colourless squares out. FADO L10, which I saw, is 2nd/-0.3. I forgot Y's a vowel, so I went for FYRD for the score.
>Dewin: OW 8A WO +20 166
>Me: ADJLSUX J6 JUDS +33 224
#note 3rd, -7.6 here. I considered only JUDS 13A, which is 4th/-7.1 here, and my move. Didn't see JUDAS I3 and DUX14L (2nd/-7.1). JUDAS is a very good move, then.
>Dewin: AFNO K5 FANO +28 194
>Me: ADLNRVX L11 .X.N +22 246
#note 3rd/-6. I wanted to keep the vowel, so I didn't see almost all the other moves in the top 8. Turns out VAR L4, which blocks and best secures the win after 2 turns, wins the sim easily (quite a duh in retrospect). VALOR L10 is 2nd/-6.4, beating my move by 0.60% in win %.
>Dewin: AEIRZ L1 ZAIRE +53 247
#note I am punished.
>Me: ADEILRV 8J ..VIER +42 288
#note 11th/-43.3. Saw RIVALED/VALIDER but missed the spot! And VIZARD LIZARD ZILA IZARD LAZIED LAZIER VIALED ZEAL! WHAT WAS I THINKING?!
>Dewin: BEGIO 14B BOGIE +24 271
>Me: ADDGIKL M1 ADD +30 318
#note 6th/-6.2. I saw GADID/KADI 15A in addition to this. I wanted to block, so I sacrificed score. Turns out the best move is an even better blocking move, GLADDIE N2. I didn't notice Dewin is catching me up. GLAIK 2J (-0.6), GADID 15A (+0.3), ZILA 1L (-5.8), KADI 15A (-5) are all better.
>Dewin: MOT 15A TOM +23 294
>Me: AEGIIKL 11B KA.I +16 334
#note 9th/-6.1. GUINEA M10, NAIK 14L (-3.1), KEA 7M (-3.6), KAE 7M (-4.4), KITE 11B (-3.6), KADI 2K (-5.5), ALKIE N4 (-6.3), KA 7M (-6.3) are better. I saw only KADI but decided against it because of 3 unseen Ss.
