#note Scoring is correct. PHENE HYPE BEY all lose.
>Alastair: ?EEIIRR 7G fIERIER +61 61
#note Challenged.
>Me: CEIKPRY J6 P.ICK +29 57
#note Didn't know PIKEY, PICKERY, RICKEY or PRICKY. Forgot RYPECK. Lost 8 equity here.
>Alastair: AFO 6L OAF +18 79
>Me: AAEORUY 8M YAE +24 81
#note The best moves all hook PRICKY except BAYOU/BOYAU. Even YOU beats YAE by 2 points.
>Alastair: AGHINW K9 HAWING +39 118
>Me: AIORTUW L10 WOT +31 112
#note TAUIWI 12H is nice, but sims low. WOT is best.
>Alastair: GINX E8 .XING +26 144
>Me: AGILRUU D10 LUAU +18 130
#note The time pressure is on.
>Alastair: INNOU F8 .UNION +31 175

#note FALL is best.
>Alastair: ?AILORS O7 p.LORIAS +58 233
>Me: DEGINRS 7C GED +27 183
#note I most certainly didn't see NIDERINGS even though I looked. INDEXING, DESEXING and SEXING all beat GED. DEXING* is no good! I was trying to open but didn't realize INDEXING did the job.
>Alastair: EJOS 5K SJOE +44 277
>Me: EINQRST -Q +0 183
#note Time pressure caused me to miss QIS 4J.
>Alastair: MOOS 4I MOOS +36 313
>Me: EINORST 3D NORITES +66 249
#note Missed INSERTION! INDEXING beats the bingos.
>Alastair: CMP E2 C.MP +20 333
>Me: ABDEUVZ 2J DAUBE +32 281
#note DAUBE was challenged.
>Alastair: ATT 1M ATT +15 348
>Me: EERTVYZ H1 VE. +18 299
#note TREZ 1O was blocked. I forgot what I was planning here such that I missed ZYME 4C. Oh yes! I was trying to trap Q.
>Alastair: AQT B6 QAT +38 386
#note Didn't see this spot.
>Me: EEIRTYZ A7 RIZ +49 348
#note Time pressure caused me to miss RITZY. ZYME 4C is the optimal play, though.
