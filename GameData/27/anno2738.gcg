>Me: AEHPUXY 8G HEX +26 26
#note Didn't occur to me that HEAPY was good. I know HEAPIER, so it's kinda embarrassing lol. To make matters worse, I didn't see YEX or PYX. HEX loses 8 equity here.
>GC: ABDUY 7H DAUBY +25 25
>Me: AABDPUY 8L UPBY +42 68
#note I was deliberating between PYA 6I and UPBY. PYA kept ABDU but left the triple open AND provided a high-scoring counter at 5K, so I chose UPBY. 5 equity lost here.
>GC: AEFV 9F FAVE +36 61
>Me: AADEITT 10H ADIT +27 95
#note Lost 0.5 equity here. I can't belive TAD 10G wins though. IDEATA 10C and ADIT are jostling for 2nd place, with ADIT winning. TAD keeping AEIT is horrendous IMO. I have adopted my old strategy of fish fish fish bingo, so AEIT is definitely not ideal for me.
>GC: AIMNOST -AIMNO +0 61
>Me: ?AEERTU N8 .ATElEUR +72 167
#note Didn't see SUBERATE N6 and forgot PERACUTE M8. In any case, BATELEUR is best, so I'll take it.
>GC: ACEINRT 13G CREATIN. +78 139
#note I'm still rusty! I held this play but didn't challenge after listing the 4 anagrams.
>Me: CIMOPWZ 15L WO.M +39 206
#note Missing ZORI is a HUUUUUUGE mistake. I'm still rusty lol! Lost 11 equity here.
>GC: OV J13 .VO +14 153
>Me: CIKMOPZ 12L PO.K +38 244
#note Missed MOZO 15G and didn't know KILP 12K. No matter, as POLK is easily third with 4.3 equity loss. KILP is only 0.5 better.
>GC: FR 15H FR. +18 171
>Me: CEEIMSZ 11D MEZES +41 285
#note I thought MEZES was better than MZEES because of the Z placement! Turns out the alternate-vowel-consonant placement rule is still the one to follow. MEZES is 2 points behind MZEES, and ZEES tops the list a further 2 points ahead. It didn't occur to me to set up. 
>GC: NOS 12C NOS +16 187
>Me: CEILNST 10E LI +24 309
#note Best. Haha.
>GC: GI K5 GI. +12 199
>Me: CEEINST 13B TEC +21 330
#note Was trying to think of GENETICS's anagram to capitalize on the opening. TEC scores while keeping a nice leave, beating all the other 1 or 2-tile fishes.
>GC: EILNOST 5F LENTI.OS +59 258
>GC: EILNOST --  -59 199
#note I challenged IMMEDIATELY. I remember this from the old SA News, when Cheah added a note to Ricky's article saying that the plural is LENTIGENES*. LENTIGENES isn't good now, though. Haha I think I mentioned this when LKB GC and I were mugging during Causeway, but GC apparently forgot! Tsk!
>Me: EHINOSU M8 .HI +23 353
#note I was trying to fish for a bingo. I saw that this rack yielded GINHOUSE hours later, but thankfully it doesn't play. PHI is a horrid fish, but I was tempted by the score. This move loses 4 equity. EAU is far better, but I like the E.
>GC: EILNOST B11 LO. +7 206
#note Wah trying to open. I had to block, but as you will see, I found it tough. I challenged ONOS just to learn it. HAHAHAHA.
>Me: DENORSU A8 NUDE +17 370
#note NUDE loses 8 equity to plays like NOD 14A. OD 14B, UNDO L2, UNAXED I5, UDO L3 rank higher but fail to note the possible bingo with GC's EINST leave. Had I been evil, I would have played OE to deny any sort of bingo. I should have, but nah I am not evil LOL.
>GC: EGINRST B3 STINGER +64 270
#note Only choice. I should have been ebil lol.
>Me: IIORSTW 14A WIT +23 393
#note WIT loses to ROWS TOWS ROW TOW at 14A, IWI A1, WITS 14A amd IWIS A1, in that order. I figured IORS was a nice leave, and I didn't remember my Collins IWI handily. IWI would have been a better fish. I lose 1 equity here.
>GC: ?AAEGIN 3B .AGINAtE +70 340
>Me: AIOOQRS H1 QA. +33 426
#note LOL I impulsively emptied the bag but blocked row 2, so it's not that bad.
>GC: JLR G2 J.RL +20 360
>Me: ADIOORS D2 A.OOD +14 440
#note Once again, I impulsively took the win when ODORS 4D was way better. Heck la, I was lazy and I wouldn't have seen ODORS even if I tried. :D:D I mistracked, too, so I didn't know I gave GC 5 points with his out-play. HAHAHAHA.
>GC: ELNO E5 NOEL +15 375
>GC:  (SIR) +6 381
