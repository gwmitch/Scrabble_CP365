>Jason: EEGIKRT 8H GREEK +30 30
#note Grob and Winter had a long game, and each left the playing room. Carol Rav, Grob's next opponent, sits next to me and watches our game. Little did she know what she was in for.
>Dan_Stock: III -III +0 0
#note During the "director's summit" Saturday night, the NAST was mentioned. "Did Jason ever qualify for that?" Jeff Clark said, grinning, referring to my four close calls without making it. "He must've, he's the second-highest rated player in Michigan," Stocky said. With friends like that... (Actually, I was waiting for them to call me out on my annoyingly bringing up this fact repeatedly. Was afraid they'd gone soft.)
>Jason: AEEIINT I5 INE.TIAE +60 90
#note "Yeah, because Paul Epstein's only had top-10 finishes at Nationals and Ron Hoekstra's only won the Canadian National Championship, while you've won the Burning River Blowout," Pete said. (Another country heard from ... guy outplays me once to go to 3-6 against me and gets lippy.) "And the Fall Fenthion Late Bird, an open, might I add!" I said and laughed. Getting back to the game: Needless to say, I was quite pleased this was unblocked.
>Dan_Stock: ?CELNRT 5E CLaR.NET +86 86
#note Shortly after hitting his clock, Dan commented that he should've gone through the A (CENTR(A)Ls). It would be a mistake that would snowball.
>Jason: EIIRTWY H12 WIRY +51 141
>Dan_Stock: IJO J2 JOI. +27 113
>Jason: AEEILST 14B ATELIE.S +70 211
#note "What'd you have for breakfast?" Carol said. "Actually, I haven't eaten yet," I said. Then I corrected myself. "Luckbox-O's."
>Dan_Stock: ADELMRV D8 MARVEL.D +88 201
#note "Me too," Dan said as he laid this down. Gah!
>Jason: BFOQTYZ 3I B.OZY +44 255
#note First mistake of the game, as I miss Z(O)OTY. (-7.9) 44 tiles played, still no sign of Grob.
>Dan_Stock: FPRU 8A FRU.P +36 237
#note "Only 36," Dan says. These Division 1 scrubs can't score for anything. :)
>Jason: AEFLNQT J10 FEN +35 290
#note We were both cracking up about how the game had progressed. "If I lose this one, I won't mind," I said. "Can I get that in writing?" Carol asked. "Then by all means, lose!" Dan said.
>Dan_Stock: INO 4L ION +35 272
#note More than halfway done (54 tiles played), still no Grob. Of course, not that much time has elapsed, as we're plopping down these mindless high-scoring plays quickly.
>Jason: AEILQST 15A QAI. +46 336
#note My semi-fish for the I pays off. "Where do you go to church, Our Lady of the Balanced Rack?" Carol asked.
>Dan_Stock: AX 7B AX +36 308
#note Dan, go away!
>Jason: ELOSTVW O1 VOWS +38 374
#note Grob arrived and I made sure to play this before he sat down. Then Dan stopped the clock and called George over. Tally: 63 tiles played (27 in the bag), 7 1/2 turns, score 374-308. I had 18:44 left, Dan 19:00+. The table talk kind of stopped there as the board became constricted, play slowed and the game got more serious.
>Dan_Stock: AACGNOU 11A GUA.A +18 326
#note Dan showed this rack to Carol and George while the clock was stopped. GUANACO's an orphan.
>Jason: DEHLTTU 6G HE.T +29 403
#note Damn! Q's pick of TE(N)TH, same spot, would continue my 30+ point scoring streak; instead it ends at eight turns. (-6.2)
>Dan_Stock: ?CDENOO N4 .ONCOdED +64 390
>Dan_Stock: ?CDENOO --  -64 326
#note Good play from Dan. Took a long time debating this; was 90+% sure it was bad, but what if it's good? I could be screwed.
>Jason: ADLMTTU 10B MA.T +26 429
#note FYI, if you read Grob's annotation of his game with Carol, and he talked about the person who also complimented Carol's CONMAN* ... yeah, it was me.
>Dan_Stock: ?CDENOO F2 COO. +12 338
>Jason: DLPRSUU 6A UP +21 450
#note I held so long on NONCODED* Dan took the courtesy draw and showed AEGIOPU before it went back in the bag. Since I drew PU here, I obviously did a half-ass job of mixing. Considered (K)UDUS (best win %); PR(aH)U (best valuation) is cool; didn't know it. (-0.1)
>Dan_Stock: ?BDEN 13G B. +14 352
>Jason: DDHLRSU 12C H.RD +17 467
#note A bunch of better plays. DUDS at 13J leads in valuation. (-33.6)
>Dan_Stock: ?DEIN 9L ID +11 363
>Jason: DILOSTU L3 ...I +13 480
#note I probably should've played from the D to kill that spot, but Q likes this.
>Dan_Stock: ?AEGNOS N7 NOSEGAy +63 426
>Jason: DLNOSTU O12 DOLT +27 507
>Dan_Stock: E 8N .E +6 432
#note Fun, fun game.
