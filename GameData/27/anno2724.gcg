>Jason: AILOOUW 8G WOO +12 12
#note Jason: Exchanging keeping AIL is tops but given that I've seen no blanks and one S my past two games, I'm kind of inclined to agree with pitching it all. (-3.2) Steve: He's left off the T!
>Steve_Grob: EIIJNNX 7I JINNI +38 38
#note Thought briefly about holding on to the -NI on the end, but it's best to play them off since this makes it more likely to cash in with the spider at J6, and it also doesn't give up any easy -s hooks.
>Jason: AEGILSU 9I GUILE +22 34
#note Before the game, I was at 7 wins, Knappster 8.5. So, I went up to him, told him it was official that he'd finish ahead of me and said, "Therefore, I announce my retirement from Scrabble, effective immediately after this tournament." George heard this, came up to me and said: "I didn't see Joey Krafchick on the list for this tournament." Touche, sir. I saw LINGUAES* and UNAGILES* and didn't realize LINGUAE was a double-double. (-6.7)
>Steve_Grob: AEIOOOX 6J XI +52 90
#note Yeah, but what do I do next?
>Jason: ABDOSTT 5K BOT +20 54
#note In hindsight, BOTT to create a juicy -S hook, but it's close. (-0.1)
>Steve_Grob: AEIOOOQ -AAAAAAA +0 90
#note Probably a good thing to draw the Q, since I'm passing this turn anyway.
>Jason: ADDISTU 4L DUAD +24 78
#note Q likes UD(O) at H6 by a bit. (-1.6)
>Steve_Grob: DDELSTY O1 TED.Y +30 120
>Jason: IMPRRST 2K PRIM. +18 96
#note D'oh! -8.5 for missing PRISM at 10F. That will prove costly right about ...
>Steve_Grob: DEFHLLS 10F FLESH +52 172
#note now.
>Jason: ?HRSTTT H10 .TH +10 106
#note If I don't hit here, this puppy's just about over. There are seven plays within three points of each other. (-1.6)
>Steve_Grob: DEILOQR 12H .OLDER +20 192
#note Normally, it would be right to play QI at 9E. But Jason could have a bingo on his rack, given the fishing play on the last turn. This makes it much tougher for him to get something down.
>Jason: ?AARSTT 13B TArTARS +71 177
#note Steve: OK, so maybe I was wrong. Jason: Of the six bingos that play, this is the only one I knew, and it's Q's pick.
>Steve_Grob: EEEGIOQ 11C OGEE +15 207
#note The right idea. No rush to dump the monster as a spot is still guaranteed to be there next time. Plus. . .
>Jason: AEEIIOR 12A AERO +21 198
#note Steve: I might get lucky and draw a U. Jason: Nearly played it at 1H before seeing this. I'll regret making the best play right about...
>Steve_Grob: EFINOQU 1H FIQUE +61 268
#note now.
>Jason: EGIILSS M12 .IG +8 206
#note Jason: Best in percentage, but a slight hit in valuation to (F)IG at H1. (-0.7) Steve: A key play as you'll soon see. It looks to me like Jason is setting up a juicy hook for himself. Why look at all those A's that are left. A's, you say?
>Steve_Grob: ?AENORU 15I OUtEARN +76 344
#note I saw ARENOUs, but wanted him to know I also knew the A hook, and he wasn't going to be able to go there. Jason holds but doesn't challenge, and I catch a break.
>Jason: CEILPSS 2C SPLICES +70 276
#note Jason: OK, I know keeping RIGA* was stupid, but hear me out. I see gobs of bingos here. I don't remember it, but think: "Why would he phony here? Even if he plays up top and I go for 100 on the bottom, which is pretty much a worst-case scenario (SPLICES is 91 down there), he's up by 30, we each have random racks with eight in the bag and he has first crack at row 1 plays. Why would he play anything he wasn't certain of?" So, despite being obligated to challenge given the game situation, I let it go. I also knew SPLICES was low-prob seven ($20) and didn't want to lose the challenge and have him block up top. Can't think that way. Just an inexcusable mistake. Meanwhile, Q likes the 3E placement better. (-0.9) Steve: Would've been worth a tad bit more on row 15. I'll let you do the math.
>Steve_Grob: ACMNRTY 14D MAY +37 381
#note Duck likes (S)MARTY.
>Jason: AKNOVWZ 1A ZOA +38 314
#note OMG, KWANZ(A)! That at least makes him sweat. (-72.4, though I think it can't be that much; esp. given that after KWANZA in this case, Steve bingos out)
>Steve_Grob: ACEINRT C1 ..CERTAIN +76 457
#note Jason: I was super-impressed, less so now that I see C(L)ARINET. "Nines revenge!" I joke, referring to my GE(NE)RATEd that won our game at MM. Beautiful play. Steve: Not too hard of a find, if you've already been looking for a place to play CERTAIN. Quackle certainly isn't impressed with nines, and plays CLARINET instead.
>Jason: BEKNVVW 4A KN.W +32 346
#note Mostly well-played except for the "miss" of KWANZA, but RIGA* sticks with me. (shakes head)
>Steve_Grob: AN 11K AN +12 469
#note And the 2008 tournament year comes to an end!
>Steve_Grob:  (BEVV) +24 493
