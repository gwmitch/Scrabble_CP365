#note this is where using quackle to refine your game comes back to bite you... I should have ran away with this game. fishing is dead, dead wrong.

#note even quackle stops fishing at this point. saw ATONIA and NAOI but not (I)OTA. at this point you almost have to keep fishing cause you have committed yourself to it and there's no way you will not get a bingo for a fourth straight turn leavin AEINT is there?

#note this play really confused me, I couldnt even begin to guess what her leave was.

#note I had come too far to just roll over at this point. Norma has great word knowledge and had proved it during friendly chats and postmortems all weekend. She KNEW this wasn't good, but for some reason she could not bring herself to challenge me. She curled her lips and tapped her pen while I laid it down and announced the score, but I was very careful not to give away I knew it wasnt good by fast bagging or anything, and she didn't even hold.

#note the P eliminated one of the three possible letters left that she needed to bingo (CPP) so I wanted to keep it that way and not open any more lanes
>Norma_Marshall: IX G3 XI +36 304
#note this made it so she didnt need to bingo to win and I started getting very nervous
>Max_Karten: AAEIRRV A8 .AIR +10 359
#note my other choice was RA(RE)R but after she made the XI play I did not want to let her tie it with JANE, JOLE, etc on the tws... getting more nervous
>Norma_Marshall: AKN H6 AK.N +14 318
>Max_Karten: AEOPRRV 3E V.. +13 372
#note wanted to hide that I had the other P so she thought there was still a chance for her to get it
>Norma_Marshall: IJNSU 2H INJU..S +60 378
#note getting VERY nervous at this point
>Max_Karten: ABEOPRR 1G APO +29 401
#note of all the three letter choices that scored the same, I saw this left me with an out, and I also mistracked and had her having CDEG left so i THOUGHT this play won. I was not thinking that this lost, and I also was not thinking that APO was new and might get a challenge...
>Norma_Marshall: CDEO -  +0 378
#note she insta-challenged. it helped she had about a minute left on her clock, because if she had taken the time to do the math she would have known that even if I had all 1 point tiles left, CODE/MYC wins. Finally, someone else makes a mistake, and this allowed me to have the two game playoff that let me win the tournament. If she wins this game she gets the two game playoff and I most likely get 3rd place instead of 1st. As soon as we sat back down she realized what happened, and because she is a MUCH better sport than me said "at least I know I could have won, that's good enough for me." I would have flipped the board and left the tournament, without question. APO IS MY NEW FAVORITE WORD!
