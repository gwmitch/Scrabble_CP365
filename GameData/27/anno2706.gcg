#note I almost played IGG or IGGED here, both better. DOGGIE 10D is the best play, should have seen that.

#note A lazy play I made because we're just playing a casual game. Several ones are better. But given what happened next, I'm glad I did it. I think any bingo here is a great play, but I like Kitty's the best (see next frame).

#note Great play, Kitty! (For the stars in the room, find another way to score over 100. Not me. I probably play SPICY because I'm not good. Way to go, red haired girl!)
