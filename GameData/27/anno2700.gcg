#note No N for CONJOINT. :/
>Tim_Michaels: EKL 9G LEK +19 45
>Ryan_Fischer: ACIINOT D8 .ACTION +24 50
#note Blocked ACTINOID/DIATONIC, too!  (F)ACTION is way down on the list, the Quackster recommending fishing off the I, or maybe OI.
>Tim_Michaels: TUU 11B TU.U +8 53
>Ryan_Fischer: EFGILLO 14B GO.IF +34 84
#note Best.

#note Best, though hesitant to keep the LL.
>Tim_Michaels: IMSW 10G SWIM +31 107
>Ryan_Fischer: EELLOQR H14 Q. +11 123
#note ROLE 11I 19 is another option, but I don't like dangling an E like that, beside the DWS no less.
>Tim_Michaels: AENOSTU 11I SOUTANE +75 182
#note But ROLE woulda blocked, at least.
>Ryan_Fischer: EELLNOR 6F .ELLO +14 137
#note Missed ENROLLEE.  Oops.  Only saw the D/R ending.
>Tim_Michaels: ?DEIINT 5I EDITIoN +69 251
#note He took several minutes trying to find a 3x3.  There are none.  But he didn't play on the triple either, oddly.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEENRV O1 RAVE. +27 164
#note Best.
>Tim_Michaels: ANRWY O7 YAWN.R +39 290
#note WANEY's a little better.
>Ryan_Fischer: AABEGNR L1 BEGA. +22 186
#note Fish off AB N1 18, try to get back in it.
>Tim_Michaels: EZ 2J ZE. +32 322
>Ryan_Fischer: AHHINRT N1 AH +22 208
#note Was mistaken in thinking I couldn't get rid of both aitches in this unfortunate draw.  HAH 12K 32, though it kills a couple lanes. 
>Tim_Michaels: DINV M9 VI.ND +26 348
#note Woula blocked that play, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: EHINRRT E7 H.R +13 221
#note R(A)H kills the T lane; bad idea.
>Tim_Michaels: AOP N7 APO +23 371
>Ryan_Fischer: EINRSTX 13C ..X +21 242
#note Scrabble gods are funny peeps.  Fish off the X to EINRST, and draw...
>Tim_Michaels: DELORRU 4D LOURED +20 391
#note The blank!  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EINRST B4 INTEReS. +61 303
#note Makes it a little bit more respectable.  Maybe I play ROLE instead of Q(I) and I have a chance.  Who knows.
