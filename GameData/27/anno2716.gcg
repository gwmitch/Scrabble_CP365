#note my most embarrasing moment of the tourney.  I learned ACEINORT as one of like 20 8's i studied before the new dictionary.  I knew I was playing a phoney, and I was missing the legal play, which hit me as I was walking to the challenge computer.

#note problem 1- I've mistracked.  problem 2- I don't realize I've mistracked.  AXED in M10 wins the most.  I am thinking she'll have some trouble going out, as I have an extra  D, and no T in the unseen.

>Pete: AELOX 2L OX +19 408
#note AXE g4 salvages a 6 point loss, if she finds the right play, or a win if she doesn't.  I didn't think she had an out, as my tracking was wrong, and i was short on time.  idiot me.  I though I was cute setting up AXILE for my out.
