#note P(I)X at 10D scores almost as much and is a superior leave. (-4.1)
>Joel_Sherman: ADISY 12B DAISY +35 139
>Jason: EEHSTTT 5G TEETH +31 102
#note Hey, didn't I play this vs. Mallick? :) Unlike against him, this time I'm aware of the -E hook. Q likes TET or TETH, same spot, better. (-3.0)
>Joel_Sherman: EORU 4H ROUE +25 164
>Jason: FIOOSST B10 FI.OS +34 136
#note Wasn't 100%, but since it's good, clearly best.
>Joel_Sherman: ABINU A7 NUBIA +28 192
>Jason: LOOSTVW A13 WOT +25 161
#note Angered by my inability to play VOLOST anywhere, I blunder. Being a huge S-hog at the time, I refuse to play VOWS at L1 for 38. (-11.3)
>Joel_Sherman: CEIKOO B2 COOKIE +30 222
>Jason: ADLOSSV 10D D.VA +16 177
#note Again, AVOS or LAVS at L1. (-7.5)

#note Went "hey, BROWNISH - B. Hey, wait, didn't I just slot a B in the triple lane. (looks at the board) Wowza! Stay open, stay open, stay open..." OK, if he's missed his fish...
>Joel_Sherman: AEGINRV 14H VINEGAR. +78 350
#note Hmph. And without the case blank. But wait!
>Jason: CDEIJNU H12 JI.E +66 372
#note OK, can he duck it on his seven-tile pick (yes) and I get it on my three-tile pick (no)?
>Joel_Sherman: EFIN C3 NEIF +31 381
#note Beautiful. Joel told me that after this he (deservedly, IMO) picked the blank.
>Jason: CDELNTU 5B ..LT +16 388
#note My pre-endgame's crappy, and Joel and I went over this play post-game for at least five minutes. I remember CP put this second (behind C(OE)D ... can't remember if I saw it over the board). Sim puts these two very close, this gettign a slight edge. The summary was: Given what's in the bag, I had almost no shot no matter what I did. T(O)ED at N7 has the highest valuation, 28.5 ahead of this.

#note Missed CY(G)N(E)T. (-8.0)

#note Good game. But what would've happened if I hadn't been so attached to S's?
