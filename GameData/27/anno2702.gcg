>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEJNU 8D JAUNCED +100 100
#note Hmm... if I there were an I, I'd have JAUNDICE... er... WAITTAMINUTE!
>Martin_Weisskopf: AEORRST -  +0 0
#note Count it!  (I love power words!)
>Ryan_Fischer: AFIMPQR E7 F.QIR +34 134
#note Here or horizontal.  Here's better, I think.  Either way, he's got a response.
>Martin_Weisskopf: AEORRST 12B ROASTER +84 84
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ALMOPX 13F OX +36 170
#note Missed PrOX(I)MAL.  Even if I saw it, I think I'd play OX anyway.  I DID, however, see SMALLPOX.  Do I get points for that?  No?  Okay then.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ABEG B10 BA.GE +28 112
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADLMNP I2 NAPaLM.D +68 238
#note Whee!  Er, BOMBS AWAY!  Or something.  :)  (Also EMPLANED)
>Martin_Weisskopf: ILO H12 .OIL +22 134
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEHIKL H1 LEK +29 267
#note Missed BELIKE/BARGEE.  Yup, BARGEE!
>Martin_Weisskopf: GNRTU 15A GRUNT +30 164
#note But NO BARGER.  A barge is a ship, duh.
>Ryan_Fischer: BCEHIIY 11H BICE +23 290
#note Ugh, took a long time here.  BICE is so mediocre it hurts.  Gives him an easy hook, too.  First glance, BEY J3 25, but that gives a couple nice counters too.  (G)IB 13B 20 is interesting, as is HY(EN)IC 2F 24.  Oh well.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?AEINNS L9 INSANEr +71 235
#note Bleh.  He'd have tons of stuff anyway, no real harm there.
>Ryan_Fischer: AHINOTY 14J HY.NA +38 328
#note I played too fast.  It's a nice find, but YAH(O)O is the star play, and HOYA, which I DID see but passed up, is better too.
>Martin_Weisskopf: EFSU O12 FUSE +45 280
#note That's why HYENA was weak.
>Ryan_Fischer: AHIIOTV A7 OHIA +25 353
#note VITA instead.
>Martin_Weisskopf: EIOWY B4 YOWIE +26 306
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIMPTV A1 IDEM +40 393
#note He remarked that I always had an answer this game.  Maybe so, but if my answers are JAUNCED, NAPALMED, HYENA, and IDEM, rather than RETSINA and the like, I'll take it.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ADEOTUV 6F OVU.ATED +66 372
#note Nicest guy, but he complained about the tiles right before he put this down.  And I'm wondering what he's complaining about.  Pet peeve of mine, y'know?  VAMPED, which I woulda played instead of IDEM before he played YOWIE, woulda blocked OVU(L)ATED, too!
>Ryan_Fischer: EPRRTTV L3 REV.T +16 409
#note I was very happy with this play as it accomplishes a few key things.  Takes last scoring lane, pretty much, gets rid of the junk, and leaves one in the bag.  Sure, I leave the possibility of SIZE down below, but if he doesn't have it, he might have GROSZ or something, which would give me a counter.  (O)VERT isn't quite right IMO because then that E and D are left open for scoring, as is the KA for KAZOOS or something.
>Martin_Weisskopf: L 11B .L +4 376
>Ryan_Fischer: AIOPRTW 14E AW +29 438
#note I don't know why he fished off the L.  Can't figure out what he was trying to pull.  I was fixated on AW for a while, so I took it.  WOP might be a little better, in that I can go out next.
>Martin_Weisskopf: EGIOSTZ 10D S.ZE +33 409
>Ryan_Fischer: IOPRT K1 TROP +12 450
>Martin_Weisskopf: GIOT -  +0 409
#note He challenges, so it balances out.
>Ryan_Fischer: I 12N I. +5 455
#note Low on time (seriously, like 5 seconds left), I miss the better out, of AID or PIPE.
>Ryan_Fischer:  (GIOT) +10 465
