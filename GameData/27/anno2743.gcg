#note No surprise that QI wins. Even FA 9F is 1.5 points below.

#note Overscored by 2.

>Me: EEINSTT 10B TE +18 168
#note The beginning of the end. Fishing is okay but I didn't open, and Cheah noted that. For reasons I don't know, ET D3 beats TE by 1 point.
>Cheah: MUY D2 YUM +30 200
>Me: EEINRST H3 E. +2 170
#note EL guarantees a bingo but not a spot. I lose 10 equity with this. NE 6L wins because it opens?
>Cheah: EK H1 KE.. +24 224
>Me: EINNRST C1 INN +17 187
#note Fishing EN 3H is best. I lose 9 equity here.
>Cheah: DEEL M2 EL..ED +22 246
>Me: EORSTTW 3G T.W +24 211
#note I was going to try SWOTTER if not for ELOPED. TEW is the best fish this time.

#note EX is telegraphing an O, so I had to block. HM A1 is best, and I sacrifice 10 equity to block with the 2nd best move.
>Cheah: PU A1 UP +21 336
#note He takes my spot.
>Me: EEIMNRT F9 ..M +6 314
#note GUM was an effort to control the board after the last P was used, because I'd have a counter-bingo to his. I didn't see that it was harder to bingo with ZAGS than GUM. I lose 17 equity here, but it doesn't matter.
>Cheah: AN G5 NA +10 346
>Me: EEEINRT 1N EE +8 322
#note I wanted to try WHOOPEE which Cheah later told me was good. I didn't know WHOOPER, though.
>Cheah: ?AEEORT 12D ROsEATE +70 416
>Me: EFINRTV H11 F.VER +33 355
#note Impulsively emptying the bag is right.
>Cheah: ABIINOR 11H .IBROIN +30 446
#note FINI 11H is the right move.
>Me: CILNRTV M10 V.NIC +20 375
