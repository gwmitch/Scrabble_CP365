>David_Gibson: BEUZ 8G ZEBU +30 30
#note Mental note, he slots it before the DWS column instead of allowing his opponent to play down from the Z.  I always thought the opposite was better.
>Ryan_Fischer: AACOOPR 9C COPRA +25 25
#note Wasn't sure about it.  Probably not smartest to take that risk, but my other options weren't pretty.
>David_Gibson: INPY 10G PINY +31 61
#note Phew, it's good.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEIOSS 11E OES +21 46
#note Better is AIS, I think.  Blanked on that option, trying to get rid of the O and A.
>David_Gibson: EEGNRT 12A GERENT +22 83
>Ryan_Fischer: AAIIJLS K4 JAILS +40 86
#note Best.
>David_Gibson: EE 4K .EE +20 103
#note Wonder what he's up to?
>Ryan_Fischer: AIILSTV H1 VITALIS. +86 172
#note Phew.  Best and only.  Took me a while to find this.  I didn't recognize the alphagram, though I probably HAVE been in that neighborhood.  Took a bit of extra effort to pull it out.  Way different ballgame if I don't.
>David_Gibson: ?AEFRUY N1 FEUdARY +88 191
#note Ah, all clear now!  Betting he drew FY, though I forgot to ask.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADNORU O7 AgROUND +79 251
#note Best.  He told me there were two plays through the G, but neither played (GOURMAND and RIGAUDON).
>David_Gibson: AHT 1L HA.T +42 233
>Ryan_Fischer: ADILNOT 2C DILAT.ON +63 314
#note Missing DALTONI(C) -- oops.  Now I have another word to relate it to so it'll be easier next time.  Not the first time that/ANTICOLD has come up for me.
>David_Gibson: OW N9 OW +28 261
>Ryan_Fischer: EIILMOQ 6J Q. +31 345
>David_Gibson: ABCR 1A CRAB +43 304
#note Hence why the best play is called "Best."  Leads to less comebacks most of the time.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIILMO 13J MOILE. +18 363
#note Trying to close it down, eat up some tiles.
>David_Gibson: NO 3C ON +17 321
#note Don't know what he's up to, but something's fishy.  This sets me up, so I'm wondering how right it could be.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEISVW 4A VISED +43 406
#note VIEWED opens the 3x3 (though I didn't even bother looking at that spot).  If I'd've played WISED, I'd have WAXED in the endgame.  I think in hindsight it's still safer to take the W to the end than the V.
>David_Gibson: FO 14M OF +22 343
#note Nice last-ditch setup.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGGMTW 15J TEGG +12 418
#note Trying to block.  The BEST block here is GAME 14H.  Why?  No Os left.  I wanted to play GEEGAW, but that woulda emptied the bag.
>David_Gibson: EHIKNRT 14E THINKER +84 427
#note Nice fit!  He laughed, telling me he drew HK to EINRT!
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIMWX H12 MI.X +48 466
#note Best, and only win.
>David_Gibson: U I8 .U. +6 433
#note Wow, I did it.  Didn't make the best play every turn, but damn near close!  Yeah, the bingo/bango/bongo was incredibly lucky.  VITALISE is the hardest one, so if I don't find that and he gets down FEUdARY, I'm screwed.  Whatta game.
