>Chad_Harris: CKRTU 8H TRUCK +32 32
#note He's all, like, okay, "don't stick an -ING on it!"
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGPSVY J7 G.V +7 7
#note Too bad I didn't know it takes an -AGE.  Hehe.  CAVY is much better.  I don't know what my logic was in playing GUV.  Temporary brain freeze, except for setting up my S and not giving an H or G hook.
>Chad_Harris: IQ 9G QI +23 55
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEPSTY M8 SPAYED +42 49
>Chad_Harris: HOW L10 HOW +38 93
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIMNT 10F MINI +26 75
#note No place for INTIMAE, this is okay.
>Chad_Harris: IIUUU -UUUII +0 93
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGOORT K10 AGO +34 109
#note AGOROT is a little too aggressive, but who knows if that's better.
>Chad_Harris: CRTU L4 TRUC. +22 115
#note You get extra points for playing the same word twice.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIOORT 11E OE +8 117
>Chad_Harris: ?AEIINT 5E dAINTIE. +78 193
#note Boo.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIORTU D6 OUTRIDE +72 189
#note Yay!
>Chad_Harris: ALLO 4E OLLA +13 206
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEIINV 8A BIN. +18 207
#note The better play, BAI(T), prevents him from bingoing... like 3 turns later.
>Chad_Harris: L 12J L... +7 213
#note "He hates Ls."
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEINSV 6F VEE +34 241
#note Whee.
>Chad_Harris: ADEHNRT B2 ANTHER.D +78 291
#note Yeah, that's the one.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADINRSS H1 INS... +18 259
#note This is actually a decent play, though deceptive in its dumping of the S.  I have to open, try to breathe some life into this board.  The scoring plays kill the board or open bad spots, and the downside of INS(ANE) is it kills the S hook for TRUCK.
>Chad_Harris: FU 2F FU. +14 305
#note That was no fun.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABDJORS 2A J.B +12 271
#note Pretty horrible dump, but I have no choice if I want to get back in the game.
>Chad_Harris: EZ J12 .EZ +32 337
>Ryan_Fischer: ADORSXY 3A O.YX +51 322
#note Luckily it pays off.  No open N for SARDONYX, but I'll take this!  :)
>Chad_Harris: OPW 12F WOP +19 356
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIMRS 13G MAD. +23 345
#note Missed SEMIARID (kept wanting to say MISAIRED).  Seen it before, not 100% obviously.  But if I take the bingo now, I'm wondering how likely it is he outruns me with his own.
>Chad_Harris: ?AEENOR A8 .EmOANER +83 439
#note He reasoned he had to play a bingo to win.  I was like, why not block MY bingo spot, and just play out the endgame?
>Chad_Harris: ?AEENOR --  -83 356
>Ryan_Fischer: EFILRSS 7F EF +27 372
#note Not there yet, but this sure gets me closer, actually pulling ahead.
>Chad_Harris: ?AEENOR A8 .EAcONER +83 439
#note Again, AE woulda blocked just fine.
>Chad_Harris: ?AEENOR --  -83 356
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILRSS 14B AIRLESS +78 450
#note Phew.
>Chad_Harris: ?AEENOR 13B NA +10 366
#note Low on time, hard for him to find the best sequence.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGT 1C AG +13 463
#note I miss (S)TAG to go out, too.  Also misinform him that PAS doesn't take an E.  Oops, it does!  Hehe.
