>Harriet_Lakernick: DINQSUV 8G QI +22 22
>Pete: AACLRTU G8 .AT +13 13
#note While QUA and QUART are better equity plays, I don't feel like being quite so hook friendly when she played a 2 tile opening play.
>Harriet_Lakernick: ACINU F10 UNCIA +15 37
>Pete: ACLRSTU 15D CULTS +38 51
#note Missed all the bingoes.  Shoulda seen CURTAILS/RUSTICAL, didn't know CURTALS/CRUSTAL.  CULTS worked out well, tho.
>Harriet_Lakernick: AINP E8 PINA +19 56
>Pete: AEHMRSY D11 MY +19 70
#note best.  I was afraid I was missing something cool, but this is it.
>Harriet_Lakernick: AOT 12F .OAT +7 63
>Pete: AEHIORS J10 HAIR +22 92
#note Duck tended to be fishier here and it is probably right.  I was hung up on what appeared to be an obvious setup for an I.  OH D8 and HAO 13H are best.
>Harriet_Lakernick: EO K10 OE +13 76
>Pete: EHIJOSZ I9 JO +23 115
#note doesn't the bag realize I'm trying to bingo here?  Blank on SHOJI.  My play is second best, a ways back... I was in the bingo mindset.
>Harriet_Lakernick: ENOW 13J .EWON +16 92
>Pete: DEHISSZ N10 ZEI.S +68 183
#note Not even I would miss this one.  best by far.
>Harriet_Lakernick: AX O10 AX +29 121
>Pete: ADEHSTV 12M H.E +23 206
#note Was not going to permit a cheap extension of AX there.  Duck's best plays are all fishes... with 8 E's unseen, I feell ok with this leave.
>Harriet_Lakernick: EGR 14K REG. +19 140
>Pete: ?ADFSTV 15J VAT +17 223
#note I still feel like I'm down... the game has been far less open than I prefer, and I keep missing on my draws. DIF wins, VAT is well back.
>Harriet_Lakernick: ADEIU 7H ADIEU +10 150
>Pete: ?ADFLMS K5 FL.D +16 239
#note wanted to kill the spot at 8L, since I couldn't use it well without burning the S.  MALFED and FLAMED all are better ways to do that,
>Harriet_Lakernick: BOW C12 BOW +23 173
>Pete: ?FIMOST M1 FOMITeS +82 321
#note best.  COMFITS in the same place only other playable, which is the better play, but I was hoping to draw a challenge.  oh well.
>Harriet_Lakernick: DEEK J2 DEKE +18 191
>Pete: EIINOOR N2 ION +16 337
#note A solid play here.  INFER makes sense here too.
>Harriet_Lakernick: EGLNNPR 4L P..G +18 209
>Pete: ?EIORRT D3 pRERIOT +71 408
#note This and its anagram are best.  I picked this one because it was the new one, and I thought it might, just maybe, draw a challenge.
>Harriet_Lakernick: ELNNRUY -  +0 209
#note Which it did.
>Pete: DEELNRU 5A UNR.ELED +68 476
#note Somehow, I felt safe flirting with danger here.  199 point leads do that.
>Harriet_Lakernick: AEGNRSV B1 VEGA.S +24 233
>Pete: BLY 1M .LY +31 507
#note best.  No outs on this board.
