#note when she did this she debated putting the E down for about a minute after she put down the MA, I wasnt sure why she was closing one of her best lanes, but I figured she had ES? as a result 
>Max_Karten: DEHIRSV -  +0 280
#note this was the play that would have made me quit playing scrabble if I had not won this tournament. I looked for about two minutes, and concluded that she had three lanes. In row 2 it would have to end in E, in column e it would also have to end in E. The third lane was column A ending in -ING obviously. Also, there were 8 tiles left, not 10, the C and R were not there so it was BDEFIMO?. I concluded that she was probably going to bingo, or fish off one of the three BFM tiles, and I would need to leave the one tile in the bag so I had a play to come back with making SWOP, SHIVERED, or a play across row 1 to the tws or I would block whatever lanes were left after her fishing play... so I PASSED leaving 6 minutes on the clock for the end game. I didnt take the time to figure out that she couldnt possibly have an -ING word with what was left and I did not even see VIDE/WE would have won the game. I have never been so upset during a tournament game as after she made her next play...

#note remember, only F was left, not CFR, not really sure if those tiles were missing or played on plays I missed recording. Almost positive it was a full set of tiles.
