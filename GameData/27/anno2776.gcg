#note When you're down, the rash thing to do is bounce back right away. This is why people who've just lost a big hand at poker loosen up. Although I've never played John before, I have enough respect for him that I'm not going to try BOTANICS*. I considered it, but by then it was too late. If I was gonna do it, I should have done it immediately after he bingoed, without hesitation.

>Carl: ADEOOSS J6 DOS +31 255
#note One of a scarce few times when a word I didn't know would turn out to be the best play. OARS 9F is best, but I didn't know SHELVING to be a noun.
>John_O: ?AINNRR 14B bRANNI.R +68 308
>Carl: AADEEOS G7 A.O +17 272
#note Some frustrating racks. This time ARSE 9G is best.
>John_O: EIQUV C9 QUIVE. +56 364
>Carl: ADEEESY 15H .EADEYES +94 366
#note I cussed aloud when he played QUIVER, and right before I was about to play DEY 15A, I saw the bingo. Then I felt dumb for getting worked up.

>Carl: EEGLOUW 12A WO.E +28 444
#note I spent a long time on this. I looked at WOEFUL 10J and WOE L9. The K is dangerous no matter what I do. WEEL 9L looks like it wins most often, but it's an interesting position nonetheless.
>John_O: AEHP L9 HEAP +33 449
>Carl: EGIKLU 5C KLUGE +28 472
#note Arrgh! What the hell is wrong with me? How is it I missed GLEEK N2? And that would still have been the wrong play. QI is best, because it blocks his only out. Then I get either KLUGE or GLEEK next turn. It's like my endgame got progressively worse throughout the tournament.
