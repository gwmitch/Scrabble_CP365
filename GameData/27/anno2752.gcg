#note Maybe just I'm dopey, but I think these are some of the toughest racks in the game (although it looks pretty easy in Collins). Didn't really care for JEZaIL. I don't get why JILT would be preferable here, as it seems like the ?Z combo wants a little more help than a stray E. I liked JET because most counterplays will take the JETE hook, leaving me more likely than usual to hit my -IZE draws to the triple. I'm probably overrating the likelyhood of hitting those, though.
