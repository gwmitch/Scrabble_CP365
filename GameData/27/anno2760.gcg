#note I was happy to see this opening play go down, as the only tile I'd looked at so far was the Q.
>Jason: ??EEILQ F6 EQ.aLIzE +69 69
#note I remember seeing EQuI(N)ELy and thinking "that can't possibly be good!" Note: When playing 1900s, passing on 110-point plays isn't the best of ideas. (-41.4)
>Joey_Mallick: OSVW I5 VOWS +24 52
>Jason: BDEGNUY 14F DUNGY +43 112
#note So excited to be able to use the lucrative hook first, I didn't look for a better play after seeing my best play. GUYED, BUNGED and GYBED are clearly better. (-10.6)
>Joey_Mallick: GIP H12 PI.G +30 82
>Jason: ABBEIRU 4H BARBIE +37 149
#note Took a flyer on it. Joel Sherman said it's "new".
>Joey_Mallick: EI G7 I.E +19 101
>Jason: AAOOOUX -AOOOU +0 149
#note I felt like my logic here was sound; instead of playing AX for 38 first and exchanging next turn, I figured his inevitable bingo might give me a bigger X play. But Q, without rack inferences, doesn't recognize my brilliance. :) (-1.1)
>Joey_Mallick: AEINSST K4 .ASINETS +90 191
>Jason: AEEHTXZ E10 AX +38 187
#note Don't know why I didn't play EX. Shortness of E's? (-3.2)
>Joey_Mallick: AFL H1 FLA. +27 218
>Jason: EEHTTTZ M3 T.ETH +24 211
>Joey_Mallick: IM J4 .IM +28 246
>Jason: CDEJRTZ 2H .EZ +32 243
#note Missed J(E)EZ, but against the Mallicks of the world, I'm not opposed to shutting down a bingo line here in a close game, esp. given his last play. (-1.7)
>Joey_Mallick: DDEEFN 6B FEND.D +24 270
>Jason: ACCDJRT 10B JAC.. +30 273
#note I remember taking a long time on this play and being rewarded for my patience by seeing this. So, after the bingo-X play sequence, I'm down four. Next turn, I'm down seven. Next turn, I'm down three. Next turn, I'm up three. This would continue for a couple more turns, and I'm trying to stop the "OMG, I'm hanging with Joey Mallick" thoughts.
>Joey_Mallick: EGO 8M EGO +21 291
>Jason: CDLOORT C2 COOL.D +22 295
#note I probably should've kept blocking with DOR or DO at 9M. Another "whatif" in a game with a few of them. (-2.4)
>Joey_Mallick: EOPRU 2A RE.OUP +32 323
>Jason: AEMRRTW C9 W.RMER +30 325
#note Missed W(O)RM at D1. Hmph. COOLED, WARMER ... I couldn't make up my mind! (-17.8)
>Joey_Mallick: AEHIRTU O5 THI.UREA +62 385
#note (groans)
>Jason: AANOTTY A1 T.AY +33 358
#note "The guy you sound like," Joey said. At dinner that night (just before this round), he said he thinks I sound like Trey Wright. If this is true, Trey has my deepest sympathy. (-0.6)
>Joey_Mallick: AIINOOS 5B O.IO +21 406
#note No surprise, best.
>Jason: ANOTV N12 NOVA +16 374
#note Best.
>Joey_Mallick: AINS N1 ANIS +21 427
#note A little disappointing because I probably should've won. But hey! A fun game with a couple lessons thrown in.
