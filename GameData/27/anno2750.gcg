#note in hindsight, FORA is great because there is no way he knows the only hooks are M and Y. have to play down to opponent's level, have to play down to opponent's level.

#note if you have never felt the feeling of knowing you will start a tournament you have been planning on for six months 1-3, on the first night where there are only four games, and you are the top seed... well... it sucks!
>Max_Karten: ACLOQRT C7 QA. +22 130
#note the weird thing is i was debating between VI(N)A and QAT/AGAR the play before, but then got all tense and pissed off and forgot about QAT/AGAR while solely focusing on the new hotspot that had been created.

#note w(I)NTRILY would have been epic, much like my failures this first night. I was hoping he wouldnt challenge, and if he did he would open it for INeRTLY, but alas. When he challenged he just hit the middle button on the clock, dumped his rack, and said "Let's Go" while getting up out of the chair. I thought that was pretty badass of him, like something Russell Crowe might do if he played scrabble.

#note play wicked pissed off for two and a half hours straight and you might miss P(O)INTIer too... nah, im probably the only one who has ever missed something that simple.
>Joe_Waldbaum: B 1M B.. +5 239
#note i was hoping this wasnt a sign he had an easy bingo rack and was just waiting for me to drop my 60 pointer to make an 8...

>Max_Karten: EHOORUZ 14H OOH +32 286
#note the fact he held this play just pissed me off more. like exponetially more...
>Joe_Waldbaum: AEM 13I MAE +23 354
>Max_Karten: EERTUWZ 12D W.Z +30 316
#note he made like a whistling noise here implying this was like a monster play... pissed off level going through the roof. the only thing keeping me from flipping the board over was that he was leaving a spot open for me to play the X for 52 and actually still be able to win. I'm still wondering whether or not he knew that spot was there...

#note i mistracked from being too pissed off and i cant make sense of the rest of the scoresheet, pretty sure the MAE play was something else too, final score was recorded as 458-405, not sure how though
