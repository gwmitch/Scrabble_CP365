#note: I saw the word immediately, but then spent extra time to try to find something that didn't put anything on the triple lane. Then I figured out that at this point I might be able to survive a 3x3.

#note: He held, didn't find a 3x3, then challenged.

#note: Quackle suggested H10 SEGUED. I don't like opening that lane down there. I like Quackle's third suggestion, 15E SWEDE, much better, but didn't see it.

#note: I meant to play 2M DUG, but put down GUD* instead. When he challenged, he was going to just have me pick it up, but then he changed his mind and had someone come over to adjudicate. Can't blame him - His clock had less than 30 seconds left, why not get some extra thinking time?
