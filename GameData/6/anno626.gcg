>JH: AAEKMST 8G KA +12 12
#note KAMES or SAMEK are very close.  Championship kibitzer very slightly prefers KA.  I do too on the opening move, especially against someone who has less bingo power.

#note not the best placement.  Scores not as much.  Boo me.

>JH: GIILOTZ K4 GLITZ.. +36 122
#note I think this is best, as does Quackle.
>John: EIPRRST M2 STRIPER. +72 87
>JH: AAGINOY 7F YOGA +22 144
#note I think again best with a meh rack.

#note Unfortunately this is EVOCATE#.  During the game I was more concerned with GLITZED. :)

#note LIFE is a decent leave from this rack and it scores not so bad.  Quackle also prefers this.

#note Grr.  If he'd have played the better play and put QI where it didn't block bingo lines for a miracle comeback for him I'd have C(A)LDRoNS.  The computer prefers something keeping CRS?.  I don't think this move was horrid, but maybe was a bit suboptimal.  Nothing to get in a huge twist over.

#note lots of only bingos in this game.

>JH: EFPRUUY F10 Y.U +14 518
#note a big miss.  b10 PENURY 34 is clearly best.  Dorky move.
>John: BDO 10B BOD +23 300
>JH: BEEFPRU 13B EF +22 540
#note it's 540 to 300; gotta try for the stratosphere and fish. :)
>John: ?GINOTU 13K TING. +12 312
#note missing NOnGUI(L)T.  A tough find if you haven't studied it.  
>JH: ABEOPRU 1B POURAB.E +63 603
>JH:  (?OU) +4 607
#note Whee!  Aside from the # word and PENURY, not a bad game.
