>Edward_S._De_Guzman: CDEFORU 10D CURF. +15 15
#note Whoops--I can explain.  XP was talking about a game where he played CURF setting up the S back hook.  I didn't know SCURF so I looked it up and saw that SCURFY was good.  Then by weak logic, I assumed that CURFY must be good.

#note I was very surprised to draw both blanks this late in the game.  With tons of time left I try to find something (like L9 BIOPICS 73) but fail.

#note *sigh*.  Giving me the E, there are lots of words that I've seen before but I can't seem to find anything.  The frustration from the previous turn seriously hampered my anagramming skills this turn.  with time dwindling I make a move and hope for the best.
