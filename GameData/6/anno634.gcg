#note grrrrr....I have taken enough physics/applied math/engineering courses to rationalize OVERDAMP* being good.  Sam later said he was also unsure but thought of the word in an engineering context.

#note QMeister likes 2J MOVER 32 or the slightly more defensive 2J VOMER 36.

#note it's hard for me to remember why I did this.  QMeister likes 4J REGS 18.  I think I was scared of drawing the Q again if I threw it back.  I was also hoping for a big Q play from 8A or 15H.

#note at this point I'm going to need a bingo-like score to get back in the game.  So I set myself up for a big Q play.
>SK: DEGLNRR K2 ........ED +36 457
#note grrrrr....I held for a while.  The only way I could possibly win is if OVERDAMPED* is no good.  I have a 60 point Q play, keeping the blank for the endgame.  So I should have challenged.  But then I thought of the last round, a big loss, and wanted to avoid another one.  So I essentially conceded the game, with my new goal being to minimize spread loss.  Lame.
