>Edward_S._De_Guzman: EEINRSY M2 YE +21 233
#note I saw the bingo B5 SERENITY 65 but decided to fish again because it opened up too many hot spots.  I rarely pass up the bingo but given what was still in the bag, I was too scared of the comeback play.

>Edward_S._De_Guzman: ENNTTTU G5 TEN +12 353
#note not sure about what to do here.  I'm not going to score major points here, so I wanted to minimize the chance of a scoring play coming down from E4 or E5.  and i wanted to dump an N and at least one T.  quackle likes 4A HENT 14.

>Edward_S._De_Guzman: AENSTTU 3E ATTUNES +64 417
