#note The awkward racks continue, but at least I was scoring pretty well. Probably PELF (G4,25) is better here.

#note The triple was a smokescreen - Row 11 was the line to worry about. Actually, PIE (11D,15) looks to be a better block, winning 4 out of 8 cases, but it would have lost to AURIStS as it turned out.
