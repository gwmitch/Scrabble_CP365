#note MEW (7F,21) probably would have been a better choice.
>JE: ACMO C2 COMA +32 44
>Bing: DGNOTTZ F7 G.NZO +35 59
#note Not quite: DITZ (F7,34) keeps a more balanced leave, and is better defensively.
>JE: AERSTTW I8 SWATTER +71 115
>Bing: ADDORTT B3 DATTO +23 82
#note DOAT (J10,22) was another possibility, but I think my play was fine.

#note Strangely with the 2 blanks, there were no higher-scoring bingos. BOaRDmEN (13C) would have been slightly better to avoid setting up the triple.
>JE: EHNO O1 HONE +33 327

#note Probably YEA here instead for 3 points less; 4 vowel leaves are always a bad idea, especially going into a tight endgame.
>JE: AY 14M .YA +29 356
>Bing: ADEEIRU E11 DUE +14 344
#note This was a tough decision. I could score a few more points with ADIEU (B10,20) or AIDE (G10,19). Quackle says EAU (J4,11) wins the most (38%, to 31% for DUE), but it seems like that would lose if opponent had the J for a play at E11 (unless I picked some miracle bingo).
