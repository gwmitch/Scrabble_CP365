>skiing4me: BEFIIUV 8G VIBE +18 18
#note This was an enjoyably difficult game :) This is a difficult opening rack. I would have kept B over F with FIVE if I found no better move though. I'd have looked at changing to leave BE or E too, and possibly just gone for it since it's the opening move. In fact Quackle wants to avoid leaving E alone (presumably because of fresh rack bingo chance) and change altogether, or keep EF, but FIVE is perfectly playable since BIU go together.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: EFGJQST K5 JETS +32 32
#note And if her rack was difficult so was mine. My first thought was to look at hooking JETS/FEGS. I also looked at TEF under (IBE) but the score wasn't worth it with SJGQ as a leave. QI alone won't solve my vowel shortage, and anything like FE(E)T just removes useful letters. G(I)FT for 8 doesn't quite seem dynamic enough either, so JETS it was for raw score. I decided that a change wasn't worth it for a couple of practical reasons, though Quackle would keep EST and only JETS has any other value to it.
>skiing4me: AAFGISU J6 FA. +29 47
#note FAA/IF/BA/EA would leave GISU which has synergy. FA(E) is a little loose, because AGISU is a bad leave. Quackle disagrees - I guess it's a case of, for me AGISU would be bad, for her it's fine. Of course, FIE is also playable, and is better simply by the possibility to avoid duplicate I.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: FGIOOQS L4 FOG +30 62
#note FOG came to me pretty quickly. QI was never a starter when I considered that FOG scores so much that the one-turn Q stick is overriden, because even if she counterladders I might get a high scoring Q word down the M file.
>skiing4me: AGILSUW M3 WAG +30 77
#note If only WALUIGIS was a valid move, that would be hilarious. WAUL would be ideal but there is no good place for it. So WAG it is. GAW scores slightly higher.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: INOQRSU 2M SUQ +32 94
#note I took seven minutes here because it was a difficult position that needed a strategic answer. I've been stuck with the Q all game so it's time to dump. I could play QUOINS/SWAG for 25, which removes the potential duplicate I, but puts the Q in front of the TWS. QUOIN through the I doesn't solve anything (the goal of that move was to avoid duplicate I), so I looked also at playing SWAG/SUQ which leaves INOR with the open B, and saw that I had a good chance to pick up an E and have a high probability for a bingo. And I've only just remembered I could play QINS/SWAG which leaves ORU. I forgot QINS in-game, I had a migraine root the last couple of days and I know it happens so I'm not frustrated. QINS for 41 keeps the game closed but ORU is not a worthy leave, so I think that move would be wrong anyways - why pay 9 points for {+u -in}. In the end, SUQ won out because removing {QU} and keeping INOR was the best way to try for a bingo next turn. It isn't hugely likely she will have tiles to exploit the dangling Q anyways in my opinion. Quackle thinks QINS is just worth it over QUO(I)N but it isn't a good idea to use computer style judgement on a razor margin if it doesn't fit your style of play. If I knew more bingos, maybe. And (JETS)ON for 13 is apparently also very strong, interestingly Quackle also prefers IRON, OAT, and VOR to SUQ.
>skiing4me: IILRSUV H6 VR.L +7 84
#note VRIL is a nice idea to close things down (though if I had a bingo it wouldn't do much since I have S anyways), but it isn't the right move. Look at the leave. What a horrible rack! I'd seriously consider changing to leave RS. Quackle suggests keeping RSU as being move valuable (presumably U helps tacking onto the awkward Q/V in some scenarii), or ILRSU, or S/IS. I find it difficult in such situations to know WHAT to change.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ?INOOOR I8 .OO +9 103
#note I had to think a while but found no bingo, and BOO/LO seemed a fine option. Quackle indeed rates it best - pleased with that.
>skiing4me: EEIIISU -EII +0 84
#note What a horrible rack. No doubt to changing! It said she changed 3, I presume that to be correct and Quackle says only keeping ES is slightly stronger, but EISU is good. That's an 1120 awareness she shows there.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ?INOORZ 11I RIZ +30 133
#note I would have liked to play something like ORZO or RONZ but I couldn't quite remember the former and didn't like the latter's tileburning. RIZ sets up the BOOR/S hook. Shamefully I missed HORIZON, and ZORINOS is possible for 116 as a doubledouble. It's ok though - it could be the mig. ZORI is also a word.
>skiing4me: EINORSU O1 S.UIRE +48 132
#note SQUIRE is the aggressive pointscoring move, but OO/OI would leave EINRSU which is very palatable too I'm told.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ?BNOOTX 10I .X +50 183
#note I got very lucky to be able to use the hotspot, though to be fair she might have realised it was a good idea to block it.
>skiing4me: AEEHNOR N6 HORN +28 160
#note HORN is a bit much. HOA would do fine leaving EENR, or HOE leaving AENR which is better. SQUIREEN for 51 is even better, and HORE, HOAR, HERO etc do better than HOE apparently. I don't get that.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ?BNOOST M7 BOO +21 204
#note I didn't see any bingos, so BOO fit the bill. UNBOOTS and BOUTONS are indeed valid, as are BOSTONS, BONITOS, OBENTOS. BOO however still makes me a 6:1 favourite though.
>skiing4me: AAAEEIP L11 APE +23 183
#note ZA/AIA or AE/ORA/ONE, but not APE. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ?EENSTU O9 ENThUSE +71 275
#note So I just put the first word I saw down. Sequent is a valid 83 score with ORS/ONE.
>skiing4me: AACEILN M12 ANA +14 197
#note ACILN is a strong stem that prompts APE to be played. ANA is ok.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: DDHLLRR -DHLLR +0 275
#note I would normally look for a word like DR(APE)D or D(A)H(S) but changing to keep DR felt perfectly valid as an autoplay.
>skiing4me: ACEILTT 6F TA. +8 205
#note TAV was her attempt at opening the game up for herself since TACTILE doesn't fit. TECTAL for 31 making ANAL would do well.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ?DEEGNR 5A aNGERED +71 346
#note BOORD/ANGERED would score 76, GENDERS/ANAS for 80. Autopilot was valid.
>skiing4me: ACEEILT C2 CLA. +14 219
#note Quackle wants to attack - ALGETIC, LATENCE, ELANCE< AECIAL, AECIA. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: CIILOTW 15J COWL +17 363
#note COWL was just a closing play with no time. ITALIC, ICTIC, COTWAL, ALOW, AWOL, WALI, WAIL.
>skiing4me: DEEIKPT 2A PI.KETED +88 307
>Daniel_O'Dowd: DEIIITY 1G DEITY +39 402
#note YITIE, YITE.
