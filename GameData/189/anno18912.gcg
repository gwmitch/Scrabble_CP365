#note H(A)LVED and H(A)LVE both better, no reason for me to miss those.  Putting the E there is just pointless.

#note I get lucky

#note I don't know (S)WARDING, badly miss (A)WARDING), STE(WARDING) is sick nasty.  This is second best non bingo but it should have been a real bingo.
>Paula_Catanese: ILN K9 NIL +21 50
>Sam_Masling: AELPSTZ 6B ZAPS +47 190
#note One of the most beautiful plays that I've ever been able to play.  See if you can find it.  This is and 12A ZETAS, and F5 TZA(R) (which is fairly better) are second best about but by faaaaaaaaar.

#note I hate my brain, why can't I see NILL... wtf.     
>Paula_Catanese: UUU -UUU +0 98
#note And because I miss talents, she exchanges. Scrabble makes sense

#note Lol now I see it
>Paula_Catanese: GP 12B P.G +12 110
>Sam_Masling: ABEESTU 12F BEAU +12 243
#note Lots of interesting options, BAT(T)UE and TUBA(T)E look the best at M9 and M8 respectively, but there are lots of options all scoring 12-20.

#note I don't know my 4's (does a little dance) but apparently I can get away with it.  (Break dances to Rafi's beat boxing)
>Paula_Catanese: INT 8L .INT +12 166
>Sam_Masling: ACIORUU N7 U.AU +6 348
#note 2E (T)URACOU is awesome but not really a good play.  (F)UCI is the best but U(N)AU is fine.
>Paula_Catanese: EHIMOR O10 HOMIER +47 213
#note Maybe it wasn't...
>Sam_Masling: ACDIIOR M11 O.IC +12 360
#note Right now, I basically only lose if she bingos and hits me for 50, or bingos twice, so I take out the triple line. Up by 130 I could even outrun two small bingos, so I sacrifice a couple points and take out row 15 which could hit me hard.

#note I've only simmed 5 games so far and I'm starting to see I've missed ALOT this tournament.  I think I was really nervous to be playing in d2 and I start playing smarter as the tournament progresses but if I keep playing like this the whole tournament I'm really lucky to have gone +.500
