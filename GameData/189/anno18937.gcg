#note One of two intentional phoneys I attempted this tournament. I was frustrated with round 8 against Joel, and then now with having no spot to bingo here, I take a risk.

#note And here's where my anxiety catches up to me. I immediately hold this play. I note he can play SALUTaRY or eSTUARY and think, why would he play this if he wasn't positive of it? I'm now incredibly nervous about making a missed challenge, which really isn't such a big deal in the grand scheme of life, and fail to consider that this rack would be so high probability. If I'd stopped to think of an equally probable rack (=ALPORSTU), I could've easily realized that it was in the top 10,000 most probably 8s, a set of words I have learned many times over. And yet, for the second time in two games, whilst feeling completely rattled, I make a word knowledge mistake. I felt silly as soon as I released this word - If I knock this off, I have a shot at winning, even though Nigel will most likely bingo next turn (he saw eSTUARY, and thought of SALUTaRY, but liked this play more.

#note And then I miss BOOING.

>dacrON: AEFILPT 12A FLITE +26 291
#note I like opening the board now, while I have a decent scoring play. I also save AP(O) for next turn, and this play also gives me more chances to draw an R for (EWE)R, which is likely my ticket back into this game.
>Nigel_Peltier: EIILOTV B10 VO.TI +32 371
#note That was a pretty bad-case scenario for me.

>Nigel_Peltier: CEGKLOR O8 .RO +12 427
#note Seems pretty defensive, but it does make it rather hard for me to bingo. The main issue is that Nigel now risks me playing (BRO)NZERS, and by throwing the O out there, I no longer have to draw it (although it'd become a nonbingo now).
>dacrON: AEINNRS G11 .AN +10 344
#note Probably either this or (V)AIN in the same spot. This keeps the shot alive for (BRO)NZERS if I get the Z, and also goes well with the two remaining Gs in the pool.
>Nigel_Peltier: ACEGKLS 14F KEG +25 452
#note (BRO)CKAGE is pretty sweet, but this gets the job done best outside of the BRO extensions.
>dacrON: EIINNRS L1 N.NE +10 354
#note This is a dreadfully played endgame on my part - doesn't even guarantee me an out in two. I'm pretty sure I was out of time, from trying to conjure up a comeback. K1 S(H)RINE is 24(!) better.
