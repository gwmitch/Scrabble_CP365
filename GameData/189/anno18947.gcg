#note Almost missed this, as I initially only saw 8's like SUBRACES, SUBAREAS, etc... This is clearly best.

#note Geez, this is ridiculous!  Not only have I drawn 3 straight bingoes to start, but they've all scored huge points and I've burned through all the S's in barely 3 turns.

#note Roy:  "You don't have another bingo?"  :-)  Best would have been plays I didn't look very hard to find:  INULIN or INURN at 7I.  Now that I've luck-boxed my way through all the S's, they're safe plays to make.  This is reasonable but not best.

#note Yes, I saw BRINDLE and was going to play it or its anagram down the O column until he blocked it.  And I'll admit it - once that was blocked I didn't look at row 7.  While it would have been an amazingly bad whiff if this played at 7B, this is a miss I can live with, and here's why.  The only way anything really bad can happen given this pool (lots of AENOR and ?? still unseen) is to give him a place for something like ANAEROBE for 149.  While bingoing at 7A pushes my lead to 191 points, this still scores 36, still puts me up by 159, and doesn't open any bingo threats if he doesn't have a blank.  And, assuming that O1 gets taken out soon, his easiest lines are probably rows 7 and 12, and 12 isn't going to stay alive very long if I can help it. (There's also something possible like TRAITOR at O5 and maybe something like WEREWOLF down the I column, but that's a very hard line to hit).  Hardly a surprise, this coughs up huge equity (this or REND is my best non-bingo) but doesn't sacrifice a whole lot in terms of winning percentage.  The sim claims the bingo wins 99.7%; this wins 98.3.

>Jim_Burlant: AAEILNR 11D ALAN. +23 339
#note Too fixated on making sure he couldn't score with the Z.  This takes out row 12 but returns an equally juicy line down the D column.  Much better would have been ANA or ANE at O1 for 35.  If I wanted to take out rows 7 and 12, FAIN G8 (which the sim hates) would have done the job just fine.   My play of ALANE is stupid.

#note Just desserts.
>Jim_Burlant: EEEIIOR O10 OI +13 352
#note Was hoping to draw into the O1 play I previously whiffed on, but my EEIO draw renders me unable to do anything about that.  That said, I can prevent something like TRAITOR down the O column and get rid of one of my duplicated I's while I do it.  Q wants me to open up 8's down the C - G columns with EERIE 7C.  In a closer game I might be more concerned about the cruddy vowel-heavy leave, but I'm still up 114 points and his only bingo lines are row 7 or to the F.  Roy is slowly creeping back into this - I'm down to 92%.   EERIE ostensibly wines 95%...I'm fine with this.

#note Can you say "unbelieavably good drawing?"  Anyway, it's this or WEEP 13B.  97% to win.
>Roy_Kamen: CDHI 14A CHID +32 305
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIMR A11 AMI.E +36 416
