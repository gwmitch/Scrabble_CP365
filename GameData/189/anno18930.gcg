#note Mark and I have this thing where any time I sit next to him, he gets mercilessly bagged. I sat next to him twice at nationals and I think his opponents bingoed 9 times in those two games, plus in Mississauga I averaged 565 or something absurd against him. 
>Mark_Pryzybyszewski: AHHIMSS 9F MASH +25 25
#note Also, Mark provided his racks this game!

SHH is devastatingly defensive here, but in TWL3 it would be a horrible play because it gives up the SHHH+ hook.

#note Q prefers FLAN 10D
>Mark_Pryzybyszewski: AEINSWY 6D YAW +36 93
#note He said he wasn't sure of ANYWISE. This is still a relaly strong play. 
>Matt_Canik: AAELRXY 10E RYA +31 138
#note Why did I set the R down? I'm not really sure either. Q likes the nigel-like RAYA in the same spot to set up the X.

#note EINS isn't a good leave when you pull EIO
>Matt_Canik: AEIJLSX J2 JI. +26 164
#note I felt that XI mate it way too easy for Mark to score 40-50 along 3I. JI(N) is really dangerous if he has a D, and I know he's likely still relatively bingo prone, but he probably didn't have a D last turn (VIDEO) and the X can always be cashed in down the road.

#note Missed a tile from his rack. 
>Matt_Canik: ?EILQST K6 Q.T +12 220
#note Really tough call for me between hitting Q(A)T for 12 and bingoing next turn or playing QIS at 9K. Because I'm bad, I forgot about OVINES/QIS for 42 and also missed (E)Qu(A)LISE for 64 or QaTS or QuEST for 64. Jeez I missed a lot of good plays. 
>Mark_Pryzybyszewski: ADEIPST 1G PAID +33 182
#note Dodged a bullet when Mark missed PIT(H)EADS here. APE(X) also looks really strong- holds the D for next turn. 
>Matt_Canik: ?EILLRS 2B tRELLIS +72 292
#note Didn't know (H)ELLERIS
>Mark_Pryzybyszewski: ?EEKSTU 2J .UKES +32 214
#note Blocked NETSUKE, which he saw. OUTKEEPS is a word - I wasn't sure of it either. 
>Matt_Canik: DGINRSU N6 UD.N +19 311
#note I can use my S next turn to completely knock out the column O line, just leaving bingos through the X as ways I can lose this game. 
>Mark_Pryzybyszewski: ?DENOTT 1M DOT +17 231
#note A 64-point bingo is not what Mark needs right now. 
>Matt_Canik: BDGIRRS 10J BRIGS +24 335
#note Don't hit the X don't hit the X
>Mark_Pryzybyszewski: ?EENNTZ L9 Z.NE +26 257
#note Mark is extending the game by creating a like for me to address
>Matt_Canik: DEGMPRW 12H MERG.D +13 348
#note PRE(X) probably wins me this game the most.
