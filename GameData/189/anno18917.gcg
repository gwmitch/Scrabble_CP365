#note i was totally confused here. could QI be right? maybe this sim needs more plies. 2-ply and 4-ply likes it.

#note not sure why he didn't play it at 9F
>cesar: JLMOTUZ 6I LUTZ +17 39
#note quackle is liking MOULT by about 3.5 more. i don't know why. also i was kind of paranoid after his xi. 
>panitch: ?AEEITV K2 lEVI.ATE +70 89
>cesar: EEJMORW L9 MEOW +22 61
#note slightly nigellian but simply J1 JEW gives me a little bit of a better shot i think. but i have a rule about always playing MEOW too. because cats. (-1)
>panitch: ABENRTU 2E TURNAB.E +67 156
#note i'm aware he wouldn't have had this if i played JEW. this is the definition of a small mistake having drastic consequences. and the answer is to eliminate all small mistakes. 
>cesar: EIJNOPR K11 JO +41 102
#note it worked, but at what cost
>panitch: AEVW 1L WAVE +51 207
#note this sucks, it's always impossible to know what to do in these situations to lessen the impact of being down early and trying to stop the game from running away. should i just save JO for next turn and play PINE or PIRN? would people actually do that?

#note -1 PUG .. i spent a very long time debating between these two plays! the main problem is that ACDT really didn't seem strong enough to give up 6 points for, and points are precious right now, i do have a chance of winning in the endgame.

>cesar: AGHPRRT B6 HA.R +30 367
#note maybe this was a mistake, i wanted points really badly.. and thought i might as well go for the Y too. GRASP 14J seemed like i was potentially blocking myself. I think the problem with HAIR though is that the leave really is not very flexible. i didn't consider GNASH H1 though and I think I might have played that. it also blocks a scoring spot.  (-4.5)
>panitch: HU N13 UH +22 389
#note he really wants to block the S; 1H is better probably...
>cesar: DEGOPRT 3I GE.D +24 391
#note again taking the points instead of playing DOG or TOG at 13I ! so paranoid. is GEED right? i feel like anything that doesn't take the points here will lose because i will then have to actually get the bingo to win.. (-5)
>panitch: EO 1G OE +14 403

#note pyro/etc at 10B only win 37.5% of the time. i thought i had a chance at this winning more. but how, right?
