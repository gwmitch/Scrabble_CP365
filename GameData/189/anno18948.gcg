#note Only bingo, and this is one I better not miss; while, sometimes, you can miss the bingo (or pass it up) and your winning percentage and equity loss are stastically insignificant, in this case, my best non-bingo is G5 XI for barely 20 points.  This wins a hair over 60%; XI G5 wins just shy of 42 and sims 38 points down, for reference.

>Jim_Burlant: AFKLMOT 5G KAL.F +24 153
#note You have to know it to play it. A word I've never seen, FOLKMOT, plays as a non-bingo 7 for 42 at 13G.  Don't know why I couldn't think of FLOKATI, though.

>Jim_Burlant: GLMNOTW G11 MOWN +29 182
#note This was not an easy turn.   After taking a while to even notice potential G column overlaps, the question became whether to play off the N or keep it.  With only one vowel in the rack, I needed to clear as much as possible with MOWN, but doing so would keep the dreaded N-less G.  So which was better?  Ultimately I decided to err in favor of points and turnover.  Quackle agrees - this is best.  MOW G11, for reference, wins 1-3/4% less often and sims a little more than 3 points down.

#note For me this position came down to two choices:  AZO B13 (I didn't like giving back easy plays at 15A, even if he couldn't overlap  down the A column) and this.  Perhaps I need more turnover out of this rack (hence, Quackle's first choice of VOLTA 4J), but to me nothing really stands out as a superstar play; the options here are all good, but not great.  This scores better than anything except AZO and worst case doesn't threaten to give back more than a 34 point FRITZ.  VOLTA 4J  wins the sim,  probably for turnover; it keeps an A, and if I draw an E, I have  ZETA 12A on the next turn. <<shrug>>
>David_Pearl: DNU 13G ..UND +10 202
>Jim_Burlant: AGLOOTW 11C .OW +25 232
#note Good points, but not enough turnover.  AGLOW 12K scores 29.  I was looking to play more closed for reasons I can't put a finger on.  AGLOW 12K scores 29 and does a better job clearing out the rack.
>David_Pearl: AILO 4J .OILA +21 223
>Jim_Burlant: ACGLOOT 12A OC.AL +30 262
#note Strong play, but not quite best:  COTTA in the same location scores 34.  I never recognized it.  61% to win.
>David_Pearl: BEE J10 BEE. +12 235
>Jim_Burlant: ?GORTTY M3 G.ORY +26 288
#note Finally, I get one right.  This is best.  Now that I have the blank, Quackle says that, while the Fat Lady isn't singing yet, she is warming up:  91-1/2% to win.

#note This is my second best choice; a word I always miss, TeTOTUMS, scores 80 at 1H.

>Jim_Burlant: DEILOPR 15H .POILED +11 369
#note No bingoes play.  I was worried about his bingoing with something like SEDATING on row 15, and I never recognized TEENAGED on row 1.  If I recognize both threats I should just look to score as much as I can since it's not  possible to know for certain what his biggest threat is.   B1 LOOPED or POOLED would have been correct here.  All I did here was give him a bigger J play than he was already going to have.  <<face palm>>
