#note Burned plenty of time here. Seemed there would be a bingo or a better play than this.

#note Another big time-waster. There's nothing through the A in the B column. Nothing through the T that doesn't keep the O.I missed 5K OILY which looks pretty nice. I didn't see LYTTAE, but I saw NEATLY which is about the same. 3G YON opens up a spot for me to bingo, but I wasn't sure that was necessary. I DON'T KNOW. ONLAY sims within 2 points of like a dozen plays.

#note Obvious play that takes me way too long to see. Now in serious time trouble with under 5 minutes left.

#note Now the time trouble bites me. I'll forgive myself for missing SCHMELZE because I didn't know it. But B11 CHEZ is a huuuuge miss. I'm obviously still in great shape, but I'm flushing a bunch of win% by throwing a blank away for nothing.

#note Obviously no time to give this position real thought. But it's pretty fun. All my plays concede FAROLITO. And almost all of them concede a bingo on the bottom. (KING gives up OORALIS for example). WIG only gives up FAROLITO. Just PAY sims nicely because it blocks some bingos and ends up possibly threatening a huge KNOWING or WAKING on the O column. Forcing Ted to block while I score a couple points elsewhere, I guess. Anyways, doesnt matter much. KING is obviously weak
