#note If I don't bingo now I probably lose, with 2 unseen blanks. I was pretty sure CREOLES was the only word in CEELORS but I had to make it her responsibility to challenge. RECODE for 44  is what I should have played, in theory.

#note GEO(CORONAE) again! But I can't play that lol. I thought for a long time here. Championship player agrees.

I saw that if I draw an L, I'll have 2 bingoes in 2 completely different spots, O(B)LIGERs and GOmERIL. In the case that she doesn't block the A column, an H gave me CHOREGI and an I PIEROGI.
