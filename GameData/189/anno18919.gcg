>cesar: ABNNUUW 6E WAN.UN +14 62
#note insane draw there. it's always fun having ~25% win chances right after opening with zetas and at a 5-6 record. (-1.5) G1 UNAU is actually simming better but it doesn't seem right to me.

#note (-0.5) to BUBO at 5B

>cesar: ACEEILU H10 ACULEI +33 131
#note it seems like his leave might be pretty good but there is not even another play that is close to this.
>harshbarger: IIJRV C1 JIVI.R +32 191
>cesar: DEEFQRR 2B F.RED +26 157
#note quackle suggests that this is a massive mistake. i underestimated the ugly-looking DEEFRR leave; i have a shocking 72% bingo chance after it!! i was desperate for a blank or S or something. (-24.5)

>cesar: EILOSTY 7L OY +35 337
#note this is actually an interesting move. OY sims significantly best, but i wonder if it gives up too many points potentially. maybe i just do QUIVERY? he's likely to score a lot next turn anyway, so i don't know what's right.

#note important to come back faster, although b4 obe is slightly tempting. 
>harshbarger: F C13 F.. +16 372
>cesar: DEGIIOS E11 IDO. +17 382
#note tough situation. quackle likes dropping the S on IDOL for 11 extra points - i think that makes sense for endgame timing as well.  ~-7
