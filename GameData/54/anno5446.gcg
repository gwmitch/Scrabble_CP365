#note Held this for a little bit. HEXER is good too. Maybe I was thinking of NIXER*. In any event I didn't challenge.

#note Now I'm wishing I played XI! Though it wouldn't have played if he stuck with VEXER.

#note Don't know why I wanted to go this route exactly. Maybe I thought it might get challenged. Anyway ZIP looks good and sims best.

#note Not sure that this was correct. I thought for a while about LARDON, which is simming best with the rack inference. But then Winter could bingo leaving one in the bag, and I could draw into drek. Still, the score cushionis a lot. Curious to hear opinions.

#note Weird plays are doing well in sim, even with the E? inference...I think this is a good play. Of course this is the problem with ANDRO--now he has a chance to bingo big and win.
