#note i did see EX, obviously, but i screwed up the valuation of it. i just wanted volatility. i was right in that DEW results in a HIGHER score on average for me next turn than EX does, but it results in a much higher average score for him too. volatility again, but it's not right i suppose. (-8)

#note dammit, almost formulae!! ROOMFUL seems foolhardy with 4 Ss unseen, but it gives me a higher win%. FOU is best equity. (-1%)

#note keep mocking me, tile gods. one letter away from PL(UM)ERIA. GOR, ARGOL, and ALGOR are all very close, but I regret to inform that I went for turnover. let me have my turnover, i'm over 100 down, ok? (-1.5)

#note this is a VERY poor fish. TO or JO gives me 25% to win, this is 0%. i didn't really think correctly about this.. i don't often see situations like this one, but i need to improve. i was mistakenly hung up on trying to open up another bingo lane, but then i realized i didn't need to. i'm actually kind of glad i didn't draw a winning tile, because i really would have been mad at myself otherwise.
