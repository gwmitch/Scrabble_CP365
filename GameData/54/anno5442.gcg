>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ?ADEETT H6 AbETTED +68 68
>Ryan_Fischer: DFGINOU 11C FONDU. +20 20
#note FUNGOI(D); FONDU(E) is pretty low down on the list, surprisingly.  Doesn't really make too much of a difference 'cause of what happens next anyway.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AEENRST 8A SERENAT. +77 145
>Ryan_Fischer: BGIIOPS E5 BOI.G +16 36
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AEY 12C AYE +29 174
>Ryan_Fischer: AIJLLPS I3 JILL +21 57
#note JAL(O)P.  Ugh.  I saw it too, but not that spot.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ALMU 4H M.AUL +20 194
>Ryan_Fischer: AAIKOPS J6 PIKA +27 84
#note OKAPI is suicidal, but maybe that's what I need.  I like my play for keeping lanes open, not giving too much up.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: EGV 13A VEG +28 222
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIOSVW F3 AVOW +35 119
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: EILORTU A1 OUTLIER. +77 299
#note And if I see JALOP, he doesn't have OUTLIER OR ULTERIOR.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEGIRSW A11 WI.ER +36 155
#note Well, gotta break it up to score now.  Pity.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AQ K3 Q.A +24 323
>Ryan_Fischer: BGINSST M1 GIBS +22 177
#note This rack too me forever.  Oh, look!  FONDUE is a verb!  It's between GIBS or BIGS or any middling play to save balance.  I chose slotting the G ultimately, hating to give up the MIAUL hook, but seeing FAG(S) is still there.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ACFPY 2J PAC.FY +57 380
#note Beautiful!
>Ryan_Fischer: DEINNST K8 INDENTS +74 251
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: X B13 .X +36 416
#note Hehe, he said when he played the X he drew the second blank!
>Ryan_Fischer: COORRSZ 1G ORZO +43 294
#note Would you fish for O(Y)EZ O1 78?  A brief sim isn't having any of it.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ?DEHMOR 14D HEiRDOM. +69 485
#note Brad said he was one off of O1 H(Y)DROgEN 185, but he missed H(Y)pODERM and H(Y)DROMEl for 203.  So much for that elusive 600 game.  Now now!  Interestingly, there's a lot of plays to take before the bingo here.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEHIRST 8J ..TSCH +48 342
#note O1 H(Y)STERIC 203!  Hahahahahaha.... I was so considering trying C(Y)THER*, I didn't even think I had something plausible there.  And I was so happy to see (KI)TSCH.  Wow.  I also almost insisted STIRCH* is good, and would have tried STIRCHE(S) had he not blocked.  After all that I could won.  Insane.  Fun, stupid fact.  I was so proud to see (KI)TSCHIER, which is #, but SHTICKIER is good in ours!
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AEINNOU 1M .OA +32 517
#note Nice play, but EONIAN gets the edge, D1 25.
