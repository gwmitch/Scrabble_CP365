#note this is my "kamikaze" strategy. just go all out with ALIF, no need to do IF. they're very close on quackle. what's better? maybe it's a matter of style.

#note i didn't think this rack was worth fishing too. but PILEI is much better, or PINOLE at 14J. if i'm going to play "kamikaze" i gotta do it all the way. i really should do the other PINOLE. -3

#note this is just too funny. i was down to about 4-5 minutes here and i was freaking out that there was a blank unseen and i had been unable to pull away. so i miss a bingo and i play a phony 4 that gets challenged off. i thought it was good then i realized as soon as he challenged (which he did very quickly). gah!!!

#note i really don't know about B1 QI. it seems harder to bingo to the G than in the bottom. but maybe it doesn't like me keeping the Q and he might bingo and i'd be screwed. this was a very tough choice but i literally had no time at this point so i just played wizen.
