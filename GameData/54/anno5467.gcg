>Cesar: AIINOQU E4 QUIN.A +30 30
#note D7 AHI is pretty freakin cute, but best move, really? i don't buy it. F6 QUAI is probably better than QUINOA. i don't know. (-4)
>Isaac: EIPU 4C PI.UE +32 110
>Cesar: ADEIOPZ H1 AZIDO +71 101
#note isaac was annoyed about playing this so quickly, EQUIP wouldn't have given me this comeback.
>Isaac: BKO 3B KOB +30 140
>Cesar: DEGOPRS 3G P.G +18 119
#note or G3 PEG for one more point. -0.2
>Isaac: ELV 6D L.VE +15 155
>Cesar: CDEORSW 10E SCOWDER +87 206
#note i undercounted this by 10 somehow. whoops.
>Isaac: EFIJNRT -  +0 155
#note i also wasn't 100% sure of it, but almost. very glad it came back green.
>Cesar: BCEEIOW 7I WEB +23 229
#note 7H OWE may be just slightly nicer. (-0.5)
>Isaac: EFIJNRT 6I EF +33 188
>Cesar: CEINNOT 1F EN.CTION +61 290
#note argh stupid SOWPODS WORDS. which causeway or wsc game was the culprit here?
>Isaac: AFRT 2L FART +21 209
>Cesar: AADHOOU O1 U.A +9 299
#note meh. i like preventing miracles. i know this move sucks, but two blanks and 3 Ss unseen could mean a crazy play. i have to play UTA. it's only 2% down by winning percentage although significantly more by equity obviously.

>Cesar: AADGHOO 2C HOOD +32 331
>Isaac: ASY 1A AYS +27 256
>Cesar: AAGLMNR L4 MAG +26 357
#note MAR is better. AGLN appears to be much stronger than ALNR. L and N don't get along that well and there are Is unseen. (-4)
>Isaac: DN J10 .ND +4 260
>Cesar: AALLNRT 12F ALAN. +7 364
#note i thought of F10 CALL and would probably do that instead. i just wanted to try to kill the board.  - 11.5
