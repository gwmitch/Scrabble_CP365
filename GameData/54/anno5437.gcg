#note i chose YOWS because i didn't necessarily want the V to block off that whole part of the board.  VOWS sims a little better.

#note with two shorter plays in a row, i decided to take out this bingo lane and clear some tiles...

#note i hate this position.  open the with omelet and potentially get a crap draw?  play blocky and continue this painful board situation?  i think maybe she doesn't know STELE - may at least give me a potential interesting lane that she doesn't see.

#note she mutters things about how she knows this is going to go badly but she just can't stand the board anymore...

#note i don't know. this didn't feel right but it got us toward the end of the game, took out lanes, and scored. q likes orzo best 4f. that makes sense since it holds the ?S and still scores and takes out lanes. i was just rushing toward the end.
