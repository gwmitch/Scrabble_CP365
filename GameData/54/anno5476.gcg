#note as a 1600-to-1800 expert, i sometimes randomly make moves that i know are bad, for no reason. i thought of JEU right away, but i didn't like playing it, i don't know why. doug suggested JUG on the train, the funny thing is it doesn't show up in the choices list, and once you add it, it shoots to the top. it ends up being second place to JEU after a couple thousand iterations. (-4.5)

#note CAW sims higher. quackle really likes fishing sometimes. 5B TILE sims way better than my move, i guess i do have the S. stop playing scared. (-7.5)

#note just take the points, i forget who was telling me that the other iceless might be a little better. but i suppose this thinking goes counter to my reasons for not playing TILE last turn. 1600-to-1800s are fickle ;)
