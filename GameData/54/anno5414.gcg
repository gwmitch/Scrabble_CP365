#note valued it a little wrong. CUD is better, one more pt, and it takes the back hook, and the leave may be better (i'm not sure about that last one). -3

#note no! no! no! i can't make mistakes like this! i saw POUF right after i hit the clock. so annoying. but even then, PHIZ is much worse than stuff like ZIP. this should be fairly obvious. if anything, i have FOPS the next turn with ZIP. FISHWAY is a nice word i don't know. but POUF is the star play, with a real SHIT leave. i just couldn't think of a word ending in UF, but i didn't think about it or look hard enough! i was frustrated at how the game was going. why can't i have absolutely no emotions?

#note yuck, absolutely missed the spot for FOOTSY. i hate being frustrated. for example, something that was clouding my thoughts was the very annoying hotspot at 12D. -10 FOOTWAY is another good word.

#note that didn't work out too badly. M2 MYRIAD is beautiful though. -1 to MAIM (keep a scoring tile?), -1.5 to MYRIAD.

#note sorry, but i think the situation merited playing up here after that move and the pool. i picked GIRD because i thought she might have more vowels than usual, but i don't really know. GIRO is better probably. 15F MINOR wins the sim. i guess i have to keep PHIZES in mind and can't screw around. (-14)
