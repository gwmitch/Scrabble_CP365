#note Weak...BOO M5 seems good. Wanted to take the E but this play is quite poor.

#note Ugh. What is this?? Trade six time I think, which is Quackle's pick. Terrible...the only redeeming thing is that Brian was pretty low on time, so outrunning seemed like it could be pretty probable.
>Brian_Bowman: AAEGNOT 3C .OE +6 343
>Sam: NNRSTUV 9K T.V +12 391
#note Yet another mistake. As Quackle points out, I definitely should have added the S to leave one in the bag. I think I would have won if I did that.

>Sam: DNNRSUW 13J W..D +16 407
#note INWIND is good--I chickened out on it. Was almost certain that he was keeping AEGIN? in playing ETA, so it doesn't matter really. 50% chance. This should have been an easy win for me.

#note Brian lost 10 on time.
