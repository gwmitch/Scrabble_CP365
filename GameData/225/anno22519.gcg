#note RECORD BREAKING GAME! This is my highest scoring game ever! 5th best play! Judgement call between WAIVER, WAIVE, REAVOW and AVOWER. Quackle says -1 but I'm not really sure why.
>Tim_O'Hara: AAINOSY 9E YAH +32 32
>Tim_O'Hara: AAINOSY --  -32 0
#note This was big. Wisely look out for phony 2's people! This is what started the landslide.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDIIMRX 9A MIX +37 69
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara: HI A7 HI. +24 24
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDIPRST G2 SCRIPT.D +69 138
#note Best play! SCRIPTED has an anagram PREDICTS? I didn not know that. But of course I knew PREDICTS!
>Tim_O'Hara: DOOY F8 .OODY +17 41
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEENNU 4C UNEA.NED +70 208
#note 2nd best play! I saw UNYEANED for 76 at 12D but chickened out on it. I could have played it if I had to but decided to take the sure thing. -6.
>Tim_O'Hara: AGILR 12A GLAIR. +24 65
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEEFGI 3I FIDGE +40 248
#note 2nd best play! I don't care if Quackle thinks 10B is better, I like mine better. Quackle says -3 though.

>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEGLNP --  -68 282
#note One of my biggest mistakes of the game was trying a phony instead of seeing 11D PEDALING. I played it a turn later though.
>Tim_O'Hara: AENOQVW B12 .EAN +34 141
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEGLNP 11D PE.ALiNG +102 384
#note Best play! Tim did not block this for some reason!
>Tim_O'Hara: AK 2J KA +37 178
>Jonathan_Lindh: FOORSSU 1K FOURS +34 418
#note Best play! I'm getting EVERYTHING!
>Tim_O'Hara: C D11 ..C +7 185
#note Does Tim have the blank? This seemed like a strange play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEMOST 7A .AM +26 444
#note Best play! I spent forever thinking about what to do here. Glad to know Quackle likes going for the bingo too.
>Tim_O'Hara: LRV E1 L.V.R +16 201
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BEOSTY E7 B.Y +15 459
#note Oops! Missed J7 BAYONETS for 66 and M3 EYEBOLTS for 64. Knew both of them too. -11.6 2nd missed bingo of the day. Oddly Quackle like TOBY N3 for 28 over all of the bingos but I think I just play the bingo.
>Tim_O'Hara: OOTT H11 .OTTO +18 219
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EIOQST C1 Q. +11 470
#note 5th best play! Not. Good. I gotta lazy here. 6G POSTIQUE is definitely best and probably draws a challenge. I knew and I didn't even look through the P. Could I have hit 600 if I played better? I'm starting to think so. -25.5
>Tim_O'Hara: ILTU K11 .UILT +6 225
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEIOST 6G .OETIzES +63 533
#note Quackle likes deferring the bingo with 10B TIE. I need to play the bingo I think. 14G ETIOLATES for 70 is awesome! I don't see split 9's though, generally. This also draws a challenge so I think this is right even though Quackle says -12.8.
>Tim_O'Hara: AENNSTW -  +0 225
#note Failed challenge on Tim's part!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENOT 15K .ANTO +18 551
#note Best play! Surprsingly no outs.
>Tim_O'Hara: EHINSUW N11 WHIS. +22 247
#note 5th best play! N10 WISENT is best. This is -6.8 for Tim. There were probably better endgames for me contrary to what Quackle says but I wanted my new record.
>Jonathan_Lindh: E D11 ...E +8 559
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (ENU) +6 565
#note As good as this was, it should have been better. 2 missed bingos and not playing PEDALING a turn earlier may have cost me my first 600. I'll take it though. -56.9 total equity loss and -44.1 unintentional equity loss (POETIZES). Should have found the fourth bingo 2 turns earlier but this was very well played.
