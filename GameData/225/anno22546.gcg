>Jonathan_Lindh: EHIOUVY 8G HIVE +20 20
#note Best play! Al would have done 8H IVY for 18 but my play sims best by .4 equity points. Good to know.
>Al_Helfgott: ?AEIMRU 9A MURIAtE +66 66
#note 6th best play for Al. K2 UREMIAs for 76 is best. Other placements of UREMIAs score more as well. -10 for Al.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEFOTUY A7 FU.Y +36 56
#note 2nd best play! I thought about this forever. How did I miss A7 TUMEFY? I certainly knew the word. -13 equity Quackle says and I agree.
>Al_Helfgott: BOW 10E BOW +26 92
>Jonathan_Lindh: DENNOTX 11C EXON +34 90
#note 6th best play! I considered 8C OX very strongly not just for the additional 2 points but also for the lack of comeback oppurtunities. I like mine better. -2.6 Quackle says but I choose mine again.
>Al_Helfgott: CHI 12B CHI +39 131
>Jonathan_Lindh: DELNRTU K2 RUNTLED +78 168
>Jonathan_Lindh: DELNRTU --  -78 90
#note This was my biggest mistake of the game. TRUNDLE and RUNDLET. I would find of these next turn though.
>Al_Helfgott: ALST K8 SALT +19 150
#note AL blocks. Did he have a bingo? It doesn't matter though because...
>Jonathan_Lindh: DELNRTU B1 TRUNDLE +75 165
#note Best play! On track again.
>Al_Helfgott: K D8 K. +11 161
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILOOP C3 POO +23 188
#note 2nd best play! I went back and forth between 1A ATOP and C3 POO forever. Quackle says -.1 but I take my play again in a second due to the much better leave.
>Al_Helfgott: DEINSTV J2 INVEST.D +69 230
#note Best play! I believe this is the only bingo for Al. And...
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIILMN 3G MAI.LINE +78 266
#note Best play! Al's bingo gave me a bingo. Also note 6F MILESIAN and 6D ALIENISM for 66 and 62. Also note MAINLINE takes an S,D, and R back hook.
>Al_Helfgott: BRY H1 BR.Y +39 269
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEILOT M2 E.TOILED +62 328
#note Best play! And only bingo! Aside from the TRUNDLE miss, I'm dialing it this game.
>Al_Helfgott: IQ 6H QI. +12 281
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEEFGR 6L T.Z +32 360
#note I didn't have any vowels here, so this was almost certanly the best play, even though I didn;t write down my rack.
>Al_Helfgott: OOW D2 WOO +23 304
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEGJNPS O1 PED +30 390
#note 2nd best play! Quackle likes PEDS O1 for 36 tacking on the S. I chose not to tack on the S but strongly debated doing it. Quackle says -2.4 but I disagree. I like my play best. I was hoping Al would would challenge, but he knew MAINLINE as a verb.
>Al_Helfgott: ?AEGNRR N8 RANGERs +73 377
#note 2nd best play! N8 REGRANT for 77 is best. Had he played it, I may have a 4th bingo later on.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEGJNS O7 JAG +47 437
#note Best play! This mostly clinched the game!
>Al_Helfgott: AAAFGRU 1A U. +6 383
>Jonathan_Lindh: AACENST 13M A. +4 441
#note 4th best play! Quackle likes fishing but prefers g3 MA best for 9. I was scared Al was bingoing was well. Quackle says -5 but I like my play.
>Al_Helfgott: AAEFGRS 13L G.. +4 387
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEFNST 13D STANCE +20 461
#note 8th best play! This was intentional because I knew Al had the last S and I didnt want a freak bingo to win the game. I don't regret this play. Quackle says -22 but I say take the sure W.
>Al_Helfgott: AAEIORS H11 RA.ES +24 411
