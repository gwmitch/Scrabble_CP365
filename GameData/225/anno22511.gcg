I saw some of the bngos, but none hit dws M13, so I decided I was saving this blank for a rainy day

>Matthew_Ridout: ?AHINSU 11K UH +18 150
#note HUMANIST K5 for 90 pts best, mine... not best.
Once I didn't spot the dws-dws or find one that hit M13, I decided on this ghaslty, lane-killing play. 

 It was 7% worse to win and nearly 30 valuataion points down
