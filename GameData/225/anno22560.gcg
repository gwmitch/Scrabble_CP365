#note October 25 Chicago Scrabble Episode 7: Press the Button! I've never annotated all of my games from a tournament before. This may as well be the first time. This game started badly because at turn 4 or so, I learned we were supposed to DRAW for firsts instead of the higher seed going first. Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man is the leading star of this game. So much so I'm almost embarrassed to post it. It's that bad.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEMNOPY D2 MONEYE. +26 26
#note 4th best play! D8 DOPEY is best but there are 4 plays within .5 of each other. -.5 but this is fine and I'd do this again.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: AEES C1 EASE +18 36
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACMOOPU 6B CO.POU +21 47
#note Best play!
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: OP B1 OP +24 60
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADDFIMN 1A F.. +18 65
#note Best play! Also C6 OF for same amount.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: AEILN 7H ALIEN +9 69
#note This play seemed very strange, but I'm the one who blew it at the end.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADDIMNO 8K MONAD +34 99
#note 2nd best play! K5 ADENOID is 36 and best. Mine is -3.8. I wanted to hit the triple badly. Note the unplayable bingo. DIAMOND. No B or S for BONDMAID or DIAMONDS and no ED for DIAMONDED. I saw all all 3 of those.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: EFU 9I FEU +15 84
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADDILTV 10F VITAL +27 126
#note Best play! I thought I was blocking her bingo. Nope.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: ?EILLTU O1 UnTILLE. +77 161
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: DDERW 11J DREW +20 146
#note Partial rack

#note Best play!
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: EIRT O11 TI.ER +21 207
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ACGRST 4C ..G +4 174
#note 10th best play! 4th and final missed bingo of the tournament and a fitting one given the outcome of this game. -23.1. Bad bad.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: AQ 3M QA. +24 231
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ACRRST 12D TRACeRS +71 245
#note 4th best play! 12D TRoCARS is best. -2.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: BEIZ 5K BEZI. +32 263
>Jonathan_Lindh: EKOSTVX 10M OX +33 278
#note 2nd best play! Did I really miss 6I EX for 52? This was a horrible miss if true. -14.3.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: AJW 4J JAW +40 303
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIKRSTV 11C VOE +18 296
#note I think I played a phony 2 here. It wasn't challenged. Partial rack.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: AH J2 HA. +21 324
>Jonathan_Lindh: KSS F12 .SK +17 313
#note Partial rack. I'm pretty sure this was best. Short on vowels and holding last S. This gives me the win IF I play correctly.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: AIRT 14B TRAI. +18 342
#note Jacquelyn is forced to choose which way to block. 
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENNOSTY 15F STONY +32 345
#note Here's where I blow it. 2nd best play! 15F STONEY is best. I saw it. I chickened out on it plus I thought I could score more with two tiles instead of one. -5.6 but more like -999.9. Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man is that you? YES IT IS!
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: BIIR 14J BIR +24 366
#note Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man FAILS AGAIN! I allowed a phony 3. I thought this was good. Why not CHALLENGE?
>Jonathan_Lindh: EN I2 EN +11 356
#note Best play! Lol.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (I) +2 358
#note Good to know a recount would have been pointless. Total eqity loss was between -50 and -60 but my play was much worse than the equity loss indicates. One missed bingo and a substantial missed X play accounted for about half to a little over half of the loss. STONY and not challenging BIR* disgusted me. Awful. This game led me to a new tracking system with handwritten tracking sheets featuring jumbo sized letters. This tournament was a missed oppurtunity to put it mildly. 6-1 and a rating well in into the 1500's should have been the outcome. I believe I would been around 1565 counting acceleration points at the end. Instead? 1507. Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man stuck around for the first game of the next tournament which was the David Englehardt game. Glad to know Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man handed two people tournaments wins with his hilarious incompetence.
