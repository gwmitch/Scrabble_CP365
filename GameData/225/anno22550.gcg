>Chris_Guilbert: EFOORR 8G REROOF +26 26
>JD: OPQRSST -Q +0 0
#note very interesting position! thought about exchange QS or PQ, but this hits so much of the tile pool (73% bingo chance!)
>Chris_Guilbert: ?ABERTW H2 WATERB.d +63 89
#note I saw BRAWEST, but not BROWBEAT which he could've played here.
>JD: OPPRSST 3G P.SSPORT +82 82
#note whoa, cool draw! I did not know POPSTER which is new
>Chris_Guilbert: ACHINOT 5A INCHOAT. +76 165
#note ANORTHIC might be safer here
>JD: AGILTTX B1 TAXI.G +36 118
>Chris_Guilbert: EIJNRS K5 REJ.INS +56 221
>JD: EEGLTUZ L1 ZL.TE +50 168
#note after making this play it occurred to me that GLOZE could be better by not giving up the Z for triple-word score plays, but I need the volatility at this point anyway
>Chris_Guilbert: ADEI 1K A.IDE +45 266
>JD: EGLNRTU 11D GRUNTLE. +68 236
>Chris_Guilbert: MMUY H11 .UMMY +39 305
>JD: AADEKNQ F10 Q.AKE +40 276
#note play QI/QI? QUAKED? QUAKE? I need sources of volatility so I didn't hook the D, but I wanted to play QI to give myself a chance at the S and blank, which are vital on this board in particular for column O and M. but it does block up the board a bit. Q also likes AQUA, I think because the K scores well on this board, like EKE at A1 for 42 potentially.
>Chris_Guilbert: GINO C3 IN.OG +43 348
#note nice play
>JD: AACDEHN N1 .E.ACH +40 316
#note again, wanted to reach into the bag for the key letters, but also score well. this play seemed perfect once I spotted it
>Chris_Guilbert: AEEV O6 EAVE +26 374
>JD: ?ADDFNS 15D FADD. +37 353
#note great draw, I have a real chance now
>Chris_Guilbert: EIOY 2F YO.IE +31 405
#note ooh, GOOEY at 6B is 37 - but maybe he had two Is
>JD: ?AIINSU 14H .INUtIAS +72 425
#note we were both down to not very much time - I missed my real word here which is MUSICIAN!! but MUSICIAN also makes it really easy for him to score well, so it worked out for me that I played this, and he eventually accepted...
>Chris_Guilbert: BEILNOV 12A VINO +28 433
#note he had about 10 minutes to figure out his endgame, but had trouble tracking me correctly. I spotted his best play of BORN at 6F which leaves outs at the bottom-left that I can't do much about, although I fogrgot about VLEI being TWL. the other two wins are VIOLIN at M10 and BOVINE at 14A. his play is not supposed to win...
>JD: DLOUW 6F WO.D +31 456
#note I made a game-losing mistake on this turn with almost no time on my clock, knowing that I was supposed to play OW to save LUD/EAVED. but his clock was so low that it was most important to get a play down as fast as possible.
>Chris_Guilbert: BEL 4A B..E +35 468
#note this is his game-winning play, but he found it too slowly after first putting down his out-play.
>JD: LU A10 LU. +6 462
>JD:  (L) +2 464
