#note Heartbreaking block of FOREFEET, which may have gotten challenged.

This play was a very outlandish one. I normally would play 9I FE, as FORTE is a pretty good leave, but after his play of VIN, a leave containing one-point tiles was suggested. This means that if I can score and score again next turn with something like (Z)AFFER, I am right back in the game, as he will be unable to score well barring a play from the Z, or an overlap of my play at 10F for around 20 points. I am also reopening the top of the board in case things go awry, and perhaps Michael will not see the O(VINE) hook. I stand by this play, but I can be easily convinced otherwise.
>Michael: IN B10 .IN +12 145
#note In a striking turn of events, my inference came true and Michael seems to be mistakenly playing catchup, seemingly at a loss for what to do other than fish and set up a bingo lane.
>Josh: DEFFRUW 10J DRUFF +37 146
#note But what one-point tiles does he have? Does he have a blank? Possibly. An S? Probably, right? Seemed like if I could infer that he did not have an S, I should play 13A FEW. If he does, I should definitely not play FEW I would say, since he easily overlaps for 40 points if he doesn't hit his bingo. I misinferred here, and paid the price. For what it's worth, I thought this was a word, but I may have challenged if he had pluralized it, since it's possible I was wrong about its validity, and possible that DRUFF* would be an adjective.
>Michael: EEILNNT 13A LENIENT +79 224
#note I was very confused here. Seems he kept a pretty shabby ELINT or ELITE, ENITE or ENINT-type leave. FEW would have worked out fantastically.
>Josh: DEIORWY O5 DOWERY +55 201
#note Taking are of business here. I was pretty convinced that DRUFFY* was phony, but didn't think he would be able to challenge.
>Michael: EOS 14A OSE +38 262
>Josh: ABCCEIK 15C BACKIE +50 251
#note N3 CEIBA is nice enough, but I started to get impatient and greedy, to much avail. That's 3 phonies in a row.
>Michael: HO N6 HO +31 293
>Josh: ACDMTTU M10 .ACTUM +26 277
#note Now here I make a mistake, it would seem. I was hoping after 3 unfamiliar words, a 4th one would tip the scale enough to draw the challenge. It seems Michael didn't deem it worthy to challenge this one, as it, in effect, didn't block his bingo, as he immidiately thought it did. But the play is M1 MUDCAT.
>Michael: ABEEILS 12E BAILEES +68 361
>Josh: ADGNOTX M3 TAXON +39 316
#note I couldn't find anything I could try here, so I just went for the best valid play.
>Michael: AMPU L2 PUMA +35 396
#note ugh
>Josh: ADEGGIS 14H DISGA.GE +79 395
#note This is the third (!) time I have phonied with DISGAUGE*, each time against different opponents. Each time, I thought it was a valid word. I was really hoping he would challenge, but I am lucky he did not! I always think MISGAUGE is the phony, and DISGAUGE is valid. Maybe 3rd time is a charm, and I'll finally remember!
>Michael: OW K4 OW +41 437
#note Ow!
>Josh: DINORRV O12 VI.D +36 431
#note When all is said and done, I did not play this game perfectly. I could have done more. Here, VI(E)D seemed like the logical choice. Leave one in the bag and score as much as possible, so as to complicate the endgame for Michael. But VI(E)R is definitely better. I actually keep thinking VIER is phony, which is why I didn't play it, but why should that stop me? I have already phonied 4 times in this hopeless game! I still would have lost, but I definitely put up a great fight!
>Michael: ?AELSTU N1 UTAS +17 454
#note Assuming this was his rack, this was a decent play.
>Josh: ?NORRRY E2 RYRON..s +31 462
#note Phonying 4 times was definitely not enough in this rather frustrating game! I apologize to Michael for taking it out on him. He deserves more credit, he just needs to be confident in his word knowledge.
