#note Inadvertant poor placement
>Joey_Krafchick: ADEEMNR 7H AMENDER +82 82
>Matthew_Ridout: ADEEHNV 6I AVE +42 70
#note Chickened out on HAVENED
>Joey_Krafchick: LOOW 5K WOOL +26 108
>Matthew_Ridout: DEEHKNR 9H EH +25 95
#note KENDO L1 best, mine an okay sixth
Slotting a K in the tws lane and a vowel in the 3xs lane feels too aggressive to me

#note KI N2 better by a whisker
>Joey_Krafchick: AZ 9N ZA +25 176
>Matthew_Ridout: ?CEEIRT E4 TIERCEs +74 225
#note RECITES, same spot, better by 1% to win and 4 valuation points.   not sure why - perhaps is my slotting of the C on row 8
>Joey_Krafchick: OPTUY O1 POUTY +44 220
>Matthew_Ridout: EIINOST F10 .OI +7 232
#note best      
though in retrospect, i'm surprised it beat IONIC 8A
>Joey_Krafchick: AGIV D1 VAGI +28 248
>Matthew_Ridout: AEINSTT C4 SATINET +62 294
#note I knew giving up five points from from 13F might be a mistake, but I felt like the position was a little stronger from C4.
Mine finished 8 valuation points back and was 5% worse to win

#note NERVY 1A best, mine 3rd
>Joey_Krafchick: AANO 1F ANOA +17 365
>Matthew_Ridout: BHMNRRW 2I HM +18 374
#note Same word 13 H best and only play over 50% to win.  mine 3rd.
13H felt -way- too aggressive for me.  if i was to lose, decided wouldn't be because I opened up that bingo lane
>Joey_Krafchick: IO 3H OI +10 375

#note ORB 13K 9 valuation points better somehow, but both were 100% to win
>Joey_Krafchick: DEILSSU B10 ISSUED +24 410
>Matthew_Ridout: ?GINOR K9 ROl.ING +14 426
#note spotting one of the three nines from REX would've been cool.
I was now a game up on Joey heading into the KOH match - but he was sooo far ahead on spread, margin here didn't matter
