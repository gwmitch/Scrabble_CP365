#note key move, I thought that it would pay off to take the points and hold the relatively strong NNS? leave for a high-scoring bingo. but the board is actually pretty closed and NNS? only bingos 60% of the time, so Q thinks this is a 6-7 point error.

#note there's enough tiles in the bag that I would feel stupid for playing QI at 13B, getting hit with a 100+ point bingo immediately, another bingo the next turn and then losing to an out-bingo.

#note I can tuck in PLIE for some nice points, or play IMAGED to block the PLUME hook since I know he's still holding an E thanks to his earlier phony
