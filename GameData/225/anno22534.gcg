>Kevin_Bowerman: CEMOOSU 9A MOO +16 41
#note Wanted to block the O an open an easier to hit non-bingo triple triple, as well as other extensions. Didn't know COM(O)US, but it seems stronger

>David_Gibson: INW E5 WIN. +14 208
#note Didn't considerthat he was passing up 9 points here. Presumably as to not open new lanes, so it seems fairly safe to assume that he does not have any of ST?
>Kevin_Bowerman: AABEGLO 14F BOA +26 204
>David_Gibson: TZ 6D T.Z +32 240
#note Or maybe he was just setting up the Z and closing off another quadrant? Some day I'll understand this man's play

>Kevin_Bowerman: AAEELOO K9 OLEA.E +12 235
#note This seems weak, but if I don't play and open up here, it's likely he will play at 12L and I'll have nothing but a G to bingo through or open up.

>Kevin_Bowerman: ACENNOP K3 NOPE +27 262
#note Laid down CANNO(T), and then started to doubt its validity.

#note R(Y)U? This? Seems hopeless no matter what
>David_Gibson: ELNUV O7 V.NULE +10 385
>Kevin_Bowerman: ADIINRR G2 RID +12 292
#note Gotta hope for a bingo (only to cut spread at this point), this seems to be the best way to do it

#note Should just cash out on the spot now with BRAIN
