>Nedd_Kareiva: AAIOOSZ -AAIO +0 0
#note October 25th Chicago Scrabble Episode 5: Press the Button! This game was full of ugly exchanges on both sides. This probably should have been a loss for me but Nedd made one fatal error that likely cost him the game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: INOPUUV -IOPUUV +0 0
#note 4th best play! Keep INP, no just N. -.6. 
>Nedd_Kareiva: RWY 8G WRY +18 18
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEKNUVY F7 NAVY +28 28
#note 4th best play! F5 UVEA or F6 KNAVE. This turn was hard. -6.2 but this is still reasonable.
>Nedd_Kareiva: DOU 7I OUD +11 29
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEKOSU 8K OBAKU +45 73
#note Best play! This is another horrible rack. K5 KUDO is the best real play. Mine is vastly better than any real play. I confused this with OKAPI and OTAKU. OBAKU* is jibberish. 28.1 equity better! 
>Nedd_Kareiva: ACINOST O6 CA.TIONS +61 90
#note Best play for Nedd! Nedd immediately holds but doesn't challenge because he has a low scoring playable bingo. That mistake was the game right there.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEFIINS M7 F.NCIES +34 107
#note This was a subject of long mental debate. Quackle likes K5 FIDO fishing the best. I don't think the board is conducive to bingos with CEINS. Ending with E or I his hard with this rack and the M and 13 lines can be shut down with one play. Pass up 18 points? Quackle says -7 but I go with my play purely due to board shape.
>Nedd_Kareiva: AEEW L11 AWEE +28 118
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEEINOR K11 REB +27 134
#note 2nd best play! If this is accurately. Was the last letter a Q or R. Quackle has this as -.8 to E10 OBE but once again I'm not possing up 12 points on a bad board.
>Nedd_Kareiva: PU K5 UP.. +14 132
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEINOSV E3 DOGIE +16 150
#note Did not record rack. Maybe this horrible. I had a very clunky rack this turn.
>Nedd_Kareiva: LPTZ 4C PL.TZ +32 164
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEFL D7 FLED +15 165
#note Also did not record. I do know these racks stunk.
>Nedd_Kareiva: DEGIINT C2 DI.T +14 178
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EIORTX -  +0 165
#note I did not exchange with a blank. I drew a Q but no U or blank.
>Nedd_Kareiva: AEEJ E10 AJEE +29 207
>Jonathan_Lindh: TVX 12D V.XT +28 193
#note Didn't record rack but I had no vowels. This had to be right.
>Nedd_Kareiva: ?HINORT L4 THO +21 228
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEMRRT B5 ARMREsT +62 255
#note Best play! This or ERRATum in same spot.
>Nedd_Kareiva: GHINS A1 NIGHS +42 270
#note Nice play by Nedd!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEIOQU A11 EQUId +71 326
#note Best play! This sealed the game pretty much.
>Nedd_Kareiva: GO D12 .OG +9 279
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEMNOO C14 AN +5 331
#note Wasn't sure exactly of my rack. I had AN, an M, and at least 1 O at the time. Just being extra defensive with an S out.
>Nedd_Kareiva: AAEIIIN 9M .I. +9 288
>Jonathan_Lindh: ELLMOOS A7 MOO +29 360
>Nedd_Kareiva: AIRS G2 SI.AR +15 303
#note This was another mistake by Nedd because it gave me an outplay. It didn't matter much at this point.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEINR 2G .ARNIE +8 368
#note Best play! Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man is on vacation! For this game!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (ELL) +6 374
#note I actually played pretty well given what I drew. The phony made the difference.
