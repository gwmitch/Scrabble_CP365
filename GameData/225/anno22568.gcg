#note This was a bad miss here. I didn't know the word (S)ORGO, which plays for 18 at 13D. That's definitely much better.

#note Ouch. 9H (F)ILIfORM! I knew there had to be something better than this. 9B MI(R) looks better too actually.

>Josh: AGHNOST 6K GOTH +20 292
#note I keep missing TA(UT)OGS. This might be better, but the biggest threat here is that he has a 6 ending in ZES from O1. Maybe he'll think GOTH doesn't take an S.
