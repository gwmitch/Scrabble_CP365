#note this is an extremely paranoid, and very bad play. BAP at 14F is definitely better, and VAN is even better. i wanted to play VAN but i became bizarrely paranoid about the lane on the right, but PAAN doesn't even block that many bingos anyway and keeps a terrible leave. I can't be making this type of plays. PAVAN is probably best and i missed it. -17

#note TRUG probably. i play weird. i don't know. i wanted to make sure i scored enough and didn't give him an easy score back or something weird. i really should think about my moves more carefully.  i also forgot about the spot at O8. -7
