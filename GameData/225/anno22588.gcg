>cesar: AAHIJLY 8G JAY +26 26
#note Zar: game 19 of the California Open. wow, i really prefer this to HAJI. quackle wants me to be aggressive and also prefers the leave of HAJI. -2.5
>jd: AEEFLMV 7H FAVE +22 22
>cesar: AEHILRU 8K LEHUA +29 55
#note JD: good thing this isn't CSW or his bingo hooks with FAVEL
>jd: EILMORV K4 LOV..IER +44 66
>cesar: ABEIRRT J10 BAR +23 78
#note Zar: BAR is pretty obvious but i had to be sure i wasn't missing a bingo. i spent a long time on this move. 
>jd: ?DEILMU 12C DULcIME. +76 142
#note JD: I wanted to play here to block the 7s lane on row 13 after Cesar's last play, which took many minutes, indicated he was close to a bingo.
>cesar: EIIORTY H12 .ITY +27 105
>jd: AAGGNNT M8 .ANGTAG +26 168
#note JD: he didn't quite put the I where I needed it for ANTIGANG
>cesar: ?EINOOR 9B EROsION +74 179
>jd: EEINNRZ 14J ZIN.ER +72 240
>cesar: EFLOTTW O12 WO.T +33 212
#note Zar: this and OFT sim basically identically. i wanted to not give up more super easy points.
>jd: AEEKNRT L1 KETA +30 270
#note JD: zar's last move forced me to open up more than I liked. I can try to set myself up for next turn by playing KEN at 13B, but this sims fine.
>cesar: BEEFLPT 2J FE.BLE +38 250
>jd: CDEINQR E5 CINQ. +30 300
#note JD: glad to see the new word!
>cesar: EIMNOPT 1D PIMENTO +97 347
#note Zar: i missed impotent and almost missed pimento.
>jd: DDEEPRS O1 D.EP +30 330
>cesar: DHIOOSU 10A OH +26 373
#note Zar: the U is bad enough that i should get rid of it anyway (also there's another U out). -3
>jd: ADERRSS 2C RAS +9 339
#note JD: quackle analysis suggests this play sucks. I ran out of time and felt I had to try something, but the bingo percentage is way too low - not that many bingos even have an E that early, and I block my R on column C and row 2 bingos. an obvious scoring play like BARD or BARDS at least leaves me in range to draw a lucky X play on column A or otherwise score myself back to a win. I probably need to draw a bingo that plays on the bottom anyway since he should block next turn, so perhaps the best way to do that is BARDS on this turn. the S is worth nothing since there are two more unseen!
>cesar: DGINOSU C2 .USING +18 391
#note Zar: i couldn't let that spot stand, but come on cesar! quackle likes RODDING and ODIOUS, then my stupid move. why wouldn't I play ROSING, which i'm 100% of? I was pretty sure RUSED was a word for some reason.. and i was extremely lucky that he let it go too. ugh.
>jd: DEIRSTU 6B U. +4 343
#note JD: too bad I didn't challenge RUSING! it didn't really occur to me to do so, although the game situation strongly encourages it. but I had a shot at winning if I pull the A here drawing for TARDIEST at the bottom and column A bingos, so I figured I should go for it.
>cesar: ACDOSWX A6 SOX +33 424
#note zar: cods so i can go out with WAX next turn. -11
>jd: DEIORST 14A DORTIES. +72 415
>jd: DEIORST --  -72 343
#note Zar: it was worth a try JD :P JD: it's good in collinssssss
>cesar: ACDW I11 W.D +20 444
#note -1
>jd: DEIORST M2 .ODES +24 367
#note JD: out of time. best is DISTORT or DOTIEST on row 14.
