>Jonathan_Lindh: CCIKOTU 8G COCK +24 24
#note Episode 2: Thanksgiving Weekend: The Horrible Tournament: 5th best play! 8G TUCK is best because of CIO leave. Only -3.1 equity slip.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EISSV K4 VISES +29 29
#note Well of course she has 2 S's. People always have the hooks when I do G8 positions.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ILNPRTU 6F TULIP. +16 40
#note 8th best play! I took forever on this play. J5 LINKUP is hard to see but best for 28. I like the leave on this play which is why I played it. -12.2 equity. Ouch.
>Harriette_Lakernick: GI 4K .IG +14 43
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEINRT H8 .RIENTEr +74 114
#note Best play! But misscored as 71. Ouch.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?BEEIRS 11C BEERI.St +68 111
#note Harriette missed 2 2x2's on this one. 11E fREEBIES and 11D BESIEGER.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADIOOOU 7B AUDIO +9 123
#note It's either play AUDIO in one of 4 positions or swap. I should have exchanged and kept a D but N4 AUDIO is best. I considered it, but thought it gave up too much. I get pounded on this one. -9
>Harriette_Lakernick: AEJN 8A JANE +44 155
#note I mean, Jesus Christ. All tournament!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EFOOORX 12B FOX +48 171
#note Best play! But how do I pick up another O? Multiple O's would be a problem in several games.
>Harriette_Lakernick: GY C11 ..GY +20 175
>Jonathan_Lindh: EFLOORR 10D ROO +21 192
#note Best play! FLOODER D3 is best TWL06 only play.
>Harriette_Lakernick: DNRY 14G N.RDY +13 188
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEFLLNR 14A FL. +18 210
#note Best play! Why do my racks suck?
>Harriette_Lakernick: HMO 13K MHO +23 211
>Jonathan_Lindh: BELNORR 6B BRO +29 239
#note Best play! I'm really not playing badly.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ADENOTT N1 NOTATED +78 289
#note Best play for Harriette! And only bingo! This is really not my tournament. After the BRO play and around the time she laid this down, I overdrew by 1 tile. Harriette threw back a Z which is normally a smart thing to do. However, what came next was horrible luck for her...
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEGLNR O7 ENLARGE +83 322
#note Best play! And only bingo! However, the N10 spot is worrisome with a Z out.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AHITW H1 WITHA. +48 337
#note I really liked this play! Good job Harriette! However, I didn't like this play from a WINNING perspective.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEIPQV 1L VI.A +33 355
#note 5th best play! I did not see Quackle's best choice 1J PAVANE keeping IQ but my play works out best in the end. I split the rack up into three components. L1 VINA to pluck the triple, L3 QAT to offload the Q, and EP for the remaining leave. The triple seemed like the riskier spot so I decided to plug that first. Quackle says -17.3 but I firmly believe this is best. Kind of like an endgame sequence!
>Harriette_Lakernick: AZ N10 ZA +64 401
#note Good Jon: Now if you throw the coffee pot across the room you'll be kicked out of the tournament. Bad Jon: Can we throw the bagels and cream cheese instead?
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEEPQW 3L QA. +41 396
#note Don't have my rack, but this was automatic and the best play. Nowhere for the Q elsewhere that scored anywhere close to as much.
>Harriette_Lakernick: DELMSTU 14M MUS +23 424
#note Good Jon: Refrain from throwing the bagels and the cream cheese. Bad Jon: Can we throw the muffins?
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEEPTU 12L UP +25 421
#note 3rd best play! I searched a long time for a winning endagme. L9 DEPTH is 22 but what about AEU? I don't know. -4.9 but not so sure.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EILNW 15L WEN +20 444
#note 2nd best play for Hariette! 3E WINTLE is her out. Kind of hard to see.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEET 4D DEAT. +18 439
#note 2nd best move! I did not see my out of TEATED for 9 points. It didn't matter anyways. I lose anyway. -5.6.
>Harriette_Lakernick: IL 3C LI +7 451
#note J8 KILT and 3F LIT score 9 for Hariette. -2 equity for her. Neither of us played ideal endgames but both were OK.
>Harriette_Lakernick:  (E) +2 453
#note Final Score recorded as 452-436 for Harriette. -34.8 equity excluding the VINA/QAT sequence which I felt was optimal. Everything but the very beginning and very end was completely perfect. And I still lost. I mean...come on.
