>Rafi: EJRTTVY 11E JET.Y +30 30
#note Maybe JOTTY instead? ERV is significantly better than RTV.

>Josh_Sokol: ANOORST J2 SANTOOR +68 136
>Rafi: AAGIRRT E9 RA. +10 79
#note I didn't think of AIRT or TARGA. This was a weird move... I am definitely sacrificing equity to play RAJ but I'm making the board more open long term. Quackle hates it and I don't really like it either, but I couldn't think of anything better at the time, and RAJ creates more variance. 
>Josh_Sokol: FIQR 3I F.QIR +42 178
>Rafi: AGINRTW 12C TWA +23 102
#note Didn't think of JETTYING until later in the game, although given the game score TWA might be better. I need a bingo pretty badly and with 10 E's unseen TWA bingos 43% of the time vs 14% after JETTYING.
>Josh_Sokol: ADNV L2 V.AND +18 196

>Josh_Sokol: CGL 8L CL.G +27 223
>Rafi: EILNRTU 6J .L. +4 186
#note I hit GENITURE with one of the 10(!) remaining E's. I bingo with an A and O in two spots, and NEURITIS with an I draw, and some of the consonants hit too. #1 play upon simulation of all choices.
>Josh_Sokol: ADHIPS 4D DISHPA. +37 260
>Rafi: AEINRTU D2 IN.URATE +62 248
#note Was incredulous that both my spots were blocked until I realized I still had this.

>Josh_Sokol: IZ 15M .IZ +42 322
>Rafi: ?AEOPRY 6A PYO.RhEA +70 344
#note OMG I might win. I could have easily missed this because I had taken so long on RAJ and OLD was down to 5 minutes... I didn't see it until after Josh played BIZ and then suddenly it popped into my head. 
>Josh_Sokol: DEENO A4 DE.ONE +33 355
>Rafi: CEEEIKO C1 EKE +24 368
#note A rare situation where the pre-endgame play seems pretty obvious, which was lucky because I was down to 4 minutes on my clock.
>Josh_Sokol: ABEEIST 5G AI +13 368
>Rafi: BCEEIOT 13A OBE +14 382
#note Not the best win, but a win - glad to see it under some time pressure. OC(T)ET/BIKIE is cool.
