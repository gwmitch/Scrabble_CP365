>Josh: ?ACIKNS J2 CAKINgS +82 82
#note I wasn't sure if this was a valid anagram, but I didn't see him challenging. If he lets it go, it's the best play, I think. I'll take it. Just SACKINg and CASKINg. Maybe CASKINg is better.
>Jason: FMOR 9D FROM +28 50
>Josh: CDFOPTY 5G COD.FY +30 112
#note I thought this was a strategic choice of board control and leave flexibility over points for 10F YOD. I thought the leave was 10 points better (PT over CFPT), and the board shape was far superior. Turns out CFPT on this board really isn't an issue. I score about 5 points less on average and I don't allow Jason to shape the board how he wants on the bottom? I guess? Yeah, I should have taken the points.
>Jason: ABEGHIN 2G BEA.HING +82 132
>Josh: EOPTTTT H1 P.TT. +24 136
#note Not expecting this turn of events, though! I didn't think P(I)TT(Y)* was a word, and the two extra points hardly made it worth thinking about, as H1 was a much more important spot to keep in check. Turns out that even if L1 T(I)TT(Y) (which I failed to consider) has better overall prospects for me in general (which I don't think it does either), this works out best for me. Jason had THIONYL ready to go!

>Jason: AHILPT 1L PIAL +39 211
>Josh: AEEIIRS 4H .I.E +16 173
#note Wait... I was going to play (K)EA until he played PIAL. Ugh. Definite mistake (despite having been small).
>Jason: EHRT 5E RE...... +34 245
>Josh: AEEIIRS H10 .EREIS +21 194
#note Yeah, I don't think I'm fishing again. Need to blow the board open first.**** This is something you should never say, ever. Definitely a pivotal mistake. I need to play I8 (R)AI or (R)EI

>Jason: ?IINORT 3C OI +11 331
#note Jason was running into serious time trouble here. He said he thought RIGATONI fit. If this was his rack (as it seems to me), he missed something huge in 14E IN(HI)bITOR!) 
>Josh: ADGLRVX 13L LAX +35 358
#note Another clear mistake, as I thought GRDV was better than GLDV. Not here.
>Jason: ?INQRTU 2A QUIRT +35 366

#note I thought I had found my win here, but it came just short.

#note Missed dONEE, but there was nothing to be done about it.
