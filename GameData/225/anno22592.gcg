#note this is THE WORST PLAY OF ALL TIME.  play carb, abaci, bract, something. however, the main issue here is that i thought i had 20 fewer points because i made two 10-pt addition errors in a row earlier. if i had known, CARB probably comes down (i didn't think of ABACI because I was worried about drawing 4 consonants and wanted to keep some vowels, remember I thought I had 20 fewer points). -24
