#note This is the penultimate round of WGPO Word Cup. Winter and I have been double-Gibsonized. He's beaten me three times at this event, and it's starting to hurt. In fact, he pushed me out of first place in the previous round. We now have equal 22-22 records, but he has me on spread by about 100 points. I can feel it slipping away, and need something good to happen this game.
>Carl: AAMNRTW 7F WAN +12 12
#note I was initially surprised that this sims so badly, but I can see why now. WATT scores a few more points and is a little better for defense/board control (-4).
>Winter: DENNORT 9A DONNERT +64 72
>Carl: ?AEMRTT A8 A.MiTTER +149 161
#note I nearly missed this, and probably would have done the obvious MATTERED A2, except that the S-hook led me to go through all the possibilities a second time.
>Winter: OX -  +0 72
>Carl: AIIKRRU D8 K.AUR +28 189
#note As soon as I hit my clock, I saw the better placement. (-2)
>Winter: OX B13 OX +38 110
>Carl: EIILORU 15A .OILIER +18 207
#note OUTLIE J6 is better (-2)
>Winter: ACSV E4 VACS +25 135
>Carl: EEENPUY 14F YE +28 235
#note PYE 14E has to be better. (-7) This is a serious hole in my game. Generally, when it's a difference between a bad leave and a worse leave, it's not worth it to sacrifice points. Intellectually, I understand that, but it's hard for me to follow through on it in practice.

#note N1 PI is winning the sim handily. I'm unsure what's going on here. (-7)
>Winter: DDEI 4C DI.ED +20 252
>Carl: BCEILPS 11C P.BIC +22 339
#note Moving in for the kill. Also on the table: BIS N1. Next turn perhaps; lots of Is to be drawn.
>Winter: IV C2 VI. +14 266
#note I feel like Winter played this game really well. Despite the 3x3, my lead was never unassailable, and he always managed to find ways to make a comeback
>Carl: EELQSWY 5A WYE +17 356
#note A terrible draw to my ELS rack! Note that plays like WYE F2 don't defend against huge Z plays at 1A, and I won't be able to do anything about the spot for several turns. A play like VIDE forces him to bingo through the V.
>Winter: ?AEGIOR 2A RA.IGOtE +76 342
>Carl: EIILPQS 1F LIP +30 386
#note A great draw devastated by Winter's bingo. Not only is my lead erased, but I can no longer wrap up the game neatly with QIS, DEFI because of threats like FEZ, FIZ, JEFE, JIAO etc. Maybe I should just play QIS anyway and hope he doesn't have those things?
>Winter: ESZ N4 SEZ +37 379
>Carl: EGIJOQS B1 J.G +14 400
#note Dismaler and dismaler. My reasoning here was that taking out one of the two big F spots might inspire him to use the other one, perhaps burning the I. Or if he instead blocks QI N1, I can take out the other F spot with SEE M5 and then play either QI D1 or QAT I6.
>Winter: AEIORTU N1 UT +20 399
#note But it turns out the F was in the bag and I have to eat it.
