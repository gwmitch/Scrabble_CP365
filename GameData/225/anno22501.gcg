>Jonathan_Lindh: BDPRTWY 8G WRY +18 18
#note Episode 1: Thanksgiving Weekend: The Horrible Tournament:
This is actually the best play. Everything sucks. I debated between this and PRY. PRY's leave is slightly better but this is better by 1.5 equity.
>Joe_Roberdeau: KMOO 7I MOOK +23 23
#note A new word by Joe! A lot of new words were played in this game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABDFPRT K5 PR.B +16 34
#note Correct play is probably BARF and AWRY for 27 at F7. I did this because Joe looked close to something big on the K8 triple line. -11.3 according to Quackle. I see its point.
>Joe_Roberdeau: AENS 8K .ANES +31 54
#note Joe took a while on this. I thought it was a strange move but he might be holding another S which confirms my suspicions he's close to a bingo.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACDFIQT L4 QI +26 60
#note 3rd best move! I strongly considered QADI L2 which is Quackle's top choice but I didn't want to leave myself vowelless given how I drew this tournament. -5.6 according to Quackle, but I'd do it again.
>Joe_Roberdeau: BGNO O4 BONG. +11 65
#note What is Joe up to? This play seemed strange as well.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACDFHTT F7 DAFT +20 80
#note Best play! CHT leave is valuable just as I thought. I misscored this as 19 instead of 20. I made math errors all tournament.
>Joe_Roberdeau: ?DEFISU E1 DIFfUSE +73 138
#note Also E1 SUlFIDE for 73. I suspect Joe was close to a bingo for a while. I like DIFfUSE better because I don't like slotting an S in the triple lane. Wise choice on Joe's part.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CCHIPRT M2 CHIP +40 120
#note Best! I debated between CHIP and CHIC here. CRT is better than PRT. This is also part of the reason I did QI instead of QADI. In addition to the vowel situation, I have a 30+ comeback on the M line if I draw an I. I did. I figured Joe would be bingoing elsewhere. I was right.
>Joe_Roberdeau: ADEZ 1E .AZED +48 186
#note I wanted to throw the tile bag across the room on this play. It was like this ALL tournament. 
>Jonathan_Lindh: CHNRRRT 5C CH.RR +10 130
#note 2nd best play! I mean come on. 3 R's?!!! Quackle likes I7 (MY)RRH better by equity 15.5 to 12.9 but since I'm not holding an S and since Joe has turned over 11 tiles in 2 turns AND I've been drawing terribly this entire tournament I'm not leaving him an S line. -2.6 according to Quackle but I like my play better and I'd do it again.
>Joe_Roberdeau: AANORTV -AANOR +0 186
#note I don't what I would have done if Joe blocked the T. 
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEENRTY 10D EN.REATY +63 193
#note Best play! And only bingo. These are the type of bingos I had to find in this tournament. One of the most pivotal plays of the games. Back in this game.
>Joe_Roberdeau: AIM 11K AMI +20 206
#note Did Joe pick up the other blank? There are alot of back hooks onto to AMI and the triple letter/double word score combination should draw attention.
>Jonathan_Lindh: LLOTUUX 2D T.X +51 244
#note Best play! I mean, who picks up two U's with the X? This play scores the most and neutralizes the F2 hotspot. The leave is awful, but H10 EXTOLL and 11D XU offer similar dreadful leaves.
>Joe_Roberdeau: AE 2L A.E +10 216
#note Joe is fishing again.
>Jonathan_Lindh: LLOSUUU 11C ULU +12 256
#note 2nd best play! Three fucking U's! Come on! I swear it was like this this whole tourney! Quackle likes C3 LOCULOUS for 22 best but I strongly disagree. I need to keep an S and LOSU is much better than U. I assume Joe will be bingoing next turn and I need to create another line so I can bingo later. -2.6 equity but this is still best.
>Joe_Roberdeau: ?AEGILN 12F LINeAGE +81 297
#note Tied for the 3rd best play for Joe but this was actually a game killing mistake for Joe. Joe needed to play 12I rEGINAL for 83 as it doesn't tangle a letter above the triple word score. His play allows me to create more lanes. An H12 play combined with the SULU hook and 2 S's out will create a world of complications for Joe.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ALLORSU H12 .ULL +12 268
#note 10th best play! C3 LOCULAR is idiotic Quackle! I need to bingo and that play blocks my SULU hook. This is best despite what Quackle says. Quackle says -8.7 I say this is correct. AROS is great for bingoing.
>Joe_Roberdeau: AVV N10 VAV +23 320
#note Joe sees the N10 spot and closes it. Wise choice. Did he have something better that hit the double word score? Maybe yes maybe no.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENOORS 3C OO. +14 282
#note 2nd best play! I think this was my rack. D4 O(H)O is Quackle's top choice and gets 2 more points. Probably right but my play does the job. Very slight error. -2 equity according to Quackle.
>Joe_Roberdeau: DEITW 14F WI.TED +20 340
#note Joe has the right idea. Close down bingo and score enough to outrun me. However, I created another unblockable Jumpjon setup. He's about to get torched.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGINRS 15H .ASERING +87 369
#note Best play! Dagger time! Joe wisely held to check to make sure I didn't play any phony 2's on this one. I was about to B8 ERASING but saw this better play. Another new word played during this game! ERASING could give up a huge J comeback on the A line. This does leave open the possibility of an A12 J play for 46 points if Joe has the J or the S, but then I would probably have a 33 point comeback like JOIN A12.
>Joe_Roberdeau: EEIJNOT 14M OE +10 350
#note Joe drew dreck out of the bag after WILTED. I could just tell from the way he played this based on his body language. It's over.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIJNST 12A JINS +46 415
#note Best play! Finally! Good luck! I draw the J and the S out of the bag on the last turn and hit the 46 point J play. A12 JETS as well but ET gives me better outs so I thought.
>Joe_Roberdeau: EIOOT A12 .O +9 359
#note Joe was low on time and probably not tracking exactly. He missed E4 fOOTIE for 10 points which was his out. That's hard to see though. He also didn't see the also very hard to see (CHURR)O hook which form plays that comprise most of the top 10. If I knew Joe would do this I would have kept IN for (JO)IN A12 for 33. -23.4 equity slip for Joe.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ET 14A ET +14 429
#note Best play! You mean I played a perfect endgame? Yes! This game was typical of the racks I drew and I had to claw this one out. I'm now 5-0 against Joe and I'm not really sure why. -32.8 equity according to Quackly but I think this is wrong. -13.3 is more like it given -19.5 of the -32.8 were intentional plays I would do again. Quackle's selection through the C would have lost me the game. 7 of 13 plays were best plays but it was probably more like 11 of 13 given how some of Quackle's choices would have probably lost me the game. Best game of the tournament and I'm proud to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Final score recorded as 436-359. Correct score 437-359.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (EIOT) +8 437
