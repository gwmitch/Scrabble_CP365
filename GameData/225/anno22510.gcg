#note Episode 3: Thanksgiving Weekend: The Horrible Tournament: Lest the cross-tables readers think I'm just complaining about tiles, I blew this game completely and probably handed David the tournament. Every time I have lost in the first game, the winner of our games has won the tournament. It continues! A fitting word for David given his stellar performance!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DHIIOU E8 .UDIO +12 12
#note Best play! Who picks up this dreck with a blank? I swear, it was like this ALL THE TIME!
>David_Engelhardt: AFHT D12 HAFT +32 54
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ABHIIN 15A BAH. +27 39
#note 7th best play! I should have seen BRAINISH I7 for 66 which I knew cold or its anagram at I5 for 64. Bad miss but this ended up working out. 15A BAITH is an intriguing pass on the bingo for 30 which I did not see and comes in at only -3.9. Anyways, bad miss on the bingo but my sequence worked out better. -12.7. 1 of 4 missed bingos in the tournament, and none of them affected outcomes. I swear, I didn't play so badly.
>David_Engelhardt: AX 14D .AX +29 83
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?CEIINO 15F INvOICE +86 125
#note Best play! My sequence ended up working better.
>David_Engelhardt: Q J14 Q. +31 114
#note It was like this all tournament.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEPTVY L11 PEEV. +20 145
#note 2nd best play! Terrible post bingo racks were a major problem this tournament. Quackle likes L10 VEEPEE for 22 keeping TY but this might be better because it keeps a vowel. -1.4 to Quackle but I'm not so sure.
>David_Engelhardt: EIORRSW J2 WORRIES +79 193
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEENOTY C10 OATY +30 175
#note 3rd best play! This sims so close with I2 AYE and C12 OY for 26 each I'd call this stylistic preference. Only -.4 to Quackle but I'd do it again.
>David_Engelhardt: DGOO K10 GOOD +25 218
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEIMNS M6 MEANIES +69 244
#note Best play! However there is an argument for the M5 MEANIES for 3 less. The L8 spot for cheap points.
>David_Engelhardt: CFT 8L F.CT +39 257
>Jonathan_Lindh: IJORRUY 4H JU.OR +40 284
#note Best play! And I drew the Y.
>David_Engelhardt: IPZ B8 ZIP +30 287
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAIRUWY N3 AWAY +33 317
#note 2nd best play! N1 AIRWAY for 55 is clearly best. Huge mistake and I looked forever for a 5 or a 6 to the double word score. This was massive I feel -26.2.
>David_Engelhardt: EENN O1 NENE +23 310
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIIRRTU M1 RUT +12 329
#note Quackle likes RUIN L1 for rack balance and 7 fewer but no bingo lanes really exist. Ehh. -10.4 Quackle but I don't think it's that bad.
>David_Engelhardt: EEGIIKR -GEEK +0 310
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEGIIKR O8 .IGER +7 336
#note 10E DIKE is best according to Quackle. TIGER shuts off the the T lane with a blank out. A bingo to the T would cost me massively.
>David_Engelhardt: EMS F6 ME.S +14 324
#note DIKE would have blocked that I guess.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIIKNNV H7 V.IN +7 343
#note 4th best play. Yeah, DRINK I7. This isn't good but I needed to kill the E line.
>David_Engelhardt: LOT 14L .OLT +14 338
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEIKLT E1 TALKIE +24 367
#note Quackle rates this as the best play but it is a sure loser. Just play ALIKE and get this game over with. I was worried about 2 fewer points and an extra T. I blew it!
>David_Engelhardt: ?DGNSU 1B DUS.iNG +27 365
#note I suck. This was his only win!
>David_Engelhardt:  (D) +4 369
#note We recounted. Glad to know it was correct. Why did I screw this up? Total equity loss -70 but in reality -50 as about -20 of it was intentional blocks that don't sim well in Quackle. The endgame was horrible but this wasn't THAT badly played either.
