#note The sim gives an edge to 7G YA. I thought it might be close, but 8 points seemed a lot to give up for a P on my rack. Apparently this is a significant error. Weird. Guess I misevaluated this one. I guess it is because I am making it so easy to underlap for lots of points? That might explain why 7G YAP also sims better. Also I guess I am not leaving many bingo lines open.

#note Tough call. Decided to keep most of the rack together.

#note Sims neck-and-neck with the bingoes.

#note Already down to 11:41 after this play. The first four racks were noodle-scratchers. Need to speed up from here on.

#note I was going to do KIMONO before his last play. Then I decided he must have had a strong leave. Otherwise he probably would have played for more points through DEARIES somehow. I like shutting down eights here.

#note Blocking bingo lines won't win alone, since I may not be able to block row 15. I need to keep scoring in case I need to outrun a bingo. Keeping the Z seemed like a good idea for that reason.

#note I am very annoyed that I flushed a win down the toilet here. My first instinct was that I was misspelling this. Then I decided it must be related to WURZEL, so there is no T. I was then quite sure I had the spelling right. The real plays aren't fantastic, with WIZEN still losing a decent amount of the time, but losing a turn here would have cost me the game for sure. A dopy mistake at an awful time. Fortunately, Deen bought it so this did not cost me.
