#note EKING and ZEK are also good plays. I wasn't sure which was bettter. Quackle suggests ZEK.

#note I liked this play at the time. However, I actually didn't think of EEK, which might just be better anyway.

>Noah: ADEINNW 8L DAWN +41 87
#note My thought process: "Oh good I have a good EKED play. Hm, ADEGINNW that looks familiar, but DAWEN and DEWAN aren't verbs, so there can't be anyone in there." Gunther plays, I play DAWN, hit clock, a second later, "oh fuck awninged."

#note Interesting rack. I didn't spot JEHAD 11A, the highest scoring play, or HAJ 14D, which is another great choice, but they aren't necessarily correct. I kind of liked this play just because it put the nail in the coffin of the top right of the board, scores well, and keeps good row 11 potential for next turn. Other plays to consider are HADJ 10K, JAWED/JAW N6, and even HEAD 11B, because the J isn't bad here. HEAD probably has to be too much of a sacrifice though. I would rather HADJ than HAJ because it blocks some of the more powerful lanes on this board. I also preferred this to JAWED/HADJ for the reasons already stated. I'm thinking JEHAD is probably better because it scores more point.

#note Row 15 is by far his most legitimate winning chance, so i closed it off.
