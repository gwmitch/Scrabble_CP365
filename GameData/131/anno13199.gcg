#note 182,000 hits in Google.  One who belongs to a guild.  Yet another dictionary disappointment, though it, too, isn't even Collins.  Sigh.  This rack has no 8s.  "Best" is 13B GU(I)D 12.  Meh.

#note I should have known LINDEN.  I saw SNIDE, but it's too consonant heavy and volatile.  If I'd count anything as a mistake, this'd be it.

#note I guess between that and ZONED I had it coming, but still it's kinda frustrating.  hEKT(A)RES is 101.

#note Again with LINDEN.  I saw CINEOL but I thought it'd prevent me from hitting GLITZIER.  Had tracked one too many Is.  My play is weak but I thought necessary to make any sort of comeback.

#note Nice fit, but either place allows a hard comeback.  He recommend maybe GLITZIER comes out ahead.  Champ says... PINAS(T)ER is strongest.
