#note At 13E, INJECT and INKJET play.  Both give away a bit too much.  Tough rack.  I'm fine with my play.

#note I *thought* OUTFLOWING was good.  Again, didn't see a point in opening all those lanes, though I guess the T in THUJA is a tiny bit riskier.

#note Of note: ETYMA.
>Heather_Steffy: DOP A13 POD +28 279
#note Held and released.  Bogus hook.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFIITU L1 FETA +30 362
#note Really bad leave, but I'm hoping I get the Q to absorb it.  TUFA isn't that much better considering all that.
>Heather_Steffy: ELX 1L .LEX +42 321
#note Although that was less likely to happen putting a T there.
>Ryan_Fischer: CIIRRTU H4 CURI.. +11 373
#note Considered CIRRI, but there's one plausible bingo lane left that I needed to block.  If I play CURIE, she could come back with ACQUIT at worst.  So, CURI(OS) avoids all those threats.
