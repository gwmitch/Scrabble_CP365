#note Funny that all three bingos fit as triple-triples.
>Nigel: AGIIOST I1 .GIO +6 121
#note A nice play, keeping the board more open than plays like AGIO L7 or AGO 2M.

>Noah: CEEGIOU 7B OGEE +24 396
#note 4C is usually the superior placement, but I think I am up so much that this sacrifice is actually worth it...even though he still bingos a lot anyway. And, I don't really mind the YOGEE hook.
>Nigel: AAEORST 15A AEROSTA. +77 262

>Nigel: ELLPRUV N3 .VERPULL +67 329
#note Not a word.
>Noah: ACEJNNR 8M J.N +30 426
#note I once knew that ELLOPRUV only contained one valid word, but today I leaned toward OVERPULL* being good. I also realized that I had a very good chance of winning if I just left it on.
>Nigel: EIISTUW 4D WE +28 357
>Noah: ABCEINR B10 CARIB. +32 458
>Nigel: DIISTUU -DIUU +0 357
#note DUI 14D might be better. It's an annoying position. Exchanging makes the gap too large, and DUI the bingos too unlikely, a recurring pre-endgame theme while trailing.
>Noah: AEEIMNZ 8A ME +18 476
#note It seemed like some sort of A column TY word was his main chance to win. I could also just take MAIZE J11.
>Nigel: EILNSTX L11 XI +37 394
>Noah: AEIINUZ A11 ZA +26 502
#note Blocking some possibilities like SANITATED while guarding against potential row 3 plays I missed when looking at the pool.
