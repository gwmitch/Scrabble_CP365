#note This is definitely my most interesting turn. Tons of options here. ZEE 4A, LEET 4A, ZLOTY N10, ZEP 11J, mEZE 10L, and this. I would not play LEET because it doesn't really accomplish anything. I also don't really like mEZE because it ramps up the entropy even more. ZEP is a decent option, though it's kind of like LEET, not accomplishing much but a decent score. I would rather play ZEE than ZEP because of what it does to the board. I think that it can lead to a more closed board often, because of plays through the Z. I don't need to gridlock the board or anything, but keeping it tame would be helpful. ZEE 4A is decent, but I don't know what his likelihood of a play along column A is -- probably too high. ZLOTY is also a reasonable option, though EEE is pretty lame.
