#note I do not have a good record against this man, especially not in poker! He has a small psychological edge over me. Only a few players share that fortune!

>Josh: ?AADKOS K11 OAK +20 112
#note I missed 2K (V)ODKA. I guess I should play that? I prefer not to give Dean easy ways to score though.
>Dean_Porporo: LLUY C11 .ULLY +18 174
>Josh: ?ADENNS M4 ScANNED +72 184
#note I missed the 73-pointer, M4 SANDmEN.

>Josh: ABDEGNO N9 DOGBANE +84 268
#note Took me waaaay too long to see this. I completely missed BONDAGE on my rack.
>Dean_Porporo: HW 15A WH. +36 280
>Josh: AELORTU 2J O.ULE +20 288
#note I chickened out of OATER here. O11 OATER is definitely the play. See how psyched out I get?!
>Dean_Porporo: HU O14 UH +32 312
>Josh: AEEMNRT 1L MATE +38 326
#note Silly, too many e's left, I should play METE.
>Dean_Porporo: EEFL 1G FEEL +23 335

#note whew, it's still a game...
>Dean_Porporo: ?FX 12A Fl.X +52 387
>Josh: AEIRTTW D2 .WITTER +22 427
#note Those A-words kill me. I wasn't sure enough to play A(T)WITTER. Thought I could definitely be confusing it with AFLUTTER. What a game this would have been for me if I hadn't chickened out!! This is embarrassing in theory, yes, but it's not a huge loss in winning chances.
>Dean_Porporo: BCEOPRT N6 BE +22 409
#note He should play BO to set up outs for himself. C7 BOP is equivalent.

#note -2 to C7 POT.
