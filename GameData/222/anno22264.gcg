#note October 25th Chicago Scrabble Episode 1:
Press The Button!

Best Play! And only bingo.
>Marty_Gabriel: BBHOT E4 HOBB.T +26 26
#note Nice play! I don't believe I've ever seen this word played in a life game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEGKNS D1 NAKED +35 111
#note 3rd best choice! D1 KNEAD is 43 points leaving GS. Equity of 48.6 vs. 40.6. -8 equity.
>Marty_Gabriel: HOW 7G HOW +28 54
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFGIOSS 6H FOG +22 133
#note 9th best play! Best is 10B FOGS. But I wanted to bingo and maximize my open lanes. -4.9 according to Quackle.
>Marty_Gabriel: AOR 1A ROA. +12 66
#note Marty took forever on this. Was he looking to triple triple or merely block?
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIIRSS A1 .IA +3 136
#note My play doesn't show but I'm trying to bingo and EIRSS is a very strong leave. -10.5 according to QUackle but I'd do it again.
>Marty_Gabriel: AEINRTU 5I TAURINE +73 139
#note Best play for Marty! And only bingo!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEILRSS 10C RESILES +73 209
#note Best play for me! I saw N2 REINLESS and passed but did not see F8 TIRELESS. This is still best.
>Marty_Gabriel: CIRX O4 X.RIC +66 205
#note Ouch! XERIC is clutch. He's right in the game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADDLUY M3 DA.LY +26 235
#note 4th best play! I like mine better than Quackle's N1 YULAN which I think is stupid but oh well. Quackle says it's -3.9 but I trust my own judgement.
>Marty_Gabriel: EMOV 11H MOVE +24 229
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADRRTUU L9 DURA +20 255
#note 4th best play! L8 DURRA is better but only by 1.4 equity. RUT is superior leave to TU apparently. I think my place is just fine.
>Marty_Gabriel: EMT L4 T.EM +25 254
#note A new 4 by Marty! And one that I just learned!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFLNRTU 13I FAULT +30 285
#note Best play!
>Marty_Gabriel: DP 10K P.D +10 264
#note I don't know Marty's rack, but I thought this play was rather tilty for him. Is he close to a bingo or just short on vowels?
>Jonathan_Lindh: CENNORS 12B CONNERS +76 361
#note Best play! This is where I take over the game. CONNERS at 14E is the only other bingo. This is better by 2 points.
>Marty_Gabriel: AJW 14H JAW +39 303
#note Maybe I should have done 14E CONNERS. Then again, maybe not.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEINPST 15I SAPIENT +92 453
#note THEN AGAIN, MAYBE NOT! Best play and only bingo!
>Marty_Gabriel: EEGIOOZ J4 G..E +16 319
#note Marty scored this play as 19 points. It should have been 16 points. And why didn't block B6?
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ILQUYZ B6 QU.Z +42 495
#note Best play! Why didn't Marty block this?
>Marty_Gabriel: EGINOO 9J NO.I +15 334
#note 2nd best play for Marty! F5 GO is better by 1 point.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ILY B11 I.iLY +18 513
#note 3rd best play! I did not see FAULTY and find my best out N11 LAYIN for 26 points. Even this game I had end game troubles. This is the best non-FAULTY out. When I set ICILY down I began looking for a better play while double checking my score. Marty thought I was going to hit his clock instead of stopping it while going out. Hence he began yelling, PRESS THE BUTTON, PRESS THE BUTTON referring to the middle stop button.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (EGO) +8 521
#note I began laughing my ass off during lunch about this comment. Russia disputes American influence in Ukraine? PRESS THE BUTTON, PRESS THE BUTTON! Do want saving at Staples, PRESS THE BUTTON, PRESS THE BUTTON! Marty went over by 1:58 so -20 on his time. Recorded score 521-317. Actual score 521-314. Score I should have had: 529-314.
