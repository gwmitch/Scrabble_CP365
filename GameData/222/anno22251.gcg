>Josh: ADEGMNR H4 MANGER +24 24
#note I thought the exchange 1s might be better but I just took the safer play I guess.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AKV 5E KAV. +22 22
>Josh: AABDEIQ 6H .IQAAB +37 61
#note Maybe 6B QADI is better here. Prevents scoring on his end. Also it may be worth keeping ADE here with just (N)IQAB, as the potential for disaster is not much larger than with DE and the potential for a bingo next turn improves.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: DEPSU N2 DUPES +40 62
#note This was also a thing that could happen but it's OK as it gives me a spot to score.
>Josh: DDEMSUW F4 D.W +15 76
#note Saw DUM(P) 4K after I played. That seems safer.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?EHIOSV 9E OVE.fISH +64 126
#note 8A cOHESIV(E) would have hurt
>Josh: DEEJMSU 4L JU.E +28 104
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?AAEILR 2G sALARIE. +60 186
#note K8 A(S)sAILER is 64, but I don't know if that's correct over this
>Josh: DEEMNSS J8 S.DESMEN +67 171
>Bernard_Gotlieb: HOY -  +0 186
#note Clutch challenge draw! Now I'm back in the game.
>Josh: CEEEPTT 1F CEPE +39 210
>Bernard_Gotlieb: HOY K11 HOY +37 223
>Josh: AEFFRTT 15E FATTE. +27 237
#note Ugh, I chickened out of (N)AFFER for 48. That's huge obviously. Turns the game around.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: INNORU 14A RUNION +25 248
>Bernard_Gotlieb: INNORU --  -25 223
>Josh: CFOORRZ 14D COZ +70 307
#note So lucky that he confused RONION with RUNION* here.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: INNORTU D10 RUNI. +14 237
#note I feel like at this point he just gave up. :/
>Josh: DFIIORR 8A FIORD +33 340
>Bernard_Gotlieb: NOOT 8L ONTO +21 258
>Josh: EINRTUX M2 .X.R. +48 388
#note I knew it was close between this and C11 NIX, but I couldn't resist the style. I could have played off UNITE somewhere to fish for the even more stylish EXURBAN though!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: LLN 11C N.LL +8 266
>Josh: EIINOTU N8 .UITION +18 406
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ABW M13 WAB +28 294
