>Josh: EEGILNT H4 GENTILE +70 70
#note This game was very important. I had to win, since it would give Joe less of a chance of running away with victory and would give me a good chance of getting first  if I win 2/3 after and an almost guarantee of cashing. I was very confident that I would defeat Joe here. Scored as 72.
>Joe_Edley: CNOZ 5E COZ.N +32 32
>Josh: ABEEPTW 6F WA. +38 108
#note To start things off this turn I decided I shouldn't play WA(N)E so as not to give him easy points if he has a D. What a stupid oversight. Joe averages not even 0.2 more points after WANE.
>Joe_Edley: AIISX J1 IXIAS +45 77
>Josh: BEEPRTU I1 BET +22 130
#note I considered this and E(X)PERT. Looked like this controlled things a bit better and gave me a much stronger shot at a bingo next turn. I was already getting distracted though, so I took a while not thinking about anything. 
>Joe_Edley: DEOOPSW 11D WOOPSED +85 162
#note held and released after I saw SWOOPED and sort of remembered the pair.
>Josh: EHNPRTU 10F HU. +31 161
>Joe_Edley: AIM 1F IAM.. +27 189
>Josh: EENOPRT 12A PORE +28 189
#note I spent forever making sure I didn't have a bingo and ended up making a *insert homonym of PORE here* play. I missed 12C NOPE, OPE and 12A POTEEN. 12:45 on my clock after this play. Not good.
>Joe_Edley: ?EEFRRU B7 FERRE.Us +74 263
#note Once again held and released by me. I hated letting this go. FERRIC and FERROUS are already words, why should there be another word relating to iron? 12I FERRUlE is the play here.
>Josh: EGILNTT 12I LETTING +75 264
#note I thought this and 2A scored identically. I think two points makes a difference here, and I should have played at 2A. 
>Joe_Edley: DGMU 8A D.GUM +30 293
>Josh: BDEIKOY N10 BO.EY +32 296
#note Definitely didn't know what I was doing here. I was really under a lot of pressure.
>Joe_Edley: AQT 2D QAT +18 311
>Josh: ?ADEIKS O7 KADI +31 327
#note Spent more time looking for a bingo that didn't exist. Time winding down for me.

#note I don't think you are ready for this choke. This is my worst choke ever, since winning and losing this game was extremely important for the rest of the tournament's sake. I had around 3 minutes left. First I saw ECHOLES(S), and figured I should keep looking to find something more plausible. Then I look and I see ECHELLES and FLEECHES which after a minute I realize don't play. So then I see CHEFLESS and ACHELESS and wonder which is more plausible, then I decide ACHELESS is, forgetting about ECHOLESS, with -2:38 seconds on my clock.

My whole thought process was wrong. I knew he had AVIATOR(S) and no matter what I needed to block, but I thought VITA at O1 would be too much for me to outrun. I just needed to do simple endgame math from the start of my clock winding down. I can play so many things that block him and still win the game with ease after VITA. So not only was my original gameplan for the turn completely off, but I forgot about the most plausible bingo I saw and played a phony, which accounts for around a 150-point spread loss and 150-point spread gain for Edley, who was then in 2nd place, highly in contention. Had I gone on to win this game as I planned, I would have been in 3rd place and Edley in 2nd, I believe. 
>Joe_Edley: AAIORTV 14E AVIATOR. +71 483
>Joe_Edley:  (CEEHLS?) +22 505
#note Final score recorded as 371-505. I also studied LACHESE(S), so I should have known it. I wish I could forget about this game.
