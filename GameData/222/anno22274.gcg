#note ironically I've long wanted to play the 2x2 the hard way, but didn't realize it was possible on this turn (L4)!! I also almost chickened out and played AGENIZED, but I was pretty sure it was good
>Bruce_Ward: AAEHSTT -  +0 15
#note he challenged.
>JD: FMNOSUZ 12H ZON.S +48 224
#note I wasn't sure if he would spot HASTATE or not, but this conveniently  blocked both spots for it

#note I thought that the best sequence would be blocking JAY at 13A, but if I give him JAY and play NOVEL then I get to play JOB in response, which ends up being 6 points better than optimal play after BOP.
