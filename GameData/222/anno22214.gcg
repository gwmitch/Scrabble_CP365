>Michael_Fagen: ABDOUY 8H DAUBY +30 30
>Josh: DENOPPX 9G POX +43 43
#note I missed 9H EXPO
>Michael_Fagen: ?EFOORT 10E FOOTERs +81 111
#note tough to miss EXPO. Michael has two better bingos here.
>Josh: DEILNPU 11F PIED +33 76
#note I missed 11C UPEND and 11B PULED, as well as E8 UP(F)IELD. Those are options to consider as well.	This does at least complicate the game
>Michael_Fagen: ABIO 12C OBIA +17 128
#note Observing this game, Jason claims Michael did not make the right play here. I noted that this makes a C a valuable tile to draw and creates a bingo lane that Michael will have a hard time dealing with
>Josh: HKLNNTU L4 HUNK. +30 106
#note I missed 13E THUNK, which methunks is the right play.
>Michael_Fagen: DQU C10 QU.D +28 156
>Josh: DELNTTW 13F LEWD +17 123
#note Apparently, according to a static simulation, I'm supposed to fish with I7 T(AXED). That hits on this board with an O for LETDOWN at 13F. It may also be valid to assume that Michael may open the board next turn and give me a spot for the bingos I draw into with an A and an I. On the other hand it's unlikely he'll give me a spot even if he opens the board a bit. In that sense my play seems more sensible. But I could be wrong in my analysis.
>Michael_Fagen: LV 5K L.V +12 168
>Josh: GLMNSTT -GMNT +0 123
#note That play is bad news for me. Michael is probably sitting on a bingo-ey S rack. Apparently I'm supposed to keep ST here. Makes sense. This is a few points worse.
>Michael_Fagen: AEOSTZ 14I AZOTES +73 241
>Josh: EIJLOST 15E JOLES +40 163
#note I was not happy making this play, but I can't let Michael have that spot down there. I am too far behind not to score and prevent him from doing the same.
>Michael_Fagen: AEGNV 13K GANEV +29 270
>Josh: EIINRTU 6I RUI. +8 171
#note I have to draw into multiple bingos at this point, so opening the board is a must.
>Michael_Fagen: IIII -IIII +0 270
>Josh: AEEIINT K8 .I.E +10 181
>Michael_Fagen: AEINRRS N5 SIERRAN +68 338
>Josh: AEEINRT 5C ARENITE +66 247
>Michael_Fagen: GHIT H1 TIGH. +39 377
#note I played ARENITE to prevent big scores at H1.
>Josh: AAEENTT 1H .ETANATE +77 324
>Josh: AAEENTT --  -77 247
#note Pure frustration, although this is probably my only chance at winning. I had overdrawn and Michael found the blank. Odds were not in my favor this game.
>Michael_Fagen: CMSW 3L CWM +38 415
#note I had drawn the blank once again with my provisionals.

>Josh: ACENORT 2B ANORET.C +74 336
>Michael_Fagen: ?AFGILM 1A FlAM +43 502
#note EDIT: Michael played AZOLES, not AZOTES, so his last tile was a T, not an L.
