>Matthew_Larocque: ABEIOST H7 BO +8 8
#note I guess 3-vowel leaves are risky to fish with, but I needed a good amount of luck here.
>Joe_Gaspard: IRWY I4 WIRY +25 25
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINNST G5 INANEST +70 78
>Joe_Gaspard: IOP F9 POI +17 42
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEENTZ H1 ZETA +48 126
#note I completely didn't know BEZANT was a word.
>Joe_Gaspard: INOOSTW 2B TWOONI.S +76 118
#note That's why BEZANT would have been better.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEGNNOU E8 BONG +30 156
>Joe_Gaspard: MOR C2 .ORM +18 136
>Matthew_Larocque: EHIINTU 1A HI +17 173
#note Sorry Q I'm not playing J7 ETUI. I'd rather keep things more closed.
>Joe_Gaspard: DER D1 R.DE +19 155
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIMNTU B4 EMU +16 189
#note I decided that this was fairly minimal-risk, only a bingo starting with N or a parallel _UN play would hurt. 
>Joe_Gaspard: DIJ 6D DJI. +14 169
>Matthew_Larocque: CEINNRT A6 NICER +23 212
>Joe_Gaspard: DESV 12B DEVS +24 193
>Matthew_Larocque: CGINTTV C9 CIV.T +26 238
#note He really saved my rack with that play.
>Joe_Gaspard: EFK J3 KEF +21 214
>Matthew_Larocque: AGNOTX B12 .AG +12 250
#note Missed full rack, but I know that I didn't have any way to deal with his setup (no D,E,S,F). I was trying to set up DAGO with my X next turn in order to counter his setup.
>Joe_Gaspard: ADL A13 LAD +18 232
>Matthew_Larocque: AGINOTX 1G A.O +16 266
#note Still can't deal with IF. I saw that an E draw would give me EXING for a bingo score - 5 Es left, I had to go for that.
>Joe_Gaspard: QSU 5F Q. +22 254
#note He almost play SUQ/IFS. I wish he had.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGINRTX 3F AT. +10 276
#note I missed, but there's not much I can do here even though I know he might bingo next turn.
>Joe_Gaspard: ??LOTUY K5 sTOUtLY +92 346
#note There it is.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINPRX H11 EXING +68 344
#note I needed this sooner.
>Joe_Gaspard: EH L7 EH +20 366
>Matthew_Larocque: EELPRRU 3J .ELP +20 364
#note This does likely give me an out next turn, but I'm sure he will block.
>Joe_Gaspard: AAEFLSU I13 FA +20 386
>Matthew_Larocque: AERRU L1 RU.E +10 374
#note I guess I'm supposed to block some plays that he has s-hooking kelp?
>Joe_Gaspard: AELSU J12 USE +16 402
#note He didn't play there anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: AR L11 AR +9 383
#note R(Y)A for 10.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AL) +4 387
#note Not being able to block IF was frustrating, plus he didn't even have the F! And neither did I to capitalize! I felt like I held my own, at least.
