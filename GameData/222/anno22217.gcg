#note Only important aspect of the game here. I didn't record my racks and have since forgotten them. I challenge TERETE rather quickly, as I know TERETES is the plural of TERES. Turns out TERETE is a completely different word! Big mistake that cost me the game.
>Mark_: DO F6 DO +16 320
>Josh: AHIKMNS 14G H.N +13 314
#note At this point I just want to try and make Mark screw up. I also am OK with drawing the Q here as I can score with it. He was low on time and I needed to exploit that to have a decent chance of winning.
>Mark_: ACT F2 CAT +15 335
>Josh: AEIKMQS 4C KE.. +16 330
#note Here I thought he might see dELIRI(A) so I decided to confuse him and hope he misses my out. Otherwise I have no wins.
>Mark_: ?EIILR A3 RELIe. +9 344
#note He must see and block UMIAQS. He was out of time
>Josh: AIMQS B10 .MIAQS +34 364
>Josh:  (I) +2 366
#note I stole the win here for sure.
