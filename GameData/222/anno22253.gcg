#note My first large mistake of the game. I was a bit too worried of the E5-K5 2x2, so I decided to get rid of my only vowel to block. But this did a worse job at blocking a bigger threat, the R at H8, than my original idea of P(E)P. But one play that I looked for and missed trumps all, and that's PR(E)P(L)AN M6
>Bowerman: EEIINSS N10 SEISIN +30 183
>Josh: MNPRTTY 3G TYP. +20 236
#note SEISIN left the board completely out of my control, so I had no other choice but to go for equity here. M7 R(E)P(L)Y is also a miss though. I knew that spot would be tough to find plays in.
>Bowerman: ENOOSUV 15K OVE.S +36 219
>Josh: BGMNRTU 12L BR.M +22 258
#note This wasn't a great play either. I should probably play GRUNT(S) at 13I. Although I can draw into an ING bingo often enough here, when I don't, I'm in trouble.
>Bowerman: ?HINORU H1 HO. +27 246
#note This is probably better than 14E NOURIsH. Kevin was annoyed he missed the bingo, though.

>Josh: ADEINTU 14E AUDIENT +64 339
>Bowerman: ?AINRTU 15B pURITAN +84 330
#note Took me ages to challenge P(REMAKE)*. I hated not being sure, but he blocked all of my bingos.
>Josh: CEEGIRT 13C GIRT +16 355
#note 13A TIGER is the play. If I'm going to create a lane, might as well keep a better leave and accelerate the endgame. I had no clue what to play here so again I decided to just go for the points and leave. I missed TIGER though, and I could also just play 4D GITE or CITE.
>Bowerman: DEENRTW 6H T.. +4 334
>Josh: CEEFGTV 5F VEE +8 363
#note I had no idea what his range was, but I decided I could win after this as long as he didn't hit. I don't think there is a correct play here because he could be fishing with anything. I think I made the right decision, but there are too many lanes to deal with.
>Bowerman: ADEENRW 9B WANDERE. +67 401
>Josh: ACFGIIT D4 FACTI.G +28 391
#note I decided to play this out of pure frustration, knowing he couldn't afford to challenge. Actually, he can challenge, as my best play with my remaining I loses by 2.
