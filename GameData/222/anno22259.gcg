>Josh: DIILNUV H8 LIVID +22 22
>Karl_Higby: FZ 9G F.Z +29 29
>Josh: ABEKNOU 12B UNBAKE. +28 50
#note BUNKOE(D) is the play. After I played this I realized I was setting up quite the hook. Don't make mistakes.
>Karl_Higby: ?AEHNSY A6 HANkEYS +105 134
#note After he played this I realized that might not be a word. Don't make mistakes. Nice phony, Karl. HYAENAS is the real word. Scored as 106. 
>Josh: AEINOTU 10H .AUNTIE +25 75
#note Time to open the rest of the board. :( Who would just play VAU here?
>Karl_Higby: ORTW B4 TROW +21 155
>Josh: EGHILOO 4B .HEOLOG +26 101
#note I really need to keep digging into this bag, don't I? TROW was a weird play. All I knew is that I wanted to block A1 and keep scoring. I should just play 13C OOH or HOO in the same spot.
>Karl_Higby: AABORST D3 A.ROBATS +61 216
#note missing ABATORS
>Josh: CEIIORT 13C OI +12 113
#note I saw this, CITRI(N)E K5 and COR(G)I H1. I should have played CITRI(N)E just to continue my trend of playing 6 tiles a turn and scoring.
>Karl_Higby: EFIN 11J NEIF +27 243
>Josh: CEINORT 14B NOTICER +88 201
#note TRICO(TI)NE! This is the correct play but that is an awesome word!
>Karl_Higby: AX B9 AX +51 294
#note Karl took a while here. I imagined he was considering playing at H15, or he had the blank.
>Josh: DENPRUW H1 PUR.ED +30 231
#note I regretted playing this, because although I need to keep the board alive, I more desperately need to prevent Karl from scoring, and playing at 15G with DEW is the correct way to do that. The board can wait.
>Karl_Higby: MP 2H .MP +13 307
>Josh: AAOORTW C1 WAA. +24 255
#note This was something like my leave. I had two O's and two consonants, and this was the only way I could score.
>Karl_Higby: ?CDEEIN 15H ENtICED +92 399
#note or L4 DIgENE(TI)C!
>Josh: DEOT 1A TO.ED +30 285
#note forgot my rack
