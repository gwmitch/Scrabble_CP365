#note Was wondering whether GOOGLIER* was valid. It's GOOGLIES that's valid, surprisingly. I didn't know the ORIOLE extension, GLORIOLE! That's the play at E2

#note nowhere for FOUREYED!

At this point in the game, I realized that my clock was running on Frank's time, because we were playing on those dreadful flip timers that don't register every hit. I had lost 3 minutes and was annoyed by this, since it equates with 6 minutes of net loss. I started sloppily with FOY H2, realizing my mistake, but I am happy to have found this play. My clock was now at 17:14
>Frank_Tangredi: AAENSST M7 ANSATES +75 117
#note Letting this go (after holding) was definitely a low point for me this tournament. I must have been rattled from having lost that time. Frank will now proceed to fastplay me, which is obviously legal, but sort of unethical in my opinion, no offense to Frank who is a great guy. In game, I may have done the same, but a flip timer was at fault, not my forgetting to hit the clock.
>Josh: AEIMORV H1 MOIRE +32 181
#note I finally got rid of this spot, but at a high cost. I should be grooming my rack here with D4 MOI or controlling the board and scoring with D1 VERA.

#note Let's get that left side under control and block some big plays he might have.
>Frank_Tangredi: IIII -IIII +0 197
>Josh: ADIIIIV -IVIIA +0 267
#note Not sure what to keep here. It seems close between A, AD, DI and nothing at all, since the pool is conso heavy. Prefer not to double my A
>Frank_Tangredi: RTU 1A RUT. +21 218
>Josh: DDIIKNO K2 KIDDO +31 298
#note nice, I missed (Z)ONK. I thought it was quite bizarre in game that both of us kept missing the Z. Apparently this play was correct though, since it blocked a bingo, apparently. I had 8:45 seconds on my clock here, which shows how much I was getting time rushed.

#note I forgot about MAXIS I10 PRAM is the play. This was a key play that I messed up.
>Frank_Tangredi: AI O5 AI +13 374
>Josh: BLLRTVW 6J ..W +13 422
#note I thought there was one in the bag here even though I tracked right. Frank took around 8 minutes on his last play, which got me very frustrated, as I knew he could not possible win with the pool that I tracked. The worst part about getting fastplayed is waiting a long time in the preendgame and endgame for your opponent to lose! Anyways, at least he distracted me enough to force me to make another mistake.
>Frank_Tangredi: DEIINOR D7 ..RIOD +18 392
#note With Frank's time now winding down, (a combined 15 minutes used in two moves) he fails to make the strongest endgame play. This would be -5 to N1 (V)INO, but I fail even harder next turn.
>Josh: BLLORTV 11C V.LT +14 436
#note I should have just gone with C10 BLOT. I was worried he would gain more points by sticking me with the V. Silly thinking. -10.
