>Josh: EEGNTWY H4 WEENY +30 30
#note You'll see in this game the effect that the previous game against Edley had on me. I was really down in the dumps. I put TWEENY down first and then chickened out, playing this instead, figuring it wasn't much of a loss anyway.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: EVX I3 VEX +31 31
#note already regretting not playing TWEENY.
>Josh: ?GOSSTT 6G G.TS +21 51
#note Please don't tell me I missed that. Please stop. Probably my only chance ever to play this word. If you see Siddharth Murali, tell him I'm sorry.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 31
>Josh: ?AIOSTY G8 OSTIArY +65 116
#note Figured that although this has considerably worse long-term defense, I'm not so far ahead that a play at H12 down could really hurt. That's why I opted for this placement, which is much safer in the short term. Josh thinking in the short term is not the Josh we all know, and it definitely isn't the Josh I want to become.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 31
#note exchange 6 AGAIN. Not feeling like we're gonna have a good game here.
>Josh: BEIIIIU -BIIIIU +0 116
#note "What is this sorcery?", both Ben and I wondered
>Ben_Schoenbrun: EEPW H12 WEEP +54 85
#note And there goes my short-term risk aversion. I felt like total crap after this came down. I wondered what in the hell I was doing. Good thing I didn't know what I had missed on turn 2. I would have played even worse than I played the rest of the game if I had seen GJETOSTS after making my play, if playing worse than this were even possible.
>Josh: EER I13 ERE +17 133
#note I'm not going to give you my full racks for a bit, firstly because I don't remember them and secondly because even if I did, it would be so embarrassing to tell you about all the bingos I missed and why I decided that I didn't want to play one of them. 

Basically I knew I had bingos on this rack and the next couple, but I didn't want to open the board. I was content playing on a board that Ben would have to open and give me a nicer, more devastating bingo.

>Josh: AGLOOZ L6 ZOOGL.A +36 276
#note Where's that closed and controlled board I thought I was creating? I don't remember my last tile and therefore why I opted not to play ZOA for 41

>Josh: DEINU O6 NUDIE +23 299
#note why is Ben still in this game?
>Ben_Schoenbrun: CEHKO 12A CHOKE +36 267

#note Basically throwing the game and saying: "Hey, you can score 60 points with an overlap and win if you'd like.
