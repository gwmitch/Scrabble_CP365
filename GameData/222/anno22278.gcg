#note An interesting position given where I'm at in the match. It's a best-of-4, and I'm leading 2-0 +233 - so I don't even have to win this game necessarily, I just need to prevent blowout losses. It's debatable which does that better - is it PENK, or PINK through the I? PINK is a little better for limiting his bingo options, though not perfect. I decided to keep things straightforward and take the play that's 12 extra points. Not sure.

#note Turns out PINK would have just made his bingo score 4 extra points. Heh.

#note A difficult position, since he's very likely to bingo. Do I try to minimize his chances, or simply score and limit the spread? Quackle suggests JAUP, which is interesting. Blocks a lot of bingos from the A and also begins to unload the high-point tiles. The other option is just a straightforward "take the points" play like ZAP B6.
