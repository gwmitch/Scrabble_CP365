>Mike_Ebanks: AKRST 8D KARTS +28 28
>Matthew_Larocque: AEJORTW 9C JAW +32 32
>Mike_Ebanks: ABEM C9 .AMBE +32 60
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHOORT D11 OOH +29 61
#note D12 OHO looks to provide better defense, at 4 points less. Sim does prefer OOH, but it's quite easy for him to score 25-30 points here.
>Mike_Ebanks: AW E11 AW +28 88
#note Like that.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEELRTZ 10B Z. +31 92
#note Oops, LEZ scores 41, which is a lot to give up. The open S made me think about keeping a strong leave so I auto-played Z(A).
>Mike_Ebanks: IPX B13 PIX +32 120
#note Throwing an X down there under any circumstance is unlikely to end well.... Mike was unlucky enough to get hit back with the absolute worst case scenario....
>Matthew_Larocque: AEELNRT 15A E.TERNAL +194 286
#note I am fairly sure this is the highest scoring play I've ever made. Is it enough to get to 600?
>Mike_Ebanks: INS I13 INS +20 140
#note Not if Mike is hogging the remaining esses.
>Matthew_Larocque: DDDIINY 12I DIDY +23 309
#note He sure did bail out this rack though. I once phonied with #DIDDY, but decided not to risk it here. DIDDY isn't THAT much better than DIDY that I need to risk my turn.
>Mike_Ebanks: NORU K8 ROUN. +12 152
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEINNQ 10J Q.IN +33 342
#note I figure he's sitting on an S, but I have to make a play here. Obviously not EQUINE or QUEEN. EQUID leaves double Ns which I don't want. I liked this best for sure.
>Mike_Ebanks: BEUY 8K .EBUY +33 185
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEENUV G5 VEN.UrED +63 405
#note I didn't rush this play, I just don't know enough words yet. I thought there was a word sounding like VENDEUSE, but didn't know for sure/how to spell it. 14F UNE(N)ViED is cool but leaves the door open for a 50+ point counter play. VEN(T)UrED does have some defensive merits but it scores a lot less points.
>Mike_Ebanks: AGORT N10 TARGO +32 217
#note Held this, but couldn't be 100% sure this wasn't a word. Mike likes to throw down fives I've never seen before, and I can't really lose the game here anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEIIOR 5E In.OICER +98 503
#note Extremely good time to get away with a phony (a 98-point one no less). There are no valid bingos here, just 3 plays that score 20,20,22 or use the blank for a 44 point In(V)OICE. The more I think about it, the more miraculous it seems that Mike just let me have this. He must have been very convinced it was valid.
>Mike_Ebanks: EEF 4K FEE +21 238
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHOUV 4C VUG +17 520
#note I almost played VUGH for 27 (missed where it plays for 28), but I was trying to maximize my average score for next turn by keeping the H. I am taking an 11-point hit here, though. I ended up scoring 26 next turn for a 43 point total. If I score 27 now, I have to score more than 16 next turn. The QUINT hooks make that a certainty if they stay open. I think I overthought this.
>Mike_Ebanks: AELPS N2 SALEP +33 271
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEHLOO O13 OHO +26 546
>Mike_Ebanks: I M8 .I. +6 277
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEELOT 6F O. +7 553
#note I have a handful of ways to score 20+ here. I got greedy because of the open S (I saw possible draws such as DEALATES/LEADIEST/TREADLES/DEFLATES...). I was hoping Mike missed whatever his fish was and tried again.
>Mike_Ebanks: FIRST O1 FIRST +42 319
#note Matt why do you gotta be so dumb sometimes.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEELNT O8 .EAN +24 577
#note T(Y)NED is 27. I can still make 600 if I'm smart. (Hint: I'm not smart).
>Mike_Ebanks: ACGILMT H1 IMAG. +30 349
>Matthew_Larocque: DELT 1G T.LED +6 583
#note I'm out of time. Best is to play LED G1 because he cannot play out next turn then.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (CLT) +10 593
#note Underscored by 2. Even when I get astronomically lucky, I still manage to disappoint. When I think about this game, I think it annoys me more than any other game I played this tournament. More than the game I lost by 264, or losing because of *AUXINE.
