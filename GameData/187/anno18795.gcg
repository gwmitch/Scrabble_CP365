>Matt_Canik: EEIIKOZ H7 ZEK +32 32
#note ZEK, KOI, or exchange? Sim has KOI about 3 points higher. Seems strange to give up 18 points for a Z. 
>Christopher_Sykes: IX I8 XI +26 26
>Matt_Canik: AEEGIOV -AEEGIOV +0 32
#note Chris can deal with this mess. I'm dumping all 7 to try and increase chances of pulling an S. 
>Christopher_Sykes: ?EGLOOS 10B OLOGiES +76 102
#note Counted as 77. 
>Matt_Canik: DEEILNO A8 ELOINED +85 117
#note How fortunate! Counted as 88
>Christopher_Sykes: JOW C7 JOW. +26 128
>Matt_Canik: AHIMTUW E7 WAU.HT +26 143
#note Is it worth holding the T back to play there next turn? 
>Christopher_Sykes: AVV D6 VAV +36 164
#note Owwwwww
>Matt_Canik: ABFIMST J9 FIB +20 163
>Christopher_Sykes: EH B13 HE +21 185
#note This, plus the way I've seen Chris play previously, has me thinking that he's pretty bingo prone but may not have an S. 
>Matt_Canik: AIMRSTT 15B MAT +14 177
#note So I want to kill this line while holding KIFS for my S (or if he plays down K10 my S still has value). 
>Christopher_Sykes: ?EILNQR -Q +0 185
#note Actual rack. 
>Matt_Canik: FIRSTUY K7 FUSTY +49 226
#note Conceded that he's going to bingo at this point, but I can score 49!!! 
>Christopher_Sykes: ?EILNNR 14D INNERLy +60 245
>Matt_Canik: EEIIRRT 15G REI +19 245
>Christopher_Sykes: IIIUU -IIIUU +0 245
>Matt_Canik: CEIOPRT 12C CO.TIER +20 265
#note That JAWS spot is going to be really big to the outcome of this game, especially against a fish-heavy player like Chris. I decide to dig as deep into the bag as I can to pull one. TRICEP for 38 is an option that I think I'd have played had I seen it. 
>Christopher_Sykes: CDEIT L11 EDICT +26 271
>Matt_Canik: ILOPRRU J4 PURI +13 278
#note One of the perils of digging deep into the bag is racks like this
>Christopher_Sykes: AAGN 4J .AGAN +16 287
>Matt_Canik: ADLORSY O4 SADLY +40 318
#note If I burn the S, SLOYD is the play. I hate to give it up because of JAWS, though, but PAGAN feels like a setup play to me. RA(N)DY or YOD 3M both also deserve consideration. 
>Christopher_Sykes: AA 3L AA +11 298
>Matt_Canik: BENOORU 5I B.RO +20 338
>Matt_Canik: BENOORU --  -20 318
#note Chris draws poorly again. Great, I can take advantage of this to start scoring a lot so I can outrun a bin--- or I can score 0 because I don't know my 4s. 
>Christopher_Sykes: ADEGINS N8 AGNISED +77 375
>Christopher_Sykes: ADEGINS --  -77 298
#note Thankfully I get it back due to some dictionary confusion. Phew!
>Matt_Canik: BENOORU M12 ON +11 329
#note I'm really low on time now. I feel like a Chris bingo is almost inevitable unless he pulls the Q. I'm blocking up this I so I can attempt to stick him if he bingos first and then pulls it 
>Christopher_Sykes: ADEGINS 6N A. +5 303
>Matt_Canik: BEEOPRU 8G R.. +10 339
#note Playing off 1 tile to decrease chances of pulling the Q
>Christopher_Sykes: IQS 2J QIS +36 339
#note But looks like he took care of the Q-drawing already!
>Matt_Canik: BEEMOPU 15L .UBE +18 357
#note I have 0:34 at the start of this play. The score is 342-340 in my favore right now. I throw this down quickly
>Christopher_Sykes: DEGNORT N9 GROT +11 350
>Matt_Canik: EMOP K4 .M +16 373
#note I see that he's setting up N(U)DE for an outplay and block it. I have one win this turn, but didn't see it in my time crunch. MO(U)E. 
>Christopher_Sykes: DEN O11 DEN +14 364
#note Initially I've won by 1, after a recount I lost by 1. Against Matthew, I had thought I won by 1 but lost by 3 after a recount. Man, scrabble sucks sometimes. Especially when I had wins in both games. 
>Christopher_Sykes:  (EOP) +10 374
