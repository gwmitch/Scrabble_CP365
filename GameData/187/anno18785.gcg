#note This was dumb, should've just done PIAL and very nearly did. I had this strange aversion to EOS which made me make a clearly inferior play.

#note Hoping to score a bit more with the X next turn than I can now, which seems like a reasonable enough hope. I think I like GNAT a bit better though -- the extra consonant is clunky pn this board. GNAT(S) is possible, but he will often make small plays that block it on such a closed board.

#note I think I'm still a little too attached to keeping leaves like ER on boards where they don't go anywhere. The logic is that if there is an opening or I get an S, it's a great leave, but I don't think that's quite enough. I think it might be best to just do AN 10L. AENRR is not great but not much goes anywhere on this board and AN is hard to score off of without opening me decent counterplay. 8 points is nice to have as well. AENRR is a decent bingo leave and sometimes I will draw a bingo with it next turn. AN is probably fine.

#note I actually didn't see EME yet (worried about time pressure already, as the decisions have been hard and Matt is really fast). The decision been the two plays is interesting. JOG is a little less defensive to scoring plays than EME is, actually. I kind of like keeping a more flexible leave here, but Quackle doesn't, says taking the points now is much better. I guess that's reasonable as CEEMR can only be so much better than CGOR on a board like this.

#note Thought about CYAN but felt like points were really important here, DENR doesn't really go anywhere. I didn't think of blanks at the time, but they are another big reason to play off another tile. I still like this play. I didn't see DECAY but the scoring spot it gives up is pretty relevant on a closed board like this so I prefer DERBY.

#note I don't really know here. I played this quickly but I could also exchange. I just feel like 16 points is so important here, even if CNN is not great. Turning more tiles for blanks and esses is good here and I probably do need a blank to win this game but in for instance the blank for me blank for him situation having some extra points really helps things. I still like this but I don't know, it's a complicated position.

#note I misassessed the position! VINIC leaves 1 in the bag and actually draws bingos hooking STAB more often, which is critical if he fishes off one. And of course, it outruns in a six-pass situation, just like REDIAL. This is a gigantic mistake -- the rest of the game I end up having to hope for multiple errors on his part to win. I was not attuned to the importance of timing in this position and so I blew a lot of winning chances.

>Noah: ?CINNRT -  +0 294
#note He almost certainly has the blank at this point. I need to hope for something here. I'm not sure if I win this game if he plays optimally ever, but this makes it hard for him.

>Noah: ?CINNRT 3H .N +6 300
#note I don't think there is actually a winning play for me here if he plays optimally, but this seems to make it the hardest for him.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ?EEILOR F9 RILE +8 302
#note I think if Matt plays LO here he wins.
>Noah: ?CINRT 10A NoRIT.C +8 308
#note Honestly I played the bulk of this game quite poorly, though I'm happy that I gave myself chances to steal it at the end. Just need to keep practicing strategy and closed boards. No bingos on either side! I got low win for this game.
