>Brian: GUY H7 GUY +14 14
#note Brian mentioned that I was due to bag him, considering our one-sided history.  With how I had drawn to this point I figured I was due for a bagging myself.  
>Matt: ALOQRRV 8D RORQ.AL +17 17
#note I was just thankful he gave me a U.
>Brian: FINOS K4 INFOS +33 47
>Matt: AANORRV 4G OVAR.AN +28 45
#note Played this pretty quickly.  This does really well in the sim, even surpassing L1 VARNA for 30.  
>Brian: AEIL H1 ALI.E +24 71
>Matt: ACEIMRW F6 WA.M +17 62
#note No B for MICAWBER.  I was at a loss for what to do here.  WIR(E)ME(N) for 32 looks really good to me, or maybe just M(O)WA or MAW.  
>Brian: ?BDILST M1 BLI.DeST +72 143
#note I really thought he was going to leave the N alone.
>Matt: CEEIIRT J4 .EI +14 76
#note TERBIC!  I was looking for a play through the B to keep scoring, then settled on my choice.  Not sure why we don't have ERBIC* though.  I was not happy he blocked REINCITE.
>Brian: ?BDEEGT D1 BuDGETE. +78 221
#note So much for me bagging him. Game over.
>Matt: CEEIORT 1L O.IT +21 97
#note CORBIE in either spot.
>Brian: EHRY 1A HER.Y +39 260
>Matt: CEEINRU E4 URE +19 116
#note Tack the I on for 5 more maybe?  
>Brian: EX N5 EX +52 312
>Matt: CDDEINW O3 DEW +15 131
#note He has to have an O here, so I felt I had to block in order to minimize spread.
>Brian: JN 3G J.N +39 351
#note LOL.  Scrabble is stupid sometimes, but to be fair I did this very thing to others this tournament.
>Matt: ACDINNT G8 .AT +22 153
#note END is a nice play to fork another lane open.  I have to hope to draw an S and soon with my choice.
>Brian: UV J8 .UV +14 365
>Matt: CDINNPS -CND +0 153
>Brian: HO 2A OH +25 390
>Matt: EILNOPS 11A PINOLES +81 234
#note Saving a little face.
>Brian: EIINT A8 TIE.IN +27 417
>Matt: AACGMOO C9 CO.GA +22 256
#note NGOMA# sets up a 3x3.  Maybe.
>Brian: CZ 1G C.Z +14 431
#note Geez, I'm guessing he kept something like PATES or NATES.
>Matt: ADEKMOR O3 ...ORM +45 301
#note Well I was happy I saw this.  I can't play DEWORMED because there are lots of bingoes he can play.  This way, he has to have something specific like AUNTIES (in which case he has SINUATE lower left anyway).  
>Brian: AEFNPST 11J SPENT +21 452
>Matt: ADEIKU M10 U.KED +20 321
#note EUKED# or EIKED# is best.  
>Brian: AF N13 FA +21 473
#note Not much I could do there, it happens.  Need to learn how to play those low-point tile racks like CEEIIRT/CEEIORT when they don't bingo.
>Brian:  (AI) +4 477
