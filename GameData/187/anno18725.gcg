>JD: LLMNOTV 8G VOLT +14 14
#note I was looking for a defensive encounter with jeremy - hence I felt happy to play VOLT at 8G, which I thought would make the top-left of the board harder to access, although giving up more immediate points on column K
>Jeremy_Hall: ABEHO K4 BOHEA +28 28
>JD: BLMNPPU 4K .UMP +20 34
#note a ridiculous play, after the nonsense with edley in the previous game I was unwilling to play BUMPH because I thought it was CSW. My next best play on the sim is BUNT, but I kind of liked BUMP because Jeremy, unfamiliar with my game, would probably have to respect it as either a Y setup or a very powerful leave.
>Jeremy_Hall: AENS O1 ANES +27 55
>JD: ABCJLNP 6F BLANC. +25 59
#note quackle says take the extra points for JAMB, but I did really like closing all the bingo lanes in the middle of the board, especially since I'm holding the J and not bingoing anytime soon
>Jeremy_Hall: CEEIT M3 E.ETIC +22 77
>JD: AEHIJPT J8 .AJ +26 85
#note keeping my good scoring letters
>Jeremy_Hall: AZ N1 ZA +37 114
>JD: AEHIPTY 8M .AY +24 109
#note the game was already shaping up very inaccurately, I miss PITAYA here as a nice scoring play. playing CHI instead would keep the nice play of YEP at 7F for next time also.

>JD: AEIKRTW 8D KI +22 177
#note I missed WAUK at L2 to keep the board closed! KI is a huge risk, especially since he's been building his rack for so many turns, although I can close with TWA after next turn.
>Jeremy_Hall: EO 5F OE +9 162
>JD: AADERTW E3 DAW +26 203
#note DRAW to play off an extra letter, especially with 5 Rs unseen!

>JD: DFMOTUV B13 FUD +23 323
#note there are a lot of really good tiles in the pool, but this clogs and keeps MO for next turn as a fallback option. he was also starting to run low on time.
>Jeremy_Hall: EX D12 EX +35 322
>JD: ?MOSSTV A14 MO +26 349
#note well, a draw of SS? never hurts. just playing REV at 12E is a killer play, since I can draw myosotis/myosities/myosotes on the right as well as my difficult to block lane on column F. but this is difficult to trust over the board, so I took the points.
>Jeremy_Hall: IO E11 OI +7 329
>JD: ?EOSSTV F10 VEST +21 370
#note after the game I thought the best play is TWIGS to block TWIGGIER and fish (YESHIVOT for instance). but quackle suggests just fishing the V which should leave bingos on column F and some on column O (ROYSTERS, EYESPOTS). I was unwilling to get into ugly positions where I fish for 6, miss and then find myself losing after TWIGGIER.
>Jeremy_Hall: AEGIRRU 1A ....GIER +39 368
>JD: ?GOS 14F SOnG +16 386
#note SAGOS for two more. not my most accurate game, but a good enough performance on a closed board (hard to make the best move every time when the games are longer and the decisions very contextual!). in retrospect I wonder if he was also playing for a closed board given some of his early moves (BOHEA especially, and also EMETIC).
