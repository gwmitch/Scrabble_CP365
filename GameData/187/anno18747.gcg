#note BEN is not 8 points better than BEU, so WHANG is probably better. And a bunch of other players are about equal. I was distracted by trying to remember if BUNGED was good. I wanted to play BUNGED. This is meh but not a huge error.

#note My instinct is always to trade down to 2 consonants on these racks, because I don't want to draw into another unbalanced rack. But I traded down to CRS because I knew that was the Quackle play. But fuck Quackle, because this sims best and it didn't work at all. Next time I trade down to RS.

#note I really wanted to play CREWER* or RECREW* here. but they're not good enough to risk the turn on, and I don't know Roy's challenge tendancies at all. As for valid plays, H6 CREW outsims this by a little. No way. I'd rather leave the E open and not telegraph my vowel-lite leave.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEJNRRS 5B JE.N +22 65
#note LOL top simming play is Exch. JR. Three trades in a row would have been rough. JEON is about equal with it. I need to get lucky at this point, and that means drawing bingos to lousy leaves while I struggle to stay within range.

#note I certainly haven't played perfectly this game, but 71 points in my first six turns sucks a lot. The sim gives the edge to the oter RID. Blocking BLINIS? Why? I may need that.

#note This is my attempt to keep the board open. But really, this won't work. It will take one play by Roy through TOWER to kill this half of the board. L9 MEOW opens up a great 7 lane and doesn't offer any obvious way to slay future openings of the N and O columns. Gotta think more than one turn ahead when facing these deficits.

#note I played this fairly quickly and did not even consider YEARLY. I dunno, though. Which play makes it easier for Roy to kill all my bingo lines? YEARLY keeps the I open, but blocks the W and the A15 lane. Those lanes suck, but with two blanks unseen any lane is a real threa to him. After YEARLY, Roy needs a long enough play through the I to kill everything. After SEXY, blocks are trickier. Also, I'd rather try to bingo with ALY than SX.  It's a silly argument to have now, because as I said, I didn't even consider YEARLY.

#note Assuming Roy makes one of his valid sixes from the R next turn (like RUMAkI, which he confirmed he would have played) I have one chance to fish for a bingo at A15 or through the W or R making parallels to TAUPE. The best shot is 13A PEA, which gives me a 25% shot to draw a blank. He plays RUMAkI and I win with SERENeLY. Over the board, I didn't think my odds were nearly as good as 25% for any of my fishes, so I played this word rather quickly. It banks on Roy making a mistake. And the odds of that happening must be less than 25%. So consider this a blown chance. It's likely I wouldn't have seen the chance at SERENELY in time anyways. But still. Tsk. With what was in the bag, I was sunk any case, so that's consolation.
