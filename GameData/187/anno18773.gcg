#note 9K HIE setting up the D gives me a moderate bingo% boost...9G HIE is most defensive against bingos.

#note If GARCON scored a couple more points it would be the clear choice, but 9 is too much to give up.

>Will: EGKMOTY 12A MO.ETY +28 108
#note B12 KYE looks like it gives up a boatload of points down column D and leaves the clunky GMOT, but it scores very well. I think better still is B13 YOK, which doesn't give up nearly as much, still scores OK, and keeps a better vowel. MOIETY isn't too far behind.

#note Damn, didn't see GOBO, which is great to keep a vowel heavy leave here. Couldn't bring myself to do MOVE. I thought a heavy enough S play here would be really hard to recover from, and it wouldn't even have to be a bingo.

>Will: IRRRUVW -RRUVW +0 231
#note Never seriously considered VIRTU here and I think exchanging must be correct, but what's better, keep I, keep IR, or ex.7? I kept IR but I think now I should have kept just I, the R doesn't have any special properties on this board.
>Eric: LLNWW -LLNWW +0 245
>Will: AILRSUX A4 .IX +23 254
#note FLUX, XU, and FIX are all worth consideration. It might be that the extra couple points of FIX aren't as important as maximizing bingo chances with XU, since we might be in a race to hit ODIUMS first.
