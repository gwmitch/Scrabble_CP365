#note I should probably just play O3 EX here. I don't know why I forwent it...

>Jeremy_Hall: ?AAEGGO 15E AnAGOGE. +77 233
#note Wow, don't think I knew ApAGOGE(S). That's an awesome word with an awesome meaning, and a better play than this for sure.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEV E9 .VEA +27 159
>Jeremy_Hall: DEFGJRT 12D G.DJE +30 263
#note The merits of J(I)G at K5 are grand! I did highly consider the play, but GADJE had great immediate defense and a great leave too so I took it. I completely missed JER(I)D, oddly enough, which is obviously the favorite here.

>Joshua_Sokol: OY K11 YO +22 227
>Jeremy_Hall: EHMNRTY 14B RHYME +37 344
#note Well I missed two cool fits here at 13H, which are both leagues better than my play. It's an interesting decision between THYME and RHYME if those are the two contenders, since slotting the T at 14B is identical to the T at 2N so it doesn't add any extra bingo threats. I actually thought NT was a better leave than NR, which it apparently is not. So this isn't even 3rd best. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ATU 13A TAU +18 245
>Jeremy_Hall: ENNNNTU 13L .NN +6 350
#note It was a difficult decision to make here between exchanging and playing through the rack. The benefit of playing through the rack are mainly a reduction in Jeremy's bingo%. But why should I leave myself with stuff that may end up being impossible to work with with an 100-point lead? I think my lead is more than enough to justify scoring nothing and blocking nothing. So I think I should exchange here and keep EN (maybe ENT?). This play allows Jeremy to score while maintaining bingo threats in two spots, which is not a good thing. 
>Joshua_Sokol: IT 15A IT +9 254
>Jeremy_Hall: BBENNTU A8 UNBEN. +27 377
#note Held and released. UNBEND is good too.
>Joshua_Sokol: COR 13G ORC +21 275
>Jeremy_Hall: ABEFHTT B8 HEAT +24 401
#note I missed J10 FETA/BETA here, which are nice fits and good rack balancing plays, in contrast with the play I made. I'm still far enough in the lead to outrun even two bingos, so it isn't quite necessary to block as much as possible, although the reduction in bingo% is very nice here. *Shrug*
>Joshua_Sokol: DI J10 ID +12 287
>Jeremy_Hall: BFLPPTW -BTFPPWL +0 401
#note Perfect time to exchange 7. 7 in the bag, so he's doomed here and I will have perfect knowledge of his rack. But obviously I didn't track perfectly so yeah. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IILRRS N11 RI. +3 290
>Jeremy_Hall: ADIMOOW 3M O. +8 409
#note shutting everything down
>Joshua_Sokol: P H7 P.. +5 295
#note This was drawn, so partial leave is still ILRS?
>Jeremy_Hall: ADILMOW B7 W.... +11 420
#note He could still have BRISTLe at C1, but is there anything that reduces his chance of bingoing more than this? I think I should just empty the bag cause I can't block BRISTLE after this play and not give him another way to bingo out. So WOALD seems like the play. STIPuL(A)R is the only thing that would play after that.
>Joshua_Sokol: W 9A ..W +10 305
>Jeremy_Hall: ADFILMO O1 FA +17 437
#note No comment on this play, just totally blanked on (RIN)D. I can't actually stop him from bingoing if he has BRISTLE so I've gotta just score here. Champ says this is 40 points back. Probably something like that :/
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BILPRS N10 B...eR +26 331
#note -2 apparently, but nice find nonetheless
>Jeremy_Hall: DILMOT 9K T.D +11 448
#note For some reason I just completely lost my mind and thought he had 5 tiles on his rack that didn't go out.
