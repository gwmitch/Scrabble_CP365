#note Wow. I missed DALETHs J3 with 5 overlaps. I passed other bingos (LOATHED/LATCHED) intentionally and would have passed FLATHEAD if I had seen it. 

DALETHs, despite being really cool, actually sims below LATH

#note I don't know the hooks to LATH (EISY) so I just decide to knock out that spot so it doesn't become important.

#note I had a really hard time deciding if I should challenge this. I am 100% sure it's invalid... I looked for 3x3s I could play through it for a while and could only find LENSINGS*, which I was unsure of. I did miss one 3x3 (GINSENGS). 
Once I decided (incorrectly) I couldn't 3x3 I started thinking about bingos I would play. I didn't see one that didn't give back CONSOLER for a really long time. Finally I spotted this.
