#note I saw RUSK here but didn't like the NOSU leave much. the sim is really close as well with SOUR at 14J to set up a big new lane. dead heat.

#note this is a tough bag to play through because it's missing a lot of 1-point consonants. I considered just fishing OW. I can also sacrifice 5 points to play WADE and block cheap points on row 1. I think this is fine.

#note my win percentage per quackle is already down to 3%. nothing is all that promising. at least CIAO leaves the row 3 lane open to some degree. Q suggests OCA at M13 as a risky try - it gives her a lot of free points, but maybe that's what I need to do to give me the lanes for the 2-3 bingos it will take to pull of the comeback. but in some respects I already have enough lanes, I just need to actually draw a bingo.

#note not my finest moment - I knew ADVENES# wasn't good in TWL since I've gotten away with it before (as I'm sure my friends will remind me). the alternative is to play VENGE at H11 to go down 100. I didn't even realize until after I hit my clock that I could play it at 3C. it didn't take her long to take this play off the board. worth a try? if I think she's at least 20% to accept it, then definitely.
