#note Nightmares of HADJ coming down from H1...this fouls up that spot a bit while retaining huge bingo chances. Sim likes it.

#note I picked JAR over YARD to preserve the row 4 bingo line and to shed the bad-for-bingos J now. YARD crushes it in simulation. I'm not convinced. Quackle thinks I get JO K5 a fair amount, after Mack dumps clunky plays with W's in them at M3 (VOW/VAW, BOW, FEW) and I draw an O. A lot of the plays Quackle makes there are just not ones that Mack would make after YARD. The prospects for the J here otherwise are pretty underwhelming.

#note DEITY is so blocky...after FOX I need every line I can get.

#note CP loves VIOLA, which can't be right. It yields the lowest scores to Mack but also bingos almost never when it feels like I'm going to have to in order to get back in this. It sets up 9M TWIT underneath for a decent score, which feels like it leads to a slow death especially given that Mack isn't going to play anywhere near as openly as Quackle thinks, looking at the sim log. C3 WO I can accept as viable too - otherwise I'm fine with WOVE as a necessary gamble.
>Mack: EQTU B2 T.QUE +32 361
>Will: AGIILOT A6 AGIO +17 315
#note N10 DIALOG is a decent idea - have to hope to get super lucky here anyway. AGIO isn't hopeless with a sufficiently strong draw, though, and leaving the A column creates a major risk of being outrun.
>Mack: AFLP 8K P.LAF +30 391
>Will: AADILLT A1 LA. +20 335
#note Quackle thinks my winning chances are 20+% here with ALATED...I respect that it might give me more of a chance than my play but that seems way too high, and playing the resulting positions out by hand giving myself the best possible racks confirms that. I think the issue with LAW is as much pre-endgame timing as it is position anyway.
>Mack: AGO 13C GOA. +10 401
#note Yeah, after ALATED this can't happen

#note Maybe Mack misses OTALGIC :)
