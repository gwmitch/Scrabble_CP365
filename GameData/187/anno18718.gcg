>Scott_Garner: AGJ 8G JAG +22 22
>JD: AFLRTTW H7 W.FT +10 10
#note I have never beaten Scott Garner. pretty even sim between fatwa and waft, in retrospect I would like to play a more open style here.
>Scott_Garner: OSX J8 SOX +38 60
>JD: AFIILRT K9 FIAT +28 38
#note right spot, wrong play - I can play for a much stronger leave after FILA, or constrict the board with FIT. He played SOX very fast, which suggests another S - so maybe FILA
>Scott_Garner: AEMNRSU 11B MANURES +79 139
>JD: ADKLRRY L11 DARKY +41 79
>Scott_Garner: EOW 15L .OWE +30 169
>JD: AAIILRT L7 AIT +10 89
#note AIT at L7 strikes me as almost a forced move at this point - surely he will close the bottom-left quadrant permanently if I don't open in some way.
>Scott_Garner: AEIMOST M2 ATOMIES +75 244
#note scott is usually a slow player (maybe even slower than me) but he played this game at the speed of a runaway train
>JD: ACEEILR D6 RELIA.CE +72 161
>Scott_Garner: EHH L2 HEH +35 279
>JD: AGIIOPZ N2 GAP +37 198
#note my worst play of the tournament to this point. I wanted to score points and open up some kind of lane, but GIZMO at B8 scores a bunch of points, leaves bingo tiles and opens a bunch of threatening hot spots.
>Scott_Garner: BNO 14L .NOB +36 315
>JD: EEIINOZ C1 IONIZE +32 230
#note IONIZE looks scarier at E1, allowing for overlap bingos on column C next turn potentially. if I had played GIZMO last turn I would have AEEINP as my 6 tiles!
>Scott_Garner: EENRU O4 ENURE +28 343
>JD: ?AEINUU 3B U.AU +4 234
#note should've just exchanged on this turn! I thought I was making it harder for him to block on column B or D, but I am taking out a lane on row 3 that I would need later! 
>Scott_Garner: DLO 1A LO.D +21 364
>JD: ?BCEINT 13C C.NoBITE +80 314
>Scott_Garner: Q 9C Q. +21 385
>JD: EILOSTV 6B V..T +15 329
#note if I had not played UNAU I would have NOVELIST here and be down 8 with 3 in the bag! he would still be the heavy favorite (quackle gives me a 10% winning chance on many play) but I would at least have a nice winning chance. too bad. with this play I create a surreptitious 2x2 lane on row 5 as well as the obvious threat on the left (maybe he can't block).
>Scott_Garner: LNOR A5 LORN +20 405
>JD: DEILOSY G13 .Y +7 336
#note with the blank unseen I'm done, I should just score with DEIL at 7C and give in. instead I fish, giving up massive amounts of spread.
>Scott_Garner: DEGIPRV 15D VIPER +50 455
#note amazingly, I drew the blank out of the bag, preventing a 150 point loss.
>JD: ?DEILOS 5E IDOLiSE +82 418
#note scored as 80. I kept the board volatile enough until UNAU, NOVELIST really does give me a chance.
>JD:  (DG) +8 426
#note I have still never beaten Scott Garner.
