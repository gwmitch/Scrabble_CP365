#note took me awhile to come up with exchanging the L, quackle prefers ELL at 8H by a point or two.

#note keeping AER is not all that great with 5 Rs to come and both blanks unseen - I like quackle's suggestion of UNSWEAR

#note much better than exchanging, I can play ANOA at I11 and set up my bingo leave nicely.

#note quackle prefers the improved bingo percentages of playing BOWL this turn. it's not like I should be that eager to get into the pool. Also there are 4 Rs left, which makes this move worse.
