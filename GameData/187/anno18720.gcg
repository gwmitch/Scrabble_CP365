>JD: ELLNRRR -LLNRR +0 66
#note hurray for exchanging. I would normally keep ENR or ELR but I was trying to draw tiles that might be more useful on a dead board. close on a sim
>Terry: BINS H12 BINS +37 95
>JD: AENPRSV G11 NAP +23 89
#note massive error! how did I not play PERV here? my play of NAP would make the game much more painful than it had to be. biggest inaccuracy of the tournament to this point
>Terry: AEJ 14F JA.E +33 128
#note I thought she might open by playing on column L, but she was always going to keep the board closed on this move! all because of missing PERV

>Terry: ADL D10 DAL +16 171
>JD: AEEEIRS -EEI +0 132
#note there are ways that I can play throuh and open the board, but it seemed difficult for her to block column M. RESEAU is a pretty cool way of blowing things up, which might be better than praying that my lone lane stays open.
>Terry: CRSTU M9 CRUST +27 198
#note uh oh
>JD: ABEORRS 10L O.B +11 143
#note again, this is basically a forced move at this point
>Terry: IMR O12 MIR. +13 211
>JD: AEOPRRS C11 PAR +19 162
#note quackle suggests PAREO here which makes some sense, but I think I need to bingo as soon as I can
>Terry: ADIOU 15B AUDIO +17 228
>JD: AEEORSS B7 SEROSAE +72 234
>Terry: FZ 8A F.Z +45 273
>JD: ACEITTT 10A T. +2 236
#note this was my best play of the tournament, though in retrospect it seems inevitable - I started fishing for ATTICIZE on column C with a 5/23 chance of hitting, and I will likely get a couple of turns to try to hit it.
>Terry: EERW 13A W..E +12 285
>JD: ACEFITT -F +0 236
#note all of my scoring plays prevent me from hitting ATTICIZE, so I exchanged the F. FIZ seems wrong - q doesn't realize that she is always blocking on the right (burning a blank if needed).
>Terry: OTY O8 TOY +27 312
>JD: ?ACEITT C2 ATTiCI.E +96 332
#note 50% to win from here!
>Terry: O A13 .O +5 317
#note she had now started to get low on time.
>JD: AEFIINV D2 NAIF +26 358
#note her last play seemed to telegraph the blank or some kind of fish - I figured all I could do was to block at the top-left and hope she missed. in theory I should play VIA at D1 to prevent some beautiful 9s through AN (GRANDIOSE) but with her in time pressure I simply needed to make a play fast.
>Terry: ?DEGILO N4 LODGE +13 330
#note I was ready for the worst, but fortunately for me she missed her only anagram pair (blank a K) and I survived.
>JD: EILRV E1 LIVE +19 377
>Terry: ?I J13 Is +12 342
#note this could've been a more straightforward game if I had just played PERV at the beginning! instead, I was fortunate to come out unscathed.
>Terry:  (R) +2 344
