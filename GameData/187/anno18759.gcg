>JD: AELSTWX 8G WAX +26 26
>Conrad: DEGOORR 7I ODOR +16 16
#note cBB: What was wrong with GOR here? I was all worried about making sure the board was open because I felt like I was already in a hole - this is a terrible play - it's not like he's guaranteed to bingo or something!
>JD: ?ELORST 6E cORSLET +77 103
#note JD: I spotted RETOOLS but forgot about it. RETOOLS has tremendous immediate defensive value, dropping his bingo percentage from 13% to 9% by taking away a lot of easy 7s. I spent too long on this play.
>Conrad: EEEGIRU 8L EGER +21 37
#note cBB: I knew REGIU(S) somewhere deep in the back of my brain, but I was unable to come up with it here - definitely a word knowledge mistake!
>JD: AAEIIRV H1 VARIA. +30 133
>Conrad: DEINNUY 2F YU.N +15 52
#note cBB: Somebody is going to tell me I shouldn't "close the board here", but this doesn't really close the board, and I need to bingo ASAP, and there are plenty of fine lines in which I can do that right now. Your money may vary as to whether the additional 11 points are worth it for NE(ED)Y. I actually do believe NE(ED)Y is an ever so slight improvement on this play, but this one is darn close.
>JD: EEEGILT O1 GLEETIE. +80 213
>Conrad: DEIKMNP N5 IMP.ND +37 89
#note cBB: I think the K was my 7th tile. In that case, I have KN(E)ED for 5 more in the same spot, but now I really do want to bust the board open, and this would help me to do so.
>JD: CDDIMPW M2 WIMP +27 240
>Conrad: BEEEKSY 11K KEYS +34 123
#note JD: I was a little surprised that he burned his S, but it makes perfect sense since after KA/KI he has a new S lane to use. cBB: exactly, I just don't really feel like any of my other plays really help me enough here. I need to get lucky to get back in the game, so I may as well take some extra points in the process, especially as most of my options here force me to block the IMPENDS hook. I suppose K(R)E(W)E is an interesting option I didn't consider. I also should have condiered BEYS in place of KEYS, as it gives me more bingo potential, but Jesse does point out that I am creating a new S lane, potentially, too. L3 BE is also worth some consideration, as it preserves my lane, and takes Jesse's main scoring spot. Counterintuitive down 240-89, but there might be something to be said for it. *update* after letting it sit for a night, I'm starting to think BE is ther play here - it takes out Jesse's main hotspot for scoring, and keeps a bit of power - no matter what, I will need to "get lucky" to win, so I may as well take this opportunity to make things tougher for him.
>JD: CDDHORT L1 DOTH +41 281
#note cBB: One possible outcome where BE works out better.
>Conrad: ABEEGHO 12J BAH +32 155
#note cBB: Handwriting is tough to read here, but it appears I missed OBEAH, which is pretty silly of me. I find it hard to believe I'd have missed that, so maybe I misrecorded my rack, as I often wait until I have a spare moment on my opponents time and then write down a number of racks, but maybe I just majorly spazzed - not sure. Having ABEEGHI here would make a lot more sense, and I do in fact have an I on my next rack. Believe as you see fit, hehe, I'm a bit stumped, but I'll annotate it as it's on my scoresheet.
>JD: CDLNRRT -CDLNR +0 281
#note JD: I can play throuh with RYND, but the disaster potential of continuing to draw consonants loomed, and I also set up cheap points for him at 1A in the process. another option is DIRL at 4G to take out a lane. I think exchanging to avoid disaster combos is fine.
>Conrad: EEGIJOT 10J JO +32 187
#note cBB: 13I JOE seems pretty pointless here.
>JD: ABELRTU 9D BLUET +16 297
#note JD: it is difficult to make a play that is a homophone of losing (blew-it...geddit?). there was no obvious best move on this play, but it did seem to take out his easiest lane nicely. TABULI on 4C is another fair option. BLUET leaves him with the lowest bingo percentage of any play.
>Conrad: AEEGINT 8A GETA +23 210
#note cBB: I don't usually argue in favor of setting up an -ING lane, but it seems like a half decent idea here, especially as he can't necessarily score much to block it.
>JD: ?ADFNRS 7B FAD +22 319
#note JD: already low on time, it was hard to believe I didn't have a bingo, but might as well keep blocking. FAN would be a little better to avoid doubling the N.
>Conrad: AEEINOR 9L EO. +11 221
#note cBB: I'm actually surprised I'm only 100 behind.
>JD: ?ANORSU E4 UN.O +14 333
#note JD: I'd gotten into really bad time trouble by this point and didn't have the time to find either AROUSING or KORUNAS, unfortunately. however, it doesn't really matter.
>Conrad: AEIINRZ H8 ..RAZINE +81 302
#note cBB: I had hope for a very brief moment after this. Perhaps he didn't have S? after UN(c)O, and he's low on time.
>JD: ?AFIRSU 15B FAIlUR.S +61 394
#note JD: not enough time to find my best play of RUFFIANS. this has the additional downside of allowing potential bingos from the N - I could very well lose if I draw the Q and he bingos.
>Conrad: AEIINQV 14A QI +32 334
#note cBB: Nothing really to fish for here, I don't think, so I give up.
>JD: CCILNOS 13C COLIC.N +30 424
#note jD: COUNCIL is 1 better, but he challenged.
>Conrad: AEINTV -  +0 334
#note cBB: Just incase it was coll(ic)ins or something.
>JD: S K10 ...S +8 432
#note JD: time!!!
