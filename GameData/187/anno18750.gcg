#note Underscored by 10?!
>Mike_Baron: AEHIILX -  +0 50
>Joshua_Sokol: ACCEINR E8 .NCI +12 101
#note I didn't know C(O)CINERA. I did know CARIN(A)E. I knew this was bad. Had no clue. Blanked on everything. Also, this takes an A and I keep forgetting that in game...
>Mike_Baron: BDOY K11 BODY +30 80
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEOORT L10 COO +21 122
#note Nope. Saw COROTATE through a T and somehow didn't see CORONATE through an N.
>Mike_Baron: FI 9C FI. +21 101
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFGMRT 7I F.M +20 142
#note I didn't even look for a bingo, this time I missed FRAGME(N)T
>Mike_Baron: EEHIR L4 HIREE +26 127
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGHRT K1 GERAH +33 175
#note I guess if I'm going to unnecessarily open a triple lane then I should play HEREAT at 12A, obviously I still had forgotten that UNCIA existed. Every play that is better than this is only better than this if I see UNCIA. So utter board vision failure here, like 4 turns in a row at least.
>Mike_Baron: AEW J1 AWE +32 159
>Joshua_Sokol: EGLRTUY 1G GUL.. +21 196
#note GREYL(AG) is cool, didn't know it. URGE(N)TLY is boring. I need to block the 3x3, this isn't the time to bingo...

So yeah, 5 turns in a row where it seems my brain is subconsciously trying to get me to lose the game.
>Mike_Baron: AIIX 12B IXIA +29 188
#note I was really confused until I saw the A go down. Then I "d'oh"ed, like Mr. Baron would sometimes.
>Joshua_Sokol: EENRTVY B10 VE.NY +38 234
#note so easy...
>Mike_Baron: ALOTV M1 LOVAT +28 216
>Joshua_Sokol: DEERTTW 14J W.TED +40 274
#note Equity nomnomnom. Little did I know that I had bled at least 100 equity over the total of a few turns this game. I thought I was playing pretty well...
>Mike_Baron: AOP 15H APO +20 236
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIPRTU 13A U.ITER +40 314
#note I saw UNIT, then I saw UNCIAE (wow!), and decided UNITER was better than UNITE given the vowel/consonant ratio. I also wrote down EEINPRTU and probably didn't even try to find something in there for more than a few seconds. That's missed bingo number 1,552,342,104 this game.
>Mike_Baron: EGR H1 .RGE +6 242
>Joshua_Sokol: EIJNPTU G6 PU.JI +23 337
#note Made my easy equity play even easier! :(
>Mike_Baron: OT 1M .OT +9 251
>Joshua_Sokol: ADELNST N5 SLANTED +69 406
#note Only bingo available! (lol this is sad, at least I saw it)
>Mike_Baron: AEERRST 4B ARREST.E +66 317
#note Held and scored as 68 once released. He missed O7 TEARERS, but that would have given me another bingo...
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEILNO B3 N. +2 408
#note -1 to dO(A)BLE in the same spot, also blocking Z(A)S and going out with (J)IN(K) G9, which I missed. 

On another note, I would not have seen LOBELIN(E) had Mike made it available to me by finding TEARERS given how this game went...
>Mike_Baron: SZ H14 Z. +11 328
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEILO O7 BOILEr +38 446
#note Incredible how many times I gave this game away to my opponent who probably just couldn't do anything about it... There's no use in me ever drawing well if I can't see any 8s!
>Joshua_Sokol:  (S) +2 448
