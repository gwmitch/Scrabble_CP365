#note still on rest. i think this is a huge mistake. GOSH is awesome - could still block most bingos and if he bingoes at K1 i have a great chance of a comeback bingo! :(  (-9.5)

#note i like NIXED going for ZA. 10C BINDS is kind of cool though. i can also go for ZA but it's harder to block and i have one more shot at it.. and i keep the X to score the turn after that!

#note i was talking about this move constantly at lunch but no one really gave me any tips for how to reliably find the best play here. if my rack was AFNORTW and i was going first i would not miss the bingo. do i just need constant anagramming practice? it is so frustrating. this is a game-losing play, as you will see.

#note well, this may have been even more of a game losing play. AWL was my first instinct and i should have gone for it, but it seems as if leaving the L12 scoring spot open might be a mistake. how about C11 RAJ, the other play i wanted to make? According to Quackle both of those are a million times better than what i did.
