#note Tasha Crashes and Burns at NSC Episode 7.  I was looking forward to this game because I thought Elizabeth beat me twice before.  But we were actually 1-1 before the start of this game.

#note I passed up on JIMPY because of the X hot spot on column O.  However, there's also a hotspot at 10J that is worth a comparable amount of points. I really should have just played JIMPY for the extra six points and superior leave.
