#note So I'll exchange 1!
>Lisa_Odom: FO 8H OF +10 10
>Matt_Canik: ACEILNP 7F PELICAN +71 71
#note Trying to figure out what gave back the fewest counters bingos and 2x2s. This is the best I could think of since I don't string the E out. 
>Lisa_Odom: EEMNSST K6 T.MENESS +70 80
>Matt_Canik: AAEENOR 8K .ORAE +27 98
#note After my horrific game against Josh where my word knowledge imploded, it took a lot of guts for me to play this. Man, not knowing words is stressful.

>Lisa_Odom: DEUX N10 .EDUX +26 172
>Matt_Canik: AAAELRW 11G AWAR. +22 192
#note The speedy player play here is AWA, which I came close to playing. But on a board this bad for bingos, there's no reason to hold AELR. Grabbing the 5 extra points is probalby wise (sim agrees)

>Matt_Canik: ABDDELN 14B BLAND +35 247
#note Correctly guess that BLANDED* is no good. If I were trailing by a little more I may have tried it. 
>Lisa_Odom: EJTTU C3 JUTTE. +30 278

#note Oh jeez, there's a really nice play this turn. 
>Lisa_Odom: FGR 4A FR.G +24 302
#note NTH 9E was that play.

#note Maaaaaybe I can bingo out. 
>Lisa_Odom: ?OQ L1 QO.h +48 463
#note Naw
>Matt_Canik: EILOSSV D2 LO. +13 337
#note In a few months, this would be a pretty nice setup. SOLVE/ANDS is my play here.
