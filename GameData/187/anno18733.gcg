>Matt: ACFTUWX 8G FAUX +28 28
>Andy: AIPT 9I PIA +24 24
#note Originally put down PITA but likely reconsidered creating the 8L hotspot.
>Matt: CEHNSTW I6 WH.. +16 44
#note Struggled with this rack for a while, but am happy to see this do well in the sim.  I agree that WENT 7F is better; 7 more points and CHS is a powerful leave.
>Andy: AET J7 A..TE +19 43
>Matt: CEENNST 11F SENT.NCE +70 114
>Andy: DIIMO N10 IDIOM +32 75
#note I was so sad he obstructed the E.
>Matt: ?AJKOOR M13 JAK +50 164
#note JACKEROO would've been 102, not to mention an awesome word.  50 for JAK# is a nice consolation.
>Andy: AEILNR 15H RELIN. +33 108
#note Originally put down LEAN down column O before realizing the phony IL*, then played this.
>Matt: ?DEOORY 12B jOYRODE +80 244
>Matt: AEEHIMW (challenge) +5 249
#note This is a fun blank rack that has two solutions, the TWL one I played and a Collins-only word.

>Andy: S 7I ...S +10 275
>Matt: ?ABGNOU 2J BA.ON +30 612
#note Played this when I saw the CULT(U)S spot for my out in 2.  GUAN D1 and BrOW 6F does best.

#note My first 600 tournament game.  Scored as 642 because I can't add.
