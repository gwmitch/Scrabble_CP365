#note Jason said later that he saw SUNLAND (a word I didn't know). I can't remember why he said he elected to pass it up here. 
>Matt_Canik: EJLNPST 15D PELTS +60 166
#note In haste I threw down PELTS before noticing that JETS scored more. I thought for a while and decided that the small sacrifice was probably worth not giving him the knowledge of a few of my tiles. 
>Jason_Li: EEHI 4H HI.EE +24 128
>Matt_Canik: AJNORRU 5E JURA +27 193
#note B6 scores 3 more points. Bad. 
>Jason_Li: EGMR E10 GERM +32 160
>Matt_Canik: ABENORY 3I B.NARY +39 232
#note The first of several positions in this game where I'm forced to decide between equity and bingo defense. HA is just asking for bingos forming SHA, and HIREE strings letters out that make a real;y friendly board for bingos. BINARY accomplishes a lot of cool things: it knocks out SHA and HIREE while still scoring 39 points! but it leaves a really bad leave and gets rid of the Y that I would love to use at F10. Still, I stand by this play even as quackle sims BON(E)Y K1 4.5 points ahead.

#note Another turn between equity and bingo defense. The WAE->TWAE spot set up here isn't a *huge* concern, but it definitely creates a lucrative bingo line if he has the right stuff and with both blanks out it's possible that he does. the B column is still totally available for bingos and it's going to be really hard to justify a play that blocks those, especially when I'm giving up both Os that could be used for 6E to string a word that way. 
>Jason_Li: AITW B11 WAIT +30 223
>Matt_Canik: AEEIRTT A7 RETIA +23 285
#note More defense vs equity decisions! The WARE lane is immensely dangerous right now. Thankfully, I can knock everyting out. Bot how? ETA for 11 holding EIRT ? or a longer word that scores more points but sets up possibilities for 7s? I roll the dice that Jason can't hit this spot. 
>Jason_Li: UVV -UVV +0 223
#note Jason can't hit the spot. 
>Matt_Canik: ELMNOTY 1G LOMENT +35 320
#note I got really excited about this play. It scored 35 and held the Y for BOGY. Now I will be up by so much that I can survive a bingo easily. 
>Jason_Li: CHI A13 HIC +32 255
>Matt_Canik: EEGPUXY F7 P.XY +42 362
#note POGY or POXY? there's nowhere else for the X to go so I just played it here. Now he's going to need two bingos or a huge play to catch me.
>Jason_Li: ?DE 13G ....zED +50 305
#note Uhoh, this bodes very poorly for me. He's likely got the other one.
>Matt_Canik: CDEEEGU L9 DEUC. +16 378
#note CEDE B6 is a much better option to leave one in the bag. 
>Jason_Li: ?AGIOSU 2B AGOUtIS +68 373
#note When Jason started to lay down a bingo, I was sure it was going to be VIrAGOS, which would end with a one-point loss for me. Phew.
