>Joe_Edley: EEG 9F GEE +13 13
>JD: AACIORY 10E COY +24 42
#note I was drawn to the defensive value of this play, but GEE indicates a bunch of one-pointers left over anyway, so might as well keep a better leave and just play OY
>Joe_Edley: ?AACELN 7I ANLACEs +68 81
#note not sure why he didn't hook foys?
>JD: AAGIIOR E10 .IAO +12 54
#note not my finest draw...I missed ORGIAC here at E5, which looks like my best play. However, my play does leave me with a much higher bingo percentage (30% V 17%) and opens the board, something I would always rather do against Joe.

>Joe_Edley: UX 12K XU +31 183
>JD: AEILOOT 6H ALOE +18 181
#note he played XU very fast, which suggested to me that his leftovers tiles were good (also indicated by HAEN). therefore I figured it would be worth doing what I could to block the S hook of SAY (all 4 unseen), instead of just cleaning up my rack with OOLITE. this is reflected in the bingo percentage after ALOE.
>Joe_Edley: ABENSST 5C ABSENTS +77 260
#note he had banjoist anyway as backup
>JD: IIMOPST K11 O..M +26 207
#note the board is pretty dead and I'm down 80. his next play if I don't create a new opening will be to block the top-left. the trouble with OXIM is that he just about always has an E. I thought about playing IMPEL at K3 also, but I didn't think IOST bingoed enough. in retrospect, should probably play IMPEL, or maybe PI at 4F.

>JD: DEILOUW F2 WIL.D +21 291
>Joe_Edley: ERSZ 3E S.ZER +25 339
#note probably telegraphs the blank as a play, in retrospect - hard to see him opening a lane otherwise
>JD: DEEEOUU -EEOUU +0 291
#note a really bad spot - should I be holding EU and trying to draw the Q for B9? probably too many tiles in the bag for that to be a reasonable strategy. quackle thinks I should've just kept the E, which I agree with now.
>Joe_Edley: PW 11J W.P +13 352
>JD: DDEHNOR H1 HO. +18 309
#note almost out of time, I was going for a bingo from the H, but quackle points out a huge missed opportunity - dropping the D for FRAMED and trying to draw HOUNDER at B9 for 87! I'm sure that I looked for that kind of opportunity but I must have passed it up for some reason.
>Joe_Edley: ?ENRTUU 1H .aUNTER +10 362
#note in retrospect, what a missed chance! if he goes ahead and plays this and I do get HOUNDER, I might suddenly be the favorite! he did this to block banjoist and the bingo lanes.
>JD: ADDENRU 9B R.D +4 313
#note no real winning chances, just a desperation fish. out of ideas. US at 10B could allow me to win back some spread. as it turns out, he had the last U, so even if I do play HOUNDER I most likely would've gotten stuck with the Q (and this would have to be after hitting a 1/10 fish).
