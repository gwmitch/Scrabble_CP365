>Matt_Canik: AEJORRU 7I JUROR +49 49
#note JURA sims neck-and-neck. Against a really strong opponent like Jim, I may want to open a volatile S hook on a board that is already shaking up to be closed. 
>Jim_Kramer: AD K5 DA.. +10 40
#note Jim spent a really good amount of time before playing this. I tag him to be pretty strong for an S right now- fishing doesn't make much sense without one. 
>Matt_Canik: AAEEENU 6M EAU +7 56
#note I figure he's likely holding something like AENRS. I'm still fairly certain - like 60-80% - that he's holding an S. So I knock out JURORS with this play and make it somewhat tough for him to bingo. It seems counterintuitive to put a tile in a 3x3 when oppt is fishing, but a U in the 6th spot seems pretty unlethal. I still really like this play...

#note Okay that is NOT what I was expecting to happen next.

#note God why am I so bad at scrabble sometimes. I didn't like this but the more I thought about it the more I could justify playing a word I was unsure of - falling behind, down a bingo, can't find any options that score well and hold well.

#note Held and released. He wouldn't phoney when up 150, would he? :(
>Matt_Canik: EIILLNR E1 LINE.R +14 314
#note An example of me cratering after one bad misplay. I implode on myself so often when I know I've blown a game. I need to work on staying calm I guess.
