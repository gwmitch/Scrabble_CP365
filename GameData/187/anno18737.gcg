#title 2014 NSC Round 18
#description Eric Tran plays Jesse Day in Round 18 at the 2014 NSC
>Eric: EEILNTW 8D WINTLE +26 26
#note this was the annotated game from round 18 of the 2014 NSC.
>Jesse: ADINOPR J6 PADRONI +79 79
#note JD: matters very little, but PONIARD arguably would lead to a more defensive board shape by not opening the bottom-right quadrant
>Eric: DEEINUY F6 EN.UYE +19 45
#note Eric: I spent about 10 minutes on this rack.  3 minutes was used deciding if ENNUY was a word.  EYED is 30 pts.  K10 YE keeps DEINU, which can bingo.  Bad move.  Not like ENNUYE even keeps a good leave.

>Jesse: AAEEEFG 12D AGEE +20 99
#note JD: for the rest of the game I fast-played Eric as much as possible (some of my moves were straightforward)
>Eric: ?ADDINT K1 NIDATeD +72 117
>Jesse: AEFGGHU E2 FAUGH +29 128
#note JD: I saw FUDGE but passed it up - quackle prefers it because it takes away the cheap Q and X plays he can hit at J2.
>Eric: ABEELOU 1J U.ABLE +27 144
#note Eric: Chickened out on UNBALE.  That's 6 pts.

>Jesse: ?AEGOOQ 4D Q.AG +28 156
>Eric: EIMORRS N1 .ORIMERS +74 218
>Jesse: ?EFMOOT M6 FOOTMEn +73 229
>Eric: AEIKRSS H1 KAISER +49 267
#note Eric: I laid KI L8 first, setting up my S.  But then I wafered on whether KOSS was valid, and decided to make the play I was 100% on.  KI is valuing 12 pts ahead of KAISER, despite KAISER scoring 24 pts immediately more than KI.  It is so deadly.

>Jesse: ADIJPRV L11 PAVID +32 261
#note JD: my win percentage after KI/KOS drops to just 25% - I would have to either play VID at 13B to set up the J, or go ahead and play PAVID at L11 and hope I could get some counterplay.
>Eric: IINORSV 15G VIROI. +30 297
>Jesse: AHJLRTY 8L J..H +66 327
>Eric: EEENOOS 9C OE +8 305
#note Eric: Low on time.  Sim likes O(G)EE, giving me chances to outrun by hitting the x3.  Should not have spent so much time on ENNUYE.

>Jesse: ALNRTXY 13A LYNX +37 364
#note the pool was a bit anemic, so I figured I had to go ahead and take my points, and I could block next turn on row 10 if he took the points on column A.
>Eric: CEELNOS A11 CE.LO +24 329
#note JD: my time pressure worked - he missed ECHELONS here!  Eric: OMG I'm the worst.


>Jesse: AIORTTW 10B WITT. +27 391
#note JD: the only threat I could see was SUBNETS, so I blocked over here.
>Eric: BENSSTZ 14K B.ZES +36 365
#note Eric: If I had played CLON last turn, I would have had BLITZ for a lot!
>Jesse: ACORU I5 RAC. +25 416
>Eric: NST 2H .NT.S +13 378
>Eric:  (OU) +4 382
