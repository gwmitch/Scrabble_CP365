>Chris: ?BIINOT 8D BIOTINs +72 72
#note BIONTIc is clearly better for short and long term board dynamics, but I saw BIOTINs and played it within 3 seconds :(
>Fern: EIVY I5 VEI.Y +16 16
>Chris: ABCNOUV E7 B.VOUAC +28 100
#note Played this immediately too - was glad she didn't block the I :)
>Fern: ADELRSW G3 WRASL.ED +68 84
#note So she plays this, and I don't notice the transposition until she is just about to draw. I start to say hold and she looks down and notices it, but I tell her that it's too late and she thanks me profusely and keeps drawing, lol. At least I escaped 14B WARSLED for 91.
>Chris: EEGGINT J8 .EG +12 112
#note Didn't want to open the J6 hotspot with (V)EG or (V)EGGIE 5I, so I fished with SEG. I forgot about the SEGO hook momentarily, though. I might play WEETING G3 if I had to do this one again.
>Fern: EEEEE -EEEEE +0 84
>Chris: EGHINPT 13C ET.HING +32 144
#note I didn't know that PECH compared - PECHING looks best here.
>Fern: EEIJ H11 JI.EE +39 123
>Fern: EEIJ --  -39 84
#note Very proud of this instachallenge... not really lol - I'll take the free turn though! 
>Chris: DEHLLNP C9 HELP.D +16 160
#note What in the actual ... am I doing? Wow lol... Didn't know LETCHING, but 5H H(A)L(V)ED is much better.
>Fern: EEIJ H1 JEE +35 119
>Chris: AFILNRY B13 FAY +41 201
#note Wanted to play FI(N)NY H11 here, and then took the points with FAY instead. FINNY is pretty clearly better - it keeps a better leave and obstructs the SEGO/SEGS line. 
>Fern: CIRU 5C CURI. +14 133
#note RU(N)IC H11 is 24 with just those letters.
>Chris: ILNNPRS D2 INR.N +10 211
#note The sim likes SIN E12 here, but I like my play better, I think - LPS is nice and this doesn't open anything else. 
>Fern: FINORST 11I FORINTS +74 207
#note I deserved this for playing SEG, not so cleverly thinking it was a good defensive play haha
>Chris: EILPRSZ O6 PRIZE. +51 262
#note Decided to take the 6 extra points for PRIZES, since I was intending to shut down the board and win with my lead rather than try to bingo with ELRS after playing ZIPS. I didn't know the highest scoring play, ZIPLE(S)S O6 for 57, and it's worthy of consideration too since the S isnt too useful on this board.
>Fern: GO A14 GO +29 236
>Chris: ?LQSSUU 12I US +14 276
#note Pretty proud of this play - I could burn the blank for QUAIL or QUAIS for 46, but by doing this, I have 10x2 draws to hit my setup (AAAAAAEEEE) for SQUEAL/FUGS for 76 and some other stuff there and/or bingoes from the E at H2!
>Fern: MNO B9 OM +25 261
#note Laid down the N too for NOM then took it off
>Chris: ?AELQSU 14I SQUEALs +128 404
#note I hit both of them haha - I keep saying I deserve my bad luck, so I think my setup deserved this draw too!
>Fern: AEN A8 ANE +20 281
>Chris: AAIMORX 2B AX.OM +40 444
>Fern: T 6I .T +4 285
>Chris: ADEIKRT C2 .I +22 466
#note I should just take KAIN for 36 and not worry about the bingoes - wanted to keep 1 in the bag but yeah - the spread bloodletting begins here :(
>Fern: O F2 .O +10 295
#note OP/OFAY scores 14
>Chris: AADEKRT 2H .KED +11 477
#note Didn't trust my tracking, so -38 to the best play (13M KA) lol
>Fern: AAELOTW K4 TWAE +17 312
#note -24 right back to me haha - I think she was low on time.
>Chris: ADRT L10 A.RT.D +18 495
#note A(I)RT(E)D is 18 here
>Chris:  (ALO) +6 501
#note One of only 2 500 games I got at Nationals. Some bad mistakes in this one but also a few nice plays (US, BIVOUAC). This put me 3-0 coming out of the group stage, so I knew I was in for some tough competition - and I was, facing the #1 and #2 seeds directly after this game haha
