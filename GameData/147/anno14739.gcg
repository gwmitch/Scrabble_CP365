>Matthew_Larocque: CDEJPSS 8G PEC +14 14
#note I don't really like JESS, using up everything for 22? I thought keeping both esses was okay here because I created dual hooks.
>Huguette_Settle: INNOO 7D ONION +13 13
>Matthew_Larocque: DGIJRSS 8A JIGS +42 56
>Huguette_Settle: ADOT 6D DOAT +22 35
>Matthew_Larocque: DOPRRST B6 DR.PT +14 70
#note PRO(TON) is ranking a little better, I didn't see it. Leaving the T off fares well in the sim, too.
>Huguette_Settle: AE 5D AE +15 50
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIORSU C8 .IAOUR +23 93
#note A satisfying find, and the clear best play.
>Huguette_Settle: EF 4C EF +28 78
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AACFMS 11C .AF +12 105
#note I think my logic for this play was that C + M seemed like the best combo of the high point letters. I also wanted to get rid of an A, but I didn't want to give her easy points. Still, F(E)M is 21 points and AACS? is a pretty good leave.
>Huguette_Settle: AENQ 12B Q.EAN +37 115
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEHMS J2 MArCHES +85 190
#note I didn't know MESArCH, it plays for 96!
>Huguette_Settle: TUX 13E TUX +26 141
>Matthew_Larocque: AAILNRR 5J .ARL +12 202
#note MARCHES takes 3 vowel hooks! That's so awesome. Italian noblemen/noblewomen. This play is kind of weak but I didn't know the words.
>Huguette_Settle: GHITW L4 W.IGHT +34 175
>Matthew_Larocque: AILNRSY C3 Y.N +15 217
#note I know most of the fours, but HYLA is one I've never seen before. There's lots of Es left to draw so I went for the setup. Too fishy I guess when plays like 14G INLY score a lot better.
>Huguette_Settle: IIIII -IIIII +0 175

>Huguette_Settle: EMO 8L .OME +27 202

#note Only bingo.

#note lol
>Huguette_Settle: EOV N8 .OVE +19 242
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEEER 12K BEARD +30 431
#note I played this pretty fast just to prevent easy points off the hook, or some fluke bingo like WILLIES. I can't lose so it's just spread control.
>Huguette_Settle: EIKLSUY O12 .YKE +36 278
#note KEY plays for 40.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEILW 13J WILE +24 455
#note This is the best sequence I could find - missed the clever B1 WEB for L(W)EI next turn.
>Huguette_Settle: ILSU K2 US +19 297
>Matthew_Larocque: BE N2 BE +19 474
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IL) +4 478
#note Just plain lucky this game.
