#note I mostly just didn't want to put a letter in the triple. I picked this one because maybe Shan won't know it takes a D. And because if the next two plays are to snatch the TWSs, the board will then be pretty bad for bingos. I might have snagged the points for AMBERINA if I'd seen that one though.

#note I was like 90% sure this was no good. But it killed the only really scary line that could kill me with a big bingo or QUOTA/ZEBRA type play. It turned over good bingo tiles and got us closer to the end of the game. Plus, I was only 90% sure it was no good.

#note Eh... sim says TAJ. I don't really think it matters. I'm kind of planning to use this J to kill the bottom row next turn.
