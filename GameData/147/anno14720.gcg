#note I liked it better here because it opens a lane. but actually I think hooking EJECTA should be better because it takes away easy scores for him, and the board is still very open anyway.

#note wow, set that one up nicely

#note though I wanted to drop the G this is a little too open - COOL or COOT score more and also take away cheap points with ILEX hooks. also where's a Y when you need it?

#note I'm already at the stage where I have a ~2% chance of winning. the board is still very open. quackle likes YAP at I13 due to the possibility of triple-tripling. of course, in actualy peter is quite likely to block. other options would be PLAYA at B11 or PYA at 2I to keep all of my lanes open. in retrospect I think I should just take the points for PLAYA.

#note should take this lane, M6 will be easier for me to hit in future
>Peter_Armstrong: INNOU 1A .UNION +9 453
#note smart block, I probably can't beat him by bingoing on M6
>jd: DEEGITT 1A ......ED +33 406
>jd: DEEGITT --  -33 373
#note with the way the bag looks I should pretty much be blocking at this point. this doesn't really accomplish anything even if I do magically draw the blank unless he makes a dreadful mistake. but then again I'm also not in a position in this tournament where spread is likely to matter, so desperation play it is
