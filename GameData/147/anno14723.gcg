#note Dammit I talked myself out of POGEY. I might have done it if this weren't available. Sims only a point or so back.

#note I was going to do XU, but after the fish, I thought the defense was worth the equity hit.

#note I dunno, I had no clue what to do here. I actually strongly considered M11 PRAHU, but that goes wrong a lot of the time. A play Quackle suggests actually has a similar tack, though. 13L HARP sets up a lot of Q bombs, but also rarely stays open. That's the sim winner, because keeping the E helps anyways. Then 14A UH, which I also considered, but couldn't figure out what I was "fishing" for. This play is way back, which I don't get. I thought it was alright?

#note I didn't ask what her other three tiles were. But HARP clearly would not have worked, based on these four letters. PRAHU may have stayed open!
