>Matthew_Larocque: DEIOTUY 8G YOU +12 12
#note I still have a hard time knowing when short plays are better than pure scoring. But obviously DEIT is a way better leave than OU, so it seemed like the right choice. Sim agrees.
>Paul_Sidorski: AAEENOP 9G APNOEAE +75 75
#note I was really disappointed with myself here. Paul plays a phony. I'm nearly positive it's phony. But I have a 53 point counter play. If by chance I'm actually wrong, I could get screwed big time if he has a really good play next turn. The Z, worst case scenario. It's hard to challenge when you risk losing the game before it's even started, but lately my gut has been right most of the time. But I didn't listen to it, and I bombed this whole tournament.

>Paul_Sidorski: ACEUX D7 CAU.EX +34 129
#note Nice, I didn't know this one.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGILNOS O1 GASOLIN. +80 173
#note This is the only available bingo, so I was happy to find it.
>Paul_Sidorski: GRUU 3K GURU. +12 141
>Matthew_Larocque: AABEIJT N5 AB +22 195
#note I almost played J(U)BA, and then decided to play this and hope for a better J play like JOT(A) or JANE 2J.  C11 plays (BAIT, BEAT etc.) rank highly as well, but I'd feel better about them if I had an S to set up.
>Paul_Sidorski: DEKN 8A KNE.D +30 171
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIJTTW B6 JI. +26 221
#note Didn't know TWINJET, and Quackle likes playing at C11 again. J(E)T is an alternative but there's a lot of Is left.
>Paul_Sidorski: MOPR 4I PROM +27 198
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEETTW C11 WET +26 247
#note I saw WEET 5H but not TWEET haha. All 3 are pretty close.
>Paul_Sidorski: IQ 5H QI +15 213
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEILOT 12C ..fOLIATE +66 313
#note I missed (K)EITLOAs, so all the bingos looked kind of meh. I decided to take the 9 for style, but it ended up hurting me waaay too much.
>Paul_Sidorski: DRY L12 DRY +48 261
#note 48 points and a dangerous S hook? Yeah I screwed that one up.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADELOOR H12 .DOL +15 328
#note Pretty sure this was my rack. It looks like I wrote two Ds, but that's impossible, so one of the Ds must be a sloppy O. Now I'm sacrificing points to minimize the S-hook damage. 5B DOOR is winning the sim.
>Paul_Sidorski: EELRSTZ 2F SELTZER +97 358
#note Well s***. I can't say I saw that one coming. And that's why I often hate playing defense - your opponent will find a way to score anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEORV 1E VARA +31 359
#note I kind of stopped writing leaves down.
>Paul_Sidorski: FIRT 6F FRIT +31 389
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEFNOT 3G FE +22 381
#note I know I considered BENTO C2, and I did not have a blank here. And getting rid of an E must mean I had 2. Anyways, I almost played EFT 10J. I opted to play this to create another bingo line. Of course, it will surely get blocked because you know he must have at least one of the esses, if not the blank. Sim seems to like this play the most by a decent margin (32% to win vs. 26%ish for EFT). So I kinda feel ok knowing I did what I could here. But the bottom line is.... *APNOEAE.
>Paul_Sidorski: CEIIMNS 4B MINCES +27 416
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BEINOT 15A BONETaI. +80 461
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BEINOT --  -80 381
#note There's no bingos here, and obviously I saw the only word using the L which tragically does not fit. 
>Paul_Sidorski: IS 9A IS +19 435
>Paul_Sidorski:  (?BEINOT) +16 451
#note I went over - 40 looking for a bingo.
