>La_Porongita: ?DIIVVY H4 VIVIDlY +90 90
#note This is a play that I will remember... well.
>Nigel_Richards: AELLY 4H .ALLEY +24 24
>La_Porongita: ADINSTZ 3I ZA +44 134
#note It's hard having to make tough decisions like this
>Nigel_Richards: AENNRRT 7H .NERRANT +60 84
>La_Porongita: DGINSTU 10D STUD.ING +67 201
#note Just an average play
>Nigel_Richards: EGINRRT D8 RE.TRING +74 158
#note Good God, Greg, can't you just let me win?
>La_Porongita: BHIINOR O4 BIR.H +39 240
#note Still maintaining a solid 60 ppp clip
>Nigel_Richards: EKOW E5 WOKE +24 182
>La_Porongita: CIMNOOO 15D .NOMIC +33 273
#note This sort of sucks, but I wanted D and points. And my average is plummeting! :-(
>Nigel_Richards: AOU 11B AU.O +12 194
>La_Porongita: AFGOOUU C6 GOOF +25 298
#note Mildly awful- why not play this at F3, or do FOU 3L 25? Wanted to block a few good lanes
>Nigel_Richards: ACEPR 2J PACER +41 235
#note Not sure what his other letters were, but PRE(BIRTH) woulda been a peach, hon!
>La_Porongita: ABLPSUU 14F BAP +31 329
#note Best play is 14N (N)UB, which I considered... this is sort of bad, but scores best and is very defensive
>Nigel_Richards: EX F5 EX +55 290
#note Why didn't I just play GOOF there...
>La_Porongita: DHLNSUU 10A UH +26 355
#note Surprisingly a lil bit worse than H(A)ULS B10- doesn't that just invite a column A bingo ending in e or s?
>Nigel_Richards: EJ A8 JE. +30 320
>La_Porongita: DEILNSU 8M DU. +12 367
#note This is rather lousy, 78.5% to win versus 85.8% for.... (HA)ULED B10. Yeah, that be way better. Even 5J LINE would have been nice
>Nigel_Richards: EEF 6J FEE +31 351
#note Pounding those bonus spots
>La_Porongita: AEILNOS 9K AEONS +28 395
#note This, I had no idea what to do. Pool is very inviting, and I'm figuring he done had a blank at this point. Do I block the last plausible bingo lane (row 12 R-)? Or do I take out 13C QI 46? I was truly clueless. My play sims well, but in retrospect I wish I would have blocked with 13C LI, which still leaves AEONS later. But what's a brotha gonna do?? Any thoughts, putitos?
>Nigel_Richards: IQ C13 QI +46 397
#note Oh Greg, dahling, how you hurt me so
>La_Porongita: DILOTTT 1F DITTO +24 419
#note Running a poquito low on time, but I really didn't know what to do. Basically, try to score as much as I could, and hope he doesn't bingo. Thought about 1H IDOL, but didn't like the hideous TTT leave. I didn't worry too much about emptying the bag- if he bingos, I'm SOL because I'm not going to bingo, so I'd lose regardless. Plus, spread don't matter in club! This seemed like the best scoring play, that leaves me with decent letters that would maybe somehow work out well next turn? Really hard-hitting analysis here... but sure enough, it does way better than any other move, 46.6% vs. 34.5% anything else. Though upon inference of a blank, it falls a wee bit short of 1I TOT and 1H IDOL.... wateva. Any ideas?
>Nigel_Richards: ?AEIOSW 4B SWEAr +35 432
#note Greg missed a handful winning plays here- 4C rIAS/pIAS/bIAS/SIAl, 4B OhIAS/ObIAS/IdEAS/IOtAS, even 4B WEkAS and a few others. Basically, blocking my METAL B4, and leaving the W in order to go out with more points on the next turn (e.g. 1M WOE)
>La_Porongita: AELLMST 2B MALLET +27 446
#note Best, tied with SAMLET (which I didn't know- MATLESS/SAMLETS?) in the same spot. Everything else loses
>Nigel_Richards: IO 11K OI +12 444
#note All he could do. I guess I'm going to have to give my dear sister a kiss after this one. Beware, dear Madeline....
>Nigel_Richards:  (S) +2 446
#note Good game! And thus I end the night 3-0-1. Unbeaten, but not undefeated... or something dumb like that. What a long, strange trip it was
