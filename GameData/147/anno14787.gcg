#note Quackle wants me to play OXTER underneath. One less point but leaves ER, though gives a nice X spot underneath. Eh.

#note WASP 10C, though he may have been setting up a second S.

#note challenge
>scott: ?CEFLQT C9 Q.T +24 292
#note didn't see the TOQUET spot. Quackle likes CL(E)FT, which I considered but wanted to dump the Q pretty quickly to try to get down a bingo.

#note pretty close in sim to bingos

>scott: ?ADLTVY O5 VAL.DiTY +68 394
#note I didn't realize there were only three tiles in the bag, but Quackle says this wins every time. IVY at A7 seems much worse somehow. I'm not really sure why, it would be awfully hard not to draw a bingo in two spots from ADLT?, though if I get two consonants I might be in trouble.
