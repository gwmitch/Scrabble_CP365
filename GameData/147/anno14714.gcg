#note 7G MUON, 9H/D OVUM better
>Nigel_Richards: IM 9G MI +22 32
>La_Porongita: AEENOPR D7 OPENER +31 49
#note Not bad, but D4 PAEON, and row 10 OPEN/NOPE/PEON a bit better. Didn't consider MUM-P
>Nigel_Richards: IOP C11 POI +16 48
>La_Porongita: ACEFJRS E9 FACER +44 93
#note Glad to have seen this. Almost packed it in with E11 RAJ, but thankfully kept on looking
>Nigel_Richards: ?ABCILT I9 BACkLIT +74 122
#note 10H CuBITAL 76 slightly better
>La_Porongita: AJNSSYZ 15F JAN.Y +45 138
#note What to do with all this loot... aye, how to divvy up all the booty?
>Nigel_Richards: DEE 8A DEE. +21 143
>La_Porongita: OSSSVWZ J6 VOWS +26 164
#note Best, but surprisingly B12 SOWS 20 2nd best? Leaving SVZ? Thanks, but no thanks
>Nigel_Richards: EGLRY 11I .LERGY +24 167
>La_Porongita: ERSSSXZ B6 ZE.S +33 197
#note Oh dear Lord Quetzalcoatl, how good thou art to me! This is the goodest by far, though giving away my hand a bit
>Nigel_Richards: EHIRT 8J .RITHE +39 206
>La_Porongita: IINRSSX B13 XIS +29 226
#note Yeah, beeyotch, I got all the S's and I ain't afraid to show it! I don't give a shite, I'll telegraph this all day long, what you gonna do about it, Alexander Bell? Draw yourself an S? Ha! Good luck with that!
>Nigel_Richards: AK A14 KA +30 236
>La_Porongita: ADINRST L2 DISTRA.N +68 294
#note Thought about playing O3 RANDI(E)ST 60, since it's far more defensive and all and gives less back... but I wanted them points. What is this, soccer?
>Nigel_Richards: AEOT C3 TOEA +19 255
>La_Porongita: ADFGNOU 3G FUNGO.D +34 328
#note Hideously beautiful
>Nigel_Richards: DLO H1 LO.D +21 276
#note Steve had the Q here, thought about playing Q(U)OD...
>La_Porongita: AAABINR 10M ABA +27 355
#note Not quite sure what to do here. I'm in awfully good shape, but I thought about maybe trying to block row 13 (13I (L)ABIA?), or more definitively take care of column O to avoid OUTQuOT(E) or similar such nonsense. This is pretty good, though
>Nigel_Richards: IQ B2 QI +24 300
>La_Porongita: AEINORU 2L .OUR +13 368
#note Clueless here. Saw possibilities through the L's, but somehow decided not to block either one? Took care of column O, figuring I'd leave one in the bag and score through the R if necessary. This does really well though, actually! Thoughts?
>Nigel_Richards: ?EGLNTW 10D ..W +14 314
#note Actual rack
>La_Porongita: AEEINOT 13H E.ATION +14 382
#note Tied for best with LINEATE- can't block both lanes, but better to make him do it in row 1
>Nigel_Richards: ?EGILNT O1 T.IGoN +24 338
#note Steve missed 1C GLuTE(L)IN. Frankly, so did I! O1 G(R)aTINE(E) woulda been pretty swell
>La_Porongita: E 4G E. +8 390
#note Lo mejor
