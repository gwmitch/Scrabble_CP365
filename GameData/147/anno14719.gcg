#note though FETAL and FATAL sim better, I suspect they end up playing QI at N2 next turn a lot of the time - which is a good way to lose the game. I like this fine.
>Peter_Dolgenos: AEGRRT H10 G.R.ER +24 241
#note pretty nice play to open a lane.
>jd: AEEFHLW 10B HAE +28 316
#note with only one A left this spot is unlikely to be taken, so I might as well do something more proactive with the board and save the A. HAE offers up a T hook, which isn't a huge deal but does nothing to contain volatility (I also didn't even realize I was creating the hook at the time). the top-simming plays of HEW at N2 and FEW 14M are not ones I like against a lower-rated player. I found a play on analysis that I love looking back on this play two years later -  FEWER 15D which cuts his bingo percentage from 10 to 2%. I have to block the R at some point, and the sooner the better.
>Peter_Dolgenos: EWY M8 YEW +23 264
#note seemed at the time to block a good lane, but with the Rs all gone he was going to have a hard time hitting that spot anyway.
>jd: CDEFILW 15D WIDE. +13 329
#note with only a few vowels now remaining, WIDER might be a dangerous play to make, though it cuts down on far and away the best lane on the board. he could still hit THAE even though the bag is ugly. playing off an extra tile with WILDER gives me another shot at a vowel, or I could try something like IF/EF or FEW at 14M that partially blocks row 15. In retrospect I think I pick WILDER and hope he doesn't bingo on column A.
>Peter_Dolgenos: IPU K12 P.U +8 272
>jd: CFLNOUV D12 FLO. +20 349
#note ugh. bad. winning chances dropping. really need to dump either the U or the V. what was I thinking? I also still didn't see THAE. VOE at 6B blocks about 1/3 of his bingoes if I infer from PIU that he has the T (20% down to 13%) and starts to clean up this rack. This is the problem with playing HAE in the first place!
>Peter_Dolgenos: NOS 11A NOS +20 292
#note mercifully I guess he didn't see the hook either
>jd: ACFNNUV E2 FA +20 369
#note got lucky and drew another vowel. still did terrible things with it. quackle's number one suggestion of FUN at 14M looks totally nuts until you realize that BENISON at N9 fits perfectly and the N at 14O gives him no bingos (a hard thing to see over the board). he's no guarantee to see BENISON but at least playing FLU to keep a more flexible leave to prepare for the inevitable fish would be smart.
>Peter_Dolgenos: BEINNNO 9L ..B +5 297
#note oh shit.
>jd: CINNNUV 5M .IN +7 376
#note well. I had to really work on my tracking here and figured out that he had EINNOST pretty much as I was going over on time. I was convinced that I had just lost. I yelled "quiet please" a couple of times because everyone was headed to lunch and I was the last game. this is the only winning play.
>Peter_Dolgenos: EINNOST A11 .ONET +18 315
#note fortunately I found my only block, after already going over a minute. dodged a major bullet there. phew.
>jd: CNNUV 6C V.N. +9 385
#note I wonder if he might have had BENISON when he fished?
