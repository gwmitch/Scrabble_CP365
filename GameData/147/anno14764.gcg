#note Cool game on ISC with Noah. This is best.

Noah: BOART seems good also.
>whatnoloan: AIIKMPR G7 KIP +30 30
#note Best.

#note I am sooooooo lucky.
>whatnoloan: AEIMRTV L1 MAVI. +26 56
#note AM(B)IVERT and VER(B)ATIM blocked too... Poor Noah.
>rockzombie: ?DEIIIX 1K I.IDE +24 126
#note Cool position here that I totally blew. I didn't even see or consider MIDI. Probably the worst play of the game.

#note Does anyone prefer FOXI(E)R? Would you have challenged FOR(N)IXES, Noah? Noah : I think so.
>whatnoloan: AADDENN 3J DA.EN +22 148
#note Noah is doing really well so far.
>rockzombie: ?FIMRRS 13C FIR.aRMS +80 239
#note MISR(E)FeR and R(I)MFIReS are better.

#note Took me way too long to see this.
>whatnoloan: EILOPQS 1C QI +15 267
#note I like this.

Noah: I didn't think about just playing for points with LOPE etc. It seems like those are better, blocking a huge spot and scoring way more. Q is pretty bad on this board but still.

#note lol...
>whatnoloan: EFLOOPS 1G OF +32 299
#note P(R)OF H12? Noah: I'd rather block this spot given opponent's leave. OF has the highest valuation on a sim.
>rockzombie: ACDHLLW H12 C.AW +36 386
#note I think this is right. Keeping the H for (S)H 14J.

#note TOTALLY WHUP here. No question. And no excuse for having missed it...
>whatnoloan: CEHLOOS B4 .ESCHOOL +67 394
#note CHOLO N10 is interesting here. I think RESCHOOL is better though. Things are looking grim anyways for him. Sim likes ECHO N11. Noah: I think I'm just supposed to play ECHO and hope to draw a bingo. There's not much he can do about it but try to outrun. If he plays one tile I am still in decent shape.
>rockzombie: DEOTUWZ N13 DOW +30 444
#note Major screwup here, but I didn't know what to do. TOUZ(L)E is a sure win, M10. I didn't see it. I had other wins but it's by far the best. I also didn't see his next play... I just didn't know if he had an out or not.
>whatnoloan: ?AEISY A8 ESsAY +53 447
#note He had (G)ASEItY to go out. WIS(P)Y is the best win.
>rockzombie: ETUZ A2 ZE. +14 458

#note Ughhhh... Great game! :P
