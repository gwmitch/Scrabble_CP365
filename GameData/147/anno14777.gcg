>Scott_Pianowski: BOP 8G BOP +14 14
>Avery_Mojica: AAADEGS 9G ADAGE +22 22
>Scott_Pianowski: EGO 7E EGO +11 25
#note After this play, he was down to 14 minutes.
>Avery_Mojica: ADEHNST I8 ..H +8 30
#note I couldn't bring myself to play HANDSET. Regardless, HASTENED is a miss. Still makes it onto static.
>Scott_Pianowski: ?EIINRT E4 NIT.RIEs +78 103
>Avery_Mojica: ADEINSW D10 WAD +20 50
#note 8K DWINE.
>Scott_Pianowski: FILP D2 FLIP +26 129
>Avery_Mojica: DELNOST 2A TEN.OLDS +78 128
#note The look on his face after I tracked, totaled, and played this in less than 20 seconds was priceless.
>Scott_Pianowski: ACIIN 8K ACINI +32 161
>Avery_Mojica: ?AACEEM 1A AMA +27 155
#note CAMERAE, AMESACE, ACADEME, EMACIATE. Don't know any of those. CAGE F5 is cute though. 
>Scott_Pianowski: ADNOW 1H ADOWN +36 197
>Avery_Mojica: ?ACEEYZ 2J YE +31 186
#note ZEE C11 is better, but I pressed my luck for a M2 -IZE bingo.
>Scott_Pianowski: EEEETV C8 TEEVEE +34 231
#note Don't even know why I didn't hold this. I think I was distracted by the fact that he had 7 minutes left and I was doing really well against a 1680 player. 
>Avery_Mojica: ?ACELUZ B12 LAZE +32 218
#note He complimented me on this play. I forced the board open, I dumped well, I opened a triple-triple if the -LED hooks didn't work, and I still have a wide open board for volatility.
>Scott_Pianowski: BRR 3K BRR +18 249
>Avery_Mojica: ?CEGISU 3B GE. +20 238
#note EUGENICS
>Scott_Pianowski: NORTU 15A T.NOUR +21 270
>Avery_Mojica: ?CFIJSU 8A JU. +30 268
#note Forgot about the SLED hook.
>Scott_Pianowski: HIM 7M HIM +27 297
>Avery_Mojica: ?CFIKSU 6J FUCK +31 299
#note Sometimes you just have to. Didn't think about moving it one space over. 
>Scott_Pianowski: ILNO 5H LION +17 314
>Avery_Mojica: ?IOSTVX O5 VO..T +10 309
#note He said LION was to block VOX. I needed to close the board.
>Scott_Pianowski: ORTY 10L TYRO +20 334
#note This was a setup for his Q.
>Avery_Mojica: ?AISSSX 11I SAX +29 338
>Avery_Mojica: ?AISSSX --  -29 309
#note I forgot that PAH takes no S. I figured in the back of my head that if this is no good, he'll still play QI at 11K and I can go under and score well. Math was very off.
>Scott_Pianowski: IQ 11K QI +24 358
>Avery_Mojica: ?AISSSX 12J XIS +37 346
#note I hoped he didn't know RUER to go out. This didn't let him.
>Scott_Pianowski: ERU F10 RE +19 377
#note 4D INURE is the other option. While playing this, he said "you're not making this easy"
>Avery_Mojica: ?ASS I12 ASkS +15 361
#note Close, though I should have done B6 SKUAS (didn't know), SAS(IN)S 4A, or SAYST 6A.
>Avery_Mojica:  (U) +2 363
