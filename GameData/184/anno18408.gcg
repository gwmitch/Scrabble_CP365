>cesar: ADFPSSW 8G WAP +16 16
#note I am very miscalibrated for this type of rack. I legitimately thought WAP was better than SWAP/WASP or WASPS, which is the best-simming play. (-5) The lesson to take here is: 28 points is 28 points, and don't care about playing off two Ss. DFSS is simply not a workable leave.
>mike: AQT 7F QAT +21 21
>cesar: DDFGISS J5 FIDS +19 35
#note And here, I completely reversed course and did the opposite thing based on reacting to my draw. At least here, it makes more sense to do 9H DIF; I have an S, it keeps the board tight, and gives up way fewer points. FIDS is easy to overlap and put me behind. (-4.5)
>mike: ACDE K4 CADE +30 51
>cesar: DEGGHRS 9E DREG +18 53
#note my draws are a bit annoying, but DREG gives up a lot more than GED if I am trying to keep it closed. (-1.5)

#note unfortunately i can't take advantage of the sudden opening.

>cesar: ACEINRU K10 CU.IE +14 296
#note i think i have to play something like K10 CUTE here. I honestly don't know what's right. 11D LEU keeping ACINR sims far best, but quackle is very bad at doing this type of analysis because basically 100% of the time mike is going to block row 2. The only draw that would work in both lanes is OM. So basically, I have no idea how to win this game, any thoughts appreciated. I should have done CUTE at least to make it a bit harder on him.

#note I lost a total of 16 "equity points" this game, yet I consider it to have been a pretty badly played game by me; I made at least three significant mistakes (WAP, FIDS, LATU) plus I don't know how to put a value on CUTE over CUTIE but strategically I would imagine it is immensely better.
