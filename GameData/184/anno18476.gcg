>Siddharth_Murali: AORRTTU 8H TROUT +12 12
#note This is a live game against Kenji (8/3/2014) where Kenji purposefully plays like a Division 2 player (to provide practice? :))
Joshua Sokol, a spectator, included some brief commentary, I'll add some of my own brief commentary as well. 
J: top static, looks alright. Other option is TOUR somewhere.
>Div_2_Kenji: ?FNRTTY K7 N.TTY +16 16
#note J: missing T(U)FTY and T(U)RFY
>Siddharth_Murali: AAEGGHR L11 EGGAR +21 33
#note J: like a good div 2 player Sid misses AARGH
>Div_2_Kenji: ?BDFRRV 14K B.RF +18 34
#note J: Real Kenji would have traded
>Siddharth_Murali: AAHNPSW O11 AWASH +55 88
#note J: or WASH for 3 less
>Div_2_Kenji: ??ADERV H8 .RAVEleD +83 117
#note S: Kenji thought this was the most reasonable bingo that a D2 player would play
>Siddharth_Murali: EGMNPUZ 14F ZE. +31 119
>Div_2_Kenji: BEIJNUU M9 JUN +24 141

>Div_2_Kenji: BEIISUY I4 BUYE. +11 152
>Siddharth_Murali: AHNOOOS J4 OHO +24 221
#note S: Of note: Taking the points with OOH gives back 50 on avg, this gives back 31. Sim likes this by a wide margin actually.

#note S: Inexplicably throwing a ton of win % on the table. Giving back QAT will lose a large portion of the time unless I draw into a bingo. (In this case I drew into a bingo as well as had many other winning plays, aka luckboxing). RE(R)OOF is best by far.
>Div_2_Kenji: AEIILQT O1 QAT +47 397
#note S: Kenji saw the actual best play of LI(E), but figured that D2 players would just take the points and make me find the bingo.
