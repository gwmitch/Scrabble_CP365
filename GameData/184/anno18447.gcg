#note JOULE is a lot better.

#note E7 DUOMI is nice. I want to keep the board relatively open here. 
>Fern_Lindzon: CEKOY D8 .OCKEY +44 115
>Jackson_Smylie: AAIITUW C12 WAIT +29 91
#note This was a tough decision... WAIT is best statically, but how much does the T disadvantage me? I'm down, and it creates another lane along the B column, and at this point I don't want to start sacrificing points, I sort of have to hope she just doesn't hit me there too hard.

>Jackson_Smylie: ADEFOST I6 OF +20 163
#note I see that I need to score here so that I could bingo once and catch up, rather than needing two bingoes. FADO I liked, but my worry was that a play down the J column could block all my remaining bingo lanes. the J1 to J7 lane is likely to be blocked, but unless she has an S or F, which is really unlikely, the I column is unlikely to be blocked.

#note ES(T)ATED 15A is a beautiful play, setting up another lane as well. I wasn't sure enough of TEATED to play it. I wanted to score a lot here to perhaps cut down on the spread, if could also bingo through the S.

#note This was a really fun game to play, I was happy to draw WIRETAP to lessen the damage, and KLAVERNS was an awesome find.
