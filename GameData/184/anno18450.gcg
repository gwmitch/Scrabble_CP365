#note it seemed like he was going to bingo any second now and i purposefully dumped a bunch of equity to possibly block it. i also wasn't 100% sure on RAWS, (funnily?) enough. however 12I ADVENT is probably right anyway. if he bingoes i really don't want to waste a turn with the V. (-11)

#note -7 JOY. i don't have the patience or skill to realize there are no possible triple triples. (actually, i would be extremely impressed if someone could do this in a game -- is it extremely difficult or would you have the confidence to give up a possibly 100% winning chance to play JOY?)
