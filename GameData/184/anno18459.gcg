#note This is almost certainly the best play as I draw into 7s more often with DETIES than with DITES, and also if she makes a play I draw into more 8s with 6 tiles.

#note I feel like this is better than 14A OF even though it's two less because K15 might hurt a lot.

#note COTQUEAN was a thing I missed as well. Jeez. I should play CAL(K) probably.

#note It's between this and just (DOR)E. (DOR)E seems to induce more errors but lose against Quackle more often. I also hoped that she would miss A(DORE) or not have it. 
>Maddy_Kamen: AEGLPRS B12 PAR. +25 368
#note Actual rack. She did in fact miss A(DORE). Had she played ARGLE/A(DORE), things would have been different. But perhaps she should fish here.
