#note I considered VANG keeping JQX. Partially because it's a decent option, and partly since JQX is the fucking best leave ever. I didn't want to have to work through the rack for 3 or 4 turns. Maybe if I'm going to keep the X on an exchange anyways, I might as well keep JQX and score a bunch. Quackle likes keeping AGN on an exchange. The X probably isn't too good right now.

>Jackson_Smylie: AEIIPTU D3 PIETU. +20 50
#note I have a history of getting away with phoneys against Vera... IMPUTE and UPTIME set up too many points for my liking. I am down though, perhaps opening up the board more is right. PIETUM offers enough lanes. Ultimately though there is no reason to play a phoney anagram of an only slightly worse word.

#note Closes the board a lot, SCARRED opens the bottom a lot more. Drawing a play through AXE ending in D would be a sweet board killer at this point.

#note This or ZIP? The Z is okay here with the 6J spot.

>Jackson_Smylie: DEEIMWZ 3A WIM. +22 313
#note Suddenly the Z isn't looking so hot. I liked drawing an extra tile with WIMP to go for the S's. I really don't know how to distinguish between 2B WE, 3B ZIP, 3A WIMP, 3B ZEP. They are all similarly equity-wise, and don't affect the board at all. If this board gets worse, a Z could bail me out even with a 24 point play. With just one more E left in the bag, it's a good idea to hang onto my E's.
>Vera_Bigall: KR 8M .RK +21 303
>Jackson_Smylie: DEELRTZ N10 TREED +20 333
#note Plays for one more at J10. TEL(NET)ED I5 is really cool, and a decent play. Trying to play off more tiles rather than fewer, an S here would be great. If I can draw the last E (sorta unlikely though) I can hit LEZ parallel to TREED. 
>Vera_Bigall: AAN 2A ANA +23 326
>Jackson_Smylie: ALNSVYZ 13M L.Z +24 357
#note Very careless play. (I)VY E1 is a lot better, and I can likely draw a Z play with CHAYS next turn. I completely overlooked the 4 O's in the bag when playing LEZ, thinking only ZED was an option for her. Even playing VANS/CHAYS now is okay.

#note IVY once more.

#note She said she drew all vowels after this play, I'm asuming she kept EHIR, or maybe AEHR.
