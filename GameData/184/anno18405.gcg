#note Cesar: my rack is not very workable, but i think GOUTY is ok; maybe I5 YOU? (-1.5)
Noah: I would exchange 6 or 7 here. OUV or even OTUV seems to put you really behind on such an open board. Quackle slightly disagrees with me though, in a sim.

#note cesar: i was already getting pretty upset at this point. i talked myself out of UPFLOWED, even after telling myself that it could most likely be good, but i was psyching myself out and didn't want to lose a turn and blow the game already. i think i was about 60-65% sure of it and even thought "i would play this on mostly anyone". i will need to trust my word knowledge more in the future. (-60) also, FOLIO

#note Noah: I forgot the DINKIEST hook this turn, unfortunately. BLItZ scores so much and also has much better defensive value (ZILCH doesn't really block anything, BLItZ blocks col I, and the big row 15, col H and row 14 spots). Big error.

#note Cesar: phony.. but..
>noah: DEELTUX 15C EXULTED +132 369
#note Noah: So I held ZOOECIAl and didn't like it, or it's counterpart ZOECIAL very much, but I had this, basically a guaranteed win even with 32 tiles still in the bag. If I challenge ZOOECIAl off, the only advantage I get is some extra spread, whereas if I challenge and it's good, I have a significant chance of losing as he can block EXULTED while scoring quite well in the process with a DINKIEST play. I felt I needed to be about 95-100% sure ZOOECIAl was phony to challenge, and I was nowhere near that confidence level.

#note Cesar: sorry for getting mad, i suck. it's actually right to do J12 QI here. my chances of winning are so low that i might as well go for banners or baronnes or something.

>cesar: EENQRTV D1 VE.N +26 250
#note Cesar: i don't know why i'm not playing off the Q
>noah: AAAEILP 12I ALAE +22 417
#note I'm just going for spread at this point, so my sole objectives are to maximize my points scored and minimize his. The Q looks like it could be a big factor here but I think it doesn't matter much, as it's about 50/50 that I get it (he has extra chances because he could've already kept it on his last two plays, I have extra chances because I am playing first and have the drawing initiative). I also have a better chance to draw something like QINTAR than him since I will be keeping at least one A this turn. The plays I see worth considering are ALIVE, APEX and my ALAE, though another good play could be around. ALAE scores least this turn and probably makes Cesar's scoring potential highest (row 1, row 11, column A), but also probably makes mine the highest (row 2 is most easily hit after ALAE). It seems like ALIVE would be better than APEX because it keeps the P which is good for scoring here, mostly on row 2, though 2 points and the QADI possibility are reasons to play APEX instead. Not really sure between ALAE and ALIVE. A sim might be good for distinguishing or at least pointing out big differences here, but it pretty much agrees with my intuition and puts them all very close -- within a point of each other on valuation. 
>cesar: EOQRRTY A12 OYER +34 284
#note Cesar: quackle thinks i should exchange. there may be some merit to sticking him with the Q.
>noah: AAFIPRS 11K FRAP +34 451
#note Noah: I want to make sure the Q is unstuck if I draw it and try to maximize my spread if I don't. This leaves the Q unstuck for me, as row 10 blocks leave him with all consonants and allow me to set it up. It also seems like I'd want to block row 11 because he can get strong plays (GROWN, TROW, TROG, etc.) here, so this seems like the play.
