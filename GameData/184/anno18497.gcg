#note Oops, missed the ADZE spot...  This slightly better leave isn't worth a 10-point deficit.  Tunnel vision, sigh...

#note Still wasn't worth it.  Having an A instead of an E means I still certainly bingo.  In fact, NEB + ESTANCIA scores much more.  But would I have seen ESTANCIA instantly in a real game as I did just now?  I hope so...

#note Okay, this is probably too paranoid and intermediate, but -ABLE bingos are a threat.  I wish I had been thinking about them at the time rather than coming up for a justification for a dumb play after the fact...  Actually, this doesn't sim badly though.

#note Yikes.  I'm actually surprised this isn't a word.  I'm obviously mixing it up with KLONG.  I think this would be a hard challenge for most intermediates though...

#note After Dan played this, I was thinking to myself, "What?"  That sounded so outrageous and let me off my guard so much that I ended up not challenging.  Not that it mattered...
