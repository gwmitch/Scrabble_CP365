>Matthew_O'Connor: CDEOU H4 COUDE +22 22
>Jackson_Smylie: DGHIOTY 6F DO.GHY +26 26
#note Saw DOUGHTY, and thought of playing it to go for the challenge. I think regularly it's a bit better as well, no reason not to take the extra point.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AILTX K1 LAXIT. +32 54

>Matthew_O'Connor: OPRV O1 P.RVO +42 96
>Jackson_Smylie: AEFIISW 1H WAI. +26 100
#note Thought about WIFE as well as FAIL. I'll take an F over a W, and AIS isn't as balanced as EFIS. points are good
>Matthew_O'Connor: AEHNN 4F EN.HA.N +24 120
>Jackson_Smylie: BEFIMRS M1 F.B +16 116
#note No good S hooks on the board, but there are decent enough bingo lanes to make FIB okay. FIBS is another option, which I like since EIMR is still decent.
>Matthew_O'Connor: BEENOR 3B ENROBE +25 145
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EILMRS N5 MILkERS +66 182
#note Missed Lo(R)IMERS through the R, which scores better. Not too happy with milKers.

>Jackson_Smylie: ?DEEOPR --  -85 193
#note Really stupid play... why would I phoney here? was being greedy, and ironically miss deportee 8a.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ELOUZ O11 OUZEL +47 232
>Jackson_Smylie: ?DEEOPR 14H DEPORtE. +82 275
#note Board vision fail!! 8A
>Matthew_O'Connor: NOU H12 UN.O +18 250
>Jackson_Smylie: AIINRST F6 .ISTRAIN +61 336
#note DISTRAIN sims best on Quackle, but all are valuated within a point or two of one another. DISTRAIN doesn't give up too many bingoes, although RAINIEST doesn't either. 2 points is nice though.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AEEIRST 10E A.TERIES +60 310
>Jackson_Smylie: AGMOSWY L12 WA.Y +28 364
#note WOMY(N) is best according to championship player... WA(R)Y is said to only win 7/8. If I draw the K he has ACETATE. I didn't think this turn through enough, I just sort of autopiloted and assumed the win.
