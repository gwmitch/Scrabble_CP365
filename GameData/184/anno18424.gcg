#note HAGRODE is a litle more defensive
>Matt_Canik: EEFRRTU 7I REFUTER +66 66
#note A sim actually prefers this placement to the underneath placement. I thought hard about where to put this. Glad I made the right call..
>Lloyd_Mills: EEJS O4 JEE.S +60 138
#note :(
>Matt_Canik: GIKNOWX 7C GOWK +30 96
#note Apparently I overthouht this turn. OX 9H is blowing out the options in a sim. I thought holding the X was a good idea because I could just cash in 9I next turn a lot. GIKNW seems like such a juky leave, but I guess I can pull a lot of -ING words that will score a ton.

>Matt_Canik: EINPRTX 9H EX +38 134
#note Pulling an -IN(G) 2x2 would be so nice
>Lloyd_Mills: DY N5 DY. +31 191
>Matt_Canik: AINNPRT 6B PANT +27 161
#note Maybe I should just play PAN and keep going for that -IN(G) bingo? But that sets up SPAN...
Sim has both options side by side, maybe a slight edge to PANT.

#note Trying to dig further into the bag for an E, S, or scoring tile. Those are probably going to determine this game now that BLOND is there.

>Matt_Canik: ABITUVZ 9A TAV +25 300
#note I'm in a bad position here.... I'm hoping that, for whatever ridiculous reason, he doesn't make a play at O12 and I draw a S/C/E for ZINC/ZINS/ZINE. I don't think a bingo is happening for me this game.

#note (A)HI K3 is cool, but this game is over. 
>Lloyd_Mills: I 5J .I. +12 396
#note Lloyd's fish makes me think he held ACEINS or maybe AEIMNS, so I've got about a 50% shot at the Q next turn. Unfortunately, I can't find good scoring plays if I pull it that aren't QUOTE/QUITE at 2F. I just lose here.
