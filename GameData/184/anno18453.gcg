#note Edit: Posted this game because it was very strategically interesting. Pipe up if you have anything to say, especially about AEEGNOT and EILMNOO in the pre-endgame -- I have no idea what to do there. Here, UPTIME is better against Orry to open the board. From past tournaments, and especially this tournament, it seemed apparent that Orry is probably a better strategist than me but not so good at consistently finding star plays and very rusty with word knowledge, which is something I'm very good at. YUP doesn't get me what I want at all.

#note Orry's been signaling a good rack by his plays and his deliberateness in the last few turns. I could just do BOG here. I have to fade a bingo in the upper left hand corner, and if he gets one I'm not in a great spot, but if I do I think I'm in pretty good shape. Even if he bingos I can play AXE 10M to set up my the case S, and blocking is hard (row 10 plays often give up S hooks). This play is pretty bad. EG isn't a great leave and I am opening letters for him to bingo through. Opening the scoring spot might be a good aspect of ABATIS, though he can use the spot to refish and score well in that process, often leaving a lane on row 14 or row 13. BOG is very strong. ABA is also a good play. Though it gives him bingos making the blank an S if he has the blank, it helps me fade V bingos. I think I like BOG here and this seems like a pretty huge mistake, which stems from me not correctly figuring out what the position called for.
