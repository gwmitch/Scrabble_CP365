>Jackson_Smylie: DEFLORV 8D VOLED +26 26
#note At this point, I am 8-3 and Matthew is 9-2. I need to win this game and then the last game against him in order to win the tournament, Matthew has to win either of the two. This is also my 500th tournament game.
>Matthew_O'Connor: LOVW G5 VOW.L +16 16
>Jackson_Smylie: AEEFRYZ F8 .AZY +38 64
#note (O)YEZ is nice since it sets up an FA play underneath. I don't know how much of a consideration it is right now to take away the VOWELS hook. I'm up 48 after this play, and LAZY definitely limits his bingo options, by about 5%. 
>Matthew_O'Connor: PX 6F P.X +18 34
>Jackson_Smylie: BEEFQRU E11 BEEF +32 96
#note I am really happy to be drawing such nice tiles at the beginning of the game, I could easily get a bingo lead like this. BEEF sets up a Q play at 12A.
>Matthew_O'Connor: EEIINOT -EEII +0 34
>Jackson_Smylie: AOQRTUU 12A QUOT. +48 144
#note Super happy to see the second U.
>Matthew_O'Connor: HTY 15C THY +26 60
>Jackson_Smylie: AHIILRU A12 .UAI +39 183
>Matthew_O'Connor: ?CDENRU D3 uNCUR.ED +76 136
#note Damn! UNCURVED*. I wasn't prepared to challenge since I saw he could make the blank an I for INCURVED and an A for UNCARVED. VERECUND is a nice word.
>Jackson_Smylie: EHILORS 13C HO. +24 207
#note HO(u)RLIES I missed. Gotta review my 8s.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ?AEGRTU 14E .RUiTAGE +65 201
#note (D)AUGhTER is the best bingo here.
>Jackson_Smylie: AEIKLRS H12 KA.L +36 243
>Matthew_O'Connor: ABDR 15L DRAB +32 233
>Jackson_Smylie: AEGIMRS 13J MAGI +26 269
#note I know MAGI doesn't take an S, but my hope is that he plays atop MAGI and gives me an S hook.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AGP 12K GAP +33 266
>Jackson_Smylie: EIRSSST N6 SISTERS +68 337
>Matthew_O'Connor: CEIOR 5G .OICER +31 297
>Jackson_Smylie: EIINNRT 7G .IN +19 356
#note Nothing else scores much better, and it does not hurt to keep EINRT here.
>Matthew_O'Connor: EMOOSTW M2 TWOSOME +103 400
#note Fantastic overlap! He played this really quickly. I was not expecting this to happen.
>Jackson_Smylie: EEINNRT 10H INTERN.E +60 416
#note I liked INTERNEE for 60 more than the other two bingoes (internee and renitent) since it leaves Matthew with fewer options if he doesn't have JIL(T)ED. I am not expecting to win this game, if he has an out in two my chances of winning are pretty slim. I have to hope I pull a nice enough rack that I can outscore his out in two, or that he has a bad enough rack he can't make an out in two or his out in two doesn't score enough.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ADFIIJL K1 JAIL.D +14 414
#note Matthew mistracked, and had me at AAEENNO. F(u)JI is the only winning play, Quackle says JILT ties.
>Jackson_Smylie: AEEINNO 1H NIN.A +39 455
>Matthew_O'Connor: FI L8 FI. +20 434
#note Now I play Matthew for the win in the last round.
>Matthew_O'Connor:  (EEO) +6 440
