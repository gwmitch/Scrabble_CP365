#note Whew.  Glad to see I didn't miss a bingo on this turn.  I thought I had.

>Sean_Wrona: ?DENRTY C4 aR.YNTED +66 87
#note Since I didn't see TINDERY this is probably a bingo worth rejecting.  NERDY is probably correct even over any of the bingos, but that's hard to convince myself to do when the board is relatively closed and I'm far behind...

>Sean_Wrona: CEINQSU 4A QU.I +44 131
#note Saw QUINCES instantly when I saw the rack this time (I didn't during the game), but even after seeing the bingo, I missed the NIT-->UNIT hook.  Oh well.

>Sean_Wrona: CEGNOSU 5E GENUS +33 164
#note Really, really dumb.  I was debating between this and GENU and I don't know why I eventually chose this.  I think I did because I expected him to play in row 4 hooking the U after GENU and block my row 3 bingo line.  I way overthought this though.  That threat isn't worth playing the S for too few points when row 3 STILL might be one of his likeliest spots anyway (if he has a bingo...)

>Sean_Wrona: CDEFRST H7 ..FECT +13 208
#note Pretty bad miss here.  I'm guessing I just saw the DEFECTORS possibility here (as well as the opportunity to create many more bingo lines) and went wild when something like DEF C13 is infinitely less stupid.  This does not sim too badly though.

>Karl_Higby: ?AAIIOT 11H .IAO +12 239
#note He tried to put down some phony 5v8 on this turn.  I didn't write it down but I think it was OITITACA, and I think this was his rack.  I said hold before he hit his clock (whoops) and he changed his play to CIAO.
>Sean_Wrona: DENORRS H7 ......ORS +45 253
#note Knowing that he has the blank, I HAVE to block the DEFECTS line, and DEFECTORS is obvious in any case regardless.

>Sean_Wrona: ADENPRW 3D PRAWNED +72 325
#note I had never studied this set so I made an educated guess that PRAWNED was good.  Karl, who had studied this and thought PREDAWN was the only bingo (which I hadn't considered) ended up challenging.  Maybe I was right to leave row 3 open by playing GENUS instead of GENU.  Nah.  That play still stunk.

I misscored this as 68.

>Sean_Wrona: AEEHILU 14F HI.EE +18 343
#note Knowing he still had the blank I figured I needed to block as many lines as possible.  Even considering this, I have no idea why I chose this play over G13 HAE though...

>Sean_Wrona: AGMNOOT 10J AMONG +22 410
#note This was the first time I ever successfully iterated something in an endgame, going through every one of the remaining tiles in the pool to make sure I had two outplays no matter what I drew, and I did.  According to Quackle Championship Player, this was even the best one, and that kind of surprised me...  Maybe I do have a future in this, although iterating simple 3-letter outplays is nowhere near as cool as iterating bingos as experts do...
