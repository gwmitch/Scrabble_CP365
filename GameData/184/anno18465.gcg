>JD: DGLNPQW -GLPQW +0 0
#note JD: I was pretty sure that exchanging DN would win the sim, but keeping either GN or GLN bingos a bit more often even if I assume noah exchanges back.
>Noah_Walton: AEGIOOT H8 AGIO +10 10
#note Noah: Posting this game because although it was lopsided it had many interesting decisions. Here, I could also exchange or play GOO, tough call. None of the options are very appealing.
>JD: AADILNW 10F WA.L +15 15
#note JD: WAIL is a very defensive option, which I like here, but DAW at G11 pushes my bingo percentage from 25% to 42%, leaving a lane at the bottom that he is not so likely to block - well worth it.
>Noah_Walton: AEGNORT I2 NEGATOR +62 72
>JD: ADEFIIN H1 DIF +28 43
#note JD: I wanted to have the lane to the D as an option that could immediately get me back in the game
>Noah_Walton: CEHIOTW J3 TOWIE +30 102
>JD: AAEILNQ K3 AAL +29 72
#note JD: LEAN at K2 is the play because it creates a QI spot that is unlikely to get blocked. 
>Noah_Walton: ACEHIOS 11E COH. +28 130
#note Noah: Also considered CHIAO 11B, but this is much better defensively.
JD: my bad tiles will allow Noah to control the board for the next two turns. all he has to do to take full control is to block the SWAIL and AGIO lanes and then block the D, which he methodically proceeds to do.
>JD: BEINQRV -BQV +0 72
#note JD: LEAN would've led to a way better outcome. I probably should just play through with VIBE to set up my Q and hope I pick up decent letters along the way - keeping EINR won't really get me anywhere unless I immediately hit the D up top.
>Noah_Walton: AEIRSUV 2F VA.. +15 145
#note Noah: Considered SUAVER for more points and to block S hooks, but SUAVER allows for many openings, keeps a much worse leave than VAIN, and leaves the D, which is going to be hard to block without sacrificing most turns -- this turn I don't really have to sacrifice at all to block it.
JD: Noah succeeds in creating a completely closed board (kind of like in backgammon), which I will have to support many points to extricate myself from
>JD: EEINOPR E11 .OPE +8 80
#note JD: what to do? COPE gives back loads of points, but the only other real play I see is OE at G7, which he will just block, in which case I am really gambling on drawing an S or blank (less than 20% of the time). COPE would still allow me to bingo through the P, but there are 12 letters unseen that hook the back of COPE, so perhaps I should just play OE and pray for a good draw.
Noah: I dislike making such a huge opening as COPE here -- I will almost always take the spot and put Jesse further down. Ideally, a good play in this position gives me few opportunities to score well, scores okay itself, doesn't keep a horrible leave, doesn't make the board too hard to open later on, and goes more for the esses and blanks, which are really so important here. The last one is hard to achieve without exchanging, which doesn't seem good enough, and OPE turns over 3 as opposed to the two that most plays turn over, but gives back a lot of cheap points for me that also block the opening. I don't really like OE either because it scores nothing and, while the scoring options it gives back don't seem to bad, they are better than anything else available on this board. Playing at 12F scores a bit more and gives less for me to work with. I like PI because EENOR is workable, and has real chances at bingoing through the V (only 10% bingo chance per sim, but that's not so bad for this board), and for aforementioned reasons. OI keeps a bit nicer leave but it's not like it's doing much more on this board, and it scores 4 less while giving me back row 13 plays for scoring. It looks like a horrible play but then again this position is a pretty bad one.
>Noah_Walton: DEIRRSU 15E DURRIES +84 229
#note Noah: Considered 15C DURRIES, but I actually like this better due to the position -- it opens up a strong scoring spot and fewer bingo lanes. If Jesse takes the scoring spot I feel like I can block good openings it makes most of the time as well. I also wasn't 100% on COPER, but I'd take this even if I was.
>JD: EINNRTT 12A INTR.N +20 100
#note JD: seemed like I had to do something to restore this quadrant of the board.
>Noah_Walton: AACEMNO B10 CA.ON +26 255
#note Noah: Another turn where I'm not 100% on a word (MACON), but still prefer my play for positional reasons. It's just very hard to lose at this point, and CANON blocks the left side of the board, reducing his bingo potential next turn and severely reducing his avg. number of bingos long term, while allowing me to draw high scoring M plays on column A and row 14, plus not opening up that huge S spot MACON does. I am very happy with this choice for the most part, though I unfortunately didn't think of CANOE B10, which accomplishes the same thing while keeping a better leave.
>JD: EGQSTXY L1 XYST +62 162
>Noah_Walton: AEEEIMT 1J TA.EME +45 300
>JD: EGHLMQY A11 L.MEY +38 200
>Noah_Walton: EIIJNOT K11 JOIN. +24 324
#note Noah: JAWLINE is pretty sweet, though this is clearly better. JOINT(S) actually might be even better -- sligtly worse bingo lane and low C-V ratio in the pool.
>JD: EGHQSSZ 13J Z.GS +28 228
#note JD: ZIGS is kind of an auto-pilot move, maybe SIGH at 13J to set up the case S although it keeps QZ.
>Noah_Walton: ?EFIOTU M6 OUTFlIE. +65 389
>JD: EHIKPQS 8K KI.HE +39 267
#note JD: SHTIK for spread
>Noah_Walton: ?DEILNV O1 .nLIVEN.D +63 452
#note Noah: I may have played ENLIVEnED. I'm not really sure whether uNLEVIED/uNVEILED is better or not, and I was pretty tired at this point so just went for style points, meh.
>JD: DEPQRSU 14I PE. +25 292
#note JD: a point better to play the Q now, says quackle
>Noah_Walton: ABBERU N3 AB +10 462
#note Noah: With optimal play, it seems that this wins by 188, and MAE by 194. I don't think there is a better play than MAE.
>JD: DQRSU 5G DR...S +25 317
#note JD: I should just play the S in anticipation of being slow-played.
>Noah_Walton: BERU 4D RUBE +15 477
#note Noah: I was too focused on getting this game over with, and not enough on spread, and also missed DRAWLS and was thus taken aback by it. I should slowplay him here with HE, (R)UB, (O)R(E) to get 15 extra points. I am capable of finding sequences like this, and I had plenty of time to do so. It's really important to do this, as spread matters, and you're giving away free spread every time you misplay an endgame in a decided game.
