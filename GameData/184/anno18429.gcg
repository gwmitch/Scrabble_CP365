#note should maybe just exchange down to ES - dead even on a sim. my general philosophy here would say to exchange.

#note lientery would be better

#note I figured I would make the position more difficult to interpret, in case he forgot about DELUSION. Q seems to prefer the placement at 12A.

#note I can also play THINK and hold the D and J to score with next turn. not sure which is better.

#note huge miss, maybe time pressure? POOVE at B10 is vastly better. I was far too focused on putting the G at A8 to take advantage of my case N.

#note now down 41, I liked creating the S hook on row 15 for Mark to worry about and have to block, but I can also play DIODE this turn for a bunch of points to catch up more.

>JD: AEFGNSY 4B F.GEY +24 401
#note I was focused on trying to block his Z plays on row 4 while also drawing an out, and saw that FOGY would leave me with ANISE at row 15 or ANSAE on row 8 with the right draw. in contrast, FOGEY only seemed to win when I drew an A (ANSA) or the E (in which case he can't play ZEIN). but under time pressure I nonetheless played FOGEY. the endgames where I draw the Z are hard for him too. my analysis wasn't bad under time pressure, but in this case if I play FOGY I win. FAY also wins 3.5/8, winning if he doesn't have ZLOTE.

#note with FOGY would've drawn ANISE here for win
