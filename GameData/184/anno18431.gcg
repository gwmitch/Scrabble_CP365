#note tough call for me between fishing AE or A - it seemed like ADEERS hit enough to be worth it, but something I didn't consider is that I'm giving him free points by opening the triple lane on row 1, which makes KAE a better idea

#note I have now just blocked my spot for UNERASED, unfortunately. ADEERS is by no stretch of the imagination a premiere enough leave to not score more points on this fish, for instace by playing DUE/DINKY.

#note I think NIB is reasonable - my bingo percentage hits 64% and I have a shot at some 9s as well with a lucky draw.

>JD: ?CEINTX N1 .X +18 293
#note I just played the X off because it looked bad unless he made a major error, but I actually had a great chance here - I can draw for ATTACKING or ATTACHING by playing off EX (LEX) and drawing any of AG, AH, GH, A?, G? or H? - a 9/36 chance. I will still lose if he bingos, and he could block by playing down from M9 since the bag will be empty, but nonetheless a missed possibility to give myself a chance.
