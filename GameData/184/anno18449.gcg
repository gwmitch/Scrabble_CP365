#note We're playing this game outside. My only qualm with the setting was the ubiquity is wasps, hornets, and bees.

>Matthew_O'Connor: ELOW E3 LOWE +17 89
>Jackson_Smylie: AEEIOTT D8 .OATEE +16 81
#note ETIO(L)ATE. It's quite fitting that I miss a bingo in the final round of the tournament, it represents the mountains of bingoes I missed all tournament!
>Matthew_O'Connor: ANY C11 ANY +26 115
>Jackson_Smylie: BBFIIRT 6A FIBB.. +16 97
#note I set down B13 FIB because I don't know my threes. I gladly remembered fye* is invalid. BIB sims better, and it's a good idea to get some points now. IRT is nice with thte E and S open.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AELNRTU A6 .LAUNTER +86 201
>Jackson_Smylie: EIKORTW J4 WORK.ITE +69 166
#note phony. I should just play KOTOW or KOTOWER here. WORKSITE, if challenged off, really puts me in a bad position. I'd rather work my way back in than take a 50/50 shot.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AGHOY K11 HOAGY +34 235
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EGIRST 15D REGISTr. +86 252
#note perfect draw
>Matthew_O'Connor: NQTU 13I QU.NT +48 283
>Jackson_Smylie: CDIITUV 3C CU.TI +16 268
#note UV(E)ITIC is a great play, cleans up the rack. I was really starved for ideas on this turn, nothing looked good. CIVIL is a good option. I like UVEITIC since it draws more tiles hoping for an S or A. CULTI isn't very good, there are better options that score more.

>Matthew_O'Connor: ADEENO 4J .EANED +33 379
#note He dropped an O during his turn.
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEEIIO 3L AIDE +22 351
#note Not in a very good position here. I have to hope to draw a big J or Z play. AIDE sets up JEED, but that is likely not enough to win. DIE(D) is nice since it leaves AEIO, which gives me EPIZOA. Matthew is very likely to block that, though. I don't know what's right here. 
>Matthew_O'Connor: JLMNOOS 2M JO +36 415
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEGIOZ H7 G.D +5 356
#note playing EPIZOA now is a bit better. this blocks his outs and leaves me with ZOEA.
>Matthew_O'Connor: LMNOS 1N MO +19 434
>Jackson_Smylie: AEIOZ 1C E.IZOA +51 407
#note Congratulations to Matthew, winning the really strong field. This tournament has taught me that my short word knowledge is pretty good, but my bingo knowledge really needs work. Part of it is focus as well, had I thought about looking for bingoes with AEEIOTT this game, I surely would have found ETIOLATE. This was a really fun tournament to organize an play.
