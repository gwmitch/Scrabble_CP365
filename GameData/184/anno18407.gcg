#note I think ZAS is a bit more defensive and it seems worth it just barely. (-0.5)
>karris: OX 8N OX +32 75
#note Karris commented on the similarity of our plays, as I laughed nervously.
>cesar: ABBGSTU 9F BUG +13 71
#note i mean, this has to be the right play right? what does OX imply? is there anything else that makes sense? even if i want to be hyper aggressive, BABU keeps a worse leave and just gives up WAY too much.
>karris: AEINRST 10E RETSINA +76 151
#note this is the problem with playing a closed board!!!
>cesar: ABFIRST 11I FAB +31 102
#note i don't know if quackle is right about 5K FIB. i would play that against a weaker opponent, but it doesn't feel like it's doing anything to make the board more advantageous to me. the main problem is STAR >> STIR. (-7)
>karris: CEOTV 11B COVET +29 180
>cesar: IILNRST F5 LI. +7 109
#note i thought about NITROSIL* for too long and was strongly debating trying it. i didn't think i would get away with it. quackle likes 9L LIN, i don't like my chances after that. VIRL though is pretty cool. (-5)

>cesar: EEINOOR O1 OORI. +18 197
#note again i'm not sure if quackle is right. if i play 12K OORIE i am just opening up scoring spots. but one of the biggest problems is EEN vs EN. so, quackle is probably right. (-6)

#note i saw all the bingos here! (even sweetsop). i honestly didn't think i would win with bestower, thinking i'd need more luck. i did suspect that 36 points wasn't enough, though -- quackle suggests i should have just taken the points :/ (-8)
>karris: ?IJN N10 JI.Ns +54 359
#note sigh
>cesar: ?DHORST B2 HO.RD +50 302
#note i dont understand why quackle wants me to bingo with DROuTHS. thinking I'll get a huge Q play? (-0.5%)
