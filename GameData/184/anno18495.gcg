#note I've never seen this before in my life, hence the benefit of experience.  Challenging this basically gave him the game.

#note I hoped he wouldn't know this but if he has enough experience to know REWORDS he certainly has enough experience to know this...  I learned it pretty recently myself but almost any 20-year player would know this I guess...  I was hoping to get some kind of goody like the S or the X by playing long, but considering he had all that stuff, I really had no chance.  Perhaps I should have refrained from doing this because of the three unseen Us, all of which I drew.
