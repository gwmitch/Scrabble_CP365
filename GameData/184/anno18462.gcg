#note Shrug? Keping the H seemed like a good idea over keeping ILNR or something.

#note This only bingos like 30% next turn. But I don't really have much else I can do. I considered C5 QI which still maintains a decent bingo chance and sets up my H as a plan B. I dunno, I guess I was banking on SHODDIER too often, when  it gets blocked a lot of the time I draw it. Quackle likes C5 QI by a couple points. It's probably right.

#note Not much I can do if his rack is good. Just hoping I'll draw a 2J play if he gets his bingo. So I opted not to take the spot with TILLED. LITTLE is interesting because it keeps the D for a possible DJINN play. But after JO, I don't think LITTLE is worth it.

#note Killing a bingo line I maybe need to keep open. But most plays worth considering do that.
