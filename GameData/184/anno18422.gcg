#note I didn't see WOAD L3 and (B)IFID is horrible. The rest of the options ranged from "meh" to "horrible". This flew a few games ago, so let's try it again!
He held for over 5 minutes before challenging.

#note Generally you'd play (Z)EP and hold the I with the Q, but there's literally nowhere to play QI so I don't see why I would do that.

#note Not crazy about what these plays give back but I have to make one.

#note Dodged a bullet...
>Matt_Canik: AELNNQT F14 Q. +31 265

#note Gabe has about 2 minutes on his clock, and I have 270 instead of 265 after GOT. 

I just don't see fishing for a bingo working here. I decide to turn on the guns and try to outrun him. With BENDYS and the X out, if I get a little luck I can catch him. I think my odds of winning that way are way higher than my odds of drawing and playing a bingo.

#note With Gabe very low on time, maybe he botches this. 
>Goobriel_Goober-Shagoob: AOOPU E5 P.U +10 384
#note He said he almost did. I don't think I'd have won regardless though.
