>Tasha: AABEHUZ 4A HABU +30 185
#note I played HABU over ZEBU because I like AEZ better than AAH.  Sticking the H in the A column is better than sticking a Z.  I can also draw into HAZED or something next turn.

>Tasha: EELNORU O7 UNREE. +18 421
#note Before playing this I calculated ATOP at 20.  I win by four.  Normally I would block his outplay, but I was curious to see if he would challenge UNREEL as he was down to 4 seconds. 
>Marty_Gabriel: AOPT 11I ATOP +20 413
#note He doesn't hold and plays ATOP instantly, but afterwards he said he wasn't sure if UNREEL was good.  See, I had the right idea.
