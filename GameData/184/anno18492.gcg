#note FRY does provide a superior leave, but I'm quite surprised that wins since it doesn't seem like AEMNS would bingo all that much through the G, U, or N (at least enough to justify taking so many fewer points).  FEY and FAY I definitely understand though - I didn't know GUNNERY.

#note WAY too defensive too early, and DWELT is probably better defense anyway since she's probably better at finding 7s than 8s.  And I probably would have chosen DWELT myself had I looked there/thought of it.

#note Clearly the defensive considerations are not nearly enough to choose to do this rather than exchanging.  Probably because I was overrating what the defensive considerations actually were since I forgot about ABLED...

#note I remember being unable to decide between this and BECRIERS*, unsure whether either of them/neither of them/both of them were good.  I judged that this was more likely to be good and luckily was correct.  How did I actually remember BECRY* as a word?  It's not even in Collins...

#note I lucked out again, but WAY too dangerous.  And yeah, ATT seemed pretty obvious when I looked at it again.  I was too greedy here when I didn't need another bingo to win this.

#note Right, duh.  Brain fade there.  I wasn't blocking everything - only row 1 by doing this.  It makes total sense that OGIVE/VOGIE are much more certain wins by blocking H2 bingos as well.
