#note this is a very interesting situation and one of the few i believe that quackle is not suited for. suddenly, the board is super blocked up and i'm down by 50. something like 12D DEL seems immediately obvious, but all he has to do is block up the board after it or just take lots of points at 14F or something improbably like K5 VOX. one choice that i didn't think about was J4 ENJOY, but ultimately that probably gives back more than i'll get out of it. my reasoning for choosing my admittedly somewhat ridiculous play is that it provides a weak opening of the top left quadrant; if he takes a score down to the N at least the board will be open again. i thought it was hard to parallel with 8A and score enough except with like an H or a W. also, it gave me another shot at an O and some hopefully heavy consonant to score SOMETHING in column K. it's still tough and i don't know if it's right, but i liked it better than DEL. (-4)

#note the board is not as bad and 8A EH keeps it within 25, maybe we'll just have to start trading off plays.

#note trey next to us says something about how rob's epidermises are showing. this move was kind of garbage. i was worried about dumping the S with 3I HABUS and leaving him with possibly the case. 3A VAU though seems better than mine. I think i wanted to keep scoring, but VU must be terrible together. (-7.5) this is also bad because, really, why am i giving him an easy lane? sadly though, if you were to get me to pick between this, HABUS, and VAU, i would probably still pick this, mainly because VAU doesn't score that much and also opens a lane. HABUS i'm not totally going to shoot down. it does put me up by a lot, but if i don't draw the final S i know i'm going to be sweating for the rest of the game...

#note this looks so ugly. am i not supposed to play defense here (or try)? M9 ERUDITE, which is hilarious, sims best. K10 VIVE is what i really wanted to play, but call me paranoid for trying to protect my lead. yes, i'm aware bingos are not the only way he can catch me. (-8.5)

#note well L6 TOUR is one way to win. i don't know where my ugly looking play ranks here, but as far as i can tell, it wins with everything, right? i have outs in two for every letter except the L, and then i can still score, i think. so someone help me figure out how much equity to lose here. i'll say (-5) tentatively because of the L
