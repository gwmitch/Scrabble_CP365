>Liz: ABEFNTU 8G FUB +16 16
#note Liz was kind enough to supply her racks for this game.  FUB looks easily best here.
>Matt: ?AEEOPS J2 APOgEES +71 71
#note I should look harder and see that this fits at 9G for 5 more.  This ended up working out in my favor like I wouldn't believe though.
>Liz: ADELNTY 9G ANY +30 46
#note K8 YALD, using the FUBSY hook, is interesting.  This is fine.
>Matt: EEGNOTW 10D GOWN +22 93
#note This is OK, but I like WOG F9 for slightly better defense.  10I EWE, the sim winner by a hair, seems really silly to me, with all the R's unseen and keeping GNOT.
>Liz: DELOSTV H8 ..SOLVED +48 94
#note Pretty find, scored as 51.  She told me that she saw SOLVATED, but wasn't sure of it and figured I would insta-challenge if it were no good.  Leaving that A alone was just more of these cosmic forces at work...
>Matt: EEIMORT 13G O.ERTIME +80 173
#note And if she plays her bingo, I don't have a bingo in return.  Lucky me.
>Liz: AAOOTTU M9 AUTO.AT +10 104
#note Ugly rack.  AUTO parallel to OVERTIME seems fine; it ditches the U and the duplicates for 10 more points.
>Matt: ?ADINTX L4 oXIDANT +84 257
#note Well this is embarrassing for both of us.  I saw OXIDANT down column N first, then thought "I'll just play it on the other side for more points!"  I plop down the bingo for 84, and eventually draw 4 out of the bag, after which Liz says "Hold...challenge".  We call David over to clarify the rule; since I've already drawn tiles, the word stays.  I did record cume and the word before drawing, don't think I fast-bagged her.   I felt awful, but I've let phony 2's go myself; you've gotta always pay attention.
>Liz: CIINORS O9 INCISOR +94 198
#note She's not going away quietly.
>Matt: AACELRR E9 C.ALER +16 273
#note I have no idea why I settled on this; I thought I'd gum up rows 14 and 15, along with columns D and E with a 60 point lead.  This isn't an original choice but it does as well as the AR fishes, all behind CAGER.  
>Liz: ABEGILR L12 G.B +22 220
#note These two letters go on the other side of AUTOMAT for 25.  Dumping the E for 7 more points is probably worth it, with 5 still unseen.  Meanwhile I'm hoping she leaves that A up top alone because...
>Matt: ADIKNQR 2C QINDARK. +76 349
#note !!!! Unbelievable.  It scores 92 at 2F, but I really did not like leaving it one short oof the DWS; I might get hit with something like STONY for 76.  SLEAZO/SLEAZY would be a really awful worst case scenario as well (114/120 points!).  Maybe that's paranoid, but I felt I was ahead by enough that I could consider those 16 points as insurance.
>Liz: AEEHILR 3B HI +32 252
#note Tough choice.  3 hooks left for HI unseen, which means I probably have one of them.  However, I'm guaranteed to block if she plays the A as well.  I think she has to take the Q spot since I'm likely to take it next turn for big points myself.
>Matt: ADEIIPU A1 PIA +21 370
#note Yeah the leave is awful, but I figured she was setting herself up.  DUPE is 11 more points to keep AII instead of DEIU...with only one more I unseen, it might be OK to do that.
>Liz: AEEELRZ 1G ZA +50 302
#note Well, it sure looks like I'd have been better off playing QINDARKA at 2F.  C'est la vie.
>Matt: DEIJOUV 13B JIV. +28 398
#note Playing here and keeping the OD to play on Row 14 next turn. JIVER seemed to risky if she has the other O, or can bingo through the I.  I did keep an I on the NAOI insertion but didn't see that JUDO went there...I like that play better than the one I made.
>Liz: EEEHLNR 1D HE +20 322
#note Time for her to slow the game down and hope for a miracle.
>Matt: DEEGORU 14A GOD +31 429
#note So focused on my setup from before that I miss a better play; DOGE 3E for 33.  
>Liz: EEELNRW J10 WEE. +15 337
#note No S for NEWSREEL.  The duck likes ditching the W and L with WEDEL/N 15F, but it's looking bleak for her.
>Matt: EEFORTU M3 FEU +22 451
#note REFUTE M2 39 sims best, but she could have an outbingo to the G.  FEU does the job just fine without emptying the bag.  
>Liz: ELMNRST 11J .M +8 345
#note Ditching the M is right if she wants a last shot at a bingo, trying to draw into STERLING.  
>Matt: ELORTUY E1 ..TRY +16 467
#note I actually mistracked this game, so I had her sitting on EIINRST.  I think she has RESITINg, so I block the lane and try to obstruct the QIS hook.  HURTLE keeping OY for row 15 next turn sims best by far.  My endgames need work.  
>Liz: EILNRST 4B EST.IN +29 374
#note LIS 4A 28 followed by HINTER is the optimal endgame, but it only saves 1 point
>Matt: ELOU 15A OE +25 492
#note Take the points, she can't slow play as I have at least 2 outplays.
>Liz: LR B3 ..RL +9 383
#note Final score recorded as 492 - 390
>Liz:  (LU) +4 387
