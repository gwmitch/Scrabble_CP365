#note Quackle says I score 50 points on average after GECKO and only 30 points on average after this. Does it predict words to the G most of the time or what? I guess it's possible that GECKO is better, yeah.

#note I certainly considered DEBAG. CEQ and BCEEG both seemed kinda bad on this board, and I thought BCEEG might be workable sometimes, less than CEQ.

#note I thought of RUDDY a minute later, which might be better because it preserves the B for plays on row 1.

#note Looked for FE bingoes, but missed (FE)AtURING. Liked this more than GUAR because it preserved an EXILE hook. BUDDYING is also not bad.

#note I can't draw any bingoes to the FE, so fishing might just be hopeless. Quackle agrees, finding no winning play.
