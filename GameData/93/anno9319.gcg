#note Blah, shoulda seen HOWDAH 11D. Also FOH I13 scores a ton and sims well despite the four-consonant leave. This play isn't very good.

>Evans_Clinchy: EGINNST 6C TENSING +64 188
#note Saw STEINING#, wasn't nearly confident enough to play it.
>John_O'Laughlin: ELNRRUV D1 VELUR. +26 226
#note Lucky me -- my bingo blocked his NERVULAR#
>Evans_Clinchy: ACEINRS 2A CIN.REAS +74 262
#note Takes out one 3x3 line, replaces it with another that might possibly be better. Kinda silly. RIANCIES# is probably a better play here, but I missed it.

#note Didn't know VOTEEN#
>John_O'Laughlin: DIOOZ 12A ZOOID +53 315
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEEIJU 14B JEU +25 322
#note Gotta block the Z, obviously. AUE# 13A doesn't work -- he could still have ZANY. No AJEE, since that just offers easy overlaps like YO and KA. This seems like the best bet. Many-ply sim agrees.
>John_O'Laughlin: AIKRU 10B KAURI +30 345
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AAEIOY 12G A.IArY +34 356
#note Quackle's pre-endgame solver doesn't come up with this, but it skyrockets to the top of the sim table. Every single tile in the bag threatens an outplay, and 6/8 guarantee me multiple spots.
>John_O'Laughlin: IMMNORY 2K YOMIM +31 376
#note Best, but not quite enough.
