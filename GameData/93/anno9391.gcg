#note I thought she had VENOMOUS through a nonexistant N she'd play later.  She would, though, have A4 OU(T)MOVES 92.

>Heather_Steffy: EMNOORS D8 .ORMONES +78 159
>Ryan_Fischer: AABCFIP 15A FAB. +27 183
#note FAB up top scores more.  Makes sense to take out the S.  ABA(M)P of note.  BIFAC(E), too.
>Heather_Steffy: BETY A4 BE.TY +39 198
#note Bogus.  Well, BETTY# seems plausible to me.  Ugh.  (Whaddya know, it's CSW!)
>Ryan_Fischer: ACIIIJP 11C A.ICI +18 201
#note I couldn't stomach leaving CIII, playing JAPE right now.  So, I had to clean up with this.  Challenging BETTY is the top play, of course.  :P  Of note: PIA(N)IC.
>Heather_Steffy: AELQ M3 EQ.AL +30 228
>Ryan_Fischer: AACIJPR H1 JAP.R +42 243
#note Q likes keeping the R.  I like 3 points.  The sim eventually agrees, but also likes PRI(M)A.
>Heather_Steffy: KOW 13B WO.K +22 250
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDFINR 12G FARDIC +31 274
#note Maybe frustrated with the poor draw (well, not THAT poor), or that FRICANDO doesn't play, I decide, sure, why not play a phony 6 that doesn't really do anything for me.  Top Q static plays are R(E)IF and FAD(O).  I was also considering FR(A)NC which would've worked out a bit better (though she'd still bingo).  Of note: FRAC(T)I and F(E)D(O)R(A).

>Ryan_Fischer: ?ILN 15K fLIN. +5 365
#note 9J LInN(ET) 6 and out.  Challenge BETTY#, play FR(A)NC, maybe I pull it out. No fighting the bingo/bango here, though.
