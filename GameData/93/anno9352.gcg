#note I calculated a 1/3 chance he had none of AAAE. Since i didn't find any other plays that seemed to give me chances as good as that, I went with LAM. Of course, it takes FGS as well, but he often won't get that many points for those blocks, and i can try something else that's strong while gaining a few points on him with this play.
