#note OK, so there's only one bingo in the pool to worry about -- UNTWIST K3 (not that I was sure of this by any means, given my weak # knowledge, but it was my best guess and it ended up being right). I can block with ROJI# 5H, but if I do, he's got a 1.5/8 shot at outrunning me with the W hotspot. We tie if the last tile in the bag is the U (TOWN-HUE 4K-TAIS# B5), and he wins outright if it's the I (TOW-EH 11E-ASTUN). So simply taking out this spot with HOE is actually best. Again, not that I had this figured out over the board, but my gut said to leave the bingo open and block this spot.
