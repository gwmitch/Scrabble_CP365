#note I'd rather not start off fighting through three Ns.
>Martin_Weisskopf: EILV 9C VEIL +20 50
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIINOP 9H EPIGONI +69 69
#note "Nice drawing."  And the coffeehousing begins.  No, it's not "nice drawing" when I change three to a nice leave.  I was unaware of PEIGNOIR.  EPIGONI + R.  Noted.  I've never played it.  Maybe someday.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ORZ J6 ZOR. +33 83
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDETTT O7 TACT +31 100
#note O8 ACTED 43?  I guess the TT leave is okay for 12 more points.

#note 10E MM 28?  I think I like mine better.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ABDEORT M2 ABORT +48 197
#note He made a sound after he hit his clock like he made some big mistake.  Turns out he left ED, missed TABORED for 108.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIMNST K11 MIG +23 175
#note Wow, I had no idea how many points were just sitting there at 10F.  MITES, METIS, or MINES for 52!  Too fixated on the bingo there.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?DDEILU 13D DELUDIn. +62 259
>Ryan_Fischer: EINOOST G1 SNOOTIE. +60 235

#note 1D HIS(S)Y 45.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ADEELOR 1A ORDEAL. +27 353
#note He told me he wasn't sure of RELOANED.  WTF?  It's shit like this, Scrabble!
>Ryan_Fischer: CHINUXY 2G .IXY +22 294
#note C1 (D)UCHY 28, D8 (FE)CUND 24, H13 (D)UH 21.  Win pcts of 6%-4%  So yeah, I effed it up.  Just gotta figure out why I'm not seeing this stuff like MITES and ISOTONE.  I figure I gotta ditch the X and Y to give myself ANY chance of bingoing.
>Martin_Weisskopf: EINN 12C NINE +18 371
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCHNOU 11D HABU +36 330
#note Was about to play RAUNCH but HABU seemed like it'd slow things down, give me a teeny bit better shot at a bingo.
>Martin_Weisskopf: L 8N L. +4 375
#note ...
>Ryan_Fischer: AAACNOV 1I AA +16 346
#note Probably should've played FAVA, give me a chance at a high-scoring play in response to a bingo.  I was still deluding myself into thinking I had a shot at a bingo.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?EEENRT B1 .EpENTER +68 443
#note And here's where he shoved the blank slip in my face to make sure I knew it was a P (and not a C).  Sigh.  Sad thing is, even though he got both blanks, it was I who blew this game.  Totally.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACGKNOV 4A G.CK +26 372
#note A7 NOCK 38.  Words, they are falling outta my head.
