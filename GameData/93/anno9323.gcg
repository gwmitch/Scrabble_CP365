>Ryan_Fischer: EEIORTX --  -42 0
#note Q says OX.  This rack really bugs me.  It bingos through 4 good tiles, 3 I saw.  So I threw this down figuring maybe she'd leave it, and if not, maybe I bingo.
>Leesa_Berahovich: FHILT 8D FILTH +30 30
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIORTX F7 I.EX +27 27
#note Or (F)OXIER.  That might be a little better.
>Leesa_Berahovich: EJT 9C JET. +26 56
>Ryan_Fischer: EGMORTU 10B GOT +23 50
#note I don't know how I missed JORUM the first time yet got it on the way back.  No, I planned that.  Yeah, that's the ticket.  This is still second.
>Leesa_Berahovich: III -III +0 56
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIMRRU C9 ..RUM +28 78
#note Wow, wholly shit.  9H EREMURI 66 (plural of EREMURUS, some sort of perennial herb).  4v7, I shoulda seen that.  It's been way too long.  My current cardbox has no record of me seeing it, which means I saw it on my last format, a LONG time ago.  Also, R(H)EUMIER(!)
>Leesa_Berahovich: CINSZ 6B ZINCS +52 108
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIORRR -IRROE +0 78
#note Q suggests (FILTH)IER.  None of the other plays are very appealing.  Goin' fishin'.

>Leesa_Berahovich: ILRRUY 4H .URRILY +26 228
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AACDEI 6H .ADIAnCE +70 251
#note AC(A)DEmIA is super-volatile.  Pretty sure it crossed my mind, but didn't know if I wanted to risk it.  MAENADIC is next best.  Then ACETAMID, then mine.  So, nothing to be had on the TWS.  Also: CAMISADE and AECIDIAL.
>Leesa_Berahovich: AILOY 1A OIL.AY +36 264
#note Nice.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BEEIOV A12 .IVE +30 281
>Leesa_Berahovich: EEPP O5 P.EPE. +30 294
#note Oops, it's just WEEWEE.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BEHOOT 11K HOBO +36 317
#note The only thing I could get close to was THEORBOS.  BESOOTHE and BESMOOTH play.  This is better than the latter.
>Leesa_Berahovich: ANNO 9J ANON +22 316
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEENOT 2F ErODENT +68 385
#note 2D (A)NEcDOTE 71 is a smidge better.  Champ says mine fares a smidge better than ENDNOTE, presumably because of the vowel exposed at 1L.
>Leesa_Berahovich: MOW 1H MOW +44 360
>Ryan_Fischer: BDGLSU 14C SLUG +24 409
#note SLUB and SLUG both win 100%, but I shoulda been more careful.  UGL(Y) blocks her out of AKIN.  I briefly doubted SLUB, so didn't play it.
>Leesa_Berahovich: AIKN 1L AKIN +30 390
#note She wanted a recount, and whaddya know, we actually added right!  I didn't play this one too well.  EREMURI, the phony opener, letting PEEPEE* go.  Hate to say it, but she deserved that one.  Bittersweet.
