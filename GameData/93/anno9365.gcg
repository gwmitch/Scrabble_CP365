#note Well, he blocked TRESSIER for like 131.  N1 zESTIER is best.  I figured I leave that spot alone.  68-point plays through the A sim a little better 'cause they cover up the 2LS perpendicular to the 3WS.

#note It's like he knew.  But it's not like GLISSADE actually fit.  Ooh, 2L GA(T) 14 is cool.  Here I thought it would be a choice between DEA(F) and SEA(FLOOR) to open things up.  SEA(FLOOR), which Champ doesn't consider, sims 2nd, 18% to win.  GA(T) is 1st, 24%.  Not looking good.  I figured I'd need the S, which is why DEAF.

#note Of course.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AGILQS O1 QIS +46 391
#note Color me surprised to see the blank turn up.  Now SEAFLOOR is an option again, but I'm low on time.  Champ says this is right, with %13.89 win as opposed to 12.5% for just QI (which I would've played had I thought about it a second more -- which I didn't really have).  Oh well.  I really don't think there was much I coulda done about this one.
