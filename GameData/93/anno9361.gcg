#note of course, it never dawned on me at any point in time that bronzest is, in fact, a phony. nooo! I even thought of it when she put down ZEST first. In response, I decided that my next play would also be a self-annotation.

#note should probably try harder to block. KORAT jams up some more lanes.

#note I had some time so I looked and looked but without realizing that I had WRANG as a straightforward play the whole time. I didn't see GUARANA at all but it wins the same number of games, losing if I draw an N or the S. the wins are a little harder to see than after WRANG or WRUNG though.

#note TAU at A4 is better by a point. somehow this was the second time in a row I'd had this rack at the end of the game.
