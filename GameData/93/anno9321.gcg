#note And again I neglect to hold a bogus word a higher-rated player plays.  Ugh.  It's just a gushier grushie.  And it's just brushy.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGILORW B2 AIRGLOW +83 336
#note Thought admittedly this was part of why I let it go.  (Although at first I thought this played at J9 -- y'know, upside down and all.)

#note I wrote down AMEERATE on my scoresheet so I don't know why I didn't think EMEERATE, too!  Shame, missing a 5v8.  Barring that, I wanted to ensure that if he bingos I have a good chance of bingoing back (plus it obstructs the 2x2).  That's why I played here.  7E (P)EE 18 is a good play if not the bingo.

#note Pretty automatic play here.
>Eric_Tran: AV 2B .VA +6 289
#note Obvious yet quite clever Z setup.  He's still in it.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEEKRT 12H TREEl.KE +76 457
#note I doubted KEESTERS and everyone around was shaking their head when I said it after the game.  Minor validation, it being good.  I'd rather just take the one I'm sure about, though.  Also, STREEKER.  I could play KEETS to take away his Z threat, but that's not too bright.

>Ryan_Fischer: ACFIJPT 14J JAT. +27 484
#note Well well, in the pool we have at least ZEALS up top and AZALEAS down low.  AZALEAS hurts more, so my thought is just stop that one.  Champ says I should just play F(A), leaving one in the bag so even if he bingos out I get to go again.  Sounds good!  It took Champ like FIVE minutes to come up with that, though.

#note Oddly, I SO wanted to see him find ZANzA, but it wasn't meant to be.  :(
