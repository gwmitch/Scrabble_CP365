#note G3 MANTI(C) 32 -- "Having powers of prophecy."  Not that me having foreseen anything that would happen next would change anything... or something.  All these plays block all those lines; something I didn't want to do yet.

#note #%(*^Q#)@! blocked MANSARD!  John asked if this play was reflexive, or rather, reflective of my mood.  Noooo, not at all!  :]
>John_Luebkemann: EEIPQRU 11H REEQUIP +92 382
#note Overlooked PERIQUE.  Shifted two back, it scores 101.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADIINRS E11 I.AR +26 222
#note I had to ask Champ for some help here, because of how impossible the situation is.  It chooses 15K NADIR 29 with a .15% win pct.  Mine is 2nd with a .1% chance.  Isn't that precious?  :)
>John_Luebkemann: EH D14 EH +11 393
>Ryan_Fischer: DINOORS 9H SORDINO +72 294
#note Words just falling outta my head all over the place.  Here I am thinking INDOOR is an adjective that doesn't take an S.  -21, not that it matters.
>John_Luebkemann: EGHU 8L HUGE +50 443
#note Well, yeah, that's why suboptimal plays are suboptimal.  Yep.

#note Champ wants me to go ahead and surrender my S with 15G ALLS 17.  Oh well.  Mine's not so bright 'cause there are just too many Ls left and it's doubtful I'll even draw anything that fits there (though from where John was sitting, TROAK was a possibility).
>John_Luebkemann: AILTV C3 VITAL +24 511
>Ryan_Fischer: ALLLOST 4B T.LL +8 348
#note Whatev. :]  4B L(I)ST 8 sets up OLLA/ALIST to go out.  Nice, Champ.
