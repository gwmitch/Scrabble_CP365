#note Nice!
>Carl: AAANNOO J4 ANOA +11 215
#note Why does 12D ANOA sim best? It closes lanes when I need to open them. I'll never understand that duck. (-5?)
>Tony: HOY K4 HOY +32 294
#note Ok, maybe that's why, but still-- how am I going to come back if the board is closed?

#note Down to a 3% chance of winning at this point. My goal is to keep scoring and hope for a miracle. PINK C10 wins the sim, but it's close. (-1.5)

#note Drat, I was hoping he'd play something starting with C at H1. There was a decent chance of that.
