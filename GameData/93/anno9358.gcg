>Kenji: ACW 8G CAW +16 16
>Geoff: ABMRSTW H7 W.B +8 8
#note I didn't think of G8 CWM 14, which I might have chosen over this. Though the sim actually prefers WAB, on account of better defense.
>Kenji: III -III +0 16
>Geoff: AIMRSTU 6B ATRIUMS +72 80
#note Of the three 72-point ATRIUMS (ATRIUMSES?) available, this one finishes worst, by a point or two.
>Kenji: ?AEEISV 10D AdVISEE +79 95
>Geoff: CIOQRTU D8 QU.RTIC +56 136
#note I did consider passing up the 6 points for QUARTO and not hanging the S hook out. Sim says it's very close, less than a point in favor of QUARTIC.
>Kenji: DETUV 11J DUVET +21 116
>Geoff: HNOOPRY A4 HONOR +46 182
>Kenji: AAEILNZ 14D .ANALIZE +91 207
>Geoff: BDMNPTY M10 B.NDY +22 204
#note Ooh, B2 TYMPAN! Big miss there. (I did see BYNEMPT#, but of course that's no help here.) 
>Kenji: EX 5D EX +38 245
>Geoff: EKMOPRT H12 KE.P +45 249
#note Didn't know RECANALIZE, though it wouldn't have been correct here...
>Kenji: ENRSY O11 SYREN +46 291
>Geoff: EIMOORT L11 .OE +19 268
#note Okay, now RECANALIZE is best. That failing, not sure why I didn't just play off the two O's.
>Kenji: AGHST 15A GHAST +52 343
>Geoff: DIMNORT C3 MOR. +22 290
#note I need some help now...under 10% to win. 
>Kenji: ELP D2 LEP.. +26 369
>Geoff: DEIILNT 13A IND.TE +19 309
#note Let's desperately chase the blank. Not the worst idea in the world, but not much of anything looks promising.
>Kenji: EFIT 9H .EFIT +25 394
>Geoff: GIILOOU 8L IGLU +21 330
#note Trade? Play GUIRO for 7 fewer points? Not this, fair enough.
>Kenji: AEG 7L GAE +15 409
>Geoff: ?AFIOOO 2A FOA. +21 351
#note Oh god how could I miss LOOFAOIL j/k.
>Kenji: ADIJLNR B9 DJIN. +29 438
