>Rich_Baker: HIPZ 8F PHIZ +36 36
>JD: EEGIJNN F5 JEE.ING +21 21
#note just JEEZ saving GINN is the play, much more likely to bingo as a result.
>Rich_Baker: Q H7 Q. +11 47
>JD: ELNOOOO 9H NOO +28 49
#note NOLO actually sims better by virtue of not giving back the TWS. my score is going to be terrible next turn whether I keep EOO or ELOO anyway
>Rich_Baker: OW 10I OW +38 85
>JD: ELOOOTW G3 WOO +19 68
#note again, I overvalued keeping the second consonant, still doesn't make the leave much less mediocre. WOOL is the play

#note monitory would be a few more points, still a nice word

#note TAGAREEN# would've been preferable, still in it with a shout
>Rich_Baker: AEFHS A7 SHEAF +54 274
>JD: AEEIIMO H12 A.IO +18 228
#note all of a sudden, not looking so hot. I should take the points for AMIE at A1 to stay in striking distance and hope that my leave cleans itself up with the consonant-heavy bag.

#note I have a chance!! ...
>Rich_Baker: AKSV O8 KVAS +63 351
#note youch. the speed with which he played it made me think that he had to have at least another S, if not the blank already.
>JD: AAIIITX O1 TAXI +55 369
#note huge huge error, I must play IXIA. the pool is extremely strong, and rich is very likely to bingo on his next turn (at least 50%). Saving AII cripples my bingo potential, whereas AIT allows a lot of draws to hit. I was thinking about the importance of blocking column O, but he is so likely to hit a bingo that I probably must bingo out to win.
>Rich_Baker: ?AAENST 1E ANT.EArS +60 411
#note rich does a nice job of blocking a bunch of bingo lanes with his placement choice, cutting my bingo percentage to 13%. the question is, should he play TA/TEX instead? Quackle thinks he bingoes 95% of the time if he fishes, but I may be able to choose a placement that makes it tougher for his bingos to actually go down.
>JD: ACEIIRS D4 SC.RIAE +20 389
#note ARCS at C5 is 2 better (I need to block RUDD)
