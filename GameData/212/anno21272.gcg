#note WGPO Middleton Tourney, Round 7. Paranoid about (MIAOW)ING.

#note Jonathan gave me his racks...hopefully I can read them.
>Charles_Reinke: CDGLLMR -DGLLM +0 26
#note I didn't see 6F GR(AA)L or CR(AAL). Keeping the C for COX is nice even though it's unlikely to stay open.

#note Very glad I talked myself out of OV(E)RGAIN*. I could have found GRAVI(D) though.

>Charles_Reinke: CEIKNRT 12F TICK.ER +32 199
#note Didn't even think about the possibility (S)TICKLER until after I hit my clock. F3 C(OR)K seems to be clearly correct with the sweet EINRT leave.

#note 2G (TABOO)L(E)Y would have been cool.

>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEIILT O5 ELITE +35 326
#note Jonathan missed TIDELI(N)E here, but it actually sims worse than any play he could make on the O column. In the real world he was totally sunk no matter what he did.

#note Before DIVED came down, I noticed that LU(D)OS+ didn't quite fit at 13B. Then, post-DIVED, I missed that there was now an open D for me to play through.
