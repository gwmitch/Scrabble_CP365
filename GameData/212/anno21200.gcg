#note also ENGULPHS# which I had never seen before. I didn't find either of the 7s in this rack (LEUGHEN# and ENGULPH#).
>Monkey: ?EGINOR 1A rOGERIN. +80 128
#note she took her time with this play. ROGUEING is 2 more points.
>JD: CHNOTTV E5 CHO.T +20 106
#note Q recommends just taking the points for HOT.
>Monkey: EM F6 ME. +28 156
>JD: INOOSTV C1 .OV +14 120
#note she blocked OMOV which would've been nice. still, not a bad spot.
>Monkey: FW 2B W.F +33 189
>JD: INOSTTY G3 YO +20 140
#note I thought about blowing up the rack with YTOST# but surely that makes a comeback much tougher.
>Monkey: W 4F W.. +6 195
>JD: BINRSTT -BT +0 140
#note the pool is exceptionally vowel-heavy. her fishing indicates that she's extremely close to a bingo, but I'm down 55 so I kind of despise a play like BIST that gives up my good letters. Still, BIST at 10C may force her to bingo on the top-right of the board and open some nice lanes. I should've inferred that she had to have at least an S to be making a play like WON.
>Monkey: GINRSTU 10C RUSTING +71 266
>JD: DINORST I6 OD +15 155
#note saving the TRUSTING hook. fishing a single tile opens my bingo percentage from 50% to about 80%. Actually there are so many Is remaining that keeping ONRST sims better than INRST, which is unusual (part of it is that my play of OD gives back so many cheap scoring plays on column J).
>Monkey: AQT B8 QAT +25 291
>JD: IKNRSTT J10 STINK +33 188
>JD: IKNRSTT --  -33 155
#note pretty bad position, figured I would go for it, set up the case S and hope it was good to gain some extra points.
>Monkey: IILLOSY -IILLO +0 291
>JD: IKNRSTT C10 .INK +16 171
#note I liked what this did for the board although the leave is not great. Still many many vowels in the pool
>Monkey: BBDEI H10 .IBBED +42 333
>JD: AARRSTT 9I ART +8 179
#note guh I blocked my own TARTARES#. I am almost sure to lose, but if I draw the X, bingo and bingo again, it could be close...

>Monkey: ACEO 12A CA.OE +20 430
>JD: AEEIINP 2H .IE. +9 292
#note Q suggests that cecilia is more likely to bingo than I am, so just blow things up and play BEANIE or PAINED or something
>Monkey: AENRZ 13H .RAZEN +36 466
>JD: AEEINOP 14K AEON +23 315
#note she blocked oedipean. might as well fish for palinode and see if she blocks, although my best play is actually EPINAOI to guarantee the out-in-two
>Monkey: ADLLLRS O8 .LLA +4 470
#note LAZAR is best.

#note first loss!
