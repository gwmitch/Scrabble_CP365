#note WGPO Middleton Tourney, Round 8.

>Charles_Reinke: DEGGNNN M8 NEG +19 143
#note I was not really excited about Jeff making a huge play involving QUA(I), so I blocked. K3 N(A)GGED/G(A)NGED score one fewer while keeping a much better leave.
>Jeff_Clark: AA 12F AA. +14 119
>Charles_Reinke: DGNNOPU 13D DUNG +25 168
#note Pretty close with PUNG in the same spot.
>Jeff_Clark: ?ABEIOT D6 OBTAInE. +72 191
>Charles_Reinke: EHNOPRT 8A PHO. +27 195
#note 5K HON seems to be the right play. I loved that this play allowed me to keep ENRT so I didn't really consider much else.
>Jeff_Clark: ?DEEMRX A8 .REMiXED +107 298
#note Scored as 117? I should have realized that didn't make sense. The bingo at 6A is pretty cool if you can find it.
>Charles_Reinke: CELNORT 8K CO.TE +24 219
#note This doesn't show up in Quackle's choices and sims very poorly. NO(N)CE would be a lot better. I think opening up an E has some merit.
>Jeff_Clark: IKV 6F KIV. +21 319
>Charles_Reinke: ADLNRRT 9C D.RN +12 231
#note ALRT has good synergy with the open E. J10 (QI)NDAR was tempting but that would be just throwing away spread.
>Jeff_Clark: AERW 5I .AWER +36 355
>Charles_Reinke: AELMORT 2N MO +20 251
#note I hold the last A for (A)MIS. Jeff will have to dump a tile at O1 if he has one that goes there.
>Jeff_Clark: J O1 J.. +30 385
#note Too bad he had that one.
>Charles_Reinke: ADEFLRT O7 D.FLATER +63 314
#note Playing this over R(E)FLATED seems pretty obvious.
