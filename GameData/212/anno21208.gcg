#note Can't believe this actually sims well.  Thought this was a panic play.  Didn't know PIONIC, thought about PIANIC and AVIONIC but wasn't sure either was good.  So I nailed the top play I was confident in.  (minor pat on back).  Still, PIONIC is a big miss.

#note A few equity points behind URIC/VOGUER/PI.  I'm sorry, where's the bingo lane I'm supposed to stick that sweet leave?  Jason's not opening ANYTHING next turn.  I'll take pURIFIES.

#note PAGED/GAPED are about the same.  DIA(LOGIC) is cute though.
>Jason: ADES 15F SADE +20 274
>John: AADEEIZ B10 ZA +35 285
#note Simming on Many, it seems that ZEE B10 is tops at 58% win.  With 3 As in the bag???  Weird.  DIA(LOGIC) is 57%, then ZED B10, DI(C)E(R) 11I and ZA.

#note DICER and DIALOGIC smack me again.  DIES isn't so bad though.

#note Really?  I draw VC *and* Jason pulls ahead?  Horrible sequence of events.  I didn't see any winning plays so I kind of ended up playing whatever.  EVENT gets me to within 3.
