>Charles_Reinke: ?AEEUWY H7 YEW +18 18
#note WGPO Middleton Tourney, Round 16.
>Jeff_Clark: EGOR I6 GORE +21 21
>Charles_Reinke: ?AAEGUU -AAGUU +0 18
#note Lots of exchanges are close. I don't think I would ever play G9 EAU. I like bingoing too much.
>Jeff_Clark: EX J9 EX +31 52
>Charles_Reinke: ?ABEEIZ G9 AE +11 29
#note Just dropping the A for AWEE is better. If Jeff has anything good that goes at F10 he will play it because there is nothing else to play. I will get BIZE there if he doesn't block, however.
>Jeff_Clark: ACILOST 8D COAT..S +25 77
#note Jeff mentioned he had the orphan STOICAL here.
>Charles_Reinke: ?ABEIVZ F10 BIZE +31 60
#note Didn't want to deal with the closed board after 10D BIZ(E). This sims way worse though. If I assume Jeff has kept an S after his last play (which I was 50/50 on) this play gets a lot worse.
>Jeff_Clark: ACLSY 14B CLAYS +42 119
>Charles_Reinke: ?ADELNV 12D LA.ED +34 94
#note Saw VALANCED, wasn't sure. Saw ENCLAVED, wasn't sure. Missed ENSLAVED. That's three screwups in one turn. Four if you think AD(Z) is better than LA(Z)ED.
>Jeff_Clark: DEF 11C DEF. +28 147
>Charles_Reinke: ?AEEHNV H12 .EVA +24 118
>Jeff_Clark: EOV 10B VOE +20 167
>Charles_Reinke: ?BEFHNS -BHF +0 118
#note If I make a one- or two-tile fish here, Jeff will clam up and never open the board again. Exchanging three is not too obvious and I will usually have the E or A in DEVA to play through.
>Jeff_Clark: AGNOU J2 GUANO +17 184

>Jeff_Clark: IPQU 3I Q.IPU +52 236

>Jeff_Clark: BEINORT O8 BORNITE. +83 319
>Charles_Reinke: JMNTTTU E4 JUNT. +24 304
#note Only one E left and no good lanes. So I basically play the rest of the game like nobody will ever bingo again.
>Jeff_Clark: AORT F3 ROTA +21 340
>Charles_Reinke: AEHMTTU 14J HA.T +32 336
#note Leaves (HANT)L(E) as a possibility.
>Jeff_Clark: ILRSW N3 SWIRL +27 367
>Charles_Reinke: AEHMOTU 4C MO.. +26 362
#note Knowing (A)SWIRL would have been helpful for the rest of the game. I'm probably toast here if Jeff has the blank.
>Jeff_Clark: DFIKNOR L3 .INK +20 387
>Charles_Reinke: ?AEHITU C2 HU.Id +18 380
#note This will always win by one point. If Jeff blocks 11J TA(P)E with 12J FO(L)D, I will just go out with 15C ATE.
