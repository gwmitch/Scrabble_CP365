>Jonathan_Lindh: IKLNRST 8G KILT +16 16
#note Only game of night because i felt GASSED! 14th best play! 8H SLINK sims best but I wanted to keep S. It worked out. Best 16 point play is #3 8G LINK.
>Carl_Voss: DNOSU K4 NODUS +21 21
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?JNNRST H7 J.NN +11 27
#note Best play!
>Carl_Voss: FGLU 4H FLU.G +26 47
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?APRRST 11B PRATeRS +78 105
#note Best play! RAPTORS, PRATERS, PARROTS, and new word PARTERS all play at B11.
>Carl_Voss: CGLN D9 CL.NG +16 63
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEOPRU 10F PO.E +23 128
#note 4th best play! But H1 POUF which I saw but chickened out on for some reason is the best. I told you I was gassed. But my play does shut down a hot spot.
>Carl_Voss: COR H1 COR. +27 90
>Jonathan_Lindh: AABEIRU B10 U.BEAR +24 152
#note 2nd best play! C10 ARIA has a .9 point higher equity than my play. I spent a on of time here. I still think my play is better.
>Carl_Voss: ADW 15A D.AW +36 126
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEIILM A8 AIM +19 171
#note 6th best play! 3B MEALIER is best. I only saw MAILER in same spot. However, I set Carl up.
>Carl_Voss: DEEENTT B2 DETENTE +72 198
#note Can I play MEALIER again?

>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ABEEIL 6D BELAdIE. +76 247
#note 3rd best play! And the most stylish! However 1H CELIBATE for 92 points and 1H CITEABLE for 86 points are much better. How did I not see these? 15A DRAWABLE keeping the blank for 42 points is 4th best and an intriguing move. 13D GIVEABLE rounds out the bingos and the worthwhile plays.
>Carl_Voss: OVX C1 VOX +47 245
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADMSTUY A1 MUD +33 280
#note Best play! I would have thought there was something better than this, but surprisingly no. Keeps Y for DEXY and E5 plays.
>Carl_Voss: AHI 7D AHI +17 262
>Jonathan_Lindh: AORSTTY 5D AY +33 313
#note 4th best play! However I missed 1H CRYOSTAT and 13D GYROSTAT for bingos. CRYOSTAT I think I knew too. Should have looked for bingos instead of just autoplaying. I think CRYOSTAT would have been challenged.
>Carl_Voss: AHIIIOR C13 RI. +16 278
>Jonathan_Lindh: OORSTTW 2G W.RT +9 322
#note 12D NOWT is best for 19. I only saw J10 STROW for 27 points, but passed on it because there is an S out with a Q and a Z. QIS and STROWS is a strong possibility. My play doesn't sim near the top but I am okay with it because it blocks bingos lanes and clears up my rack.
>Carl_Voss: AEHIIIO -AEHI +0 278
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIOOSTY J10 SOOTY +27 349
#note 7th best play! For some reason I didn't see J10 SOOEY in the same spot. However, I think the E in the spot is risky because of something like ZEINS or VEINS.
>Carl_Voss: AEGINZ 1J AGNIZE +53 331
#note Nice play by Carl! I didn't consider this possibility. Actually I wasn't tracking period, only keeping track of power tiles.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEFIIS K11 FIE +26 375
#note My play doesn't sim because my Quackle is stuck in TWL06, but I'm pretty sure this is the best play in TWL15.
>Carl_Voss: AEHOOQV 2N AH +37 368
#note I maybe should have done N1 ZEE to block this but I don't track during club games. It worked out in the end.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEISV 3E EVE. +14 389
#note 5th best play! Along with VIER and VEER in same spot. However, my endgame is is clearly better. My endgame gets 30 points in total while Quackle's gets 22 points in total with 13I STEEVE. VIER, VEER, and EVER also block the 13 point DEXIE and force him to play off his 2 Os for less. I think I beat Quackle on this one and figured out the optimal endgame.
>Carl_Voss: EIOOQ 9D .OO +9 377
#note 2nd best play! E11 TOO for 10 points and one extra point.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IS 3M IS +16 405
#note Best play! 4 or 5 best plays in the whole game, and an optimal endgame. All top ten plays except for KILT and WORT, and KILT had a lot of merits which could have put it in the top ten while WORT had great defense. This is ideally the way I should be playing. Except for the missed bingo!
