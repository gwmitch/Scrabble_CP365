#note It took me a few minutes to figure this endgame out.  Before playing this, I made sure to verify the scores with Scott.  I saw his best play was QIN for 28, but I'll still eke out the win.  I tracked him correctly, but mistakenly only added the C when doing my calculations.  
>Scott_Garner: CINQS 12H QIN +28 401
#note If he were playing Adam Logan, QIN wouldn't be the right play.  But Scott isn't playing Adam; he's playing ME and he knows full well I haven't started studying Collins yet.  QIN is correct if you know your opponent won't know THE PLAY.  He still took a bit to play this because ZOEAL makes it look like I know what I'm doing.
>Tasha: ATU A13 TAU +15 397
#note Fortunately for me knowing QUAT# wasn't necessary.  TAU is the only other winning play.  
>Tasha:  (CS) +8 405
#note Final scores recorded as 405 to 402.
