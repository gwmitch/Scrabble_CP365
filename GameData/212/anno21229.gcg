>Matt_Canik: EMNOOPY 8D MOONY +26 26
#note Generally I'm not one to pass points for defense, but after Kevin's small exchange, I think it's right to play MOONY because it makes it harder for 7s to go down. EPONYM is a word I didn't know, this sits about 3 points back.
>Kevin_Leeds: AQT 7C QAT +28 28
>Matt_Canik: EEEEEJP 9C EPEE +19 45
#note Far more defensive than EPEE 9E, and sims about 3 points *above* despite scoring three points fewer.
>Kevin_Leeds: ??AERRT H1 ERRAnTl. +80 108
#note But yeah defense won't stop him from doing that

#note Having just botched a game again Robin, tilt-matt decides to try an intentional phoney. Kevin has a remarkable record at the challenge computer against me, I don't know why I keep trying

#note Oh god I missed GENOMICS and chickened out on ANOMIC

>Matt_Canik: ADDLSTU 12A DUD. +11 185
#note I really want to make sure that the 12F spot stays available. After this play, Kevin can't block that spot without either bingoing or scoring like 8.

#note BATHE and GANEF were the two main things I deliberated between. I also briefly thought about B(A)TH, but think after TOY kevin is pretty likely to have an S. I ultimately chose this because FGN meshes way better with the six(!!!) unseen Is. 
>Kevin_Leeds: AIIPRST 15B PARITI.S +61 329
>Matt_Canik: DFGIINO 3G F.IG +22 305
#note Really just didn't know how to approach this turn. I see UUVVWW unseen and Kevin has a random rack. If he draws into a bunch of that, I think it's actually pretty likely I can eke this one out. But with two Rs unseen also, I think it's way better for me to make a play that knocks out VR(O)UW. 

I can approach this from a completely different angle and try to bingo instead - it'll be really tough for Kevin to address TOYO. Or I can fish the O and try for D(E)FINING with an N draw. Man, I don't know. Scrabble is hard.

#note Kevin spends about 7 minutes here because he's afraid I will bingo
