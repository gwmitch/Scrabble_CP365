#note Would never have considered RYU+ at L7 although it moves the UY and keeps the good stuff.  Saw SULT(R)Y but for whatever reason decided to cash all my vowels and hope for the best.

#note P(O)M 6K is tops.  Such a nice setup.  Might tip Lloyd to what I have, but a nice play.

>John: ?DIMNST 15C SeDIM.NT +60 277
#note MISTENDS beats TUMIDNESS/TIMIDNESS just barely.  Saw MINDSETS right after I played.  Regardless, I have my lead now...I just have to hold it.

#note I bet ORACY+ is pretty good here, a word I saw and discounted for leave reasons.  Bah.  EERY/AERY at I10 are solid options.

#note Liked this as it gave me the PAIR and IRATE options.  Q likes PAIR first.  With that rack I suppose the best counter play is to just move the J rather than block VOICE...  It turns out that if Lloyd blocks my out with GIFT, I lose by 4.  Thankfully, he didn't see IRATE and was focused on the J.
