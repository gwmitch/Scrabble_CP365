#note i'm too much of a sucker for points; 4D AUK might be a little better. Also I know he's gotta have another S after PISSY so I should be trying for better leaves so I can bingo back, right? -0.5
>karris: AU 4D AU. +22 90
>cesar: EIIQTUU C9 QI +44 132
#note in this case I think QI is ok, 44 points is a lot. quackle likes 10H ETUI slightly more.
>karris: ?AABDES J5 ABAShED +76 166
#note should i have tried blocking? I was pretty sure the bingo would come down

#note i'm not sure how i justified blowing this much equity. Basically, I thought it was extremely important to get the blank, plus the X is going to score a lot next turn. but AXE K4 bingos nearly 50% next turn and scores 42!! am I just completely off? -8

#note again, i have no idea what to do. every instinct told me to play 14F BRIN, but it doesn't seem right. if he bingoes through the O i'm dead. I didn't see E3 NUMB, which i really like now (but 13G NUB/BUN do the same thing almost). VERB was just me being frustrated. so NUMB over BRIN?  -12.5, deservedly
