>Sam_: ADEIORT -O +0 0
#note Sims best by far. Phil said he would exchange IO when I asked him.
>Ed_Stewart: AEJP 8G JAPE +26 26
#note I was zoning out when I looked back at the board...JAPE was on the board and Ed was drawing tiles. Weird experience, never happened to me before. I'd tend to think JAPE 8E is better given my play. 
>Sam_: ADEIRTV K5 TARDIVE +109 109
>Ed_Stewart: EHL J6 HE.L +32 58
>Sam_: ABIIRSU 9H BI..AR +19 128
#note BILIAR*. Didn't see the superior options: JABIRU G8, URBIA I2 (didn't know it), URBIAS L1 and URBIA L1 (ditto). JABIRU is easily best, annoyed I didn't find that.
>Ed_Stewart: GIV L4 VIG +23 81
>Sam_: FIINSUY 10D UNIFY +21 149
#note Wasn't sure of BILIARY--UNIFY N5 is better.
>Ed_Stewart: MUY 11B YUM +12 93
#note He wasn't sure of it either, I guess.
>Sam_: ADIORSZ 8M AZO +38 187
#note Laid down ADZ before picking it up for this.
>Ed_Stewart: ?EILPTT 12C sPITTLE +83 176
>Sam_: ADEINRS 13I RANDIES +71 258
#note Good thing I switched my previous play, otherwise I would have had an unplayable ERASION.
>Ed_Stewart: EGOO B7 GOOE. +11 187
>Sam_: ALLNNNS A6 NAN +18 276
#note Looking back, I think it's worth it to play the S for 5 extra points with NANS. Any disagreers*?
>Ed_Stewart: BO O13 .OB +15 202
>Sam_: ILLNSSX N10 NIX.S +32 308
#note Two plays sim better: NILLS C3 and SAX J12. I think SAX looks strongest.
>Ed_Stewart: AQT C6 QAT +21 223
>Sam_: DEELLSU 6C .UELL +16 324
>Ed_Stewart: EHO 14J HOE +32 255
>Sam_: ?DEKMST 15K MED +17 341
#note KiSMET 15H, which I should have seen, is probably equal with MED. 
>Ed_Stewart: CCFORRS 11I FO. +12 267

>Ed_Stewart: OW F12 .OW +14 281
>Sam_: ?CCEGIT 15D GEsTIC +36 405
>Ed_Stewart: ADEORST H1 ADORES +39 320
#note DEAR 5E and TRADES H1 are best.
>Sam_: ACINRRW E4 CR.W +18 423
#note Dunno why, but I felt like he wouldn't know or see TUMPS D9, which led me to play this over NAW G1. Maybe because he challenged JEUX against Phil in August's Philly tourney. In any case, AIRCREW, which I didn't know, is best.
