#note AARRGHH (Phil had this on his rack during Philly, played AARGH instead cuz he didn't know it haha, not sure if it played tho, but anyway...) I missed KEBOB! 10F

>Sam_: ABEEIQS J6 QIS +42 88
#note I spent some time tussling over the leaves of QUAI 12B 26 and QIS J6 42, but I overlooked one of QUAI's important aspects: it blocks underlaps on row 11. In addition, it can set up my B for new row 11 plays forming OBI. QUAI gets the nod by about 4 points.

#note Holy shit. Even considered trying LEVATED* 12H , but figured that wouldn't fly. Never even spotted the E at 13C for ELEVATED 13C. How pathetic is that.

>Sam_: ?AEELMT --  -76 153
#note Got very confused here, thinking MALLEATE* was the correct spelling instead of MALEATE, or that MALEATE was an adjective, or something. MALEATEs and TAMEAbLE 13G are the playable bingos.

#note Glad to see there wasn't a bingo here, since I looked for a while.

>Sam_: ??AEIOT M3 AmOsITE +76 255
#note Insta-challenged...and as we got up, he said, "wait, the first blank is an N, right?" To be fair, my writing on the slip did look like it could be an N. Matt let Joe rescind the challenge, which I was perfectly fine with. But to be honest, I was a little insulted; did he really think that I would play ANOSITE?

#note Sims best, but I sort of like the idea of VIGS J10 in hindsight, shutting off the board completely. Thoughts?

#note I was so focused on blocking that I didn't even spot GRASP O4! The points have to be better here.
