>Alyssa: CLNOW 8D CLOWN +26 26
>Evans: IIIJOPT 7F JO +25 25
#note Unbelievably enough, Quackle approves. I considered OPTIC (or TOPIC) just to free up one of the I's, but JO scored too much to pass up. I guess this leave isn't that terrible -- I can always play TIPI next turn, right?
>Alyssa: DRTU 6G TURD +15 41
>Evans: IIILNPT D8 .LIPT +18 43
#note INCIPIT is best by a mile. The word looks familiar-ish. Sigh.
>Alyssa: OPRSY K3 PROSY +26 67
#note She mentioned that she thought about playing elsewhere to take out the double-double lane.
>Evans: AGIINRT 11D .IRATING +94 137
#note ...good thought.
>Alyssa: ADEGLNR 9F GNARLED +82 149
>Evans: ?EEIRUU -EIUU +0 137
#note As I see it, there are three candidates -- PIU, exchange keeping ER?, and exchange keeping EIR?. I couldn't bring myself to make a 10-point play keeping such a vowel-heavy leave, especially when the pool itself is still quite vowel-heavy. Even if there's a blank in that leave, it looks wrong. Quackle says it's a close call but pegs me with a one-point error. Agree to disagree...

>Evans: ?AEFGIS B7 GAS.FIEd +72 263
>Alyssa: ?AEIMST A3 MISrATE +88 294
#note There is actually one play that slots the M third for the DLS to score 92 -- SEMIMAT! Never heard of it. Turns out it has two anagrams -- MISMATE TAMMIES.
>Evans: EEMOTUU 3A .UM +14 277
#note This play is awful! Why don't I just play MEOU in the same spot to dump vowels? Eww. (Also of note: Alyssa asked me to repeat what my blank was. I was tempted to lie and say S so that I'd have MOUE for 37 in that bottom-left corner. Just kidding.)
>Alyssa: DEHO A12 HOED +48 342
#note Wow. I really wish that blank had been an S.
>Evans: EEEKOTU 4C UKE +18 295
#note Yikes... I didn't even think of the U hook on MUM. MUMU/UKE is a nice play; TUTEE H11 is decent too. My play is 4-5 points back.
>Alyssa: AEINNRT 2C ENTRAIN +64 406
#note I mean, she'd have bingoed anyway. Oh well.
>Evans: EEEOSTZ N6 ZE. +32 327
#note This is the proper spread play, which technically could matter in this tournament -- firsts for game 5 are determined based on spread in games 1-4. But surprisingly, K11 GEEZ wins somewhere between 3 and 4 percent of the time -- it keeps bingo lanes open and leaves EOST. I'm down 97 though! It doesn't seem reasonable.
>Alyssa: HNO 1H HON +35 441
#note I guess I can win with an immediate bingo followed by a Q play up there. She blocks the spot and scores 35. Good game.
>Evans: AEEOQST 12K OE +7 334
#note This turn was a giant pain in the ass, because I had to plan ahead to avoid Q-sticking. My play seems pretty good, because it threatens QAT/QATS and the like. Quackle values LENO J9 at 35.6 (!!!) points though. I am baffled.
>Alyssa: EILOUVV 13L LEV +14 455
>Evans: ADEQST 14I QATS +18 352
#note WHAT? Did I just miss LEVA/QATS for 76 freaking points? Did this honestly just happen? I think I just shut my brain off when I realized I couldn't win. This is awful.
>Alyssa: IOUV G11 .VO +7 462
#note AVO G2 scores three extra points.
>Evans: DE 3G DE +16 368
>Evans:  (IU) +4 372
#note Total EP lost: only 24! Oh, wait... the endgame. That's another hundred. I suck.
