>Sam_: ADEILSW F6 WA. +14 131
#note Missing SIDEWALK G1. I tend to think common words like that are the hardest to find. WIDE N1 and AW E8 look like better options among the non-bingos. i
>Steve_Oliger: AMY 9F YAM +30 168
>Sam_: DEEEILS 10G EEL +15 146
#note Missing DIESELED D1 or D8, which I probably would have challenged if played on me. KAE G8 looks better, as DEEILS is very strong.
>Steve_Oliger: CEHNR D8 .RENCH +24 192
>Sam_: DEIISUV M9 UVEID +23 169
>Sam_: DEIISUV --  -23 146
#note This play was cocky, stupid, arrogant, and impatient. VIE 10B, IVIED K9, RIVE 8L, and VIDE N1 are all good options. This decreases my win% by about 11-12%
>Steve_Oliger: AEGILOU M8 EULOGIA +73 265
>Sam_: DEIISUV 15K VISED +39 185
#note Best in equity, but not win%--that's IVIED 10A, which smartly plays open. Could have avoided this snafu by not phonying.
>Steve_Oliger: BM 14L B.M +26 291
>Sam_: AIINRUU -IUU +0 185
#note Longer exchanges take preference due to both blanks stil remaining in the bag. Don't I look at my tracking??? Ex. IINUU and Ex. AIRUU look best after a shortish sim.
>Steve_Oliger: GINT 13C T.ING +22 313
>Sam_: ABINRTZ N1 ZIT +27 212
#note Missing the star play, E4 BRAZA! Ugh. RAZING 12H is second-best in equity, and BIZE 10A is second best in win%, but BRAZA was obviously key.
>Steve_Oliger: EL 1L LE. +13 326
>Sam_: AABINRR E4 BRA +15 227
#note Sim likes ARRIBA E1, which I didn't know (in English, anyway) or BARING 12H...but where do I bingo after BARING? If Steve shuts down the O column following BARING, I'm screwed. That's why I liked BRA--though ARRIBA is vastly better.
>Steve_Oliger: AEHIOPU O3 UH +13 339
>Sam_: AINPPRR 8L ..PP +24 251
#note He held this one. Sim prefers PINA D1, which looks good--I need to further open.
>Steve_Oliger: OX N10 OX +24 363
>Sam_: AINRRSU 4C UR. +10 261
#note I like this, but for some reason Quackle prefers RUG 12K. I need to draw the blank for any hope here, so I don't want to close the board with RUG, but open it with URB.
>Steve_Oliger: EIQT C3 Q.ITE +30 393
>Sam_: AINRSSY H13 SYN +28 289
#note Sim likes SAGY 12K, which is good for scoring but doesn't leave many bingo opportunities. SAY H13 is the same idea as my play, but better.
>Steve_Oliger: DEOOW 15C WOODE. +11 404
>Sam_: ?AACIRS B5 SARCInA +68 357
#note Sims horribly for some reason, but I suspect Quackle's totally misplaying this in the sim. The only other bingo is ARnICAS B6, which sims even worse. SARCInA wins .09%, ARnICAS .09% and ACT 6A 20.93% according to Quackle, which is obviously untrue given a human opponent. He held this.
