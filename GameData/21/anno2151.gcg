>Jason: EILNOPT 8D POTLINE +74 74
#note I liked that this didn't give up vowels, but after I hit my clock, I noticed the double-double potential. Championship Player prefers TOPLINE instead, and I agree. Went too fast.
>Jeff_Clark: IPSZ K5 ZIPS +40 40
#note ...and deservedly whacked.
>Jason: DDIKLNW 6J W.NK +19 93
#note In hindsight, W(I)LD is probably best.
>Jeff_Clark: JOY 7C JOY +30 70
#note Originally counted as 29, fixed in the recount.
>Jason: DDEILNR F8 .RINDLED +64 157
#note Good thing I kept DDIL instead of DIKN, eh? :) Wasn't sure, but Jeff didn't even hold. It's good. DIELDRIN also plays, but I didn't know that.
>Jeff_Clark: ABRU L2 URBA. +25 95
>Jason: CGINSTV -CV +0 157
#note Should've done V(E)G, V(I)G, or V(U)G/G(U)V instead.
>Jeff_Clark: ?AFIIMR 13B FAMI.IaR +78 173
#note Nice find. The obscure FIMbRIA/R(URBAN) is 95. I knew neither.
>Jason: GHINSTX 1L THIN +33 190
#note Missing NIGHT, which not only scores six more but vastly improves the leave, is pretty embarrassing. Jeff said he didn't notice the T- hook when he played URBAN.
>Jeff_Clark: EFIRRTU 10C FRU.TIER +63 236
#note (trying to remain calm)
>Jason: DGNSUWX H12 W.ND +33 223
>Jeff_Clark: AEHY 12A YEAH +49 285
#note (trying really hard to remain calm)
>Jason: EGNOSUX 7H XU +22 245
#note Missed UNSEX(Y).
>Jeff_Clark: AO I12 O.A +10 295
#note The vowel-heaviness of the pool (one of the reasons I felt OK fishing into STING) will finally start to show.
>Jason: AEGNOOS A8 GOON. +27 272
#note Close. OOGEN(Y) or GOONE(Y). GOOE(Y)'s also clearly better given the pool.
>Jeff_Clark: AE 7M AE +10 305
#note I think this was the play Jeff said he had four E's.
>Jason: AAEEIST 15D AI.E. +8 280
#note Oh, how nice it would've been to play GOOE(Y) last turn and have the ENTASIA rack here! Jeff said in the post-mortem he thought this play was my "death knell." And no, there are no three-tile extensions.
>Jeff_Clark: ?CEEELQ 2H CaLQ.E +23 328
#note Needless to say, this play had me befuddled. I totally forgot that I needed to win by like 30 to win the tourney. Jeff's rationale is that it's almost impossible for me to win by enough after this play since the board is so tight. And it's only 18+ equity points behind the exchange of EEQ.  Meanwhile, I'm more focused on the difference between a rating of 1710 and 1730. So, as we put it later, I was playing to win, he was playing not to lose. 
>Jason: ABEEOST N1 .S +38 318
#note Gah! I missed (I)SBA in that spot! He obviously doesn't have an S, but picking five from a 20-tile bag with two S's, his odds are good (about 45%) in getting one. Gotta kill the spot.
>Jeff_Clark: EEM 8M EME +26 354
>Jason: ABEELOT J14 BO +21 339
#note Meanwhile, I thought *this* was my death knell. Hard to see me bingoing, hard to see me outrunning. Hopefully he's got the UVV and I can catch both S's...
>Jeff_Clark: TU 9N UT +9 363
#note OK, so far so good...
>Jason: AACEELT H1 A.ETA +24 363
#note OK, take a one-point lead (or so I thought) with good endgame tempo ... this is doable.
>Jeff_Clark: VV 5G V.V +9 372
#note OK, I think I got the advantage now.
>Jason: CEEGILS 3C ELEGI.S +22 385
#note Jeff and I each moved at a pretty good clip, as is our wont, so I had the time to take about 11 minutes on this play. The first three were spent re-tracking the game, as I had the I's gone. Tracked FRUITIE instead of FRUITER on the bingo. Thank heavens I drew the I, or I wouldn't have known! That would've been a sucky way to lose, by mistracking. I figure, in a situation like this, the winner is almost always the person who goes out first and I felt this was the best play/most probable out-in-two. Championship Player agrees. This wins five of eight times and ties a sixth, whereas the second-best LICE at K11 wins three of eight times. Proud of myself for taking the time and doing the right thing here.
>Jeff_Clark: ADGOOST 2B GOAD +19 391
#note Jeff didn't trust the best play of DATOS at 4A, but realized after the fact that I can't challenge unless I'm 100% sure it's not good, or I'll lose. But if I challenge and I'm right, I win by the 30 needed to overtake him on spread. Interesting situation, the whole second half of the game. I'm still not sure CaLQ(U)E's the play, but it accomplished Jeff's goal and definitely took out-of-the box thinking, which you gotta respect.
>Jason: CR D5 CR.. +8 393
#note Everybody happy! I got my win and my 20 rating points, Jeff won the tournament ... or so he thought, until he learned Paul beat Jeff F. by 213 to overtake him on spread by about 40 points. But still, he got second while I finished JOOM for the second tourney in a row. A fun game, worthy of a tournament decider.
