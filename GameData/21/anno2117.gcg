>Rahn_M: BEOSTUU 8D BUTEO +20 20
#note I realized after creating this file that the names are reversed. This is how I know what all his racks are but I don't know any of mine. It might also seem like he made some really bad decisions, but no. They were all me.
>Carl: GIINNN D8 .INNING +20 20
>Rahn_M: EHRSUXZ C12 XU +31 51
#note The C9 placement wins the sim. To me, it looked too risky, particularly with the J unseen.
>Carl: OOOOOO -OOOOOO +0 20
>Rahn_M: DEHJRSZ E5 JEH. +28 79
#note Quackle's being particularly harsh here. It likes JEEZ G6 by about ten points. I still can't wrap my brain around this. My strategy was to score now with the J and score next turn with the Z.
>Carl: AY 7E .AY +24 44

>Rahn_M: AEERRTU 4G RE.ATURE +66 261
#note It's tough to bingo through the blank. This is the only one that played.
>Carl: AALSV O4 SALVA +36 172
#note I held for a really long time, thinking of  but could not bring myself to challenge. The dude to my right thought it was good, like that matters.
>Rahn_M: CEFMOPT 11J FET +24 285
#note I sincerely believed that the COMP leave would make this an easy favorite over COEMPT L8 (which I would have happily played at N2 had SALVA come off the board) or FEM 11J. Wrong by about 5 points.
>Carl: BEINOST 2F BOT.NIES +68 240
>Rahn_M: ACFIMOP 1L FOAM +50 335
#note Now this is just careless. FICO / FOCI is clearly better.

#note Keeping CCRR is dumb. Quackle prefers HIC B13 or CINCH 10B.

>Carl: ET 15A T.E +9 302
>Rahn_M: CEGIRTV 12G VET +12 476
#note The analysis here gets a bit tricky. GIVE 14D sims well, and so does LEG H13. VET is so bad it can't really be determined how bad it is. Why not VEG? I dunno what I was hoping to do with the G that I couldn't do with the T. Or maybe I noticed that GO could turn into GOO, which sets up a D hook I can't block. That is something I would notice while missing seven more important things, like LI J14, also unblockable.
>Carl: DEIOR J13 .I +4 306
#note Setting up an unblockable lane.
>Rahn_M: CGIR 12M .IG +9 485
>Carl: DEOR 6H R.. +5 311
#note Blocking the only obvious spot for the C before seizing upon OE 3F.
>Rahn_M: CR 7I ..R +3 488
>Carl: DEO 3F OE +16 327
>Rahn_M: C -  +0 488
>Carl: D 3E D.. +4 331
#note It was as I was completing the tally slip that I remembered with horror the C hook for RENATURES. I don't even know how many points I lost in the endgame. I just pulled the number 30 out of some nether orifice out of frustration. Grrr.
