>Sam_: AEORTTV C1 VET +25 154
#note After 12,500 iterations, VET sims better than PET 3A by .7 equity points, but is worse by .44 win%. Anyone have a favorite? I didn't even consider PET, and would probably stick with VET now. AEORTV is surprisingly fruitful--bingos with CEFLPUX (8 sevens), and forms 44 eights, including 7 starting or iending with E (H1 and H8 bingos).

>Sam_: ??FIIOY 1C .IlIFY +45 265
#note After I had drawn tiles, Jan exclaimed, "Ugh, that's spelled with two Ls!! I should have challenged!! I said, "Uh, I'm pretty sure it's with one L," but then Phil muttered to me (he was sitting next two me), "It's two Ls." I was really surprised, since I was so certain of VILIFY and not VILLIFY*, and I'm a pretty good speller. Turned out they were both wrong. VInIFY and VIvIFY also work here. No bingos play, and I didn't expend too much time looking after I spotted VIlIFY.

>Sam_: ?AAALOV E4 AVA +17 313
#note The sim slightly prefers OVA E4--guess AAL is better than ALO. Also, an A starter is virtually needed for a column N bingo.

#note Held for somewhere between five and ten minutes.
>Jan_Dixon: DEELRST -  +0 376
#note Challenged because she couldn't find a win. There are three, one being a bingo neither of us knew. The other two leave the other one as an out. Over the board, I thought KEEL H12 won by one for her, but we didn't spot my ensuing block: EMIT 14H, which blocks DREST 14F, DRATS I10, and DREST L10. Dunno if I would have seen it over the board.
>Sam_: IIMOQT N7 QI +24 423
#note Sims as a loser because of STREELED L8, which of course we both missed again (still didn't know it). OMIT 13K and 11L are the only technical wins.
>Jan_Dixon: DEELRST H11 S.EET +27 403
#note The best non-STREELED play is TRES 13L, blocking my out.
