>Jason: AABLNNT 8D BANAL +20 20
>Jeff_Clark: ?EEOSUX F5 OXE. +27 27
#note WTH kind of word is f(L)EXUOSE? Figured he left at least two vowels, or he would've played EX or OX at 9F.
>Jason: ACENNPT E5 NAP. +29 49
>Jeff_Clark: ?EEMRSU G6 ER. +20 47
#note EMbRUES is the only playable bingo. But both times Jeff's alternatives have been solid.
>Jason: ACEEHNT D8 .EACH +24 73
>Jeff_Clark: ?EIMSTU H8 .UMpIEST +80 127
#note No double-double from the C; best along with LITMUSES.
>Jason: AAENORT 10H .OA +7 80
#note The funny thing is, I have a rack later that's close to EMANATOR, and I saw it then. Bad whiff. I also think I got way too fish-happy here.
>Jeff_Clark: DEEIINY K10 NIDI +16 143
>Jason: AELNRRT 6D L...R +12 92
>Jeff_Clark: DEEIVYZ 13B IVY +34 177
#note (Counted as 35.)
>Jason: AEENORT 12K .O +6 98
#note Yeah, I definitely got way too fish-happy. Even RENTAL/(AXE)L is an improvement over L(AXE)R last play.
>Jeff_Clark: DEEILSZ H1 SEIZE. +75 252
#note Yeah, this got away from me in a hurry.
>Jason: AEEMNRT M12 ME +14 112
#note Another high-prob miss, as I whiff on ANT(I)MERE. Those AEEIMT bingos are tricky. Always miss ADEEIMRT, ADEEIMNT and AEEIMNRT. Only a matter of time before it came back to haunt me in a tourney, I guess.
>Jeff_Clark: ?CDELPY 2B YCLEPt.D +92 344
>Jeff_Clark: ?CDELPY --  -92 252
#note Didn't take me too long to challenge. YCLEPED actually plays at N7; I know I didn't know it until dinner that night. "I deserve to lose this game for trying that," Jeff said on the way back from the challenge computer.
>Jason: AEGNORT A9 NEGATOR +87 199
>Jeff_Clark: ?CDELPY 10C P.LY +17 269
>Jason: ABDEGRW 14M WAB +24 223
#note The style points of AB(NEGATOR) would've been cool.
>Jeff_Clark: ?CDEENS 1A DESCENt. +89 358
>Jason: DEGIIRT 15N TI +20 243
#note I knew this would happen ... played all seven A's to this point, now I have an eight - A and none are open. *sigh*
>Jeff_Clark: AADHSTT I3 DAH +30 388
>Jason: DEGIORU G13 DUO +15 258
#note Didn't notice the phony two until after I drew. Shows you where my brain was. This was the equivalent of me waving the white flag, shutting down the best bingo line. Because of that, Jeff said he might've let it go even if he'd noticed.
>Jeff_Clark: AGIOSTT 11J G.TS +19 407
>Jason: EGIJKRU B6 JUKE +33 291
>Jeff_Clark: AINORTT F12 TON +14 421
#note T(ZA)RINA would've been sweet, but why open the board?
>Jason: EFGILRV 4H ..IRE +28 319
#note Yeah, I'd phoned it in by this point.
>Jeff_Clark: AIIORTU 13J O. +2 423
#note I thought this was a brilliant play. Q-sticks me if I've drawn it/he leaves it in the bag, while he has insurance if he draws it. Deservedly, he picks the R and leaves the Q for me.
>Jason: FFGLOVW K3 F.OW +20 339
#note Another lousy play.
>Jeff_Clark: AIIRRTU J13 .R +4 427
#note I think this may be a situation where setting up an out-in-two (or three) is best. Might catch me with the F or V, too, and stop the points I'll get from each. Especially since on this board with these tiles, Jeff isn't gonna score a lot anyway.
>Jason: FGLQV B13 .F +20 359
#note Jeff threw his head back in disgust. "I'm blind!" he said. To be honest, I nearly missed it, too.
>Jeff_Clark: AIIRTU B12 R.. +8 435
>Jason: GLQV 3G V.. +11 370
>Jeff_Clark: AIITU F1 .U +4 439
>Jason: GLQ F12 ...G +9 379
#note Wrong order. (E)L at B1 should be first to stop TI at 2B.
>Jeff_Clark: AIIT 12D .I. +6 445
>Jason: LQ B1 .L +4 383
#note Now TI isn't his best play, so I should take the extra point and put it at N13.
>Jeff_Clark: AIT 9H .T +6 451
#note Looks like (F)A for 7, (FA)T for 12 and (L)I for 4 are six better.
>Jason: Q -  +0 383
>Jeff_Clark: AI J6 AI +11 462
#note You miss EMANATOR and ANTIMERE, you get what you deserve. Can't blame this on the tiles. Congrats to Grob on his 677 this round.
>Jeff_Clark:  (Q) +20 482
