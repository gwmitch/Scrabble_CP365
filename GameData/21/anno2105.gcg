#note This was good for keeping the board closed, but taking the points with AIVER H11 might be slightly better.

#note Slightly tempting to put the U on, but that seemed way too risky.

#note I definitely messed up here. VAU H13 is a far better play.

#note I was pretty sure I was toast, but this gave me as good a chance as anything - obviously I had to block the SEXT hook, and I had ILIA 6K if Dave couldn't bingo out on column B. According to Quackle, SUN wins about 45% of the time, but that might be a bit high. I think there are only 15 (out of 36) racks that bingo, but many of the others can outscore my drecky collection.
