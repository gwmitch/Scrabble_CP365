>Jason: ADIIMNR 8D MIDAIR +24 24
>Steve_Grob: AEEIJOU F6 JU.O +28 28
>Jason: AGNNSST 10F STANG +27 51
#note Put down GNATS, changed to STANG because I was pretty sure it -S hooked.
>Steve_Grob: ADEEIOW D8 .IAOWED +26 54
#note Steve started playing from the M immediately and I panicked, until I saw it was this. "That I can live with," I said.
>Jason: EIMNRST K4 MINTERS +75 126
#note For style points, play M(A)R(T)INETS at G7 for 76. And I never dreamed MIDAIR took an -S. MIDAIRS???
>Steve_Grob: ?BEKVWX C13 WEB +29 83
>Jason: AEHILYZ L1 HAZY +60 186
#note This or ZA at B14. In the end, I took the risk and went with the points. Missed HAZEL at B10, but it and HAZY are close.
>Steve_Grob: ?AEIKVX 3L .EK +32 115
#note Steve: This rack caused some consternation. I dismissed the high-scoring ZAX for two reasons: it gave back too many easy points, and I was hoping to cash the X for big points to the 3ws at 08. KIVA B10 is probably best.
>Jason: CEILLST B12 CEL +24 210
#note Too much to hope that CELLIST/MY(C) would stay open, I knew.
>Steve_Grob: ?AGITVX L7 AX +36 151
>Jason: FILOSTU O1 FIST +41 251
#note Chickened out on FUSIL, despite "studying" the F fives.
>Steve_Grob: ?GITUVV M5 GUV +21 172
>Jason: AELNORU O1 ....ULAE +33 284
#note Earning a "nice" from Steve. Actually saw the possibility when I played FIST. Would that I could play like this all the time.
>Steve_Grob: ?AHILTV N1 IL. +23 195
#note Steve: Just dumping the H at 7G is best.
>Jason: EFNORRS E11 FOR +34 318
>Steve_Grob: ?AHOTTV G4 THO +15 210
>Jason: EEGLNRS 4D GEL. +10 328
#note I'd like to think Championship Player approves of my fishy block more than Speedy.
>Steve_Grob: ?AABRTV H10 .VATAR +30 240
#note I really liked this play. (And not because it gave me a bingo ... tough one to see, scores, opens; gets Steve back in it.)
>Jason: EINNRST 14F TR.NNIES +62 390
#note Late in the game, Kevin Lucas and Rob Long go to the challenge computer. A few seconds later I hear a "WHAT?!" from one of them. "Been there," Jeff Fiszbein deadpans. I laughed a little too loudly.
>Steve_Grob: ?BEEINU 13L BE +16 256
#note Steve: I played this hoping it to make it difficult on Jason if he had the Q. With that in mind, the Duck agrees but accomplishes the task with E(T)UI. 
>Jason: ACDEIOR 12K CORED +33 423
#note This or CORIA. Speedy likes the latter.
>Steve_Grob: ?EINOQU 2J QU. +32 288
#note Steve: Scrabble's version of Murphy's Law.
>Jason: ?AEINOY H5 OY +23 446
>Steve_Grob: ?EINOOP I3 PONs +27 315
#note Steve: Only thing wrong with this play is it doesn't go out in two. OOPs in the same spot would have been better.
>Jason: ?ADEINP 3C PANE +19 465
#note Well, I finally make a double-digit mistake this game.  AD(D)INg and AD(D)ENd are 11 better.
>Steve_Grob: EIO 9K .EI +14 329
>Jason: ?DI 11L rID +15 480
#note The cutest of a myriad of 15s. 2-0 and now with a spread to match.
>Jason:  (O) +2 482
