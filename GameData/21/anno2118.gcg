#note Apparently this is a pretty low probability bingo.  For a Classics major, it's as common a word as JAR.

#note My move sims fifth, but two of Quackle's favorite plays are crazy: WOODBIN gives the back D, E, and S hooks.  No way I would play that.  INDOW 4B giving the front W hook looks ridiculous too.  However, 4D IODIN and 4F WINO would have been better choices than my move.

#note I had a feeling I was missing a better bingo.  It's PYRONINE.
>CeLe: NORS 13B NOS.R +30 374
#note This looked strange to me.  I didn't think it was good, but I was happy she left the other S spot for me, so I wasn't about to challenge.

#note I had better ways to handle this ending, but I was pretty sure she wasn't going to take the AMPHORA hook, since she hadn't on her first turn, so I greedily set myself up for a high scoring out play.
