>Jason: CDEEINT 8H ENTICED +76 76
#note Exactly like our game in Pontiac: Easy bingo for me to open.
>Carolyn_Easter: ADDEIOS I5 ADE.OIDS +62 62
#note Exactly like our game in Pontiac: She answers. Only bingo.
>Jason: AAHNQSY 7M HAY +25 101
#note Whiffed on AYAH at H12. Speedy even likes ASHY in that spot better.
>Carolyn_Easter: ERUV L8 .URVE +20 82
>Jason: AEFJNQS 6N FA +33 134
>Carolyn_Easter: DGNO 13L DONG +24 106
#note Accompanied by a "I need new letters!"
>Jason: EJNQRSW 12K J.W +18 152
#note Should've gone with my gut and passed JQW, but I remembered how Q didn't like my "pass JQ, leaving RATES" play vs. Cornelis in Pontiac.
>Carolyn_Easter: EFM 9K F.ME +36 142
#note Nice.
>Jason: ?ENPQRS 10H Q. +11 163
>Carolyn_Easter: BEERV 12D BREVE. +24 166
>Jason: ?ENNPRS F11 P.N +5 168
#note Figured I was missing something through the A, but I'm not.
>Carolyn_Easter: AGNRT H1 GRANT +23 189
#note Put it at 14B, then picked it up to put it here, lamenting that each gave me a better play (perhaps she thought PENT takes the S?). "Where do you want me to play it?" she asked and I laughed.
>Jason: ?AEENRS 1H .ENERAlS +77 245
#note "Well, you blocked my double-double," I said. "Now I gotta decide which bingo to play to the G." She commented that that didn't take me long to find. "This rack is pretty idiot-proof," I said. Then she lamented my PEN play blocking her R bingo when she played GRANT, to which I said I wouldn't have played PEN if she hadn't blocked my bingo of SPiNNER(S) with BREVE(S)!
>Carolyn_Easter: EHLSXY 14A HEXYLS +50 239
#note She played this fairly quickly. "Nice," I commented. "Yeah, but look what it gives up," she said. I'd looked at II, then spazzed and dropped one on the floor. It was a U. She hit her clock and I said, "Well, from what I've seen so far, you might be OK."
>Jason: AIILLUW 15A ILIA +47 292
#note I'm lamenting the injustice of it all, and what a bad time to get a rack like this. No decent plays as far as I can see. I was thisclose to playing W(H)A. Then I saw the unorthodox LI at B15 for 13. Kills all the hot spots and unburdens myself of the duplicates. "But can she put a tile at each end of LI and score?" I wonder. "Ooh, yeah, I(LI)A fits if she has AI. Wait, don't I have AI?" I look down and nearly jump out of my chair. Speedy confirms, it's the only play. There are so often Dunlop-esque "game-losing" plays, and I think, in a rarity, this was my "game-winning" play. The accidental genius strikes again.
>Carolyn_Easter: CEILNRT 3H .RTICLE +20 259
#note "I know I'm missing something here," she said. Yup, CL(A)RINET may well win the game for her. After the tournament, she, Knappster and I were talking, and she said, "Remember that bingo I missed against you?" I said yes and she made me say it for Knappster's benefit. "Well, I play ZOUAVE giving up a big S play, and I don't have an S, but I have a blank," she says of a future game. "Well, next turn I play CLARINET through the E, draw an S, and score big next turn." I laughed. After an 0-3 start, dead tired, she finished 3-4, holding her 1530s rating steady. Good on her.
>Jason: LOOOUWZ G4 OUZO +19 311
#note I felt good after (A)RTICLE; the board was now closed and the pool was trash except for ?S out. But then I started drawing most of the trash and had to white-knuckle it home. I hate Speedy's choice of WOO at 14M. Missed OUZO at 10C, but I'm not sure that's an improvement.
>Carolyn_Easter: ARU E10 RU.A. +20 279
#note Another nice one. Scores, opens, dumps the U. Plus, she knew it took the C- hook and I didn't.
>Jason: IILOOSW O11 LO.OI +21 332
#note Now may be the time for WOO, since I have an S; but I'm leery with the blank out. Missed the cute OLIO at 2L, but this totally kills this section of the board. I'd play it again.
>Carolyn_Easter: GIT F2 GIT +11 290
#note Carolyn made some nice plays in this one, but GRANT's curious, the whiff of CLARINET hurt and this left me scratching my head. Why score so little and block the potential 2A bingos? Of course, if I'd gotten back from Mexico the day before, I probably wouldn't remember all my twos.
>Jason: AIKSTUW 6E WI. +17 349
#note This block took me way longer to see than it should've. I'm hemorrhaging equity here, but I still think I played the second half of this game about as well as I could've.
>Carolyn_Easter: BO 5D BO +18 308
#note Hard to open by playing one tile ... I like this play. Turns out the blank was in the bag, too.
>Jason: AIKMSTU C5 AUK +17 366
#note No way I was playing UMIAK or UMIAKS here. Best to stick to words I'm 100% sure of. Stupidly, AUKS is 21 better; guaranteed out and I cut down on her points if she plays there. UMIAKS is best, 35 better. SKUA is second.
>Carolyn_Easter: ?AENOPT 8A PAsTE +28 336
#note Best.
>Jason: IMST H12 .MIT +18 384
#note I can waste S's! Fiszbein, here, and I play one against Clark for 22 in the pre-endgame. Stay tuned.
>Carolyn_Easter: NO 14M NO. +16 352
#note Knappster looked at the board and said "These are all Idalski bingos, I can't tell who did what!" He correctly guessed that Carolyn's bingo was the lowest-prob one, though. I got a little measure of revenge; he talked about how he went second with ADINOOR and his opponent gave him the T he wanted. "Didn't want the L?" I asked. "Didn't want the G?" He got neither. I'm finally starting to get the better of some of his pop quizzes. At lunch, I am the only 3-0 in Div. 1.
