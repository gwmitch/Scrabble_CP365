>Mike: ADEENRU D8 .URNED +18 46
#note I saw UNBEARED, but it just sounded completely wrong. Other than missing them this memorably, how do you get words of this sort to stick? I should have at least seen RONDEAU for the 2x2.
>Lewis: DDEILP 13A PID.LED +28 44
>Mike: AEGORWY 12F WAYGOER +94 140
#note Hey, it stood. (Lewis did hold for a minute or so, though.) YAWPER A10 is best of the legitimate plays. Does this "earn back" some of the 55 equity I lost from the previous turn?
>Lewis: AHJ E3 HAJ +44 88
>Mike: ?AAGMRW A13 .AW +24 164
#note It's this or plays at 11K: WAG sims best, but I'm not sure I like it. I've learned the hard way not to let triple-triples stand open for too long.
>Lewis: MOOT D1 TOOM +27 115
>Mike: ?AGIMRT K5 eMIGRAT. +90 254
#note Clearly best; nothing even plays through the T.
>Lewis: AGR G3 RAG +16 131
>Mike: AELNNSX H1 AXELS +56 310
#note Presuming ERS on his rack from the previous semi-fish (seems reasonable, if a bit paranoid), this sims better than XENIA B10. Again, take out triple-triples, especially when ahead. As I'm drawing my tiles, before Lewis plays, I spot the second blank. Look at the score. I'm safe, right?
>Lewis: EELRSST 15A .RESTLES +86 217
#note Notice that AXELS blocked SETTLERS.
>Mike: ?CCDNNV -CDNV +0 310
#note All of the best plays are within a narrow range of win% (98.5 to 99.1), so they feel equivalent to me. VAC 10J sims best; at least it would help make the potential S hook on WAYGOER* less of a factor. I figured I was ahead by enough that I could afford the exchange, though.
>Lewis: FHOR 1A FOR.H +33 250
>Mike: ?CEENUU 14H ECU +9 319
#note The sim likes CURE 10B, three extra points for the same tiles. But ECU takes out a lane. I guess this brings up a meta-consideration; how do you play with the lead and the blank? Perhaps I should be trying to outrun here. But again, there's only a 0.65% difference between the two plays, so I don't feel too bad about this. Then again, given what's coming, maybe I should.
>Lewis: ANPT C3 PANT +33 283
#note I'm hearing footsteps.....
>Mike: ?EEINOU 9I OU.IE +7 326
#note The sim winner is OE 14E, which makes no real sense to me with five I's unseen. But again, I'm only 1.5% off the best play. I suppose the third choice, EURO 10B, makes as much sense.
>Lewis: ADIQ J2 QAID +36 319
>Mike: ?BCEIIN K1 NIB +20 346
#note Nothing is really secure here; BIN 8M sims best, by 81% to 78% (for my choice or BI in the same spot). I did consider ICIER B11, which is only about 71%; however, if I knew what he had, I would've done it...
>Lewis: AENZ B10 ZAN.E. +74 393
#note OW.
>Mike: ?CEIIIO 8M OI +4 350
#note It's interesting; when simming these games, Quackle gives a random draw to my previous leaves (which I then have to overwrite). Here, to CEI? I drew ENS. Had I caught *any* of the draws Quackle was giving me, I'd probably be okay. Sigh. As it is, for once Quackle vindicates me; this play sims best. It's only 20%, and I'll have to follow it up correctly (hopefully by drawing LT for CILIaTE/(F)ELICITy, which is what I was gunning for), but I got something right in this crazy game, at least.
>Lewis: ELNSTVY O8 LEVY +39 432
>Mike: ?CEFIIT 2A EF +25 375
#note I'm miles off here; I wasted all my time getting the preendgame right. FICOEs M5, killing both outs, is best.
>Lewis: NST 10J T.NS +15 447
#note Great comeback by Lewis; honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what I could've done differently. After AXELS, I was 99.3% to win; this must be that other 0.7%.
>Lewis:  (CIIT?) +12 459
