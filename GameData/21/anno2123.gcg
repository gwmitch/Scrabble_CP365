>John_Morse: DEFLR H6 FL.RED +10 10
>Phil: AGNPSUV K5 VUGS +27 47
#note I'm happy that Quackle confirms my decision to play VUGS here. Normally, I never- no matter what my rack is- play an s for under 35 or 40 points, a habit that I definitely need to break. After thinking about this play for a long time, I decided to let go of the s.
>John_Morse: AHOX G10 HOAX +30 40
>Phil: AAEGLNP I10 PAL +17 64
#note One of my biggest flaws it not knowing which tiles are best to keep. My play of PAL sims at about the 10th best play; the best play? PA in the same spot. Is AEGLN really that much better of a leave than AEGN or is there some other reason for Quackle's preference?
>John_Morse: CEORT 13B CORTE. +30 70
>Phil: AEEGINO 12C GAE +17 81
#note Again, me not knowing my leaves. GAE sims second best to GOA in the same spot. Personally, I can't see keeping two e's when there are still 8 unseen.
>John_Morse: MTT 6J M.TT +12 82
>Phil: EIINNOR 12I .INO +8 89
>John_Morse: ACEPTTV E11 V.. +12 94
>Phil: EIINRST M4 NI.RITES +60 149
#note Despite sacrificing 8 pts to its M1 counterpart, it sims best, leaving essentially no options available for bingos.
>John_Morse: ??AAENT N9 ANimATE +71 165
#note Unless my opponents rack is AAENT??
>Phil: ILNORUU 15J LUNI.R +21 170
#note Sims slightly worse than ULU L2
>John_Morse: FLY 13L FL.Y +25 190
>Phil: EKNOPSU O6 PUKE +33 203
#note I saw that with an N I had UNSPOKEN, but never considered that UNSPOKE could be a word. Puke sims second best after UNSPOKE, but it's a 62 point gap in word knowledge.
>John_Morse: BEEIIOT -BEEII +0 190
>Phil: AEINOSU 4L U.AI +10 213
#note Ugh. I laid down the AE for AEON 14C, then picked it up, thought for a long time, then played UNAI. 
>John_Morse: DGJMORT 14D MOD +29 219
>Phil: AEENOQS 14M E.A +12 225
#note ETA lost me the game. I knew when he played MOD that he had the Y, but did not want to burn my S playing NOES/EONS/ONES for just 22. I should have realized that a Y play wins him the game and blocked the spot.
>John_Morse: EHWY 15A WHEY +64 283
#note Ouch.
>Phil: EEENOQS O3 Q. +11 236
#note Quackle strongly prefers changing EEOQ.
>John_Morse: CEIORRS -CO +0 283
>Phil: EEEINOS G5 OE +7 243
>John_Morse: DEIORST 4D EDITORS +71 354
>Phil: CEEINOS I3 E. +3 246
#note Yes, ER for 3 points sims best by far. Honestly, I wish I could say I passed up CODEINES E2, but I flat out missed it. Trying to figure out why about 15 nonbingos sim far superior to the bingo...anyone know why?
