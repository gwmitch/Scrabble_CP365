>Carl: DEFLT 8D DELFT +22 22
>Mike: IIMORTV E3 MOTIV. +22 22
#note Or MOVIE; they're within half a point.
>Carl: ?ELNNPS 4D N.NuPLES +74 96
>Mike: ABIJRSU H1 JAU. +39 61
>Carl: GHO 5K HOG +24 120
>Mike: BCIOORS 3B BOO. +18 79
#note The cute BROMO, which I didn't know, is better in this spot. At the very least, it would've prevented the next play.
>Carl: ADIQ 2A QADI +42 162
>Mike: AACIIRS M3 CI.AR +18 97
#note Q seems to like fishing with AI 6I. I can see that; it opens a new line for my R, and ACIRS is powerful with E's to draw. CIGAR isn't bad though.
>Carl: ?AEFMOT 6A FOAM.EsT +66 228
>Mike: AAIISTY A4 TA.IA +27 124
>Carl: DEIORRY 1H .OYRIDER +110 338
#note I held this, but it was the "I don't *want* it to be good, but I fear it is" kind of hold. (You know what I'm talking about.)
>Mike: EIIPSTY B8 YIP +19 143
#note DEITY D8 actually wins the sim, improving my winning chances from 0.02% to 0.03%. Yeah, I really feel bad about missing that one. [/sarcasm]
>Carl: AEGIRUZ 6J ZA +37 375
#note Apparently I blocked GAUZIER. Boo-bleeping-hoo.
>Mike: AEINOST L7 ATONIES +68 211
>Carl: EGIRUX M9 XU +36 411
>Mike: EEELNRV 10J VE..E +18 229
#note Since nothing is more than 0.1% here, this sort of position is about feel and guts. I like this play; if I catch either of the last two S's or the case A, I've got a decent look at a bingo.
>Carl: EGINRRS O4 RINGERS +86 497
#note Or not. Me: "I think you have enough to win, Carl. You can stop now." Carl: "I hate these kind of games. From either side. This is ridiculous."
>Mike: EEEHLNR 2N HE +22 251
>Carl: EOW 7C WO.E +32 529
>Mike: EEILNRU 1D LEU +9 260
#note So, of course, VENUE is blocking PERILUNE. This, amazingly, sims best. (Hey, it's not like I was throwing equity away here...)
>Carl: ACDKNTU 12F UNTACK.D +66 595
#note Sheesh!
>Mike: BEGINRW 11A BEWIG +31 291
>Carl: LS 5A .LS +11 606
#note Nicely done, Carl.
>Carl:  (NR) +4 610
