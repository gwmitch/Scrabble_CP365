#note 9H DEFT sims quite well.  The GNZ leave looked weird to me though.

#note There are other plays that score better, but they all open triple-triples. I think I was worrying too much about defense here. Just play D11 LOONY.
>Alyssa: ?BINORS J2 BIcRONS +74 156
#note Alyssa said she chickened out on SORBING. That and ROBBINS both score well in row 15. Also worth noting: I held for a while here. I could have sworn BICORNS had no anagrams. I eventually talked myself out of that.
>Evans: AEJNOOT 15A JETON +50 182
>Alyssa: DEMX 3I M.XED +36 192
>Evans: AAADOOR 2I A.A +18 200
#note We talked a little about this move after the game -- we both though ABA was right because it opened two triples, giving me a place to score after she cashed one of them. I failed to realize that ADOBO does the same thing while scoring better and cleaning up the rack more. Whoops.
>Alyssa: AENW 1F WEAN +26 218
>Evans: ADLLOOR 5E DOLLA. +14 214
#note For some reason I thought it better to turn over tiles than score points. Quackle thinks I'm an idiot (to the tune of 17 points). LAX/LORAL is best. I forgot the word LORAL. That's bad.
>Alyssa: ?EEGILT 4A GEnTILE +75 293
#note This is where it all starts to unravel...
>Evans: ENORTTU 1K TROUT +28 242
>Alyssa: EEIOPRS C1 PIO.EERS +70 363
#note Ow. Stop doing that.
>Evans: ACEIINW B6 WAIN +32 274
#note This scores really well, but she has all kinds of comebacks. WIPE or WISE would have been safer.
>Alyssa: CHI A7 CHI +49 412
#note Like I said... all kinds of comebacks.
>Evans: CEEIIMU 1A IM.I +27 301
>Alyssa: INRRSUV 12I VIS +12 424
#note Best play is VI(RE)S, using the same tiles in the same spot to score 12 more. She was low on time though.
>Evans: CEESU K5 SEE +26 327
#note The best play is just to dump the U at I7 for UP/FUN, keeping an unblockable C(RE)ESE for next turn. Obviously I would never find that, because I don't know CREESE. Turns out it has the same meaning as KRIS. Live and learn.
