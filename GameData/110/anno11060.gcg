>Aaron_Arnold: AEPV 8G PAVE +18 18
>Chris_Canik: HIKOOVW J3 HOOKI. +23 23
#note And I start with a phoney. Whoops. And of course it's not even strategically good - HOWK is much better. VI(E)W is also better. VW as a leave is terrible, but I take it anyway. Maybe I was biased after my last game where I played off six tiles my first turn and pulled a blank.
>Aaron_Arnold: CY 5I C.Y +16 34
>Chris_Canik: AGIORVW 9F VAW +20 43
#note (H)AVIOR and VIRAGO are cool plays, but also bad plays. VAW is best.
>Aaron_Arnold: ?EENOST K8 dENOTES +71 105
#note Definitely not the best bingo he could've played. Without letting Q sim, I can see at least OuTSEEN L2 as significantly better defensively. But I won't question him.
>Chris_Canik: GIJORRU J11 JUROR +31 74
#note This is scary, but best.
>Aaron_Arnold: EGM L11 GEM +34 139
>Chris_Canik: EGGIIRX 15E RIGGE. +24 98
#note RIGGE(R) is best. Honorable mention to (REM)IX, but just no.
>Aaron_Arnold: AIL 3J .AIL +14 153
>Chris_Canik: AEHINNX 14B ANNEX +83 181
#note A gift from the tile gods. Of course, I blaspheme them by miscounting this as only 73. Genius. 171-153 after this by our count.
>Aaron_Arnold: ABDEIOS M5 ADOBIES +74 227
#note He sets this down after four minutes, I write the score without even looking, and b the time I look up, he's got two tiles face-down on the table. It was a bit fast, but within fair range of time. I'm an idiot for not looking at the play, but I'm not a big enough idiot to have thought it was good.
>Chris_Canik: ?DHISTU 8M .UD +18 199
#note I definitel don't know TUnDISH. Wish I did. Aside from that, using the T(RIGGER) is Q's next choice. I like giving myself another lane better, even with the 4-point sacrifice. BUD is 4th, behind two plays at D12 and TUnDISH.
>Aaron_Arnold: AY 15A AY +20 247
>Chris_Canik: ?HIRSTT O1 THIRSTe. +86 285
#note THIRSTeD is a good bit above any other bingo, mostly because anything else involves giving an easy Triple at A8.
>Aaron_Arnold: ANR 10G RAN +14 261
>Chris_Canik: CILLNPQ L1 CL.P +22 307
#note Approximately tied with PINC(ER) E10. I like ILNQ over LLQ. Both are better options than exchanging.
>Aaron_Arnold: OTU 11E OUT +12 273
>Chris_Canik: EIILNQT 12D QI +24 331
#note Duh. I don't like LENTI(C) because he's been fishing. Also just duh.
>Aaron_Arnold: U 2N U. +10 283
>Chris_Canik: BEEILNT 13B BE +20 351
#note BE(G) G13 is cool... wish I knew ANNEX(E). This is next-best.
>Aaron_Arnold: DE G8 ....ED +11 294
>Chris_Canik: AEILNST 1H ANTI. +21 372
#note This is potential suicide, given that he's been fishing for about 5 turns now. But I apparently decided it was worth it. LINA(C) is at least a better leave, but I'm too stupid to remember it.
>Aaron_Arnold: DIM 2F MID +15 309
>Chris_Canik: EEFLSWZ 3F EF +22 394
#note Honestly doesn't matter what I do here - so long as I don't leave I(MID) and also don't give him any new hooks, I win. This accomplishes that. ZEE apparently also does, but I'm not yet confident in my Z 8's yet. FEZES is asking for him to bingo.
>Aaron_Arnold: FOOR E3 ROOF +20 329
>Chris_Canik: ELLNSWZ 7L Z.N. +14 408
#note This allows me to go out in two turns, and it's a club game, so I'm not gonna be a dick and sit and ponder spread points.
>Aaron_Arnold: AEIT 13J ...IT +14 343
>Chris_Canik: ELLSW 7A WELLS +17 425
#note Wow, I miss SWELL D4. Swell play on my part, obviously. Because, as aforementioned, ANNEX was misscored, final score is 419-343. 
>Chris_Canik:  (AE) +4 429
