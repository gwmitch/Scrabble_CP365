#note man! this play was tough. I thought IOSTY might have some weird lurking synergy.

#note You know what, I actually do agree with Quackle. EYE N1. Suicide? maybe not... it looks to me like the most probable response would be a vertical play next to mine, rather than a play to the triple. With my D, and ie? to go with it, I can perhaps make something happen with a 3x3 through that E AND whatever letter he puts in front of it...  DEBYE is a fine alternative of course.

#note great challenge by nigel. I thought it was good.
>Emcee_McMe: CDENRTU 12L CU.T +14 194
#note I really like CENTRED 13i here. blocks multiple bingo lanes while turning over 6 for the blank that I know is in the bag. My play seems alright though... I will almost certainly have that E to play through on row 14, not to mention multiple other lanes. Playing with knowledge of your opponent's rack can be fun and challenging!

#note realm seemed to be handingover points on a silver platter, but I guess this play is too.

#note I suspected that I was the ALLOWER* of some funny business when he set this down, but I was in a position where a challenge would be silly unless I was nearly positive (says nigel). yeah, I needed a lane pretty desperately (says jesse).

#note Critical moment. Excellent choice of play by Jesse.
>Emcee_McMe: AAERSST 14A TA.RES +33 360
#note Tough position. TARRES sims fine, SAD H1 sims better. challenging HOTWIRE* sims best.  By the way, I am going to start pronouncing 'sim' as 'seem', because that's essentially what it means.

#note I could've stolen this one with a better draw. still happy to be in it with a chance at the end. however this is a poor choice that I made because I ran out of time - I think the real way to go is to play FAWN blocking the easy plays on column A and praying he doesn't see VAMP. he was lowish on time so it's not impossible.
