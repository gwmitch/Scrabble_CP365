>cesar: ?AEEJRT 8G JET +20 20
#note JETE, probably, actually. JET actually gives back more points than JETE on average. (-0.5)
>carl: IQS J6 QIS +43 43
#note geez, this was almost a worst-case scenario.
>cesar: ?ADEORU I8 .AbOURED +60 80
#note ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh AUREOLED CESAR (-6)
>carl: BGINO 15G BO.ING +36 79
>cesar: EOOSVWW K11 WOVE. +22 102
#note maybe M12 WOWS but i wasn't sure about BODINGS.
>carl: EORRR L8 ERROR +21 100
>cesar: IKOSSTW 14I .K. +33 135
#note again if i had known BODING took an S, stuff like M12 TOWS/TWOS looks better. i really don't know about EKE, but it doesn't seem THAT bad. maybe i can fool him into playing closed or something. (-3.5)
>carl: AAEFGN F10 FANEGA +33 133
#note nice move
>cesar: GIOSSTW K5 WIT +25 160
#note 12B TOWING is an awesome play, particularly because he just played 6. i wish i was creative. (-5)
>carl: DEHILOT 4I LITHOED +83 216
#note wow...
>cesar: GNOOSSV 11C NOV. +14 174
#note blah, just play N2 OVENS or put the S on NOVA. GOSS is an ugly leave. stop it. (-7)
>carl: AEUX 12A EAUX +44 260
>cesar: GILOSSS A6 GLOSSI.S +77 251
#note heh, well that was lucky
>carl: CEIM O4 .EMIC +30 290
>cesar: ADEIIMT 14A TI +14 265
#note there's a bunch of plays thru NU like MINUTED. MINUTIA is also good. i don't like giving him a scoring spot when i'm down but it almost seems i have no choice. TI is too much gambling for too few points. (-9)
>carl: CELP N2 CL.PE +32 322
>cesar: ADEEIMZ 10L .AZE +33 298
#note size doesn't score enough
>carl: ?ALRTUY 3D bUTYRAL +69 391
#note well this is over
>cesar: DEHIMNO 2M I.H +8 306
#note O10 EMODIN isn't gonna work. ICH is too ridiculous, i guess, if i want to conserve spread, because it's not going to win either. there's also 4A HEMIN for spread. (-18)
