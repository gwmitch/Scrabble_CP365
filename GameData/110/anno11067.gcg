#note this game was sort of annotated but never posted. i was pretty set on KILIM until he exchanged 3 and thought i should play it closed. I'm giving up 9 equity points. that may be too much. giving him a crazy rack like ARES puts me down only 2.5 equity points. giving him ERS? puts me down 2 equity pts. so in any case i was wrong because i can score with the X next turn probably, plus MILK is an unwieldy leave.

>cesar: IKLMQST 6J MILK +28 54
#note ham came down after a long time, and then i guess i decided to throw my theory out the window. this was one of my hardest decisions of the tourney. i would normally play QIS K5 and probably should to let him deal with it, but i liked MILK for several reasons. i have the S, the K is bingo unfriendly, i am slightly more likely to draw a Y since he has strong bingo tiles... but this just has to be too open. also with QIS i have MILK next turn if anything too. i still don't know what's right. MILK wins the sim, but QIS wins by 3 if i inference the very strong ERS?, which I should. this shows how inconsistent i can be from turn to turn, choosing FIX over KILIM and then blowing up the board.. it's nonsensical.

#note i saw both possible 8s here.. they're both fun. this was also a hard play, i strongly considered PENIS but could not wrap my head around it. i thought i'd better just suck it up and leave the big Y spot open and take less points to go for the bingo. this may have been a cock-up of a play as i can totally get shafted by a 40-pt play, but i don't think there is a vas deferens between the two plays, even though FIN wins by quite a bit.

#note ok, let's do some math here. first of all, equity wise of course ZIN is a much better play than ZINE. i just figured there was almost no chance he wasn't going to hook ZIN, plus i could draw a big B spot that he just *might* miss (hey, i have to go for luck now). there's 11 tiles that hook ZIN and he's drawn to 52 tiles. the chances of him not having one are (41/52)*(40/51)*(39/50)*(38/49)*(37/48)*(36/47)*(35/46) or 16.8% (seriously, is there a way to estimate this in the middle of a game? i need to come up with a good formula). so quackle is  telling me to just give up the 35+ pts, but go for the bingo yourself.. i guess that makes sense.

#note i was 99% sure that was good, but seeing as how i have no shot to win anymore and he blocked my bingo, i have to challenge.
