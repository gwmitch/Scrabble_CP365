#note realized right after I played this that AERO 7H is clearly best, setting up R(AI), and generally being much more defensive. These early plays should not be rushed through as if they don't matter; they shape the board and set the pace. Pakorn, one of the all-time greats, often devotes a proposterous amount of time to the first few turns of the game, making sure to play them as deliberately as possible.  He is one of the only players I've ever seen with that strategy, but I think there's something to be learned from his example...

#note PUGGAREE i never would have played but REGAUGE is one of the worst bingo misses I've ever had... I mean I played GAUGE for cryin out loud. what a dumbass.

#note I think dropping the H for 26 is best here... scores well and leaves the workings of a bingo rack, even if it takes a couple turns to hit. I also like GI(G)HE, which I considered but decided against for unknown reasons.

#note dumb dumb dumb. this is NOT the type of spot I should be opening up right now. I don't want to hit a 30 point J word, I don't want HER to hit it, I dont want her to hit the QAT underlap, yet I have set all of those things in motion. VIE is indisputably correct. Scores awesome and leaves awesome POTENTIAL to score. plenty of time to come back, excellent bingo lane on line 2 will likely stay open for a while... dumb dumb dumb.

#note It appears I will need a bingo to win. VISCERA underlapping the Z looked like my best bet, because I figured it was almost certain to stay open. I didnt like playing VAS bottom left because It puts me down 50+ after Jan's response, and CRW? looks like a sure loss to me.
