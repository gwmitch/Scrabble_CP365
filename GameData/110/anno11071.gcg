>Ryan_Fischer: ADISTYZ 8H DITZY +44 44
#note I think the leave is right.  Hard to say.  Forgot to write it down.
>Lisa_Slankard: JLLO L4 JOLL. +30 30
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEMRSV J6 VA. +14 58
#note TAV or AVO instead?  The fish is right, I just don't know what the best way to play it is.  I think AV(O) is better as it helps more to ensure a bingo will go down.
>Lisa_Slankard: IIIIOOU -IIIIOOU +0 30
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEMORS M2 AROMA +29 87
#note AROMA was second to ZOEA and sure backfired.  A(Z)O looks tempting now that I look at it.
>Lisa_Slankard: EHW N2 HEW +43 73
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIILSS O1 LIES +39 126
>Lisa_Slankard: ABEINOT H1 OBTAINE. +86 159
>Ryan_Fischer: AABIISS 4C ABASI. +16 142
#note This is 2nd to BIAS which I hate so much -- so why do I hate it so much?  Ugh.
>Lisa_Slankard: AEKQRSU 3C KA +28 187
#note This or (S)UQ.  She said she had QUAKERS here.
>Ryan_Fischer: CGIMRSV N6 VIG +29 171
>Lisa_Slankard: EQRSU F4 .UQ +32 219
>Ryan_Fischer: CEMRSUX E4 .X +36 207
#note Couple things I can hit through the O.  I need it.
>Lisa_Slankard: ?DEENRS 1E END.RsES +59 278
#note 7A ENDoRSE(E) 74, but a risky spot.  DENER(VAT)ES is a 10 that plays.  Some plays from the I score a bit more, but she chose the defensive option, which makes so much sense.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEMPRSU 2D CRU +20 227
#note M(OM) for 14?  Nothing much great here.
>Lisa_Slankard: GORY O8 ORGY +33 311
>Ryan_Fischer: EFMOOPS 11K POOF. +26 253
#note POOF(Y) or (Z)OOM, I probably chose wrong.  But FEPS won't go anywhere fast.
>Lisa_Slankard: HINT 12I THIN +22 333
>Ryan_Fischer: ELMNORS I7 R.M +13 266
#note R(I)M hopes to create another spot.  Still, I need to bingo fast, draw the blank, and bingo again to win, while scoring in the process.  Maybe ENORM is right.  Scores 27, goes for the blank.  Part of me doesn't want it until I can put a first bingo together, though.
>Lisa_Slankard: AT 3G A.T +8 341

>Lisa_Slankard: AEGINRT 11C INGRATE +68 409
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEENOS N13 .EE +6 300
#note Well, it's definitely kamikaze time.  I can't exchange here.  So why not open a crazy spot and hope for something crazy to happen?

#note I don't know how I could miss those points, but I did.  Was really low on time.
