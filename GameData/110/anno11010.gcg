#note flukyzar. this is a godawful play that i knew was bad when making it but i still told myself I'M PLAYING CHOLATE. (-19.5) i suppose i should explain some reasoning behind it, which made sense to me at the time: burn through tiles to end the game faster since i'm ahead by a lot, block bingos ending in S, and (ugh) turnover. all of those don't make up for C11 HOB being a vastly superior play. right?

#note -5 cubeb but noah says bung a good idea. cubeb has a good leave.

#note aby is better because it blocks more, but i didn't look that hard when i had NAY. i was very strongly considering doing BEANIES for somewhat similar reasons as CHOLATE, but i'd probably had enough bad plays for one game. finally, YABBIE 10B is another interesting, crazy play.  (-3)

#note arsenates is better. (-2.5) i actually forgot SERENATA had an anagram. i think i'm too old to learn words.

#note probably medii (-4.5) or medial. media is certainly wrong. i sort of thought i could make him burn some good stuff... i decided against MEDII because i was worried about QI, but MEDIA still leaves a slightly less probable but more damaging QAT. it also takes 75 hooks.

#note perhaps sinful. discussion? (-3) i kind of liked GRIT, actually. quackle does silly things like 14A FIT.

#note cesar bad. 1F FUSION looks best, but quackle prefers biofuel and boule. (-18.5). i was trying to not open anything from the B and keep Q insurance. but if i'm going to do plays like INFO, K4 FEE is better.
