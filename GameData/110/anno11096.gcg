>Christian_O.B: DEINNSX M7 N.X +39 472
#note With 4R unseen, playing this was a perfect for maximize bingo chance in next move
>Adelina_Harry_Santi: RR O8 .RR +3 270
#note Adelina saw a problem of 2 R still unseen, while she has 2 R's... But just 3 points.. Probably there were better moves somewhere
>Christian_O.B: DEIINOS C1 IODINES +86 558
#note Easy bingo, best move
>Adelina_Harry_Santi: CEHINRT 1A CH.NE +33 303
#note Adelina best move here, was super parallel move D1 TRINE/IT/OR/DI/IN/NE for 26 points, because it block my DRIB play, and she was able to finish with CHI 3F for 21 points, minimize her losing spread, also, burn my hope to beat high game set by Fadlan (578, if I not mistaken)
