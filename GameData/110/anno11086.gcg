#note Only WEPT. Whoops! DEEP 11J is another good option, mainly because it opens the right side of the board up more. It's only a word.
>Jan: IQ G3 QI +23 109
>Noah: AABRSSX 13I BAR.S +22 64
#note I realize this is somewhat overt, but she might not notice, or it might be difficult for her to cover all of my X plays. SAX is the other option here, I think.
>Jan: EGLUY 14F GLUEY +38 147
>Noah: AEHSTUX 15H HE +35 99
#note AH seems straightforwardly better than this. HEST is preferred by Quackle, and I think it might be quite good.
>Jan: RWY F4 WRY +23 170
>Noah: AJSTUUX -JUUX +0 99
#note No. I think I should just suck it up and play EAUX. I might get pwned some a lot, but sometimes I get a good play and it could even help me open the board. 
>Jan: ?ADMNPS F8 DAMPiN.S +69 239
#note Held this forever. I was almost positive it was good, but I really wanted to challenge (and it to be phony), but I couldn't.

#note Was pretty sure LUNTED wasn't a word. Whoops.

>Noah: ?AILNOS C2 INSOLA.e +66 217
#note Didn't think of ALOIN. Just wanted this game to be over.
