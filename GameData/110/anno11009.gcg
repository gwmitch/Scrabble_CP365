>Jerry: EEELNRT -E +0 0
#note Sim suggests my move (exchange E) was among the best choices.  EEL or LEE 8G 6 seems to be its favorites.
>New_Player_1: ?AAGIST 8F AnTISAG +68 68
#note Simulates best - with estimated winning chances of 69% right off the bat!

>Jerry: EEELNRT L8 .REENLET +70 70
#note Sims better than LATEENERs for 66 or 62 points...with about 40% winning chance

>New_Player_1: JOY 11J JO.Y +28 96
>Jerry: AGMOSUW N11 SWUM +33 103
#note GAMUT 15H (24) and SWUM sim neck and neck for best choice, 40% winning chance estimate.
>New_Player_1: ADEELNU G7 U.ANELED +61 157
#note Estimated winning chances: 67%
>Jerry: ADFGOTX H13 FOX +47 150
#note Sims best - about 35% winning chance estimate
>New_Player_1: AHY O13 HAY +36 193
#note About 65% win probability
>Jerry: ADGMNPT 11C TAMP.D +22 172
#note My play TAMPED sims about 2.5 points behind GIMP I7 (14) with MAP 7I (23) next best
>New_Player_1: BEI J11 .IBE +15 208
#note Still expected to win 60% of the time
>Jerry: CCGINPS K5 PIC. +16 188
#note My first big error.  PACING D10 (26) sims 12 equity points better than PICA - with better winning chances (40% vs 33%)
>New_Player_1: BEIR 12A BRIE +24 232
#note Estimated 66% winning chances
>Jerry: ACEGNST A12 .ANG +21 209
#note CIG 6J (12) sims about 2 equity points better - with similar winning chances (37%)
>New_Player_1: ORT J4 ROT +13 245
#note about 64% winning chances
>Jerry: CELOSTW 10K W. +10 219
#note Another inferior play.  COW I3 (21) sims 10 points better than my play, its second choice.  Winning 46% vs 40%
>New_Player_1: KRTU 3J TURK +20 265
#note about 70% winning expectation
>Jerry: CEILOST 4C CLOISTE. +72 291
#note Actually moved to 56% winning expectation after this.  COSTLIER is the other bingo - simming slightly worse
>New_Player_1: AFI H1 FIA. +21 286
#note Win expectation around 30%
>Jerry: EGINOVZ C9 VO..NG +28 319
#note If Quackle is told what Chris held - it says the best play is ZERO L1 (46).   Frankly, I think I totally missed ZERO (and ZORI); I don't recall even considering them.  

Without knowledge of Chris' rack, the sim prefers EVITING where I played VOTING.  VOTING isn't a horrible other choice....but it sure is lacking compared to ZERO and ZORI
>New_Player_1: ?DENORU 1H .OUNDERs +89 375
#note Founder(s) is perfectly good, but FRONDEUR puts the D on the double letter, scoring 3 more.  Note that ZERO or ZORI for me last turn still leaves Chris with a bingo: RESOUND - but it's only 76 points, not 86
>Jerry: EHINOQZ I7 Q. +21 340
#note Sim prefers O(O)ZE E2 (26) by about 3.2 equity points - and 3% winning chance (15% vs 12%). ( I don't see where any winning chances are coming from, though.)
>New_Player_1: AILV E3 V.ILA +16 391
#note SILVA O1 (11) may be preferrable - killing that triple word line.  It and VIOLA and VOILA all sim around 93% winning expectation
>Jerry: EHINOOZ 10B Z.NE +40 380
#note ZECHIN C2 (42) allows an out in 2, but doesn't score much on 2nd turn.  I chose ZONE for the big scoring 2nd turn
