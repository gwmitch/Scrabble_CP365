>Jesse_Day: ABEELRS 8G BE +8 8
#note JD: any commentary with a JD in front is me. Otherwise it's nigel's. this was an interesting opening rack. We were late coming back from lunch because I went to a pharmacist to ask about my eye infection, so I only had 20:00 to play this game.
>Nigel: AGGNNRR 9F RANG +15 15
>Jesse_Day: AAELRSZ J8 LEZ +38 46
#note JD: weird sequence in which I go from fishing to making a really defensive play.
>Nigel: AEGNRTU 10A GAUNTER +71 86
>Jesse_Day: AAORSTY D8 SA.ATORY +82 128
#note (phony)

JD: apparently it's collins. it sounded like a word to me.
>Nigel: DELLNTV 15A LEV. +30 116
>Jesse_Day: ?OPRUUY 8A YUP. +27 155
#note JD: no spot for vapoury.
>Nigel: DDLNSTW 13C D.WN +16 132
>Jesse_Day: ?BOQRUV -ADEIL +0 155
#note JD: my biggest miss of the tournament so far...completely overlooked a 72 point play. actually, keeping QRU? sims better than R? precisely because I might hit LIQUOR - but I already have it this turn!
>Nigel: ADEILST A1 STEADIL. +89 221
>Jesse_Day: ?CFORUX B2 OX +31 186
#note this blank is proving tough to bingo with
>Nigel: DEEIINO 3A ..INE +24 245
#note Thought this was alright, even considering his previous bingo-building plays. I'm not terribly worried about bingos scoring 60-70, which seems NEARLY the worst case scenario here...
>Jesse_Day: ?CEFRTU 4C FURCaTE +85 271
#note correction: THAT's the worst case scenario.

JD: I needed a big break to get back in this game and I got it.
>Nigel: AADEILO 14B AE.O +24 269
#note JD: nice little fit for nigel
>Jesse_Day: ?EHIJMO 3I HOMIE +37 308
#note JD: with the J in hand this play feels extragood.
>Nigel: ADDGIIL K9 DAG +29 298
#note I kicked myself after the game for not being 100% on GADID. I needed it here (@ K5)
>Jesse_Day: ?BIJNRV E2 V..B +18 326
#note JD: this is a really tough decision. all I have to do is draw an O or some other vowel and I get to score and keep my blank. I can burn my blank now, play VERB as I did or just play JIB. In retrospect I think I should take the points. also, it didn't help that I had showed up late for this game.
>Nigel: DIIKLOT 7E ILK +27 325
>Jesse_Day: ?AIIJNR J2 J. +25 351
#note JD: still couldn't hit it, but it was time to offload the J.
>Nigel: DHIOTTU 4L THOU +25 350
#note nice play that closes a lot of lanes that I might have hit with my fish...
>Jesse_Day: ?AIINRR N2 IR.N +19 370
#note JD: he took out rainier. I am surprised by quackle's dislike of my play. I really needed  lane to try to hit with my blank. RIA looks pretty weird to me, and it's not much etter on win percentage.
>Nigel: CDINOST L10 SONIC +29 379
#note I agree with championship player- ODIC 12K. Opens some 8 lines that could still be there after the IRON_ lane is used up (or vice-versa), and ties up the game to make it a shootout, saving NST to go with the AAEEEIIIOO? remaining of the 18 unseen tiles.
>Jesse_Day: ?AIIORW 2J .OW +23 393
#note JD: I need to hit a bingo fast!
>Nigel: DEEMOQT G3 Q.T +21 400
#note Open to suggestions here... what about MODE 5i?
>Jesse_Day: ?AFIIRS 6I FAIRISh +70 463
#note JD: I didn't think SONICS was good, and I didn't need to gamble on it. the S was a lucky draw.
>Nigel: DEEIMOP O6 .EMPED +30 430
>Nigel: DEEIMOP --  -30 400
#note I figured Jesse would take the sure win, leaving me with some extra mischievous spread points, but he flipped the situation on me and realized he would still win with a blown challenge, thus it was an easy decision to challenge this crap off the board. HEMPIE is a cool adj.
>Jesse_Day: AE O6 .AE +6 469
#note JD: low on time after the challenge and never came close to seeing adage
>Jesse_Day:  (DEEIMOP) +24 493
