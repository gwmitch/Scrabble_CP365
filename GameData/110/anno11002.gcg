>Rafi_: CFNNRTT -CFNRT +0 0
#note Normally I'm inclined to leave RT or maybe NRT, but it seemed better in this case to keep NT. My reasoning was that I would hit more bingoes ending in E or to the Y with NT than with RT, and that there's 5 R's unseen compared to only 4 N's. Not sure if it's right though. Championship player strongly prefers FRET, which seems problematic to me.

>Rafi_: AGHIINT K4 ATH..ING +48 48
>Nick_Meyer: EJO L2 JOE +24 73
>Rafi_: AAAFISU 2J FU.IS +46 94
#note This completely changed the path of my next couple of plays, from FAUNA looking to bingo soon to scoring and leaving AAA.
>Nick_Meyer: ABEGL 1F GABLE +29 102
>Rafi_: AAAAIUV -AAAAIUV +0 94
>Nick_Meyer: GP M1 G.P +20 122
>Rafi_: ABENNOT 6I NO. +21 115
#note Scores well, leaves good tiles, and blocks a good bingo lane after a 2-tile play by Nick. I prefer this over Quackle's choice of NOB underlapping GABLE.
>Nick_Meyer: ADQSU 12K SQUAD +47 169
>Rafi_: ABEEHNT O7 BATHE. +36 151
>Nick_Meyer: KNY N11 Y.NK +27 196
>Rafi_: AEFNOPV 7C FOVEA +19 170
#note YANK puts me in a pretty tough position. It's likely that Nick has an S or a blank here, and I can't do anything about the triple lane at the moment. I figured my best option was to open a scoring spot and try to dig for a blank. I played FOVEA in this position to set up my P for the triple.
>Nick_Meyer: DERST 15K DREST +33 229
#note That was a relief.
>Rafi_: AENOPUX 8A APEX +85 255
#note Couldn't have asked for a better draw.
>Nick_Meyer: NOO 9C NOO +21 250
>Rafi_: ADILNOU G3 ADUL..ION +62 317
#note I was not too happy after NOO, guessing that Nick left something pretty strong. I was looking at AUDIO as the play and then noticed the AT. So happy I found this!
>Nick_Meyer: EIORVZ 4A VIZORE. +48 298
#note Ouch - turns out LAUDATION would have been better.
>Rafi_: ?ARRTTU 10F T.UR +6 323
#note One of my toughest decisions all tournament. My thought process was something like this: First I decided whether I could win the game without bingoing (unlikely) so I ruled out TAR for 18 because leaving the U is very risky with IIIIW unseen. The best leave I can have is ART? which should be good with three E's, four I's and other bingo tiles left. I didn't like TURN/RUNT because they block one of my lanes, and ROUT doesn't allow -ANT bingoes like TOUR does. Quackle prefers TURN and RUNT, probably because it blocks 7s ending in S, which is Nick's best spot if he doesn't have the blank. What do you think?
>Nick_Meyer: ?ACILMN A8 .NIMALiC +86 384
#note ANALCIMe is the only higher scoring bingo, which likely would have been a game-winner.
>Rafi_: ?AEIRRT 15A .RITERiA +80 403
#note I'm down to about 5 minutes here. I saw CATBRIER and CRAFTIER immediately but both put the blank on the double letter. I figured I really could use the extra three points, and after a couple minutes of searching, found CRITERIA.
>Nick_Meyer: CDEIRSW A1 SWI.ED +39 423
>Rafi_: EI 1M .IE +14 417
#note Turns out those 3 points were the difference between winning and losing. Wow.
>Rafi_:  (CR) +8 425
