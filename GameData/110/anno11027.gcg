#note I wanted to play ZEE, but felt it would have been too costly if Tom held the S. I also saw WOODIE, but noted that it took out a likely bingo lane for me. Both of these plays sim much higher than my choice. (-6.5)

#note There is a winning sequence. See if you can find it. It definitely helps to track correctly and save time for the endgame. I did neither as I agonized over every decision this game. (-43)

#note Out of time, and not knowing what Tom's other letter, I played this, hoping to play out with UPWARDS next turn. (-18)
