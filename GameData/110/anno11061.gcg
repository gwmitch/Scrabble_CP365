>Chris_Canik: BEIOQRV 8G QI +22 22
#note I like QI over BEVOR. Q does, too.
>Kevin_Leeds: AHSU G8 .UASH +18 18
>Chris_Canik: BEORSVY 9B OVERB.SY +76 98
#note Immediately upon drawing this, I start begging the tile gods to give him a decent QU- play. They granted my wishes.
>Kevin_Leeds: OX 10A OX +50 68
#note And then they balance the scaled by giving him this handout. Sigh.
>Chris_Canik: ADFINRS A10 .RDAIN +27 125
#note I don't know why I didn't just take the fish and move on. I sort of wanted to continue the tile turnover and try to coast this halfway-decent lead out. IF 8A is better, among several 30-ish point options making S(QUASH). I'm good at this game, I promise. Surprisingly, though, I don't lose a ton of valuation.
>Kevin_Leeds: AELM H12 MEAL +37 105
#note I almost held it, thinking is was an inversion of FEALTY, but then I remembered this was also good. Glad I kept my head straight for at least -his- play, if not for my previous one.
>Chris_Canik: AEFINSW 8A IF +28 153
#note Extremely close to WAIF(S). Q hasn't decided after 500 iterations, and I'm bored of waiting. 
>Kevin_Leeds: AFLTY D8 F.ATLY +32 137
>Chris_Canik: AEINOSW C13 OW +20 173
#note Q suggests also dumping the E for OWE and two more points; and by "suggest," I mean 0.5 valuation. I prefer keeping it for something with -ER at E8. Meh.
>Kevin_Leeds: OZ 14F ZO. +32 169
>Chris_Canik: AAEINNS 15E NAI. +17 190
#note This is best, after a long sim. Barely.
>Kevin_Leeds: ??DEIOP E2 DIsPOsE. +73 242
#note Apparently he doesn't like S(QUASH). I wish I had an S, even if it was a fake "s".
>Chris_Canik: AEGNSTU 4C UN.TAGES +70 260
#note I get away with my third phoney of the day (I only played three games today). I assume his hesitation on challenging stems from that UN(I)TAGES is just as good. I promise I'm not terrible at this game.
>Kevin_Leeds: GUV H1 VUG. +27 269
>Chris_Canik: ACIJMTT J2 JI.M +29 289
#note Q likes JAT(O) 6B more... it's probably better, because it doesn't hand him a counterplay for easy points.
>Kevin_Leeds: OW F6 WO +27 296
#note I played OW, he plays WO. Huge word knowledge in this game by both of us.
>Chris_Canik: ACNTTTT C3 C.NT +12 301
#note Lol. Definitely my worst play of the day, both in vulgarity and in strategic merit. Exchanging is significantly better.
>Kevin_Leeds: DEKO 2J .OKED +34 330
>Chris_Canik: AEGITTT K5 ATT +14 315
#note Ick. I'm just tired of looking at T's at this point. I figure EGIT is a decent leave, but Q says to say "Fuck the board," and play at 3M. It was probably right. Especially because *spoiler alert* he bingoes there.
>Kevin_Leeds: ABELNRS M2 .NABLERS +74 404
>Chris_Canik: DEGIRRT 8L G.ID +24 339
#note Ewwwww. Good game. I wish I got two -ER bingoes per game. Ignore that - I won't be bitter. Good showing by him.
>Kevin_Leeds: EOPR O4 PORE. +11 415
>Chris_Canik: CEENRRT 4L C.R. +16 355
#note At this point, I actually saw a ray of light - (G)ENITURE or (G)ENERATE are possible. I think my mathematically best option would be to have dumped just an R and hoped for (G)ENTRICE, but I didn't see it. Also, he might be able to outscore me anyway if I take fewer points.
>Kevin_Leeds: AEEHIIU 11C E.UI. +10 425
>Chris_Canik: EEELNRT L8 .ENTEEL +18 373
#note And of course I don't draw it. At least I can make a genteel play to end on some style points.
>Kevin_Leeds: AEHI M13 HIE +24 449
>Chris_Canik: R 13H .R +3 376
#note And just to undo my style points, (T)R(OW). 
>Chris_Canik:  (A) +2 378
