#note I know that Devin studies, and he's studied some weird stuff. It struck me that he might have seen CREDENDA previously, recognized the alphagram, and now realizes his mistake. Perhaps reading too much into it. Notice he also has DARNEDER. Factoring opp's rack, my play sims second-best behind UNITY N6. Am I giving him too much credit? (-2.5)
>Devin: ADDEENR 14A RED +15 268
>Carl: AAILTTU 4H .UAIL +28 317
#note I did see sim winner TITULAR. I also saw that he has possible plays at H5 with UN___ED, and thought it more likely that he would hit one of those than something to the R. Given opp's ADEN leave, my play sims only slightly behind TITULAR (-.5) 
>Devin: ADELNRS B3 RELANDS +66 334
#note Blocking VITIATOR, not that I had a chance to spot it. Devin plays very fast, and had laid the bingo down before I had drawn all my tiles.
>Carl: AIIOTTV A8 IOTA +23 340
#note I saw that the V was difficult to use, but my instincts led me away from sim winner VITTA. Maybe I'd just had too many vowel-heavy draws throughout the tournament. This one cost me dearly. (-7)

#note According to Quackle, UNCAP 2H is the only winning play.

>Devin: AEFN A4 FEN +23 413
#note The benefit of playing fast is that your opponent might not have much time left for the endgame. Devin had about 15 minutes left at this point, while I only had about 6, which I misused making sure I had him tracked correctly (I had), making sure I couldn't get stuck with the V, and ensuring my play didn't give him an easy out. Since most obvious plays do in fact give him an out, I went with CHEW because it outruns FANE. I did not, unfortunately, think to look for 45-point out-in-twos with Devin's seemingly innocuous letters. Very embarrassing. (-15)
>Carl: ITV N7 T.V. +10 432
#note Devin plays chess, where it pays to see several moves in advance. Did he realize he was laying a trap with CAMP? It does seem like an unusual play. Either way, it paid off. My best sequence is EVIL L1... WHITY N6.
>Devin: A 12D A. +22 435
#note It was only 8 years ago that I beat Brian Cappelletto as a noob#. Now I know what it's like from the other side-- and it hurts. In fact, rarely has a game stung so much as this one. Adding to the catastrophe, who should have witnessed it but the hilariously derisive John Hart, who will never let me live this down.
