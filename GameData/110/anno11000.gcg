#note Would've played LAMBIESt if I was sure of it.

#note Rafi had this rack with another tile. He wasn't sure of PEERIE.
>Noah: CLNOOUY J2 CLOY +26 138
#note Also thought about COLY and UNCOY. I thought this was more defensive than COLY, but maybe UNCOY was actually correct here.

>Noah: ADHIRUV 14L VAI. +14 211
#note Not a great play. I can block well and score well by just playing DUH M1, which also keeps a better leave.
>Rafi: ?BGLNOR H4 GLOB.. +11 161
>Noah: DEHLORU M2 UH +20 231
#note I was setting up my D for a decent score. But I should play HO 12H, which blocks the best bingo lane on the board quite effectively, and scores just as well.
>Rafi: TW M6 TW.. +26 187
>Noah: DEEILOR 10I OE. +16 247
#note Would've played OLDIE if I was sure of it. Alas, I wasn't. Still, I should've played something else, but I didn't realize this made line 12 much easier to hit.
>Rafi: ?EGNRTY 12C RETYiNG +81 268
#note Like that.
>Noah: DEFILNR 1M DEF +28 275
#note I should play F(i)L G11, which I missed.

>Noah: EEILNRS M11 .LE. +8 307
#note EL I3 seems obviously wrong. EL 13C I like better though, because it makes Rafi harder to block line 15 effectively, and EINRRS isn't all that great for hitting bingos with.
