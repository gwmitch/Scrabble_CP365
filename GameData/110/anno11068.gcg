#note SAW, because I can at least come back with WIG next turn for 28.
>Ruchi_Gupta: NOW 7F WON +14 28
>Ryan_Fischer: GHIQRWY G6 Q..H +22 56
#note Don't get Q sometimes.  I planned for WIRY, but where does it expect me to go with GHQ if I don't take QOPH now?  Like FUCK, anytime you can play QOPH, it's usually the best play, what Quackle says be damned.

#note Figured I need to make something happen.  I have the A.  Why not?  8A AJ(E)E is safer, sure.

#note That was fortunate.  Only bingo, and couldn't have come at a better time.  Amazing I found it so easily.
>Ruchi_Gupta: CEILOP 4H POLICE +36 354
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EELNRV M3 V.NEREaL +72 425
#note So that was lucky, too.  Best is N2 NERVULE 79, then L(I)VEN or 4 other words hooking to make ANECDOTAL.  I guess because others are concerned with emptying the bag?  I don't see why since there are no danger letters and no place to bingo after that play. VENEREAL jumps to 3rd in the sim.
