#note G10 APO seemed wrong since bingo lines are scarce, and being down a little opening it up didn't seem like a terrible idea. This and K5 OAR, which I dislike for the same reasons as APO, are neck and neck at the top of the sim.

>Joel: EJTU 2A JUTE +24 193
>Mack_: EERTUYZ B6 ZEE +34 236
#note A very strange and difficult turn. I considered this, G5 ZEE, and C2 TUYER. The only tiles that could really hurt he at 8A are the F and H, and if Joel had one he may very well have used it at 2J. I'm not too worried about SER, since it will be hard for him to score a ton there without a bingo. With so many tiles still unseen, this seemed like a worthwile risk to take for 8 points ofer the other ZEE, and TUYER seemed way inferior with no great Z spots. This play is winning a sim by over 4%.
>Joel: ADL 8A D..A.L +24 217
>Mack_: AERRTUY 2J TEARY +27 263
#note I debated between this, K1 DREARY, and A2 JURY, the last of which I quickly rejected since the superior leave is not too useful on this board and it leaves the 2J spot open. I figured TEARY limited Joel's average score slightly more than DREARY due to the potential of FR- or DR- words after DREARY, and since DREARY gives a decent line down the L column if Joel has several Es. Plus, UR is slightly better than UT as a leave, so I figured TEARY was better; Quackle ranks the two roughly equally.
>Joel: CEHT M2 .ETCH +20 237
>Mack_: EEFORUV N6 OEUVRE +20 283
#note I like this play as it scores, blocks bingos, and turns over tiles for the blank. Quackle likes D1 OEUVRE, which I definitely disagree with.

>Mack_: GIOSTWX 1N OX +32 337
#note This play looked good, as it saves O11 TWIGS for next turn and the best Joel could possibly have is O11 tRANQ, which will almost certainly lose as I will be up a tempo in the endgame.
