>Morris: AENOORV --  -32 83
#note I am about to play NOVAE, then I see NAEVO* and think it's better defensively and slap it down. Then I realize my combination of a few words

To be fair, it doesn't take an S.

#note There is a play that is MUCH better than this. Matt asked me about it right after the endgame, he wasn't sure it was good but at least it popped into his head. I really wish I saw this possibility, I would've tried it.
>Matt_Graham: STV 11C V.ST +34 333
>Morris: ?EMRTUY 11I YUM +24 269
#note Didn't see MUs(K)ETRY, and chose this over Ud(O)METRY. This is better than both per Quackle sim.

However, YUM or YURT 6J and EMU N13 are all better options than this.
>Matt_Graham: OUZ 2H .UZO +33 366
>Morris: ?AENRTY 13G TANnERY +80 349
#note As Matt correctly analyzed after the game, bingoing almost never wins here. Playing off YEN 6J is the way to go.
>Matt_Graham: EEEFGNT 15A FEE. +30 396
#note 1K GENET
>Morris: ?AEITU 3J AdIEU +20 369
#note I mistracked and thought he had TONG left. This is bad...
>Matt_Graham: EGNT 4J GENT +31 427
#note Overall, I played this game pretty mediocrely, with NAEVO*, CHAIRLIFTS, and TANNERY being 3 of my largest mistakes in the tourney.
