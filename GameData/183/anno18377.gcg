#note Diane said after the game that she couldn't convince herself that G(I)VEABlE was a word. It worked out well for her, though.
>Morris: ?ADENNO 13C AND +19 92
#note Aargh, went through the alphabet for the blank, the problem with this is racing through WXYZ and missing the one bingo letter for the blank, the Y. I am a bit ANNOYED at myself for missing a play like ANODYNE.
>Diane_Firstman: AAQRSU K8 QUASAR +58 207
#note Held this for awhile, was not 100% on VERBIAGES, but made the right call.
>Morris: ?EMNOOT H1 MOONlET. +80 172
>Diane_Firstman: BEFLOOR 6E FOR.LOBE +67 274
>Diane_Firstman: BEFLOOR --  -67 207
#note Catching a break here.
>Morris: ACEHINN L3 ENCHAIN +90 262
>Diane_Firstman: BEFLOOR J10 B.L +23 230
#note It is probably better for Diane to break up the O's here since two of the main 8 lanes are through O's.
>Morris: AEGILOY G3 YO +20 282
#note Quackle suggests an awesome play, (H)OY 6L, setting up HOYA! Since I already know she has EFOOR and there is only 1 A and 1 S unseen to me, that is pretty awesome.
>Diane_Firstman: CEFOOR L12 CERO +26 256
>Morris: AEGIILL M11 LEI +18 300
#note Quackle sim likes L(O)GIA 15K slightly more than this, I am not sure I completely understand why, but Diane's next turn might help explain it a bit.
>Diane_Firstman: FGNO 15K G.NOF +27 283
>Morris: AEGILVY 6E GYV. +19 319
#note IVY F4. I missed that at the time.
>Diane_Firstman: OW 14N WO +25 308
>Morris: AAEIILX M2 AXE +40 359
#note Quackle likes ILIA 5B to set up a second X spot slightly more.
>Diane_Firstman: EJT 4D JET.. +24 332
>Morris: AIILORW M6 OW +23 382
#note LIRA K1.
>Diane_Firstman: TT 3K T..T +11 343
#note Smart play by Diane.
>Morris: AIILRTU N5 UTA +19 401
#note I thought this would easily be the top play, but Quackle suggested (A)IL 2M, another play that blocks bingos but also blocks plays like DISH or RESH, but leaves 1 in the bag and dumps an I! This is second, I completely missed AIL during the game. It's a difference of 93% win and 91% win.
>Diane_Firstman: DEHLRRS O1 RESH +45 388
>Morris: EIIILRZ I13 ZE. +23 424
#note ZI(T) K1, I was a bit low on time so I wanted to play it safe.
>Diane_Firstman: DLR 2H .LD +8 396
>Morris: IIILR 6E ....R +12 436
#note This is phony, before I played it I checked to make sure I would still win if she challenged at it wasn't good.
>Diane_Firstman: R E4 .R. +8 404
>Diane_Firstman:  (IIIL) +8 412
