#note I am not sure about the hooks on LONG. I'm 100% it takes an S (duh), I am about 60% it takes an E, and about 10-30% on two other hooks that are invalid. LONGE and LONGS are words, but I wanted to knock the spot out. I hate not knowing when hooks are good or not. 
>Lloyd_Mills: ACEENRT 4F CENT.ARE +72 106
#note CAROTENE is 78
>Matt_Canik: AEIOTYZ M2 OY.Z +32 66
#note I was right that OYEZ 3L was bad because of the Z placement, but I should hold the Y and just make a play down from H1- AZINE/AZON/ZEIN are all better.

>Lloyd_Mills: ARW 8L WA.R +33 200
>Matt_Canik: AABENOR 5C BOA +23 241
#note This was a tough turn between BOA and ABO or OBA at 11J. Either way I'm setting up a big spot for an A hook (ABO) but I am holding an A. This spot seems more condusive for me personally because I have no high-scoring tiles. Lloyd's next turn bingo % is down to 6% after this play too. That's cool (10-11 after the other placement). 

Sim wants me to play in the other spot by about 3 points. 
>Lloyd_Mills: AFIT 4A FIAT +39 239
>Matt_Canik: AEFLNRR 13I FERAL +45 286
#note Don't like the big S/T spot this sets up, but it's way too many points to pass on. 

Drawing SS? after this play seems like an optimal strategy. 
>Lloyd_Mills: AKO 11J OKA +36 275
>Matt_Canik: ?MNRSSV 6I V.M +8 294
#note Well I conveniently drew all remaining esses and the blank, so now that dangerous S hook is a big advantage. 

VIMS is the equity play but I don't want to telegraph the last S. 
>Lloyd_Mills: EIOV H1 OVI.E +24 299
>Matt_Canik: ?CNRSST C3 T...R +16 310
#note I had plays to set up my S in a TWS- T(ONE)R and N(ONE)T, but I was ust so afraid of him making a sick play to thwart them. TONER actually looks unblockable, NONET is partially blockable with (KOR)AI or something. I decided to take the safe option- I can bingo along 14 at some point unless the unlikely H(ONE)D or B(ONE)D comes down, and since I've done nothing much to telegraph my tiles at this point he won't have a compelling need to block them. 

C(AMA)S -> C(AMA)SS is a really cool setup but I need to know those words and he needs to not. He is lloyd mills, so he probably does. 
>Lloyd_Mills: DP G3 P.D +19 318

#note I am in slight danger of a Q stick after this, but with such a lead I don't actually think that's an issue. 
>Lloyd_Mills: R H14 .R +6 324
>Matt_Canik: EEHJLRY D12 YE.H +32 416
#note I think the fish is for QUINTI(C), so I need to block that.
