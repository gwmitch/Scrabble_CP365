#note After looking at this rack for about a minue, I had seen nothing but VAmAnOS. I didn't think it was a word but it was a popular enough expression that it would likelly fly. Well, I forgot that I was in Canada and people weren't familiar with Spanish stuff here. I designated both blanks and Trevor looked... well, about how you would expect someone to look if someone played a disgusting phoney that you'd never seen before with both blanks in it. He asked three separate times "this one is an M and this one is an N???' and finally accepted. His reaction after the game when he saw that it was phoney was priceless. 

BTW VAVASOR/AASVO(G)EL
