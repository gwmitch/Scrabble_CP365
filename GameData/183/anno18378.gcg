#note Quackle prefers ZAX F2, to me that seems like it gives back too much, but I do increase my bingo percentage by 15% next turn if I dump the X and Z in this way.

#note This is better than EXEC in the same spot because of the Ds still out.

#note I was choosing here between BI(Z) and CUBE(B) 12A, Quackle agrees with my choice.

>Morris: ?ACEKSU -  +0 231
#note I didn't know EPIBLAST, nor did I know UnCAKES 11I. I didn't see wAESUCK J9. I did see the possibilities of CUPCAKES and CAULKERS as 8s before his turn, and was a bit annoyed he had both a P and L to give me for them! The worse part about this though, is that strategically, this challenge is unideal. If I play (F)UCK instead of bingoing like I was planning too, I need to be less than 39% sure EPIBLAST is valid. I was pretty 50-50.

#note Still am blind to WAESUCK.

>Morris: ?AEHOST O2 SHOlATE +94 351
>Morris: ?AEHOST --  -94 257
#note Yeah, I don't even want to talk about all of the reasons why this is absolutely dreadful.
>Sal_Piro: AILRU 11I URIAL +12 346
>Morris: ?AEHOST 10I HOSTAgE +77 334
#note Since I still think SHOLATE* is the word in AEHLOST, I don't see LOATHES 10H. This still is a bit better though. However, playing (R)O(V)E 4I for 20 is pretty close to HOSTAgE here. It gives me a very legitimate shot at hitting a row O bingo for a bunch of points, which I really need here.
>Sal_Piro: ADELNT O7 LAT.NED +27 373
#note This is as good as a play as any for Sal, he told my after the game the blank was in the bag. He is 97% to win here.
>Morris: AAEFHIO B4 FA.E +9 343
#note I missed his 1 out play, so Quackle doesn't like this, though it's hard to see.
>Sal_Piro: ?DELOR 13B REDs +28 401
#note He missed ROw(E)LED B9, as did I.
>Morris: AHIO 13J OHIA +31 374
#note Overall, I made 2 serious errors. Challenging EPIBLAST reflects my poor word knowledge, but it was also just bad strategically for me to do. SHOLATE* is one of my worst mistakes in quite awhile, I really blew this game.
