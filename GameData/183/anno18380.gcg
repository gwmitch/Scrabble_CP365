#note Quackle likes L(E)G or G(E)L about the same as this. CEORS is a very strong leave.

>Morris: CEEOPRS 1A COP.ER +30 40
#note After SHOLATE* yesterday, I begin to doubt my word knowledge a bit, and decide that this is only marginally worse than PRECO(D)ES. If only I saw PROCEE(D)S...

>Morris: DEIISTT H8 .TITIDES +80 120
#note And like a luckbox, I still draw into a bingo.
>Brandon_Randall: AGINORY H1 GO.Y +36 126
#note Brendan told me after the next game that he missed GYRA(T)ION here. Lucky break.
>Morris: AFHIJNW 13F HA.J +24 144
#note Didn't see (K)ANJI, and everying else that scores points has clunky leaves. This bingos most often of all of my scoring plays next turn at a whopping 4.5%, but the bigger point of this play is that I can very likely dump my bad tiles next turn while scoring, with a play like WAIF/HADJI. I think either this or KANJI is best, I don't see why Quackle likes the uber-defensive HAW G12 or HADJI in the same spot better than this.

#note GEN(E) 14E is a bit better according to Quackle.
>Brandon_Randall: BE E10 .BE +32 336
>Morris: AENRSUX C10 .AXER +30 308
#note With both blanks out at this point, I need to score and burn more tiles. I chose to keep the N over the R to play in column N, even though there are 2 N's out and only 1 R. It's close between WAXEN and WAXER, Quackle prefers WAXEN by about 3%, but these are both more than 5% ahead of any other play.

#note Luckbox.
>Brandon_Randall: AEHR B11 HARE +34 386
#note Brandon hated making this play, but he has few options here.
>Morris: ?AEMOWZ A10 MAZE +63 451
#note Brandon played an excellent game overall, and I am lucky chickening out on PRECODES didn't cost me the game. I also just drew everything.
