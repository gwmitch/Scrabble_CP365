#note Couldn't think of GHIBLI D7, which scores 24.  That this sims in the top third of the list is less a reflection of the quality of this play (frankly, this sucks), and more of an indication of how limited my choices are.  If you whiff on GHIBLI, all the other choices are quite lame.  Not sure how I missed LUBING F4 (all I saw was BULLING), but I did.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACCLPSY -ACCL +0 26
>Jim_Burlant: ?BBILNT E7 B.B +7 15
#note Again, no great options.  Q says I should play off the L with BULB either here or at 5G....I dunno, both of those seem a bit too risky.  Given my limited options I'm okay with this.

#note I've been working night shift for the last few weeks and thus have not been able to attend club since early June.  While I've played games against Quackle, Facebook Scrabble, and a handful of Words-With-Friends games, this was the first time in over a month that I was playing over a live board, and the rust was beginning to show.  While my best choices here are limited to which 66-point bingo I can find on row 4, I was so fixated on eliminating vowel placement issues that I just completely spaced on the fact that I was stopping one slot short of a double-word.  A sim confirms what I suspected looking at the kibbitzer options:  VIGILANT 4F  (I never saw this possibility) is best. What surprises me is that the sim thinks this is just as good; I think this is way too dangerous.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AIORSTU L4 SAUTOIR +84 119
#note Small consolation:  if I'd played LIGATION or VIGILANT, he'd have still had this word at C8 for 76.
>Jim_Burlant: AGINOOZ 10D OOZING +44 125
#note The other play I considered was 8K GONZO, which I rejected due to the AIO leave.  This is the clear sim winner, at just shy of 43%.  Despite the scoreboard points given up, 3B and 3C ZOO are also strong choices in the duck's eyes.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEY 11J AYE +20 139
>Jim_Burlant: AACGMNO 8K C.NGA +24 149
#note Apparently I should have looked a little harder to groom the rack.  Q says I should have played 3B COMA or CAMO for 22 to groom the rack a little.  I was more concerned about his hitting easy points at 8O.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?CEINOT O8 .CONITEs +80 219
#note Play incorrectly scored as 83.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEFMO 5K F.ME +26 175
#note For reasons that make no sense to me now, I thought it would be necessary to open another triple so there would be multiple scoring threats, and I do have the D to hook it, or so my thinking went.  The problem with Quackle's preferred play of OAF N12 is that it kills lines that I need to stay open.  There's no reason not to play 14J DEFAME here.  Not that I'm in great shape by any means (best play here barely wins 14%) but this doesn't help.  This wins 11% and sims nearly 8 points down.   
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: OW N10 WO +28 247
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEIKO 3C OKE +22 197
#note I actually toyed with NAZI F8 so I could follow it up with HOOKED D8 on the following turn to open another line, but felt that this opened the top half of the board and maximized my leave.  And if I can draw the X or get *something* going, this would give me a shot.  Q indicates it's  either this or 3E OAK or 3C AKEE.  10-1/2% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AI F8 .A.I +17 264
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEILT H10 .AILED +24 221
#note Sad but true: I saw LATED but chickened out on it, and never thought of AILED, which would have definitely been best.  That said, the outlook is still bleak:  AILED O1 wins 15%, this wins 10-1/2.  Still treading water.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADDEF O1 FADED +44 308
#note Just desserts.
>Jim_Burlant: EEHNTTV B2 ETH +20 241
#note Trying to keep the board alive and hopefully draw into something.  I realized that keeping the V was obviously more negative than keeping the H, but my issue with VET was that it would be too easy for him to block with AVE/EVE, and if I didn't draw an S, my opening would be blocked.  My thinking was that it was better to sacrifice a little leave and give myself the guaranteed hook for row 1.  Q says this is the wrong execution of the right idea, saying that VET B1 was the play.  VET wins 4%, this wins 2.

>Jim_Burlant: EJMNSTV 12C JETS +36 277
#note Throwing in the towel.  Yes, I see the unseen O's...and frankly I'm beyond caring at this point.  Between my questionable plays and poor draws, this one is beyond any hope and I'm just moving tiles.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ASW 12J WAS +40 384
>Jim_Burlant: MNQRRVX J3 Q. +11 288
#note When your luck is out, it's really out.  Drawing the I instead of a duplicated R would have helped; while it wouldn't have been enough to win, MIREX N2 would have scored 73 and stemmed the bleeding.  Instead I have to dump the Q for a whopping 11 points and will not be able to go out before Sam.

>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DEOSU 14A DO.E +39 451
>Jim_Burlant: MRRV N4 R.V +16 340
#note My gut says that, best case, I'm losing by 60 or 70 points.   If you look at the draws I was getting, even if I'd played the correct tiles off on turn N, the racks on turn N+1 still would have left me in the realm of routine with no bingoes or big power tile bombs that would have allowed me to get back into the game.  While I'm not copping a plea for any number of questionable choices I made, this one wasn't going to be a win no matter what I did.  But I never should have lost this badly.
