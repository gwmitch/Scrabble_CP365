#note COZENERs is a safer option, but given that Debbie just drew 6 random tiles it seems worth it to take the 12 additional points.

#note As ugly as the leave is, I don't really have any other good options here.
>Debbie: IINNOTV 9C .IN. +24 274
>Mack_: AABBFGT 7K FAB +23 293
#note While this could backfire severely if Debbie has an H, M, or K, I figured based on her play of ZINE that she kept mostly if not all one pointers, and definitely not a W or K. As it turns out FAB backfired, but it still looks correct. 14G ABAFT, the other alternative I debate, is simming better but that does not take the above inference into account.
>Debbie: IKNOTVW 8L WONK +62 336
>Mack_: ABGOORT 9M BOA +26 319
#note Since I am only down twenty points, I don't really mind closing down the N and O columns. No other options stand out, and this looks fine.
>Debbie: AHIITVV B4 VIVA +21 357
>Mack_: AEGLORT 1H .ATERLOG +89 408
#note Funnily, I was actually thinking when I was drawing tiles after BOA, "Wow, wouldn't it be fortuitious if I drew something like WATERLOG out of the bag," and then sure enough...
>Debbie: DEHIIT? 10N HE +34 391
>Mack_: EEJLRRU 14E JEU +27 435
#note Since the seven line above JEU is harder to hit than that after JEER in the same spot, and as JEU maintains the last E, JEU looks best.
>Debbie: DIIINT? E5 .I +14 405
#note At this point, the available bingo lines are row 3 from the N, row I hooking EXACTAS, and row 13 hooking US. The last of these seemed the most dangerous with two Ms and an N unseen, and column 3 seemed least potent. Since no five letter word exists from H8, I can't blockboth column I and row 13, and thus I must choose. This or URUS appear to be the best plays that block row 13G, and I decided on this to avoid exposing the U as well. While OUR exposes the R, starting a bingo with an R is not terribly easy especially with no Es out. The lack of Es was also the reason I decided against HOE in the same spot, as I don't want to give Debbie an E with none unseen. 
>Mack_: EHLORRU G10 OUR +5 440
#note At this point, my highest priority must be preventing as many of Debbie's bingos as possible. The available bingo lanes are row 13, row 3, and column I hooking EXACTAS. Row 3 is definitely the hardest to hit as an N isn't particularly easy to start a bingo with, and with two Ms and an N out row 13 looks easiest to use. Unfortunately no 5 letter word exists from H8, so I can't block both row 13 and column I. This looks better than HUE in the same spot, as I don't want to float an E with none unseen, and also better than HER to keep a better leave. URUS floats an additional tile so looks worse, but is this best? There doesn't appear to be a superior solution, but definitely a tricky position.

#note This gives back 11K MOR, so I7 USHER is 12 better.
