#note I looked for a while for nines through ET, but found none (none exist, but I am actually close to a really cool one if it was AT, and not ET. can you find it?) This is as good as it gets here.
>Brandon: DEW 8A WED. +24 92
>Brandon: DEW --  -24 68
>Mack_: AENOORW 8A WOO.R +26 122
#note Knowing three of Brandon's tiles, I decided against 7J WOO since it gave him WOOD and K5 WOOF since it gave him a good W spot at J6. Quackle agrees with the inference.
>Brandon: DEEW L4 WEED. +24 92
>Mack_: AAELNQV J7 Q.. +12 134
#note I think I got too greedy here, thinking I might draw into 3A AVELLANE next turn. Quackle actually wants me to play through with plays like M1 NAVEL, but those plays definitely look wrong to me and in hindsight I think exchanging QVA looks best.
>Brandon: DDMPU 5H DUMP.D +24 116

>Brandon: AJ 2B JA. +18 145
>Mack_: AGIMNTU 4A MU +16 212
#note Didn't notice EDIFYING, which is clearly best. This is a fairly large mistake, but it worked out.

#note 3H VERITY is a cool play I missed that is winning the sim, but at this point I am winning over 99.5% either way.

>Mack_: ACEORRT N1 CARE +24 460
#note I mistakenly thought the bag was empty here, so I could actually fish for ANCHORET. Brandon would just block though, so this looks OK.

#note 10F HO wins by 2 more.
