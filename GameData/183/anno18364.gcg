#note Just a note: This tournament is on a 20 minute clock and Mark, a historically slow player, is already down under half of his time. I know he generally takes a long time to find bingos. I'm fastplaying him HARD now.

#note I only remember 6 tiles here. Regardless, NAEVO(ID) or VO(ID) or this was a tough decision. Since I think WON doesn't take an S, I think I'd have the board all but locked down with VOID, but it'd be quite easy for him to open back up. AVOID doesn't let too many bingos play- few 7s end in an tile that will front hook an A. Still, probably should just play VOID.

#note AVOID vs NAEVOID vs OVOID vs VOID. 

I chose AVOID because I wanted to hold fewer vowels than with VOID, and it's still fairly defensive because not many 7s end in a tile that can front hook an A. Remember, I think WONS is invalid so I think I have the board locked down here.

#note Not afraid of holding double As because there are none left. Want to turn over tiles and create a scoring spot on the board. 
>Mark_Edelson: ?DELRST J3 DaRTLES +66 276
#note Shoot. Mark wouldn't play this if it didn't take an S, especially with STRUDEL available. He's down under two minutes now. 
>Matt_Canik: AABIRSX 12D AX +27 339
#note Can't really find a good way to close of the lines up top except (R)AX. Let's just hope he didn't pull a bingo out of the bag (or if he did, can't see it in time).
