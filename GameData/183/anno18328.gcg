>Andy: AIOSUXY J6 YU. +18 18
#note YUKO or OXY/YELK seem better then just playing YUK. Or even YOU/YELK setting up for the X.

>Hubert: AEIQSTT 7F QAT +15 85
#note I know this doesnt matter too much in this game BUT there is a difference to playing QAT/TE or QAT/ET. Of course in this case since the Q is involved, you'd want to avoid the QI hook by playing ET. But supposing QAT is something else, you play QAT/ET if you want to be more blocky and QAT/TE if u want to be more open. (TE takes more back hooks then ET's front hooks.) You never know, it could matter. Also of course just see the tiles remaining to check which play gives u more options next turn.
>Andy: ADGIISY 8C YAGI +20 120
#note WOFS/SAIYID or SAYID if you dont wanna risk fishing. Otherwise DIYA/YUKY orYAGI/YUKU or YAGI/QI works.
>Hubert: ?EINSTT O4 STINTEd +82 167
#note There is a nice interlocking RETINTS play at 9B though it only scores 2 more points anyway.

>Andy: CGHORRV D1 CHOG +36 342
#note Might want to possibly keep the H for later to aid in damage dealing by playing CROG instead. But either VOUCH or CHOG are good plays.

>Andy: AFINRRV B4 RIF +33 375
>Hubert: AIJLNNN J11 .INJA +28 374
#note Might want to play LINNS at 9D if you want to preserve vowels at this point. Hubert's actual play did however block Andy's bingo. (Looking at the tiles left, a bingo is actually fairly likely honestly)
>Andy: AGINPRV 2G P.RV +17 392
#note Preserving vowels i guess. Otherwise just PAV/MOP is the best play.
>Hubert: DLNNPTV 8L V.N. +15 389
#note Pretty much all that can be done
