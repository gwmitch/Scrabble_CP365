#note The only plays that score 59 instead slot an R in the TWS. No thanks. May also pull a ''misdesignated'' challenge here. 
>Dave_Krook: AP 10F PA. +24 81
>Matt_Canik: ABEEHLN H1 ENHAL. +30 193
#note His last play makes him more likely than average to have an A, so I was wary to play HAEN 5K because he can stack back for a good score quite often. 
>Dave_Krook: AGNORST L6 .STRAGON +70 151
#note Dave was mad at himself when right after he hit his clock
>Matt_Canik: BCENOPR 3C BRONC. +32 225
#note I knew this was phoney, but I didn't see any other decent options (overlooking PONCE C9). It's really irritating when lower-rated players never hold or challenge anything, and I feel like I need to keep people honest by doing things like this from time to time. 
>Dave_Krook: AIX 8L .AXI +33 184
>Matt_Canik: DENNPTW M12 WEND +25 250
#note C12 makes a lot more sense. I saw NEWT at C10 but not WEND on that side. Good job matt.
>Dave_Krook: BJ K5 J.B +29 213
#note Man I'm glad I played that phoney, Dave just will not stop scoring.
