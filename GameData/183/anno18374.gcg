>Morris: AIRSSTT N1 STRAITS +79 79
#note Quackle likes TSARIST N2 a bit better, I am not crazy about any of the three (STRAITS, ARTISTS, or TSARIST), they all give back a bunch. I like STRAITS and ARTISTS better though since it will now be harder to use the bottom right quadrant of the board, and with a 43 point lead, I like that.

#note QUALMI(S)h!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>Morris: ADEJRSZ L1 ZA.RE +48 127
#note 1L JE(S)S looks a bit better, I missed it.
>Wally_Schultz: CHIOORS 1G CHORI.O. +66 210
#note Wally mentioned he wished I stuck the Z out a bit farther left, so he could've had the bingo. This is still pretty sweet, but he did miss 5E ISOCHOR(E) for 102 and 9H ISOCHOR for 75. I knew neither, but once again, I am lucky he only found a 66 point play.
>Morris: ?DEEJSU 5J JE. +20 147
#note http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=15302

I wished we had a 1 turn interlude so I could have play DEJESUs.

>Morris: ?DEGHSU G8 .HUG +12 159
#note I missed HEDG(Y) 9H, which is a bit better.

>Morris: ?DEGINS 4C SEnDING +85 244
>Wally_Schultz: DNW 9K W.ND +12 318
#note Wally put this down then picked it up, then put it down again. I think he realized in between all of the S's and blanks were gone.
>Morris: AAEEIOP H12 .IAO +18 262
#note Quackle suggests AE 6I instead, I wanted to open more bingo lanes. I am under 7% to win according to 4 ply Quackle sim at this point (which has error, but a fairly good estimate still).
>Wally_Schultz: BEW 11J WEB +29 347
>Morris: AAEEENP 6I AE +24 286
#note Under 5% to win.
>Wally_Schultz: DE 3C ED +13 360
>Morris: AEELMNP 13L MAP +25 311
#note I considered a lot of plays here. Ultimately, I think my best chance of winning is either bingoing twice, or getting an X play at F9 and then bingoing. That's why EM F9 is a no go here, though Quackle digs it.
>Wally_Schultz: ADEGILN D3 ..LEADING +64 424
>Morris: EEILNTX -  +0 311
#note Sweet find by Wally. DELEADS is just outside of my range ofbingoes going into the tournament. I had never seen it before. According to amany ply Quackle sim, if I play EX here I win 5% of the time, and if I pass(challenge unsucessfully) I win 1% of the time. If I challenge successfully, Iwin 58% of the time. Doing out the expected values, I need to be at least 91%sure DELEADING is good to not challenge here. I was definitely not that sure, so I am fine with challenging this.

>Morris: EEILNTX F9 EX +55 366
>Wally_Schultz: AIKN 15A KINA +33 476
#note Wally correctly identified that this will outrun any potential bingo. He misscored it as 35.
>Morris: EILNRTU 15H .UTLINER +77 443
#note I am lucky I lost by only 17 as Wally made some really great plays that made it hard for me to catch up. The challenge is a mistake obviously, but I think given my word knowledge, I made the correct call there strategically.
