BAIRN over BRAIN too.

#note MUTATIVE.
Simple word.
Not sure why Leon doesnt want to play D1 VATU.
>Michael: BDEOSST I5 BOSSED +30 213
#note G10 ODS or 1A STOVED or 2B DOABS if you want to just keep a bingo possible next turn. BOSSED is fine too i guess but seems like a bit of a waste of 2 esses. Especially when Leon can easily score high next turn with the open O
>Leon: ACEGIIT 5G CE.IA +18 128
#note Just now i was carrying on with the game as if VATU were positioned differently. VATU in the other position would allow for more options, but now options are really limited. 
I guess VIG might not be too bad here.
>Michael: AMOOQTW 4J QAT +37 250
#note Probably never challenged CEBIA* because the Q gets an easy home.
>Leon: DGINOTT J9 DOTTING +71 199
>Michael: LMOOOUW 15H MO.UL +27 277
>Leon: ACORRUY 3K CURRY +27 226
#note H1 COURE or 12H OUTCRY or even 14C OARY seem better then CURRY. Think OUTCRY might not be the best idea because of its blocky nature. So play COURE despite leaving the Y in your rack. CURRY has a bad leave with so many E's left and gives Michael an opportunity to score high which is something you want to avoid when behind.

#note Maybe not playing K10 WOE because it is a bit blocky.
>Michael: EEENRTU 13G RET.NUE +18 357
#note Dumping for the blank. Good.
>Leon: AEHPRSY K9 HYE +36 322
#note Maybe can play YA/AHA at 11B, opening up a 2nd line in the form of -ERS for yourself. Gotta hope to draw a bingo with a leave of PHERS though. Not really hard if you get a vowel but still. OR you can go yolo by playing PHRASY or PHRASE (simple word)/ RETINUES to score big and hope to pull the J or blank (You should be able to catch alteast one of them as it is unlikely for Michael to get both from his dump). In this kind of situation, you have to either dump big or open more lines. HYE doesnt do either.
>Michael: ?AEEGIM 2L MAE +21 378
#note MAGE or MEGA or MAGI at 12L is preferred because a bingo becomes really unlikely then.
>Leon: ALNOPRS 6B PL.. +12 334
#note PSORALEN! SIMPLE WORD!

Anyway it wasnt the best idea to empty the bag with the J unseen. Your only logical hope is to play PUS and hope that Michael drew the J off his last play. You already know that Michael does not have the J when he played MAE as JOE or JEE in the same spot would be clearly better. As such, there is a chance that the J is still in the bag and emptying the bag could be disastrous. I dont think Leon can win either way but this concept does still apply to other games. DO NOT EMPTY THE BAG IF IT CAN RESULT IN A VERY BAD SITUATION (unless u really have no choice)
>Michael: ?AEGINR B2 REtA.ING +70 448
>Michael:  (challenge) +5 453
#note I dont know if PSORALEN could have given Leon the game.Maybe if JF were not the last tiles left in the bag.
