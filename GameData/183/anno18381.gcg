>Morris: ?EEIOVW 8G WOVE +20 20
#note MG: I had a tough time choosing 8G or 8E placement. Quackle agrees.
>Mack_Meller: BCINTWX K5 TWIN +25 25
#note MM: As awkward as this looks, it is better than exchangingand there isn't much else to do.
>Morris: ?AEEFIT 5E FETErI.A +70 90
#note MM: Nice find by Morris -- this is the only playable bingo.
>Mack_Meller: BCLRRUX 4L BRUX +50 75
>Morris: AENNOQY O4 .ENON +36 126
#note MG: I was choosing between XENON and Q(U)AY N3. I chose this since it doesn't give nearly as much back and if I land an A, I still have AQ(U)A in the same spot. The sim agrees, though likes ONY(X) a bit better, which I completely missed.
>Mack_Meller: CHJKLRS J7 H.CK +28 103
#note MM: I debated between this and F4 JERK, but decided on this to score more and set up my S. Quackle agrees.
>Morris: AAEOQSY N2 AQ.AE +38 164
>Mack_Meller: FGJLRRS -FGJLR +0 103
#note MM: Unfortunately, I think I have to trade.

MG: Fortunately, I think Mack has to trade.
>Morris: AGOSUYY 4F YAY +29 193
>Mack_Meller: AIIIRST -II +0 103
#note MM: Being down 90, I definitely don't like 11E IRITIS or 10H TIKI. This is winning the sim comfortably.

MG: One other close option here is exchanging all three I's. Although STAIR is a better leave for a bingo, Mack has to catch me by bingoing and then outrunning me by probably more than 50 points after I make my next play. Why not hope I get stuck with a bunch of I's and O's left? I still think exchanging II is better, but it is still an interesting thought.
>Morris: ADGOSSU 3C GAUDS +27 220
>Mack_Meller: ADIORST C3 .ORDITAS +62 165
>Morris: EINOORS 8A OO. +9 229
#note MG: Yeah, I somehow missed EROSION. I have no idea how that happened...
>Mack_Meller: EEJLTUV 7B J.VE +23 188
>Morris: EIILNRS 11D INLIERS +78 307
>Mack_Meller: DEELTUU H11 .LUDE +21 209
#note MM: This leave isn't great, but I've got to open it up.
>Morris: HINOPRT 4A PO.H +34 341
>Mack_Meller: BEEINTU A1 BEE. +24 233
#note MM: To have any hope of winning, I will need two bingos so must create as many spread out bingo lanes as possible.

MG: One other interesting option is E(A)U 9B, to go for OBEDIENT/BEAU A8. I think I may slightly prefer that.
>Morris: INORSTZ 12A ZINS +50 391
#note MG: Good thing Mack is a better player than me and doesn't play E(A)U.
>Mack_Meller: AFINOTU A12 .ONA +39 272
>Morris: EELMORT 15C TELOM.RE +61 452
#note MG: I am winning 100% of the time now on a many Quackle sim.
>Mack_Meller: ?DFIPTU 6F DIP +35 307
>Morris: AAGILMT 14H .AM +24 476
#note MG: Mack played a great game, and I got really lucky. I played sloppily by missing EROSION completely (if I did record that rack right). I am happy at least Mack bingoed out, this was a pretty cruelly lopsided game, and it knocked Mack out of contention.
