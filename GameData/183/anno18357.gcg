#note Just one game, I would like to not fuck up the first turn against Jackson. ALFA. 
>Jackson_Smylie: GIIJNST 7G J.ISTING +76 76
#note karma's a bitch

>Matt_Canik: AAILLNS 6N AL +9 21
#note LANITAL takes an S!?!?! FUCK. JAIL is nice too. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ABDRRST I5 DR.B +11 87
#note J: I had a reason not to play DRAB. I don't remember it. 
>Matt_Canik: AILNOSZ 5N ZA +26 47
#note I saw OZALI(D), AZON, ZA, (D)IAZO. Couldn't figure out what to play. Q likes OZALID by about a point and a half.

#note FOET(AL) seems like a better play. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ?CCEORT 11B CROChET +80 281
>Matt_Canik: ADEELOO H11 ...ED +39 219
#note (TAX)OL is likely a little better, I want to hold more prone here. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ELMOQRU 14D ROQU. +34 315
#note This or QU(I)RE?
>Matt_Canik: AABELOO 15A ALOE +18 237
#note BA(ROQUE) is way better. Just didn't notice it. OBOE is also better.

>Matt_Canik: ?BDHIWY 8A WHI. +36 326
#note I am pretty much not bingoing now, but *maybe* can catch him. 
>Jackson_Smylie: EEGMNRS E5 GEMS +27 379
#note kills stuff, leaves 4 unseen. I wuld do GERMS instead though. 

He balked on GERMENS. 
>Matt_Canik: ?ABDOWY 2M DOW +28 354
#note WAB N4 sets up my Y on the opposite side. Maybe I can catch him with that, but it's still a long shot. 
>Jackson_Smylie: EEHNPRT 1E THE. +11 390
#note Scared of off-chance bingos to the N. I don't think he considered that I could outrun him after this...
>Matt_Canik: ?AABEVY 7B AB +19 373
#note I spent a LONG time on this. I went down to <2:00. I realized that if I held jAYVE(E) as an out and Jackson misplayed his endgame, I *might* be able to win. If he made the (seemingly) obvious play of PER(I), then I would lose by 1 and could maybe win on a recount. Q says I can't win against a perfect opponent...
>Jackson_Smylie: ENNPR J9 PER. +18 408
#note PRE(E) is quite a bit better, but he didn't see JAYVEE
>Matt_Canik: ?AEVY 3C jAYVE. +30 403
#note No dice on the recount, Jackson is quite skilled at math. Oh, what's that? It's not math, it's arithmetic? Ok, Jackson is good at arithmetic.
