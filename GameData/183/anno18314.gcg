>Mack_: AACDINO D8 .AONIC +24 24
#note Aargh, missed 9D ANODIC, which is clearly better and sims 2% ahead.

>Morris: HOPR 13A POR.H +24 72
>Mack_: DEOPRTU A11 UP.ED +39 86
#note Or TUPPED, but I wanted to keep the better leave and try for a bingo as soon as possible.

#note Static hates this and likes B9 METEOR, but this rockets to the top of the sim.

#note Was about to play 5J GOTHIC then saw this, which is clearly better.
>Morris: EEJZ 5J JEEZ +50 259
>Mack_: CILNOTT M3 CO. +28 262
#note 9C TAROC is slightly better to unduplicate my Ts.
>Morris: EVW 4L W.VE +32 291
>Mack_: AILNOTT 13I ALOIN +28 290
#note This seemed like too many points to forgo. Another advantage of ALOIN is that it turns over more tiles for the blank. Quackle prefers 10A TO by 7%, but this still looks fine to me.
>Morris: DGRU B3 DRUG +22 313
>Mack_: ?IIQTTX O1 QuI.T +39 329
#note My choices here were QuIET, change QXIT, and postmortem I thought of EXIsT/EXITs to set up the Q. After QuIET, I will be in good shape if Morris does not have QUIETEST/QUIETERS/QUIETENS, as I am quite likely to pick up QUIETIST. My bingo percentage after exchanging is a whopping 67% though. The Q setup of EXIsT looks hard to block, but it is a fairly strange play and will probably draw a red flag and prompt Morris to block, after which I will be in serious trouble. This play is definitely a really tough call, and the main factors to consider are definitely my bingo percentage after exchanging, Morris's likelihood of having an extension to QuIET, and his likelihood of blocking the Q setup. In hindsight I think I like exchanging, but I'm definitely not sure.
>Morris: ERS O1 .....ERS +48 361
>Mack_: AEILLTX G1 LAX +40 369
#note This looks OK, as AX gives back too much. LEX may actually be a tad better since there is an E but no A out.
>Morris: GNOSTWY B8 GOWN +18 379
#note As it turns out I would have drawn I(N)SOLATE after LEX, but it still loses to WOGS in this spot followed by 6L TYNE.
>Mack_: EEILOST H1 OSE +31 400
#note Nothing wins.
