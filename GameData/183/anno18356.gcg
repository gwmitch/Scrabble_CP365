#note Not a good play. Q likes (C)HIRM, postgame matt/jackson prfer HIM H13. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AEINSTZ 4H S.NATIZE +88 251
#note Jackson: I was fairly sure this was phoney, but felt I had to play it to get back in this game. I remembered a word similar to this, and thought maybe SANATIZE* was good (I was thinking of SANATIVE). 

Matt: WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR ME TO CHALLENGE JACKSON. this is as phoney as they get and I just couldnt do it.

#note What to do on a turn like this? I dunno, but Q doesn't like this. I've botched this game six ways from Sunday. (S)PORULE seems smarter.

#note I should bingo after this play. will it score enough?
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EMNOVW O6 WOVE +35 423
>Matt_Canik: ?AAEGIS 10C .A +2 355
#note Another horrible mistake. ASSEGaI. I saw AAEGISS and it looked familiar and then was like "oh that's AEGISES, nvm". No, it's ASSEGAI. As it turns out, I would have lost after ASSEGAI. But if I'm not bingoing, this is good because it blocks QI or QUID at B9. I think it's good, at least.
