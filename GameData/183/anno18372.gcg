#note Either this or BOW 10B. With the lead of 91, I thought this was the safer play.
>Michael_Ecsedy: AP A14 PA +24 124
>Morris: BEGGMUV 10B GEM +21 239
#note This is better than exchanging.

>Morris: BGHOSUV J2 BOUGHS +32 271
#note I was choosing between BOUGHS and VUGHS in the same spot, lots of things are good here with a 130ish lead.
>Michael_Ecsedy: EIINQRT 4G INQ.IET +34 169
#note Michael's actual rack. Q(U)IN looks a bit better since he keeps a stronger to and has the T for the QUINT hook.

#note I think Michael is fishing for a bingo at this point, and has one of the 2 S's. I thought it was less likely he had an A, but perhaps he is a very set-uppy player and is setting up an AVOW play instead of playing A(V)OW last turn. This might be a mistake if my inferences were lousy.
>Michael_Ecsedy: JO C3 JO +41 258
#note ...So that's why he played VOW! I guess he is a set-uppy player.
>Morris: AAENRUU 1A AURA +26 379
#note I just found it hilarious I drew the last two A's after creating a lane for them the previous turn, with two tiles. Absurdity that pretty much describes my luck throughout this tourney.
>Michael_Ecsedy: IR I11 RI. +8 266
>Morris: ELNORSU A1 .LEURONS +77 456
#note I am really skilled at picking tiles. My strategy towards this is usually:

1. Draw tiles from bag
2. Place on rack

As practice, I suggest when baking, draw a cup of sugar or flour out of the respective jar, and then place into mixing bowl. Analyze the results, and then try to improve. Another approach is doing a sort of wax-on, wax-off approach per Mr. Miyagi, except somehow relating that to Scrabble tiles. A third way is to just draw tiles in games, but that seems silly to me.
