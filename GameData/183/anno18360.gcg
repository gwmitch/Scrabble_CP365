#note I was BULBAR but wasn't 100% sure it was good. BUBU sims above anyway.

#note L1 UVEA sims best by 1.9 points. This does beat VAGUER, which I gave a lot of thought to. I played this on top insead of on bottom to create the extra line at 9A.

#note Very worried Gabe has pulled an S now. Didn't see ELEVENT(H). (K)ETENE is also a good play.

#note Actual rack.

#note Draw NW, play NW. Maybe should play LAWN instead but so much junk in the pool.

#note Oh hey, it's this rack again. This time I actually see the bingo, but it's probably best *not* to play it. Q likes EL(V)E(R) or NE(V)E(R) or LE(V)E(R) over this. But Gabe blocks those lines way more than Q, so maybe that's still wrong.

#note I set down YIMPY 3A and Gabe clutched his chest a little as he saw me making an out. It's probably Collins.
