I'm very mad and will likely play really badly this game. Let's go.

#note ATTICI(Z)E. Didn't know it. I joked after the game that this was the best rack I'd pull all game. Didn't realize it actually bingoed!

#note This, in addition to being a bad play, is apparently not a word. CANITIES must be CANITIES, and the plural is still CANITIES.

#note He said he didn't have the U when he played this. Props to him for finding a way to shed the Q, even if he needed some luck to get there. Clever play by a clever kid. He's got a bright future in this game.
