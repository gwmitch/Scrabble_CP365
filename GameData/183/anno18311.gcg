#note This seems worth it over QI or exchanging.

>Mack_: AGLNNOX D11 AXON +46 175
#note This is so much better equity-wise that it seems worth it despite giving back the E hook.
>Mike: EFKS 15A KEFS +49 134
>Mack_: EGJLNOS B9 JO +27 202
#note K4 JOGS is the other choice I considered, but with so many Is out this leave seemed very strong.
>Mike: EIT E8 .ITE +18 152
>Mack_: CEGLNSW K3 CLEWS +34 236
#note Since ALULA doesn't take an S, the S is not particularly useful on this board so I decided to play it for 10 more points. Quackle concurs.
>Mike: ??AEGOS A1 .OyAGErS +83 235
>Mack_: AAEFGIN 3I FA.IA +28 264
#note I liked this over FACING to keep a more balanced leave and since there were 4 Is out, but I didn't realize until after my move that I held the last As. That is probably why FACING sims 2% better than this.
>Mike: IPT F1 TIP +24 259
>Mack_: CDDEGNR N1 CRED +25 289
#note I had no clue what to do here. G6 CHAD is an intereting choice I overlooked, and in hindsight it looks best. This sims just under 5% down, and as it turns out I was in serious trouble anyway, but CHAD definitely looks better.
>Mike: EEEILST O4 EELIEST +78 337
>Mack_: DGINNUZ I10 ZING +27 316
#note I considered J2 ZA but that only draws a playable bingo with the one remaining E (ENDUING at I9) and Mike is fairly likely to block, so this seemed better. Quackle thinks ZA wins 17% and this 12%, but I'm not sure I agree.
>Mike: EPU 1L PU.E +33 370
>Mack_: DDHINRU 1F .HUD +24 340
#note -4 to 11H HIRUDIN, but I didn't know for sure if ALULAR was good.
