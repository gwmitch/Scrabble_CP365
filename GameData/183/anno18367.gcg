>Brandon_Randall: ??ADIOW 8D WOADIng +76 76
#note I was 95% sure this was phony, but I saw WOoDsIA and mIAOWeD so I let it go. Stupid mistake.
>Morris: AAFIORT 7I OAF +10 10
#note I was still a little rattled this turn from letting the phony stay, FA 7F is much stronger.
>Brandon_Randall: EENOORV G4 OVER.ONE +64 140
#note Now I felt especially bad about not having the guts to call off the phony.
>Morris: AGIJRRT 6J JIG +57 67
>Brandon_Randall: EEPP H1 PEEP +40 180
>Morris: ADLRRTY H11 LYARD +41 108
>Brandon_Randall: AQT F2 QAT +37 217
>Morris: DLRRTTU 6B TURTL.D +12 120
>Brandon_Randall: IOZ 14F ZO.I +33 250
>Morris: ACHIRRU 2A CHARI.U. +44 164
#note I was pretty sure this was phony, I needed to make something happen, and the WOADING play by Brandon suggests I might have a decent chance of having this stay.
>Brandon_Randall: IY A1 I.Y +24 274
>Morris: AEHNNOR 7C NOH +22 186
#note HON I3 instead.
>Brandon_Randall: IX I3 XI +40 314
#note Yeah, HON last turn.
>Morris: ADEIMNR 3A .AM +29 215
#note Lots of interesting choices here, like this or YID in the same spot, MEDINA 15A, EXAMINED or EXAMINER 3H, and DAM 5K. DAM seems too stupid to me with all of the E's out, though the sim likes it best. I am fine with this, as it scores, keeps a good bingo leave, plays off very few tiles to extend the bingo, and does not close any existing bingo lanes. All plays are under 2.5% to win.
>Brandon_Randall: EIOW 12H .OWIE +22 336
>Morris: DEILNOR 3H ..ILED +28 243
#note Missed the ZORIL hook completely. Everything under 2% to win
>Brandon_Randall: BEM 13G M.BE +34 370
>Morris: AEFINOR 1H .INAFORE +101 344
#note Lucky break, up to 14%.
>Brandon_Randall: TTU 4B TUT +17 387
>Morris: GNNRSSV E6 ...NGS +20 364
#note I like this more than exchanging, Quackle likes exchanging GNNV best (this is 2nd), but I don't want to keep 2 s's with 2 unseen and Brandon showing no sign of having one, nor do I want to throw one back in for Brandon to take to block YOWIES.
>Brandon_Randall: AEK 5K KAE +37 424
>Morris: LNRSSSV K11 V.S +21 385
#note Quackle likes R(E)VS L11 better. I need the right 2 vowel draw here...
>Brandon_Randall: ABCEENT O1 .NACT +10 434
#note This wins unless the G is in the bag. 14K EATEN or ENACT win 100%.
>Morris: ELNRSSU M7 RUNLESS +80 465
#note Can't believe I pulled this one out.
>Morris:  (BEEG) +14 479
