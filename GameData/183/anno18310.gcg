>Mack_: ADHIOQS H7 Q.OD +14 14
#note Quackle actually likes 9G OH in a short sim, but that looks totally wrong to me.
>Larry: GSUV 11E VUGS +31 51
>Mack_: AHIRRSW I4 RAWI. +21 35
#note WHIN is another option, but I liked this to unduplicate my Rs.
>Larry: ACYZ 4H C.AZY +44 95
>Mack_: ?HINNRS K4 .IN +24 59
#note While keeping four consonants is not ideal, there isn't much else here. Plays like WHIN and HUN are too much of a point sacrifice to be better than ZIN.
>Larry: IOT H1 OTI. +18 113
>Mack_: ?AHINRS 1H .RANgISH +80 139
#note Best bingo.
>Larry: AMRTY N1 .MARTY +38 151
>Mack_: EEHILRT 2J HE +28 167
#note O6 ELHI is another choice, but I wasn't too worried about column O and this is too much better equity-wise.

#note I considered L9 aNTIRED for 2 more points, but this exposes fewer floaters. Plus, at this stage in the game Larry pretty much has to challenge to have any shot, and I was positive this was good so that factor works in my favor as well.
>Larry: EIV -  +0 244
#note Larry challenged.
>Mack_: FOOOSTU 2B OUTFOO. +24 375
#note L8 FOU is the other good option, but OOST is not a great leave and turning over more tiles is to my advantage being up over 100.
>Larry: EIV E2 .IVE +20 264
>Mack_: AEEGLOS L8 GAE +20 395
#note With four Es and no Os unseen, this looks wiser than AGO in the same spot.

>Larry: BU H13 .UB +15 291

#note I didn't see any possible bingos for Larry or bingos I could fish for, so this looks OK.
