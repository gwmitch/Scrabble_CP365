#note If only all state abbreviations were acceptable.  PACEMAKER would have fit in nicely here.

#note I forgot all about P/RESOLVED.  APO 6J is best.

>Joey: ?ADENOU M11 U.A +15 274
#note UNRESOLVED is best.  That must mean something that isn't solved a second time.  In this case, it was finding extensions to RESOLVED.
>Joel: AGITXY M3 TAXYI.G +42 299
#note Hold.  TAXY* is no good.  Duh.  And replacing an I with a Y to create a present tense seems weird, even in Scrabble.  Joel has gotten phoneys past me in the past such as PLENARIST* and MAZELTOVS*, but I've also caught him playing stuff like YIPED* and ENDOSTEAS*, so that doesn't really help my judgment here.  Better make a decision soon, or those reading this will become more frustrated.
>Joey: ?DENORT -  +0 274
#note And the challenge grid got redder.  You could tell it wasn't being challenged off because Joel's rack from that turn would have appeared next to my name.  Just in case you hadn't noticed that in the past.
>Joel: EV 5K VE. +26 325
>Joey: ?DENORT O3 DOcTR.NE +64 338
#note Despite giving him a free turn, Joel called me a ratfink for doing this.  I sheepishly became optimistic about the outcome of this game despite all the flaws I had made so far.
>Joel: AJMO F4 MAJO. +44 369
#note Yeah, I saw that spot.  I just didn't have anything quite good enough to play there earlier.

#note Who ratfink now?
>Joey: EENQT 3K Q.. +12 368
#note QI C10 makes it one point closer.
