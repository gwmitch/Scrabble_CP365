>David_Gibson: DENORSW 8D WONDERS +80 80
#note But David Gibson doesn't NEED to open-bingo on me.  :(  At least he didn't play DOWNERS. :)
>Ryan_Fischer: AEORUVX 9C VOX +31 31
#note I really didn't know what to do here.  Needed to bingo fast so dump the X.  VROU(W) is okay, I guess, but I think my play is best.
>David_Gibson: IQ J6 QI. +32 112
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEERTU G6 Un.ERATE +60 91
#note I went into the tank here trying to think of something good, and the only thing better is T(R)EAsURE.
>David_Gibson: DMNOO H11 MONDO +36 148
>Ryan_Fischer: EIKMPRR 11F R..PIKE +30 121
#note Definitely happy with the quality of plays I'm making.  P(OX)IER is another option, but better to dump the K.  I saw KEPI, but MRR is awkward.
>David_Gibson: AAFLT 12J FATAL +31 179
#note Aw.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGLMRR F3 GRAM +23 144
>David_Gibson: AZ E5 ZA +49 228
#note Grrr.
>Ryan_Fischer: DELNRTY D8 ..RDY +24 168
#note D8 (WO)NTEDLY 38.  He said this was decent when I showed him this rack, but he'd've prolly found that had it been his.  Bleh.  LED(G)Y is another option.
>David_Gibson: ATW 13K TAW +32 260
>Ryan_Fischer: AELNNOT 3C TAN.ELO +20 188
#note Blargle.  Ugly 1-point rack.  Break it up or fish?  He said TAN(G)ELO is fine.
>David_Gibson: CLU H1 CU.L +21 281
>Ryan_Fischer: BHNO 4B HOB +26 214
#note Forgot to write down other letters.
>David_Gibson: ?ILRSTU 1H .URLIeST +80 361
#note And IGHN.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIIJNO 2D JO +23 237
#note I played JO hoping for some sort of miracle off the lanes created with some sort of EGIN synergy.  Bleh.  JOIN for 35 with two Ns left.
>David_Gibson: IP K5 PI +19 380
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIINNS 1E IN +5 242
#note 5B IN 10 would just be shut down.
