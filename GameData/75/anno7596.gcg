#note Yeah, I'm not good enough to find HIPPARCH. Oh well. PHILTRA 7H is also better than this, but I wasn't 100 percent sure about it not having any hooks, so I couldn't risk it.

#note Ugh. I saw PIPETTED but really didn't think it was a word. Why is that a verb? That's a 54-ish-point mistake.

#note GIE D11 has to be better. C'mon, self, take the points. Keeping IOTTU isn't that bad.

#note Quackle suggests LIBRI instead, but Quackle was often dropped on its head when it was little.

#note Got into time trouble, couldn't figure out the best sequence. CURD H12 followed by GIMME O7 is a nice out in two.
>Karl_Higby: DEIRSS 5E SERS +38 416
#note Karl's best sequence is REDS followed by SI underneath it, which would win by a point. He was in quite a bit of time trouble too.
