>Zames: JSU 14A JUS +28 73
>Dave: AEEILRT B5 ATELIER +64 135
#note I was quite possibly going to play this at I9 before James's play, but JUS telegraphs a very strong rack, so I didn't want to give him all those letters to play through, nor to open the triple-triple.
>Zames: EFINNST A5 FINE +36 109
#note Sure enough, James told me that he would have had FERNINST.
>Dave: DELOPQU 15A OP +43 178
>Zames: HHS 10G SHH +27 136
>Dave: ADELQRU I3 QUALE +34 212
#note Gotta be better than QUAD, because of the front S hook.
>Zames: DINW J2 WIND +32 168
>Dave: AADDILR K5 DIAL +20 232
#note With both blanks out and the Z for ADZ, this was much too dangerous a spot to leave open.
>Zames: LTU 5A ..ULT +16 184
>Dave: ADKNORT L6 TRANK +17 249
#note Three observations: 1) I like this a lot better than the higher equity plays, because it makes it close to impossible for him to bingo.  2) There was no good reason not to play DRANK instead of TRANK though. 3) Keeping the D actually worked out better for me, given what I drew on the next turn.
>Zames: ?AEISSU M8 SUASIvE +76 260
#note So much for it being hard to bingo.  James underscored this by three and neither of us caught it.
>Dave: ?DOOOOT K10 OOT +13 262
>Zames: ARTW 14J WAT.R +32 292
>Dave: ?CDEEOO 15E COOEyED +85 347
#note One of many times during this tournament that an opponent gave me a spot for my bingo.
>Zames: EX 15N EX +29 321
>Dave: ADMNRVZ F6 ZA. +42 389
#note I was happy to find this during the game, but in retrospect DIZEN 9A to retain a vowel was probably better.
>Zames: GGO 11A G...GO +16 337
>Dave: DEMNRRV 2J .END +8 397
#note This move wins 100% of the time and is a necessity because of the possibilities of ACONITE/TACRINE/INFRACT/INFARCT on column N.  Interestingly, Quackle's Championship Player did not come up with it at all.
>Zames: AEFNORT 1M EF +8 345
#note A very nice setup by James that cuts the spread.
>Dave: CIMRRV 12I VI.R.C +22 419
>Zames: ANORT O1 TRONA +36 381
>Zames:  (MR) +8 389
#note Official score: 419-386.
