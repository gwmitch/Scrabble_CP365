#note I took a while and wasn't sure what to do here.  The long and short plays don't score that differently from each other, and none of the leaves is that bingo prone.  Already with a sizeable deficit, it made sense to angle for an open board.  In the sim, a bunch of plays were close with BAP 7K narrowly on top.  (It surprised me that it did better than BOP.  Maybe to hold the O for OBI.)  My play was also one of the higher simming plays, and in retrospect I still prefer it because of the score.
>Dack: ?EEEFRV 9B EnFEVER +65 111
#note Sim prefers FEVER over all of the bingos by at least 12 points.
>Dave: AEINPRR 8A PRIER +35 57
#note I spent a while looking for nonexistent bingos here.  I don't love starting to block the board up, but this scores much better than anything else.
>Dack: OVW L3 VOW +31 142
>Dave: AEFKNQS 7D KENAF +32 89
#note There's a case to be made for KENAFS 2I here, but given the deficit it seems reasonable to keep the bingo line open.  It may be hard for him to make a play up there that doesn't create more openings for me.

#note For several turns in a row here, Joe does a really nice job of milking the board for points.
>Dave: ADIIQSS 11D QAIDS +39 178
#note I had to do this, but with all those I's out, I thought it likely he would hit the Q right back.  But this is where the luck started to turn.

#note After I played this and held the last A for plays from A1, I knew I was in the driver's seat.

>Dack: IIILNRU F1 .IRI +8 377
#note It would be better for Joe to play LIN 2E on this turn or the next one to take away my scoring play off the J.  However, I needed to be careful not to get myself stuck with the G.
