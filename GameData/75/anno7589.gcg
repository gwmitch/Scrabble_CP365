#note Wasn't positive of RECHEW, didn't see LECHWE. WHILE could be best here, though, because opening lanes may not be so great.

#note We realized after the game that this might not be a good idea. After the game, we actually thought (I)N 13H could be good. It blocks the only main Q spot, and if he draws the Q (unlikely), he has AcQuEST for a buttload. That could be good, but the awesome (SIGNORI)NA might be even better! IN scores pitifully, while SIGNORINA plays off only a couple tiles, and brings the gap closer. It seems like Nigel very rarely doesn't draw a bingo next turn after it, and it also makes my next play tough, because I really have to consider the Q. A cool play here is (FE)StiNATE!

#note The endgame engine isn't quite working here -- HE is suggested as best far and away, yet only wins by twelve when played out.
