>Winter: AADGIIT 8G GADI +12 12
#note I get luck even before the game begins, as the computer assigns me first.
>Cecilia_Le: ADNS K8 DANS +18 18
>Winter: AAIISTX 7H TAX +26 38
#note Quack likes IXIA, but I suspect Cecilia has another S. IXIAS gives up too many points on a comeback, as does TAXIS. I decide to play it safe and see if I can survive leaving the two Is.
>Cecilia_Le: EFIN L9 NEIF +20 38
>Winter: AEIIMPS M7 AMIE +15 53
#note I hated this play right after I did it--hoping to score with my P, but forgot the D hook.
>Cecilia_Le: DILRY N10 DRILY +35 73
>Winter: AAEIPPS 8M .AP +21 74
#note Didn't see PAISE, and did not want to burn the S for just 33 when I could take 21 and have a halfway decent leave.
>Cecilia_Le: ADNORSW 13F ONWARDS +71 144
>Winter: ?AEHIPS L1 PEAkISH +83 157
>Cecilia_Le: BEGMU 14B BEGUM +42 186
>Winter: IINOUUW 15A WINO +34 191
#note Uh-oh--POST-BINGO DRECK!!!
>Cecilia_Le: ARY H12 A.RY +33 219
>Winter: CEIOOUU 1L .UCE +24 215
#note CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP!!! I DO NOT WANT TO LET HER GET THE P SPOT AND GO UP BY 50-60 POINTS!!!
>Cecilia_Le: QT 3K Q.T +24 243

>Cecilia_Le: EFRV 5K F.VER +22 265
>Winter: HILORUU 6F HOUR +22 262
>Cecilia_Le: IKNT 12C KNIT +21 286
>Winter: ILLORTU 5D LOUT +15 277
#note Damn, but all my racks since PEAkISH have been UGLY!!! Don't want to give up the C hook with LOUT, but I need the points and I see nothing better.
>Cecilia_Le: EE 14H .EE +11 297
>Winter: BEIJLOR 13A JOE +41 318
#note I hate JIBE--certain that Cecilia will get a comeback and retake the lead. Also, I think the I makes it easier for her to bingo than the L (if she doesn't have the C hook).
>Cecilia_Le: COZ C5 COZ +31 328
>Winter: ABILRTV E8 BRAV. +20 338
#note This was a hard, hard call. I feared BRAV(I) because it gives her the A to bingo thru, but I finally decided that the LIT leave gave me the best chance to go out (if I draw G or E--she surely has the S and blank).
>Cecilia_Le: ?EEEINS C5 ...IES +18 346
>Winter: GILT 15J GILT +10 348
#note OMG OMG OMG!!! CAUGHT A HUGE BREAK THAT SHE DIDN'T BLOCK MY OUT PLAY!!! OMG!!!
