#note C9 C(O)OEE 20.  Other plays score too.  I just hated where this rack was leading me.

#note VOW is too risky.  I hated WOOD too, but went with it, hoping a lane would be reopened.

#note With his fish I should've been very wary.  An old mistake I thought I'd gotten over.  I looked hard, figured I could outplay him, and settled on SEARS 14H 26.  Then I saw (C)OS, which was cute, scored 2 less, and kept a much better leave.  But for what?!  There's only a G to bingo to, and I usually need IN for that, neither of which I have.  So very dumb.  Oddly, Champ says (C)OS, SO, or (J)O, which are all dumb.
>Aaron_Finkel: ?EINNTT 15H NETTlIN. +74 383
#note He probably drew NT to EINT?, which means he may have missed rETIEIN(G) last turn.  Just a guess.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEELRST I5 LA +10 315
#note Thought of ERA, but with the F and Y out, it's suicidal.
>Aaron_Finkel: AF 4H FA +12 395
>Ryan_Fischer: BEERSTY H1 BEE. +27 342
#note BEY/(FA)Y is interesting.  YET allows QI, so no go.

>Ryan_Fischer: S C13 .S +7 361
#note These plays are not quite right, as I was low on time.  He got rid of the I and had only the Q left when I tried (YEH)S* which I was 99% sure was bad anyway.
