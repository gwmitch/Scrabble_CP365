#note This is an *incredibly* interesting position, and I think a game-changer.  AIRDROME blocked the incredibly easy SILVEX for 50-something.  MIX is an impulse, but I think a wrong one -- it allows an easy ZA for 37, or ZAS for 52.  I don't want to let him back in, but he manages anyway, frustratingly.  I don't know what's right here, but my play was probably not it.

#note M11 DUMA 32, 7A DUI 17?  Hmm...  I wish I could've taken the hotsopt, but I don't see it.  I can't believe DIM is so low -- maybe because of the abundance of vowels -- does Q take that into account?

#note I don't think Q is of much use here.  Winter is right - just don't empty the bag.  So, my play, RECEIV(ER), while nice, is out.  I leave too much up to chance.  He suggested REV N12, which is 4th.  (RECEIV(ER) is 1st in Q's book, with a 71% win.)  (ETH)ERIC is 2nd.  REC is 3rd.
