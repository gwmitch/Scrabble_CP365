#note You'd never think there was an 88 point play here. TEPEFY is a new one for me.

#note This was an ISC game, I kinda just played this to mess with him. I know it's stupid and it's a gamble and I'd never do it in a tournament, but mehhhh. Don't hate. 
>Joey_Krafchick: AGHNPRT 3D HARP +29 302
#note At this point he said 'nice play', which made me lol, and then I told him I'd just sit on my I all day. 
>Matt_Canik: AAIOOSU -AOOU +0 248
#note And what's the harm in that? Leave drek here, or exchange and then play there next turn to direct my rack in the way I need it directed for a bingo. 
>Joey_Krafchick: GNTUUVZ B8 .UG +11 313
#note Now he wants to play some defense. fine by me....
>Matt_Canik: AILRSST A7 SI +30 278
#note ...because I didn't have a bing there this turn and I almost certainly will next turn through the I or E, whichever he doesn't block.
