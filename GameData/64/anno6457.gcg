>Joey_Mallick: AGLOOOT 8D GALOOT +18 18
>Evans_Clinchy: EGIIOVW 9C VOGIE +25 25
#note Obviously I'm keeping IW so I can fish for the double-double ASSWAGING.
>Joey_Mallick: ?AELOOS J4 AErOSOL +66 84
#note Scored as 64.  ROSEOLA is the only other bingo, and seems to be a tad better defensively.
>Evans_Clinchy: AINRWXY K9 WAXY +41 66
#note This looks wrong. I don't know why I was so desperate to unload the Y here... WAX K3 is fine.
>Joey_Mallick: ABENQTT K3 QAT +30 114
>Evans_Clinchy: EEINRST 12D SERENIT. +74 140
#note RESILIENT is cool, but this looks like the play.
>Joey_Mallick: ABEEINT 10D TAB +30 144
#note Saving the T might make sense here, as it would fit in nicely at 11E next turn.  Meanwhile, here comes a nice find by Evans....
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEFILN 13C FINED +33 173
#note This is very strong defensively, and the pool is right for keeping AL. But Quackle says FAIL for not playing FAIL at L1.
>Joey_Mallick: EEFINNU 3K .UEEN +28 172
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEEILZ O1 ZI.E +42 215
#note Was happy to see a big Z spot open up here.
>Joey_Mallick: EFIINSV L8 NEVI +29 201
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEGLNU 14A ALANG +24 239
#note Sim likes LEAGUE, but I couldn't bring myself to open such an easy TWS lane for Joey. I was trying to score points in a more defensive manner, but this isn't it. I have no clue what I'm supposed to do here, but it ain't this.
>Joey_Mallick: EFHIPSU 15A HI +32 233
>Evans_Clinchy: DEJRSUW M2 J.W +13 252
#note I like this, since I think my best chance to win is to fish for an S bingo in line 15. I could be convinced otherwise.
>Joey_Mallick: ?EFPSTU M7 FUSE +29 262
#note I first heard the word STUPEFY from the "Tortoise Beats Hare" cartoon, but was never sure of how to spell it.  Now I have a much more reliable reference.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEORSU 15E SOURED +26 278
#note This is kinda panicky on my part. But I kinda had to infer from his previous play that Joey was sitting on at least another S, if not a blank or both. So I thought I'd beat him to the spot and score a few points. Perhaps this is silly and I should just take the points/leave with DOURA N10.
>Joey_Mallick: ?EILPTU 6C UPLIfTE. +60 322
#note At least I blocked STIPULE, forcing Joey to find the only other bingo. Of course, he does.
>Evans_Clinchy: ABMOORT 5C MOAT +26 304
#note I think I gotta throw the Hail Mary here with TAMBOUR C1. Gotta pry the board open somehow.
>Joey_Mallick: ACDHIKM 14I HICK +25 347
#note DHAK 4A scores a ton, but I wanted to play it safe.  This guarantees at least a 30 point play next turn.
>Evans_Clinchy: BCDNORR 8L ..RD +15 319
#note Nothing wins. Best spread play is just to take the points with DOC N10.
>Joey_Mallick: ADMPRRY 4B DAMP +42 389
#note 4A PRAM works better here.
>Evans_Clinchy: BCINOR 15L ICON +28 347
#note Dropping the R at N10 is best here! It's part of a very elaborate plot to Y-stick him. The sequence goes me LAVER, him RAH A13, me BENT I5, him FROE G6, me KI L14, and then slowplay out.
>Joey_Mallick: RRY 5I Y.. +11 400
#note Best is to block the out-play with YO N14.
>Evans_Clinchy: BR N13 BR. +10 357
>Evans_Clinchy:  (RR) +4 361
