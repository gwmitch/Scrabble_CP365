#note it's better at 8G. i had a strong feeling i was missing something better and i did -- short of a strike of inspiration is there any way to reliably find ZLOTE? -11

#note JOE simply. i'm pretty sure i saw this and for some reason either forgot about it or thought OOH was better. pretty bad call there. ZOO is kind of cute. -11.5

#note quackle is a bit broken. the equity from getting the word challenged off and just passing are wildly different, so that's a bug. in any case, i should have thought about this a little more. it's a common word in my field but i probably would have remembered seeing it in study. -42, OINK

#note i considered myself a minor genius for RIN -- a 3 in 8 shot at INDUSIa in two spots, and possibly higher since the U is slightly more likely to be in the bag, but i didn't draw it! then this happened. but maddy didn't track it correctly at the end.
