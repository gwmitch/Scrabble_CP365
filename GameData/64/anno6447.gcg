#note If I only knew the hooks to NUCHA.  All kinds of plays that use those hooks are good enough to win.  Way too many to list here.

#note If those above plays were counted correctly, I would have eked out a win had I blocked FANES, and then he would have had to also miss the other spot for CRIER.  What a crazy ending.
