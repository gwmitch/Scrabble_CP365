#note i struggled with this move. i don't like ZAG as much as quackle does -- however, i didn't think of LICENSOR.. doh! INCOG is not very good, but i thought i needed an edge. the problem i saw with ZAG or VEG is that david isn't going to open the board for me and if i don't draw the I, i might be in trouble. but i really should have thought of LICENSOR. 3I G(AMIE)R is also interesting. i still sorta like INCOG. this is too hard of a move to think about for me. -13, ZAG

#note it seems there are actually more posibilities with BEIRS than EINRS with this leave. is anyone awesome enough to figure that out? maybe it's obvious and I can't tell. 5G ION sims best. i'm pretty mad that i have to rely on getting lucky now. SNIB 8L might be a reasonable option, but i don't see myself winning the game unless i miraculously draw an out in two spots. -22 according to quackle, is ION really that much better than LIB?

#note ok, i wouldn't have challenged if it was ANESTRI, but i can promise you that i knew this was a word. i was just too mad to not challenge.
