#note i took a long long time on this.  it doesnt sim as badly as i feared.  there are many plays all very close, but the one that edges it for champ player is a8 AORTA(E). followed by b12 A(V)O - but i didnt like that because of the A12 hotspot.

#note my play sims 3rd behind fishing off an R at either 9a or 11a for 2 points.  being behind by 110, i just couldnt bring myself to play for only 2 points.

#note i throw away the game on this move and the next.  i've studied this rack maybe once and RESECTS came into my head immediately but i convinced myself it was phoney.  the danger of studying like i do (zzyzzva- snap recognition of racks) is that i dont move my tiles to look for words.  I should've seen SECRETS if i'd done that, - the other word in this is CRESSET.  having discounted RESECTS, i thought i'd score well with REMOULDING and keep a good leave. turns out REMOULDING is Collins only - MOULDERING is good and so is REMOLDING.  i also miss SETSCREW having written down SCREWSET* on my pad.

#note a good find, but there is a much better defensive bingo that also scores 6 more - TRAJECTS.
