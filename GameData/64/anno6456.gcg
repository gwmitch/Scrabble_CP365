>Evans_Clinchy: AIIRSVV 8F VIVA +20 20
#note This placement is stupid. Obviously it's better to set up the S in the 2x2 lane with VIVA 8G. I got kinda freaked out against Brian.
>Brian_Cappelletto: Q G7 Q. +21 21
>Evans_Clinchy: IIORSSU I5 SOU.RI +8 28
#note Trying to open lanes since I'm holding an S. This is just horrible defensively, though, and Quackle hates it. SOU J8 is best despite keeping both I's. I'm also surprised at how much the sim likes trading.
>Brian_Cappelletto: ?AEEHRT 5D EARTH.Et +90 111
>Evans_Clinchy: BCIIOSZ D1 COZI. +38 66
#note Or BIZ 4J, but I wanted more points, and I didn't mind opening like this from behind.
>Brian_Cappelletto: AEFGLST 2B FL.TAGES +78 189
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEILSS K4 S.ABILES +68 134
#note Wow, this is ugly. Right after I hit my clock I thought "oh right... ABSEILS."
>Brian_Cappelletto: AFIKR 1F KAFIR +62 251
#note Maybe I shoulda played ABSEILS?
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEELOT 3D .OEAE +35 169
#note And now I manage to completely miss AZOTE. Nice going, self.
>Brian_Cappelletto: DNO 6B NOD +24 275
>Evans_Clinchy: ABELOTW H10 LOBATE +35 204
#note I figured I had to take the points here and pray for an amazing draw to give me a chance in this game. Quackle suggests BOW 7K to set up a lane for -ABLE bingos, but I'm dubious. From down 106 against Brian, I need to score big now AND bingo later.
>Brian_Cappelletto: HMNOT J10 MONTH +38 313
>Evans_Clinchy: ACDGLPW 4K .CALP +24 228
#note Yeah, just missed CLAP G10. No excuse. Although at least this has the benefit of keeping things more open for me.
>Brian_Cappelletto: DEEER O1 DEE.ER +27 340
>Evans_Clinchy: DGIMUWY G13 YUM +27 255
#note It's either this or GAUDY M3. The leave is difficult to maneuver either way... I had a hard time figuring out which bingo lane I needed to keep open.
>Brian_Cappelletto: NOY N2 ON.Y +25 365
>Evans_Clinchy: DGIIRTW L6 WIT +19 274
#note I guess. Nothing else seems any good here.
>Brian_Cappelletto: AWX 7A WAX +40 405
>Evans_Clinchy: DGIINPR A7 .IPING +42 316
#note Yeah, I think this the first play all game that's definitely right.
>Brian_Cappelletto: EGRU F12 URGE +28 433
>Evans_Clinchy: DJNORTU 1A JO +32 348
#note And this is the second. Too little, too late.
