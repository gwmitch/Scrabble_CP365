#note This game was played 3rd 'cause SOMEONE (or multiple someones) didn't bring equipment so we had to wait 30 minutes for Katya's husband to bring another set.  We made up a game at lunch.  Play something.  Feh.  The exchange isn't that great.  Q loves its consonants.  Recommends 8F DREG.

#note H11 EDILE 44 -- because Q thinks it's okay to close down 6 lanes when down 153.  On the bright side, I SPELLED DREIDEL RIGHT.  YEAH!!!

#note Starting to joke with Chad about playing fast (we're both notoriously slow when playing each other, both usually exhausting most of our clocks).  CED(I)NG is a bit better.

#note 1K ARHAT 40 is second if I did indeed have a R as my 7th tile.  I drew a whole bunch of power tiles here, but not HAJ yet.  Better timing might've made it possible to come back.
