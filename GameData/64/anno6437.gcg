#note Club game June 17th. One of my highest scoring games, yet... I played atrociously bad. I always play better when I lose, apparantly. To top it off, the bag had 102 tiles. My opponent was not playing very good, and scoring zero 3 turns in a row kind of hurts.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIOQRRS J6 QIS +41 41
#note Well, I got this one right, but it wasn't mind numbingly hard.
>Fay_Claus: CEIV H7 V.ICE +10 26
>Matthew_Larocque: EFORRST 11E FOR.STER +94 135
#note Somehow I didn't even come up with fosterer, and didn't know reforest, but it didn't matter this time.
>Fay_Claus: AGSW M11 SWAG +28 54
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEIKT K5 KID +30 165
#note I forgot about swage, which I even know, but I didn't know the bingos in this rack. I'm not too sharp with the K in general.
>Fay_Claus: APR 12D RAP +19 73
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEOOST 9H .O +9 174
#note I had to have played this upside down... but going unchallenged.... what? She really was not paying an ounce of attention to this game. Also, I didn't check a(g)e, I likely would have found rootages/footages. Bad. Seaboot I had no idea.
>Fay_Claus: EH 12K HE. +27 100
#note I have fe(w) written down on my score sheet, but that creates 3 effs on the board and H left over at the end, which is wrong. So, this results in correct score and distribution.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEOST 15I AErOSAT +80 254
#note At least I remembered this one, double A's always cause me instant confusion.
>Fay_Claus: ABO L3 BOA +16 116
>Matthew_Larocque: ADENOTT M3 ANTED +33 287
#note Ok this is inexcusable. I mean, I thought to myself "annotated" which is a 9 letter word so I'm not sure what world I was in, but notated is apparantly too hard to deduce from that. Epic facepalm play.

#note Of all the words to challenge, this one? She said she knew ohm but didn't remember this.
>Matthew_Larocque: EELLRTT 13E TEL +15 368
#note Why not play letter/retell for 27? Because the bigger my lead, the worse I play.

#note Ok, I knew byrl and tyre, but I did not know they were verbs. Didn't know mopey, just mopy. I saw derby, and thought "hey I could have played derby/blet, if I had played let instead of tel". I didn't even bother to see where I COULD play derby.

#note This seems to be best, which is unusual for me.
>Fay_Claus: AEGL F3 GLA.E +15 174
>Matthew_Larocque: IINRUWX 3A WIRIN. +20 442
#note This sims surprisingly bad. Quackle prefers to play unwi(t) in either corner. Well, I can't possibly lose. So I will happily go for points and turnover, maybe luck into the last blank, and have a slim shot at 600?
>Fay_Claus: UUU -UUU +0 174

#note Incredibly lucky to get that A when I did.
>Fay_Claus: EJ A1 JE. +39 213
>Matthew_Larocque: ELOPRUU D1 PO.LU +20 525
#note Yeah, I was unsure on loup roup and loupe. I really don't know a heck of a lot apparantly. Po(i)lu barely cracks the top 10. Upo appears best a J10, but I didn't spend very much time on this play.
>Fay_Claus: FG B2 F.G +24 237
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIRUUU 4D .U.U +6 531
#note (P)uree or this? With two trips open, I opted to dump these unwelcome Us. Outside chance I could draw reunite/retinue thanks to 102 tiles which I wasn't aware of since I don't track at club normally. Oh hey (p)ureeing too.
>Fay_Claus: ?ITV 1D .IVoT +27 264
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEEIRU O7 EERIE +25 556
#note God I wish I knew about ureide. Quackle also likes rapid/invoiced, but I'd rather go out in 2. Forgot about eider, but that's also an out in 3. Eerie for 24 sims quite a bit better than eerie for 25. I'm assuming because it blocks hew(n). Of course my opponents actual rack here is genn not nn.
