#note TANGENCE and ANTIGENE were both blocked; I didn't see ENTANG(L)E, which may have given me a prayer.

#note Perhaps I should've thought about his rack a bit more before playing this, but I didn't have much choice.  Maybe I should've fished more on the previous turn -- 18's not much better than 15 in this case.  But I was feeling pretty helpless.

#note Yeah, that's really my rack.  You thought this was Scrabble hell, a game the next day versus Winter was even worse.  But to be fair, missing ENTANG(L)E shouldn't go unpunished.

#note Spend several minutes on this rack; am relieved to see I didn't miss anything.  My fish is 2nd best, especially because the 1st, 13A (MA)YO 32, opens another lane.

#note Winter found Q's best play that wins 100%.  Cool.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACOUW 4H COW +20 303
#note (V)AU blocks ZES(T)ER and saves COW to go out.  Winter suggested COA(T) which works, but precents me from going out.  I'm just ready to be done with this one, so I pick the play that's like 17th, but it leaves me with an out.
