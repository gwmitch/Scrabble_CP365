#note 14B J(E)ST 27?  Blah.  PR(E)ST isn'ttoo much better.  With those leaves I don't know if the points are worth it.
>Winter: AEIT 15A TA.IE +27 93
#note So we're clear: he gets the vowels, I get the consonants. :)
>Ryan_Fischer: ?GPRSTX H7 P.X +15 97
#note ...but at least he had a consonant to work with too.  Me, on the contrary...
>Winter: AAE D3 A.AE +13 106
#note Heh.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?GIRSTW -WG +0 97
#note 14E WRIGhTS 69.  Brian Galebach would've seen that.  (He's studied by number of vowels.)  WIG is dumb.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?IIRSTU J8 pURITI.S +59 156
#note Well, if I would've played from the P, it'd be two more points, but still, it's such a kick in the teeth to only score 59 here.  Shouldn't have missed WRIGhTS, though.  Winter suggested sURITI(E)S* for defense.  Nope.  It's SURETIES.

#note 3I GOOFED 36 is nice, but if I want to bingo, I need that O hook (Winter didn't know it, he told me).
>Winter: IIKW L1 KIWI +36 387
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEEGIN O8 .ECEDING +92 303
#note SO close to a 3x3 through K!  It's ridiculous to have a 92 point play here after so much shit before.  Winter was even worried about a possible comeback considering the volatility the KIWI play created.

#note Quackle just doesn't get it.  This is an interesting endgame even though it's futile.  Q suggests (W)ORD.  This sets up AI(D)E.  I dump the Q, then he goes out with HYPO for 28 ... OR he gets HYP 7M for 46(!).  Very cool.  My sequence is better because it forces him to block QUOD.  Quackle doesn't even think of this, when it's found much more complicated sequences.  Really confusing.  Its valuation is 37.2(!) but its win % is, of course, 0.  So in simulating, the valuation doesn't boost it to the top of the list.
