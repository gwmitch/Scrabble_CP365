#note Really no idea what to do here.  I thought Brian was setting up a big J play, since the bingo lanes he was setting him was forcing to use the blank as an S, which made it a lot harder to bingo.

#note A rare endgame mistake by Brian.  If he blocks this with RAY I1, then he sets up QUEER.  If I block that, he still has EMEU 14A, and the player going second would fall to 0-14 in my games this tournament.
