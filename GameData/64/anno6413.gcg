#note Yeah, you read that right.  I exchanged 2 and drew the blanks.  Even more unbelievable that I found this.  He held, but was taciturn about challenging.

#note C10 DAMN 34 leaving INZ.  Interesting.

#note D9 MIND 29.  Getting too aggressive, will surely pay for it.

#note DILUVIAN with an L -- I learned that word, or rather, first heard it, on Dinosaurs, when I was a kid.  "ABC - The Antediluvian Broadcasting Company!"  C3 AVIDIN 28?  Q doesn't list VID, but I have the last A.  Aha!  This blocks any bingo he has hooking AB, and makes a place for me.  Doesn't sim very well, though, so I guess I shouldn't be too excited.
>Winter: ELSY O12 LYSE +35 400
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIKLNU N13 .IN +18 403
#note I was so fixated on scoring with the K now or later.  Need to play 3 or less.  I thought WIN was winning, but it's only 5th.  I don't understand why U(T)ILE does so well.
>Winter: EIQRU 5J QUI. +26 426
#note He put down REQUI(N) first; probably smart to play this.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEKLORU 6C LEAK +26 429
#note N7 (T)ULE leaving KORA to go out wins.  As many times as I see it, it's a lesson to be learned.  I was halfway there in creating the spot.  Didn't take advantage of it properly is all.
>Winter: EIORRS G6 SI.E +20 446
#note SI(P)E, (R)OSIER, and ORRIS all win.
