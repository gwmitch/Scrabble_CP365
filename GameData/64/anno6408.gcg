#note To set the scene, I'm about 160 spread points behind Keller ... if he wins by 20, and I win by 200, I can win on the ultimate back door. As I opened with this and Clay started like a house afire against Keller (which, I figured, would make any Keller win by a negligible spread), I thought "My god, this could actually happen!" Then Glenn took literally seven minutes on his opening turn, allowing me to observe the "title match."
>Glenn_Dunlop: ?ADEEIR L5 DEA.lIER +68 68
#note Well, that puts a damper on blowout chances. Back to hunkering down.
>Jason: ABCIRTU K3 CRIB +26 98
#note Duck no likey. It prefers fishing off BU. Know the board is open for a good ACIRT leave, but I'd rather grab points.
>Glenn_Dunlop: GNOO 9G GOON +21 89
>Jason: AEFLOTU K11 FOU +24 122
>Glenn_Dunlop: DEINT 10D TINED +16 105
#note OK, Glenn, get rid of all those pesky bingo tiles up front...
>Jason: AAEELQT 9C QAT +26 148
#note I swear I had a reason for this instead of QA(T) at F6. Search me as to what it was, though.
>Glenn_Dunlop: AET 11E TAE +19 124
>Jason: AAEEILR 3I AE.IA +16 164
#note The pool is already so consonant heavy it may be one of the few acceptable times to fish into AILER. But I felt like turning over (eight power tiles out) and scoring was the key at this point.
>Glenn_Dunlop: ENW M11 WEN +24 148
>Jason: EHJLNRY J2 J.ER +33 197
#note Nearly played RELY at 2G before seeing this. That would've been bad. (Also of note: Glenn disagreed with my cumulative of 164 the turn before and didn't think this scored 33. Nerves? Deliberate?)
>Glenn_Dunlop: APX 2L PAX +30 178
>Jason: HIILNYZ 12D ZIN +31 228
#note Consonants were plentiful; didn't like the HILNY leave after ZI(T).
>Glenn_Dunlop: FO 1N OF +24 202
#note Grr ... I was just about to whack him up there and really take control of this game!
>Jason: ABHIILY 13A HYLA +31 259
>Glenn_Dunlop: GU A13 .UG +21 223
>Jason: BEIILPV 14D PLEB +24 283
#note Gutsy, can get hit with a bingo or an S-hook doubling the K. Went with my gut, which told me this'd be OK. VIBE at 7C is a better option.
>Glenn_Dunlop: KRSU H12 RUSK +36 259
#note OK, now the bottom is pretty much dead. Now to finish off the top and run.
>Jason: EIIMTVY 6K ..VY +20 303
#note VI(RID)ITY gets style points.
>Glenn_Dunlop: IV 4H VI.. +13 272
#note He does know he's behind, right?
>Jason: AEIIIMT 15F TI.I +14 317
#note OK, bottom part totally dead and the top part a turn or two away from getting there.
>Glenn_Dunlop: OW F6 WO. +14 286
#note Finally he opens! Luckily I'm ready for him.
>Jason: AEIMMOS E5 MOM +23 340
#note Welcome, S! You may be the only power tile I need to win this game.
>Glenn_Dunlop: CORS B10 COR.S +36 322
#note 99+% sure it was bad. But I did the math. RATS at 14K puts me up 34. Worst case scenario next turn: ES or IS at 15C scores 19 (unless he wants to use his blank there, highly unlikely); that's 53 (54 actually; I gained a point in the recount).  Glenn getting 53, 54 points on this mess of a board out of ?DEEHLLNSU!? No way. 99+% sure it was bad, but 99++% sure I win keeping it on, so I did.
>Jason: AEIRSST 14K RATS +22 362
#note Ooh, I suppose I could've played ZAP(S) and then whacked his inevitable opening. Actually, given the circumstance that may be right: triple-triple with an H might win the tourney!
