>Jeffrey: ACDEOWX 8D COAXED +38 38
#note Ugh.  I chickened out on DEWAX, but even WAXED is better, as is CODEX  -11.1
>Evans: BEPQRYZ 7F ZEP +40 40
>Jeffrey: IMOTTWY 9H TOW +16 54
#note I saw (C)OMITY/MYOTI(C) but didn't like the TW leave, liked TOW over WOT because of the hook, -7
>Evans: BQRRRRY -  +0 40
>Jeffrey: ?CEIMTY K8 CYME +32 86
#note best, even got a 10-second hold (it momentarily looked odd to me too)
>Evans: AEGLNNU 8K .LUNG +27 67
>Jeffrey: ?IIIRST 11E IRITId.S +64 150
#note best play, except the blank should have been an S.  I think I was remembering K8's game or two which featured this, or melding IRITISES and OTITIDES.  Evans held for 20 seconds, probably remembered same meme and released.  Lesser bingers = I(N)SpIRIT, RhI(N)ITIS
>Evans: AEINNNS G4 ANN.. +12 79
>Jeffrey: EHIKORV H1 OKEH +54 204
#note I was actually proud to find this- I usually miss it right away on a full rack. It still looks very odd.
>Evans: EEINSSY H11 .YEES +36 115
>Jeffrey: ADEFIRV G13 FA +20 224
#note I3 a better locale, but I wanted to obstruct those bingo lanes, -4
>Evans: AINPSTU 1H .PUNTIAS +83 198
>Jeffrey: DEIINRV 15A DIVINER. +95 319
#note best, only
>Evans: AEHLNOT 10A ANETHOL +75 273
>Jeffrey: ADGGIQT M7 Q.AG +25 344
#note I wanted to gum these lanes up a bit, especially with IG left, but QADI F2 is pretty damn good too -11.1
>Evans: ?EEEJRS C9 J.ERS +40 313
>Jeffrey: BDGIORT A8 BO.RD +30 374
#note Q recommends 5 plays in the N row above A plays.  Srsly?  I'm still holding the IG for later but GORDIT(A) A4 would have taken out the lane, true -9.1
>Evans: ?EELMOU 2J ME +22 335
>Jeffrey: AADGIOT N3 DOATI.G +25 399
#note Quackle liked DI(N)GO best, or interesting infill (P)ADI/(P)ATIO I2 -2.6
>Evans: ?EELORU B2 aUREOLE +70 405
>Jeffrey: ABFIORW 4L FR.W +28 427
#note  D3 FABRI(C) better in long run, WO(O)F too.  To me seeing two spots for OBIA sealed it -2
>Evans: AILTUV D4 VATI. +20 425
>Jeffrey: ABIO 12L OBIA +18 445
#note Interesting longer pattern BAI(ZA) better by at least 2
>Jeffrey:  (LU) +4 449
