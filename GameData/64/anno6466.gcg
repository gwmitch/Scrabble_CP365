#note i was beating myself up for chickening out on DURAL but apparently that's even worse. this situation is very tough for me, i can't ever balance points and leave properly. but in situations like this, i don't necessarily need to go for a longer word, the simple 6E TUT sims best. leaves are important earlier especially. DUAL gives more back and i score less after it. how do i make myself see that? (-9)

#note ok, heads up. OBVIOUSLY this move is extremely important. i need to catch up fast. i spent some time on this, but not enough. the problem is that i believe there are no other words besides LINEN or LIN at the bottom left. LINEN is only 1.6 pts behind LINN, but it is IMPERATIVE to find LINN! how do i do it????????

#note no!!!

#note it's easy to overlap, but i have a shot at a bingo and it scores.

#note this seriously has to be a joke. time to make a suboptimal creative play that might result in an S hook or something. 5C NAN might be more sensical. -0.3%

#note i was mad at the end of the game for not having more pATIENCE. turns out she would have done BRAZErS then. -4

#note scrabble really is not for the faint of heart. i am proud of having no reaction at all to this play, though.

#note ok, my only chance now is to somehow will her into challenging this word as much as i can, but ethically. i have no idea how to do that. i had about 10 minutes on my clock, so i thought i could waste a minute or so and then just plop it down, as if i was trying to give myself the guts to try a desperate phony. what's the best way to get an opponent to challenge?

#note -20 to VERGE, but i don't believe it. i could draw EROGEnIC and have a tiny chance of getting to play it. but i don't think theres any way to draw a bingo in two spots.
