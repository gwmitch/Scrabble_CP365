#note Or 8D GOOSIeR.
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRST K4 TRAN.IES +78 78
#note K5 placement wins by roughly 1/2 point according to the sim; Championship player prefers this placement.
>Laurie_Cohen: ORU J10 OUR +11 79
>Jim_Burlant: ?EFGMSX 6I EX.M +29 107
#note I felt 6J FAX 21 gave up too many points relative to this choice.  And for some reason I kept coming up with 21 points for G7 FOX - probably forgetting to double the F when I was evaluating the play.  Sim winner is G7 FOX 25, and that looks right; this play sims roughly 3-1/2 points down.
>Laurie_Cohen: DEO 5I DO.E +21 100
>Jim_Burlant: ?AFGILS G7 F.G +13 120
#note Couldn't think of FOLIAGES; all I saw were a bunch of phonies that I knew not to try, and no-go 8's like FLASHING and FLAGSHIP.  Despite the miss, this play sims within 5 points of the bingos, such is the power of the AILS? leave. FOLIAGES plays at G7 and H7 for 66 and 63, the G7 placement is the best play.
>Laurie_Cohen: AEEINRT 12C RETAINE. +68 168
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEILOS C6 ALIEnO.S +68 188
#note Best bingo here is 13A OBELIAS, which I didn't see.  This choice concedes roughly 3-1/2  points in the sim.
>Laurie_Cohen: ANW 8A WA.N +24 192
>Jim_Burlant: EFIKPRT B4 KEF +31 219
#note Initially saw KERF and it took forever for me just to see the safer KEF.  I don't know why I didn't think of KIF, which is definitely the best play.
>Laurie_Cohen: NRU D4 RUN +12 204
>Jim_Burlant: HIIPRTY A8 .ITHY +18 237
#note I was going to play PITHY at D2 and brain-locked when her play of RUN blocked that.  4K THRIP wins the sim; I couldn't think of it, and I didn't look for anything that didn't didn't unload an I and the Y, which ruled out THY.  Don't know how I didn't see PITHY E10.
>Laurie_Cohen: JLO 4H JOL. +33 237
>Jim_Burlant: INPRTUW H11 U.WIT +24 261
#note Best.  I'm winning 57%.
>Laurie_Cohen: EH E5 HE +27 264
#note Play incorrectly scored as 29.
>Jim_Burlant: DINOPRV F10 VI.ND +21 282
#note Best.  Not thrilled about opening up an S hook on row 15 with ZS still unseen, but what else could I do with this rack on this board?
>Laurie_Cohen: AEU L11 EAU +9 273
>Jim_Burlant: CDEOPRY M13 PRY +24 306
#note Couldn't think of CREPY.  I had mistracked, and my tracking showed the X was still at large.  I hadn't paid enough attention to the board to notice that the X was already out, so I was trying to block what I thought was the impending ZAX 14J.  This is a terrible play and it is justifiably slammed in the sim.  M10 CREPY is clearly best.
>Laurie_Cohen: ABMS 15K AB.SM +45 318
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEEIO 14M .OE +14 320
#note N12 DOE(S) wins the sim.  I considered that...but didn't like the potential for her to burn me down the O column, even though there was only one O and one E in the unseen pool.  The game was still close enough that I felt I didn't need to take the risk.
>Laurie_Cohen: IQ C3 QI +29 347
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEILT O12 ID.. +8 328
#note Now this is looking bleak.  In addition to punishing me for the PRY misfire she scored well again with QI and I'm now sitting on an otherwise terrific rack that's completely useless on this board.    Quackle says the best plays are I3 C(ODE) and E5 HET.  Maybe on a more bingo friendly board, the fishing makes sense.  Now that I'm trailing by roughly 20, I need to open.
>Laurie_Cohen: BGO N10 GOB +14 361
>Jim_Burlant: AACCELT B13 ACT +12 340
#note Sim says the best play is the cute I3 CODECS for 17.  I missed it.  This play sims mid-pack, with B8 ACE 16 also faring well.    The sim says I'm at 17% winning chances, with CODECS winning 30.  But this is about to get interesting.  Post-mortem, Laurie told me that she had held the Z due to all the unseen A's; she figured she'd draw one and hit me with ZA 14J as the game clincher.  She had no way of knowing I had all the A's.  And she was about to be hit with a horrendous rack.
>Laurie_Cohen: ELNPTVZ K14 Z. +11 372
#note Quackle says that Laurie's best play is 10I VOE for 6, leaving ELNPTZ.  Huh?  That's a sure-fire guarantee that I'll be able to Z-stick her.  She is right to unload the Z.
>Jim_Burlant: AACDEL M9 LA +6 346
#note Quackle says my only win here is A(T)E E11 for 12.  I rejected that, as it didn't leave me an out.  And despite what the sim says, it doesn't win at all against her best play, which neither of us saw.  My idea here was to force her to decide:   Let me go out?  Or block my out and leave herself without vowels?
>Laurie_Cohen: ELNPTV 10M ..E +4 376
#note Laurie's star play in this position is 6I (EXAM)PLE.  It not only scores 20, but it simultaneously blocks my out and makes it impossible for me to V-stick her.  I didn't see that as a possibility when I came up with my LA play.   Since she obviously didn't see (EXAM)PLE either, she opted to block my out and minimize spread.  But, due to time pressure, she missed a better option:  PE O9. While it gives me me 3 more back when I would play CEPE or CAPE for 24 on the following turn, it not only scores 4 more for her; it also unloads the P from her rack and puts the onus back on me to salvage the tie, as I will not be able to win outright. And, since we had misscored her HE play as 29 instead of 27, I would have lost the game (this was club, so there would not have been a recount).
>Jim_Burlant: ACDE O7 CAD. +21 367
#note Now I can't lose.  
>Laurie_Cohen: LNPTV 10I V.. +6 382
#note None of Laurie's options are good here - best she can do is minimize the points she gives back when I go out.  She was literally at 00:00 on her clock when she put this play down.
>Jim_Burlant: E 15A E. +6 373
#note Missing EF F7 7.  Final score recorded as 385 - 384.
>Jim_Burlant:  (LNPT) +12 385
