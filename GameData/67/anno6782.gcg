#note Ok I do not know GALYAK. And HOAGY beats my play too. Hmm... I don't feel the leave is 9 points better, so it must be positional? Dunno.

#note Kind of messed this rack of pretty bad. I was too focused on getting my X onto the J6 hot spot. I failed to notice the hot spot at C7. C3 DEWAX is 69!!! Damnit! BANDAGE was supposed to fish for I or U and distract Dave from blocking the spot. I guess it sort of worked in the end, but yeah, DEWAX is a bad miss.

#note Chickened out on LIOnLI(K)E for 76. I just wasn't sure enough, and I'm too eager to go up 100 points to risk something I'm unsure of.
>Wiegand: ?AEEITV 12D VEsI.ATE +74 313
#note Now the LIONLIKE mistake is huge. Dave wouldn't have had a playable bingo.
>Tunnicliffe: AEORUYZ A12 ZO.A +69 408
#note Second time my big mistake was rewarded with a huge play.

#note This is phony. YURTA is already plural. Why didn't I just do YURTA? I wanted to leave exactly one tile in the bag.
