>Rachel: EGIINOR 8G OI +4 4
#note The other placement is better, I think, because it makes it harder to use both DWS.
>Chris: ?AFIJNR 7G JAR +38 38
#note Thanks for the spot.  Oops I didn't think to look for the bingo: JANIFORM.
>Rachel: DEGINRY 9A REDYING +79 83
#note Really?  This isn't good?  Only REDYEING?  Anyways, I it's not like I was about to challenge it off with my comeback play...
>Chris: ?EFGIKN A8 F.EaKING +230 268
#note Boo yah!
>Rachel: BEHMNTU C3 THUMBE. +36 119
#note Best!
>Chris: LLOOQRU E8 L.QUOR +30 298
#note Saving an L for the hook.
>Rachel: EELLNOX B9 .X +50 169
>Chris: BDLNNOP J6 BLOND +29 327
>Rachel: EELLNOR 11J ELL +15 184
#note Aargh!  Not only does she miss RELLENO, ENROLLER, etc., but she blocks my awesome bingo!
>Chris: ?EFINNP 13C FI.N +14 341
#note PFENNIg would have played at 11H :(
>Rachel: AENOORV L7 OVER.OAN +80 264
#note Aarrghh we were just studying these last week, and I thought I remembered this being good.  OVERLEND so why not OVERLOAN?
>Chris: ?EGINPS 15F PINGErS +93 434
#note Trying but failing to find something that wouldn't set up the big spot at 14J.  PEISING is best, I suppose, assuming the phony hook stays.
>Rachel: EIRTTTW M1 TWITTER +75 339
#note Just learned WHITTRET last week.
>Chris: EEEISTZ B2 ZEE +31 465
#note Quackle approved!  Rachel and I have gotten into the habit of using the phrase "Quackle approved" to describe any instance of good decision making.  Go out to dinner and stop by the store on the way home?  That's the "Quackle approved" play.  
>Rachel: CHIIOPU 1K PI.CH +39 378
#note 1L OPHITIC is the star play here.
>Chris: AEISSTY 14E YA +33 498
#note Phony!  It looked a little fishy when I put it down, but I decided to act confident and all.  Rachel held but let it go.  Quackle prefers YENTA anyway, but I'm greedy and want to bingo again.
>Rachel: CDIOTUU 4H CUTOU. +22 400
#note Nice dump, but there was a nice extension play available.
>Chris: DEIOSST G7 ...S +12 510
#note Wouldn't it be nice be nice if I learned more anamonics so I didn't have to waste five minutes looking for a bingo here?  (TODIES = "major chutzpah food".)  Didn't think of N1 CODS, which is a lot better than what I did.  Quackle also prefers dumping the O along with the S.
>Rachel: AAAADIR B6 AA +14 414
#note Killer draw = AAAARGH
>Chris: DEIOSTV 3A V.. +6 516
#note Again with the anamonics.  At least this time I knew DOVIEST was #.
>Rachel: AADEIMR N5 AM +22 436
#note With all my fishing, Rachel has managed to stay in the game, but here she misses a bingo that would have made it a lot closer.  (Sim says 14J MANIA is best, but that's assuming I have random tiles.)
>Chris: DEIOOST O3 OSTEOID +85 601
#note So instead I bingo
>Rachel: AADEIRW 14J WA.DER +50 486
#note Leaving her with this spot
>Chris: AES O12 SE.A +15 616
#note Okay, so technically I went a minute over on time, but there was chitchat, ordering drinks, etc, so let's call it a 1100-point-game anyway.
>Chris:  (AI) +4 620
