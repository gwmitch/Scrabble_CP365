#note La Grange Park, IL. I was hoping for an O, but wasn't 100% sure of the bingo...
>trashman: ADERSTX J8 .AXED +31 31
#note I wrote down EXTRADOS, and liked it. Then I started to doubt it, thinking maybe I was confusing it with INTRADOS. Someday I'll learn the definitions, which will simplify (or confuse) things greatly. Q prefers just MAX if I don't bingo, but early in the game I'm turning over more tiles...

#note Fortunately, my mistake isn't too costly
>dan_terkell: AEJS 2J JEA.S +56 100
>trashman: CEFNOOT 4H CONFE.TO +84 189
#note Happy to find this. Makes up for the earlier blunder. Expected a hold, but Dan knew the word.
>dan_terkell: EEG H10 GEE +16 116
>trashman: ?EEEFPY L8 .EEFY +22 211
#note Q prefers K11 FEY, which I considered. Close call.
>dan_terkell: DEIOV H1 VOI.ED +36 152
>trashman: ?EINPUY 6J YUP.N +20 231
#note Q likes G12 YUP for the superior leave. Either way, I'm setting up a hook, which doesn't seem terribly wise.

#note Thought I was missing a double-double. I wasn't.
>dan_terkell: ACHP 5D CHAP. +24 190
>trashman: ?AGIOOR 14B GOO. +12 309
#note Thought I was missing something. Yup, RIGADOON. Sigh. Q likes M12 AGIO and D12 BOO ahead of this. Really?

#note Best
>dan_terkell: AEILNV A5 ALEVIN +33 276

#note I bagged Dan, and outbingoed him, 4-0, yet can't pile up many spread points. Good game, Dan!
