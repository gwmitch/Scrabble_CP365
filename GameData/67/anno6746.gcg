#note HY(R)AX, d'oh
>Becky_Dyer: FINT 11B NIFT. +22 54
>Matt_Canik: DHIIOVW G8 .HI +30 63
#note Wasn't sure about this when I made it because I didn't want to hold onto VW, but the duck likes it 4% better than WIDO(W)
>Becky_Dyer: DO 9D OD.. +16 70
>Matt_Canik: ADOOSVW H10 SOW +20 83
#note If you find the bingo I missed here I'll give you 50 imaginary dollars. I didn't like AVOW/AD because I really didn't like throwing things open and scoring so little. 
>Becky_Dyer: DEILSTU 7H DILUTES +67 137
#note I don't see what's wrong with duelist/dilutes and sows, but ok. 
>Matt_Canik: ?ADELOV K5 OV.LAtED +94 177
>Becky_Dyer: EGOR L9 GORE +22 159
>Matt_Canik: EGMRSVY M11 GYVE +33 210
#note  All of the Ds were already gone and I'm sitting on one of the last two esses, sounds good man.
>Becky_Dyer: ENOP 12A PONE +32 191
>Matt_Canik: AEIMNRS 15G MARINES +92 302
#note Chose this over remains because it prevented -ED bingoes. Only now looking back on this, that's a pretty stupid rationale because there aren't Ds left, derp. 
>Becky_Dyer: EFT 14H FET +19 210
>Matt_Canik: ?AKOSTU M1 OUTbAK.S +72 374
#note Talked myself out of OUTtASKs, thinking I was just mistaking it with OUTASKS. Whoops. Picked the B instead of a T because it might pull a challenge and because I'm a bratty little showoff. 
>Becky_Dyer: ABIIMNT -  +0 210
#note Challed. 
>Matt_Canik: ELOQRUU 1L L.UR +15 389
#note Yeah I'm not leaving that open. 
>Becky_Dyer: GIR A12 .RIG +21 231
>Matt_Canik: ABEJOQU 6G JOB +22 411
#note Here I see the two Cs unseen and no decent Q spots and decide to rid myself of the J and hold onto the Q for something like C(IN)QUE or something. Maybe. 
>Becky_Dyer: IM N5 MI. +19 250
>Matt_Canik: AAEELQU 3J QUA.E +14 425
#note EQUAL is wrong because I don't want to throw that E out there in the TWS line. There's actually a crazy play here, look for ten seconds and see if you find it. If not, don't hurt yourself because I didn't either.

>Becky_Dyer: ACNTT 14A .NTACT +20 270
#note AQUA(MARINES). And the bing I missed with ADOOSVW was ADVOWSO(N). I forgot to say that earlier, oopsies. 
>Matt_Canik: AACEHLR O4 CAR +20 445

#note She didn't realize the bag was empty, I think.

>Becky_Dyer: EIINNO 8M .ON +15 293
>Matt_Canik: AHL 14L H.AL +19 493
#note Wahoo, my first 500 game ever at club. Yeah, I've been going for 4 years and never had one. Weird. Even weirder is that my next game is also a 500 game. Oops, I gave it away...
