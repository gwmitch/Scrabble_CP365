#note i don't know if RUSE makes more sense. this is a hard situation for me.
>Andy: EEW N6 WEE +17 292
>Cesar: EHLNOST M5 NOH +24 319
#note this is a big screwup. i saw M7 HO, but I wanted to get rid of the extra consonant because i didn't like LN together. but ELNST is pretty strong especially with all those Is unseen. NOH also gives back more. -5 .... i always make mistakes in this type of situation, where it looks like it's going to be tight and close going into the endgame. it is important to use my tiles to the max here, and NOH puts it too much into his hands, i think.

>Andy: EFILS L2 FLIES +25 359
>Cesar: ENRSTTU 5K R..T. +17 365
#note ridiculous. if i looked a little harder, i coulda thought of D7 or F7 TA. ENRSTU goes with every letter in the bag  except for the J, and they all play if he doesn't block. but that is a big if; i'm not especially fond of this type of play. but surely my play isn't better. another screwup. -32%
>Andy: IS 15J SI. +18 377
>Cesar: AENNSTU 7C UN +5 370
#note now i have to fish, but the problem is that the J is still in the bag, and i have much more chances of drawing it now. truly good players think ahead in the previous turn with ENRSTTU and fish off the T. the best play but my win% is only 49 now as opposed to like 80 the previous turn. what a big screwup.
>Andy: ABCEIIS B2 IBICES +27 404
#note great play from andy, it is one of the two plays that wins 100%. B7 BI gives back less.
