#note Well, that was easy. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: JNPU E4 PUNJ. +28 28
>Matt_Canik: ELRTUYZ J6 ZE. +31 103
#note Didn't like how (P)UTZ throws the Z out in the TWS line. This blocked his bingo :)
>Geoff_Thevenot: DDEEIRS 6J .ED +13 41
#note Whoa, Geoff missed a bingo? He told me he was holding DESIRED here and zed blocked my bingo, but maybe he mistook his rack or maybe he really did miss presided. idk. 
>Matt_Canik: ILRTUVY 6C VI.YL +19 122
#note This doesn't open things up and dumps two of the three in the dreaded VUY combo.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?DEIRST 4C RI.TiDES +74 115
>Matt_Canik: GMNORTU 3I MUNGO +31 153
>Geoff_Thevenot: AFLO 5K FOAL +27 142

#note FOLEY! BAD BINGOBOY!
>Geoff_Thevenot: BIT F2 BI.T. +18 160
>Matt_Canik: AERTTXY I7 Y.T +20 173
#note With a lot of spots to play that X, I'll dump it next turn for points and try and get a bing down here, right?
>Geoff_Thevenot: ACE C3 C.A.E +22 182
>Matt_Canik: AEFKRTX 9F AX +36 209
#note Ok, running out of cheap X-spots, so i need to take this one
>Geoff_Thevenot: BEN 2H NEB +27 209

>Geoff_Thevenot: DI 10I ID +14 223
>Matt_Canik: AAEEERT H10 AERATE +25 279
#note Yeah, I'm just enabling the bingo coming this turn, but I'll have a a 50-pt lead prebingo so I can come back... and I need to dump these As and Es
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEGILST 12E GLA.IEST +68 291
#note I guess he didn't like how (E)GALITES allowed for a quick comeback.
>Matt_Canik: EEHPQSW O1 WEEPS +47 326
>Geoff_Thevenot: OW N1 OW +25 316
>Matt_Canik: HHIOQUV 14E QUO.H +19 345
#note Really need to get this crap dumped. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: CNOORRS 4L OR +19 335
>Matt_Canik: AHIILNV 15C VAIN +21 366
#note I liked this a lot
>Geoff_Thevenot: N K5 ..N +12 347
>Matt_Canik: ADGHILO B7 HIDALGO +69 435
#note Looking at the unseen pool, playing HIDALGO opens up the SHE/THE lane and lets him bingo out and win by like 3 or 4, but the only possible combination of letters that allows for that is if he's holding CINORST and I pull RR. I play the favorable odds, and it pays. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: CINORRS 14A OS +30 377
>Matt_Canik: RT A13 T.R +11 446
#note gg, whew!
