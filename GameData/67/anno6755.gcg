#note 2010 National Scrabble Championship, Dallas TX, August 2010 (TWL). Round One. Annotations by Lucas.
>Lucas: ADJORRU G9 ADJUROR +71 71
>Nigel: CDENOOW F14 WO +28 52
#note Lucked out enormously here. Nigel didn't play COMEDOWN or DOWNCOME.
>Lucas: EEFHILR 6F HE.LFIRE +80 151
>Nigel: ACDENOS K5 D.OCESAN +94 146
>Lucas: ABCIMNT 15E C..IAMB +39 190
>Lucas: ABCIMNT --  -39 151
#note I'd heard of CHORIAMB before, but confused the spelling with CORYMB. I had the right idea though: BICORN, MINORCA, and CORBINA all play here.
>Nigel: DHNOTVY 15D TH..NY +39 185
#note Didn't see it at the time, and both aitches are played, but HAWTHORNY!
>Lucas: ABCIMNT 8K .ABIN +30 181
#note Missed MANTRIC 13C.
>Nigel: DNORVVY 12C DYVO.R +28 213
>Lucas: ACEFMOT L11 MOC +22 203
#note With the open lanes (especially at 14I) COFT 7E looks like a much more reasonable option.
>Nigel: AENTTVW 5C WAVE +25 238
>Lucas: AEFRSTU 14J FASTER +42 245
>Nigel: AGINSTT O12 GI.T +21 259
>Lucas: BEIIPUU -BIIPUU +0 245
#note Probably worth keeping the P here. 
>Nigel: AEINNST N1 INANES +33 292
#note My immediate thought when Nigel played this was that he was looking for a blank. Nigel confirmed my suspicion after the game. But I had both blanks on my rack and was feeling pretty confident. 
>Lucas: ??AEEIO 13C OE +15 260
#note I knew something was here, but OEdIpEA(N) 2G was the bingo that I didn't want to burn time looking for, especially given what it would have opened for 58 points, so I didn't bother. Even so, I could have kept the D open with ORE H11. 
>Nigel: AIKQTUZ 1L QU.Z +96 388
#note Of course, OEdIpEAN would have prevented this.
>Lucas: ??AEEIL C2 ALE.IvEs +68 328
#note I saw vIEWaBLE, kALEWIfE, and bEWAILEd, but didn't see any comeback by playing them. ALEWIvEs, on the other hand, left a scoring hook with the K unseen, so I had to go for it.
>Nigel: AIKRSTT 1C KRAIT +24 412
#note So much for my plan. I was confused by him not playing TREK A8 and thus thought he had the X for D8. Many who saw this play thought Nigel was building one of his famous setups, but Nigel said he thought KALEWIVES was Collins-only and didn't want to expose his S if I challenged it off. Interestingly, he said the S was still valuable to him.
>Lucas: GINOPPU L1 .UIP +30 358
#note Didn't think of PUP B8, setting up the O and blocking the X-play which I thought Nigel had, and then I forgot about. For some reason, I also thought I remembered POPQUIZ as a Collins-only word, but it turned out to be phony, and was only listed in Webster's Second. Trying it would have been silly anyhow.
>Nigel: AEGISTU 8A AG.IST +24 436
#note Blocking PLEX, sealing the game.
>Lucas: BGLNOPX 4A OX.N +28 386
#note Poor endgame. PEGBOX M5 followed by BELON 9J or BLIN 6A is a cute out-in-two, but PLEB 4A followed by GOX B8 or EXON 9K scores even better. 
>Nigel: EEIU O1 .EE +16 452
>Lucas: BGLP A2 BL.G +7 393
#note BLIP 6A is better.
>Nigel: IU G1 .UI +4 456
