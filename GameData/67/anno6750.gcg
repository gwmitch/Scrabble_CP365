#note Had my opponent known USQUE takes an -S my huge X play wouldn't have been blocked!

#note NONTAX H1, but I don't like opening up another bingo lane with a blank unseen. Also since my opponent doesn't seem to think USQUE takes an S the board is mostly closed. My play sims best.

#note Great play. Unfortunately I don't have an A or E to make a block on the O column and there's one tile in the bag

#note I have at best a 50% chance to win as it turns out - four of his eight possible racks let him bingo out and four don't (EIIKNOS EIIKOS? EIIKON? IIKNOS?). I really needed him to have both remaining I's but the I was the last tile in the bag.
