>Tunnicliffe: AEEGLOU 8D LEAGUE +16 16
#note I didn't want to do 8C LEAGUE because of BE(LEAGUE)*. It needs the R! My positioning opens up COL(LEAGUE) and NON(LEAGUE).

#note Aw... missed REV(U)LSED. I was about to look in that spot, but decided to not waste the time. Jesse was taking a lot of time on his moves and it felt like I had a good chance to put him into time pressure early on.

>Tunnicliffe: AHIIKRS 4J .HIRK +28 232
#note I knew I was missing some weird spelling of RICKSHAW here. But 48 points?! I'm surprised CHIRK doesn't do so well in the sim. It felt solid.

>Matthews: AIIO 2B AIO.I +14 316
>Tunnicliffe: AEINNTT O6 AN. +18 354
#note Just trying to score some points. I looked and looked for a way to block both big QAT spots. But I didn't see anything. 
>Matthews: ADEEPQR C1 Q. +11 327
#note Huge relief to see the QAT possibility die off. But now how bingo prone is he? Jesse needs to draw one of three unseen T's for an unblockable bingo.
>Tunnicliffe: EINOTTT 1F TOTE +14 368
#note Huge tracking fail. The unseen R was supposed to be an N according to my tracking. I decided to block AMENDED, but would still lose to DAMP(E)NED. No point blocking that one because I would lose to O10 DAMPED anyways. Big tracking error, but I don't think it would have changed my play.
