#note KOI is interesting, as I have multiple draws for a bingo with an S, but I don't like what happens if I draw a consonant. I don't mind opening the board  with the lead and a blank.

#note BAP/PANTHER for 26 looks like the best acceptable play. I was pretty sure my play was phoney, but I figured I'd be in control if it stayed on the board.

#note VINO 5B wins the sim. I played VIM to destroy the bottom section of the board, but VINO scores more and makes it difficult to open the top left. Also, BHS is a pretty flexible leave considering all the vowels that are left. Also, there are a bunch of U's and T's left, so the O at the bottom is still a threat.

>Rafi: ABDHNOS 10J B.AND +30 300
#note There are multiple scoring options on row 5 like HONDA and BOND, but BRAND takes out a better bingo lane.
>Orry: JOT 2A JOT +32 273
>Rafi: AHIOSTU I13 US +22 322
#note I'm really not in a position to withstand a bingo here. US may be giving up the valuable S, but I'm also blocking the last good bingo lane. Also, with three U's unseen I need to unload my U. O4 HAO (leaving the ugly ISTU) sims best, and QUOIT looks like a decent option if I'm willing to leave open the O line, but with this board, blocking the O line is my priority.
>Orry: AEFLM E3 ..FLAME +24 297
>Rafi: AHIILOT O4 HI +20 342
#note D8 HAO, the sim winner, looked bad to me because it opens a lane, but the only real threat there is an ST or SN bingo. O4 THIOL looks best to me, but I didn't see it in the game. One benefit of HI is that I won't be overrun with U's.
>Orry: UU 6D U.U +5 302
>Rafi: ADILNOT 9D D.LI +18 360
#note DELI scores decently, has a good leave, and shuts down the bingo threat. What's not to like?
>Orry: ACER 8A CREA. +34 336
>Rafi: ADNOOST B5 ODO.ANTS +65 425
#note That pretty much ices it.
