>White: ACEHSST 8H SATCHES +82 82
#note No sweat.
>Black: DEEEOUU L8 .OUDU +18 18
#note Hated to do this, but it actually sims a point or two better than -EEOUU.
>White: AAFILOT K2 FOLATI. +24 106
#note Too turnover-y. COFA is clearly the play.
>Black: EEEERVZ 4J E.VEZ +34 52
#note This or FEZE.
>White: AEGLOPV 7G VAP +24 130
#note VOLGA 10K 31, yeah, that's probably better.
>Black: AEEGNPR 11E ENGRAPE. +98 150
#note Wouldn't have played if he blocked the D spot. Back in business.
>White: EEGGLOO N2 GO.E +28 158
#note I put down GOLOG 12A first, but realized it was a stupid play and picked it up. GOZE is the sensible choice.
>Black: DDIIRUW 6K .URDI +30 180
#note Clearly right - leaves me with a manageable rack and scores well.
>White: EGILMOU H11 .UGLE +21 179
#note Ooh, missed GULEMI(AS) from H1!
>Black: ADIIIWX O1 WII +23 203
#note Thought about (P)AIX, but this is better.
>White: EIMOOST 14F MO.IO +15 194
#note Uh, OSMOLITE?
>Black: AADISWX N8 .AXWADS +68 271
#note Don't think I've ever played this before.
>White: DEORSTY E5 YOSTER.D +74 268
#note Call me crazy, but I briefly considered forgoing the bingo and playing YEOD at O12.
>Black: AFHILOO O12 HOIF +56 327
#note One could argue for FILHOA 15A to get at the blanks, maybe.
>White: BIIIMRT 12A BIMI. +26 294
#note Quackle likes BIMID, but I'm not so sure. I need to open something, but IMBI D3 (setting up the TIMBI hook or RIO at C6 downward) seems more creative.
>Black: AAEJLOQ A12 .AJA +39 366
#note Awful leave, but I've got to keep the pedal to the metal.
>White: AEIKNRT 14A .IRK +30 324
#note Well, I couldn't expect him not to block the 3x3 lane, but damn, TIREBANK! JANK was probably better than JIRK here, given all those N's out.


>Black: ?ELOQRR -QRO +0 366
#note Trade as I did, or burn the blank and play QuOOL 6B? QUOOL has the better winning percentage, but it's fairly close.
>White: AEENTTY M12 TA +19 343
#note Too fishy. NEY F4, which I did next time, is fine.
>Black: ?BCELLR B10 CR.B.L +22 388
#note With a lead, this is obviously better than CLEB D2.
>White: EEENNTY F4 NEY +32 375
#note Leaves one in the bag. Hope he has the Q to wrestle with...
>Black: ??ELNNR D3 LENRo +21 409
#note I figured with N? I could draw anything and win. The Q's no problem; I have the blank and either (PA)QN(A) or QI/NI.
>White: EENNOQT I7 ..QN. +26 401
#note Not enough. Another heartbreaker.
>Black: ?NT G3 NiT +11 420
>Black:  (EENOT) +10 430
