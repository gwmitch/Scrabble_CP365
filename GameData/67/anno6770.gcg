>Scott_Leifer: AEEK 8H AKEE +16 16
>Matt_Canik: BBCOORV K4 COBB.R +24 24
#note Tops.
>Scott_Leifer: LOO 4I LO.O +12 28
>Matt_Canik: EINOOVW 9C INWOVE +19 43
#note I'm liking the turnover and relative defensivemess of this over wove 3L.
>Scott_Leifer: AQU 8A QUA +38 66
>Matt_Canik: EGORTWX 10E OX +55 98
#note Duh.
>Scott_Leifer: OPRY 11C ROPY +47 113
>Matt_Canik: EEGRTTW 12A GREW +32 130
#note I couldn't decide between this and TEW for a long time... 8 points is nice but double Ts is not. Quackle says this is no decision, and I made the right one. 
>Scott_Leifer: AAELMNT 13C MENTAL +34 147
#note He told me the rack, that's why I knew it.
>Matt_Canik: ?EIILTT 3C InTITLE +69 199
#note Also TILlITE, which I did not know. I like the end result in this exchange, though. 
>Scott_Leifer: ?AACHIS -  +0 147
#note Challenged. g1!
>Matt_Canik: AAEIOSU A7 A.UA +13 212
#note Obvious best.
>Scott_Leifer: ACN H12 C.AN +27 174
>Matt_Canik: EHIOOSU E3 .HOU +14 226
#note Q still sims UH 2E better, but I just don't like throwing that open with a blank out. 
>Scott_Leifer: AEINNST 2I STANINE +71 245
#note CANNIEST scores more, and LOCOS/STANINE doesn't set up a million-point counter. 
>Matt_Canik: EIIOPST 1M TIP +31 257
>Scott_Leifer: EEUV 12H .UVEE +20 265
>Matt_Canik: ?EILOSS M8 LOrISES +75 332
#note LEwISSON hits the triple, but overall I like lorises because the blank isn't on a DLS and it blocks anything coming from the N as well as basically anything else not -ing or ending in N.
>Scott_Leifer: AMY A12 .AMY +30 295
#note MY(n)A scores more and leaves the 15 row open if he's looking to bing. 
>Matt_Canik: ADFIIJT 6D F.JI +30 362
>Scott_Leifer: EH 2F HE +28 323
>Matt_Canik: ADEIRTZ 14H .DZ +33 395
#note So looking at the unseen pool, there's NOTHING that's gonna hit the TWS for him that's at all threatening to me. So I get greedy and play ADZ, hoping that either he opens something for me or I pull a bingo that plays on top of HE with my AEIRT leave. ZINE scores more, but I want a bingo and a convincing 140+ pt win. 
>Scott_Leifer: DFGR K11 F.D +14 337
#note He set down FRIG and I jumped (holding AEIRRST), but he looked at it for a while and then switched to FED. 
>Matt_Canik: AEIRRST 1D IRATE +27 422
#note Whatevers.
