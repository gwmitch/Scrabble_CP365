#note exchange 6 is correct
>Leah: EGILNOT 8G LENTIGO +70 70
>Hildebrand: EIJKOTW 7M JOW +38 38
>Leah: DEERRUX J6 EX.RUDER +70 140
#note 38-140.  Down 102 in just 2 turns.  Great.
>Hildebrand: EEIKLNT 7A NETLIKE +66 104
#note can the board be more wide open?
>Leah: CILT A4 CLI.T +30 170
#note Zev joked after the game, is EASTWOOD* good too?
>Hildebrand: AAINOSW 6N WO +31 135
#note Chickened out on O5 WAWA#.  I decided it was hyphenated.  WO is not too bad. about 4 points worse. Obviously keeping doubled A's is not great.  
>Leah: BEN 9M BEN +23 193
>Hildebrand: AAEINOS I5 AEO. +17 152
#note I7 ANA wins the sim by 4 points.
>Leah: AHPPY H1 HAPPY +59 252
#note oof, that scores like a bingo.
>Hildebrand: AEEFINS 10M EF +39 191
#note EF is best by a mile, but I have never played JOBE# before, and it takes balls of solid rock to make this play because I'm not entirely sure this is good.
>Leah: AGM K10 GAM +25 277
>Hildebrand: ABEINSS 14D SABINES +86 277
#note SABINES is best, but I didn't know D6 A(L)BINESS#, C1 BESAINTS#, or C4 BESTAINS#.  KEWL#!
>Leah: DEIRTVY D3 DEVI.TRY +82 359
#note Just when I caught up, back to 88 points back.
>Hildebrand: ?ADEINU 15A UNAIDEd +85 362
#note or UNAImED or UNAIrED or UNAIdED same place.  All with 0.2 points of each other.
>Leah: DOO G2 DOO +17 376
>Hildebrand: ?FLMQRR -LMQR +0 362
#note This is a weird exchange.  The board is quite closed.  Ordinarily you'd keep R? or MR? if you want to bingo, but since I'm not as  likely to bingo on this full board, I like keeping the F or the 6B spot or the 13I spot for backup in case I don't draw into a bingo.  Quack says this is 2.7 back of exchanging FQRR keeping LM?, but I think I was on to something with my reasoning.
>Leah: ACHO C1 CHAO +26 402
>Hildebrand: ?EFIORR 1A FI.O +30 392
#note Didn't know B10 FORREN# or FROREN#.  FORREN# wins the sim.  FICO is 1.1 points back.  Of course FOCI sims a little better as well.
>Leah: GILT 5K GILT +16 418
>Hildebrand: ?AEQRRU 12H QU..E +52 444
#note oh thank goodness this didn't get blocked.
>Leah: ARTZ 13L TZAR +28 446
>Hildebrand: ?AINRRS 2G ..RRAINeS +72 516
>Hildebrand:  (challenge) +5 521
#note or DARRAIgNS#, or just DARRAINS# for 22 win the game.  This took balls of solid rock to play, because I again haven't known this word for very long, and there was doubt.
