#note took ages on this.  Q says my move is not good, preferring M9 V(E)XeS. other M9 plays preferred are S(E)XTO, V(E)STS, V(E)X.  again, i'm not sure why one is better than any other.  I probably like VEX

#note didn't know the bingo that plays at J1.  I have no idea why I played KO(S) at J6 rather than a ton more points at E10, other than i was distracted by the woody allen documentary I was watching at the time.

#note I knew this Collins only one, but didn't know the other triple-triple that fits.  Took me ages to get to THREAVES as I had to scroll through the alphabet to get to V.

#note At this point, I'm more likely to find CSW only baby bingos than TWL only ones - they're fresher.

#note i missed the out-in-one outplay even though it's only 2nd best. my play is 3rd best.  You can work out the best sequence if you're feeling sadistic (one more point better than the out-in-one play).
