>Joel_Sherman: EGLO 8G LOGE +10 10
>Stefan_Rau: ADIJORY J2 JOYRID. +36 36
#note Equity-wise, it's basically a toss-up between this and playing it short with JOEY at J6. I'll take the points. 
>Joel_Sherman: CEIRT 9J RECTI +27 37
#note ...but of course JOYRIDE runs the risk of giving back easy points...
>Stefan_Rau: AADEMSV 3G VAM.SED +40 76
#note Too aggressive? Quackle prefers knocking out the S hook on JOYRIDER with VAS for 30 or DEVAS for 37. Meh. 
>Joel_Sherman: FGRT H1 GR.FT +39 76
#note Yeah, maybe that was too aggressive. 
>Stefan_Rau: AABIINU L7 IN.UBI +22 98
#note Fortunate to have a nifty cleanup for this trainwreck of a rack. 
>Joel_Sherman: AEPRSTV H8 .VERPAST +98 174
#note Dang it. 
>Stefan_Rau: AADEMSW 2J .AWED +42 140
#note WA(T)E(R)DAMS was a lovely find on my part, I think. Too bad it's only good in Imaginopods. 
>Joel_Sherman: AEINOTX 12F EX.IAT.ON +68 242
#note Oh my. That's just beautiful. 
>Stefan_Rau: AFILLMS 14A MISFALL. +80 220
>Stefan_Rau: AFILLMS --  -80 140
#note Ah yes, my patented technique of trying to force something that isn't there. This game isn't yet so far out of reach for me to be attempting such silliness. Joel didn't even let a second tick off his clock before challenging this and was appropriately derisive on the walk to the challenge station. 
>Joel_Sherman: ALRTUU 14H .UTURAL +18 260
>Stefan_Rau: AFILLMS 1L ALIF +38 178
#note OK, now that that stupidity is out of my system, let's try to actually chip away at this deficit. The biggest score is 48 for the disconnected double-double MAF(T)I(R)S (which I didn't see), but Q prefers this by a hefty margin. 
>Joel_Sherman: ACO 5E COA. +12 272
>Stefan_Rau: BEKLMSS 10F KE.LS +43 221
#note Wins the sim by a bit over 11E SMERK (41). 
>Joel_Sherman: GNOU 15D UNGO. +7 279
#note I'm catching a break here as Joel seems to have hit a rough patch with the tiles and can't do much more than block. 
>Stefan_Rau: ?ABEHMS E2 BrE.HAMS +66 287
#note Bailed out by a very timely blank draw, I'm improbably in the lead. 
>Joel_Sherman: IQ 8N QI +44 323
>Stefan_Rau: EHNNOYZ 8A ENZY. +69 356
#note Oh my. I am the world's biggest luckbox and this is suddenly a different game. 
>Joel_Sherman: NOW 15M WON +25 348
#note Luckily for me, Joel can either block or score, but not both. He spent most of his remaining 12 minutes on this move, and laid this down with a comment of "OK, I'll let YOU figure it out." Giving me a chance to botch an endgame is usually a pretty solid strategy for my opponents. 
>Stefan_Rau: ?AEHNOP A8 .ArPHONE +98 454
#note Yeah, with this draw, it was about all I could do to keep from falling off my chair in amazement about what a GODDAMN LUCKY ASSHOLE I am. Yow.
