#note whifffff. GIRLIE is clearly a better play hee. Q likes holding AEILR more here, which seems like the intuitive thing to do but I like to overthink things. Q also prefer AGILE and GLIA to exchanging.

#note I told Geoff after the game that I really didn't agree with this play. I still don't. 
>Matt_Canik: AEGHKLR 7G ELK +26 26
#note This wins a sim against a random rack, and probably just gets better when you consider Geoff to be bingo-prone. 
>Jef_Tevvunoh: BEEIPRW 9I PEW +23 27
>Matt_Canik: AEGHNRV 10J HEN +32 58
#note PEW came very quickly- he's probably holding something bingoey like EIRT or AEST or something. That weakens (W)HARVE. HE or HEN or HER or HERN? 
>Jef_Tevvunoh: BEIIOR 8K ORIBI +30 57
>Matt_Canik: AGIJRVZ M7 Z.G +25 83
#note Was so excited about Z(I)G setting up JAB. 
Then I noticed JA(B) setting up ZIG, but I had already shown Geoff my Z. Damn.

#note Sim greatly prefers this but with all the As out it seems kinda reckless. 2x2s using the blank seem silly. VOWED or DERM? 
>Jef_Tevvunoh: EILX M11 .EXIL +30 116
>Matt_Canik: ?ADIMRS 15H DISMA.eR +149 303
#note I could not decide if this was a word for a while, but I had so many other bingos that I figured I could definitely try it. Glad I did!
