#note Another close call spot.  The pool is pretty junky, with only 1 A and 2 E's left.  So, I thought there was an ok chance he can't hit this floating Z.  This also keeps a good leave, giving me a good shot at bingoing down O.  The downside is the variance: if he hits this Z, IF I don't bingo down O, I'm in a bad spot.
