#note I liked how Dean might be unsure of the hook to this.  Also, only 1 S and 1 ? left.   Simming best is DYNE.  missed it.  Don't mind my choice.

#note Tricky spot that I misplayed.  I should play 6F PAT to block NITERIE.  My thinking was that Dean may challenge SOTHS, giving me a 2nd turn to block NITERIE.  But that thinking is too optimistic - he'll let this stay to play his bingo.  PAT is much superior.  I also miss STARTUP

#note Another tricky spot.  The Q is so horrible on this board; even if I draw an I, I can't play it.  B10 ADMAN looks tempting, but I need to ditch the Q.  I also need to try to fish for the ? or the S -- very key tiles on this board.  I'm not sure any ply on quackle will realise just how horrible Q is on this board.  But maybe I'm overworrying about the Q, and there will be enough situation where I draw the U.

#note Simming best is (AG)ED.   I want to minimize exposure to the Q, and figure my blank will help me win a close endgame.  
>Dean_S: ADEINST 13G STAINED +83 414
>E_Tran: ?DEIMNR 14J DEMoN +37 387
#note STAINED was a killer.  After the game, Dean suggested I play HIED, or 13E ED.  His exch 3 should be a bit worrisome so it might be in my interest to block the bingo lane.  Since I have the blank, I can eke out wins even if I draw the Q.  This might be a tad results-oriented though
