#note Q likes YOGEE to YOGA. I guess this is paranoid. 
>David_Whitley: DEEPRTW C7 P.WTERED +92 166
#note Held for a while... it's close to game over if this is good, even with my counter. But it doesn't make sense for Whitley to play this with PEWTER 8J for 52 available, and I know PEWTERER is good, so I accept it. Doh.

#note Maybe I should take the more volatile placement? I don't think so since I just get wrecked on counters. 
>David_Whitley: ?JZ 4L J.zZ +58 282
#note I held this too.... I knew JIZ# was collins and (correctly) thought this one was too, but it's just so obviously a word that I talked myself out of it. Jeez. 
>Matt_Canik: ACEIIOQ 14A QA.I +28 233
#note Maybe I overthught this, but with only two unseen Is I am setting up a lot of points for myself while opening a new part of the board. Q doesn't like it. 
>David_Whitley: EIRRSTT 15D TERRITS +77 359
#note I mean, I guess it's fine since he was going to bingo anyway (GRITTERS)
