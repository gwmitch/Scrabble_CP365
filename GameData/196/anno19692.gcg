>Jonathan_Lindh: ABDENTT 8D BATTED +24 24
>Harriet: FNO 9C FON +16 16
#note The World Series is going on now so this is very fitting. Best play too!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEIINO -EEIIO +0 24
#note Quackle likes EIDE I6 best but sims my swap as 3rd best. Still go with mine.
>Harriet: ELMU C9 .LUME +20 36
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENOQYY 11B Q.AY +32 56
#note Best play again!
>Harriet: AIN 12A NI.A +29 65
#note Steve got away with a phony on me?    &T^&$#%!!!!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EENORWY 7E WEEN +21 77
#note YOWE 7H was best despite one less point due to better leave. The last two turns are when things got away from me.
>Harriet: HRSU 6C RUSH +36 101
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AIMORY C3 MAR.Y +28 105
>Harriet: DER A12 .ERD +15 116
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?GIILLO D2 GIL +16 121
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?GIILLO --  -16 105
#note I missed GLADIOLI 4A and tried a phony GIL? This lost me the game here combined with NIMA* and WEEN vs. YOWE. Terrible game.
>Harriet: IKO D2 KOI +22 138
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?GIILLO E1 GILL +19 124
>Harriet: BER B4 REB +33 171
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AIIOST 6H OI +5 129
#note No bingos here? Yes it's true. This play blocked Steve's first 9 of the year too but set him up for a 7.
>Harriet: ?DEGHOU 5H tOUGHED +77 248
#note Ha Ha Steve! Quackle likes A1 DOUGH for 50 and keeping the blank. I don't know...Quackle be crazy!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEIRST 15A .IASTERs +77 206
#note A14 RESTRAIN 2 points better but very risky. DIASTERS 15A gets 2 less and allows a moderate amount risk with the triple letter score.
>Harriet: CETV L1 VETC. +34 282
>Jonathan_Lindh: AELNPWZ 1E .LAZE +45 251
#note Quackle is right! 3I WALTZ is better than my 1E GLAZE because of positioning. Watch what happens next...
>Harriet: JNOU 3I JUN.O +40 322
#note &*$%$!!!!!!!!!!!
>Jonathan_Lindh: GINOPSW 14F WO +28 279
#note Quackle says I did the right play but I'm skeptical.
>Harriet: INPT A1 PINT +27 349
#note *&$%$%!!!!!!!!!!!! It happened again!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGIINPS I8 .IP +7 286
#note Quackle likes VIGA 1L instead of my fish DIP. I almost had it worked out.
>Harriet: CIOTX 11I TOXIC +35 384
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAGINOS H1 .A +11 297
#note $%$&*$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Again! Quackle says I got 4th best play, but I whiffed on AGNOSIA! Just chicked out on it. Two different places to play it. I still wasn't going to win the game, but a 2nd bingo is always nice and keeping a reasonable spread is always better.
>Harriet: ADEERSV 13F ADVERSE +76 460
#note Yeah...I suck...yeah...
>Harriet:  (AFGINOS) +22 482
