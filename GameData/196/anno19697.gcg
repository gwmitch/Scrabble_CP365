>Matt_Canik: AEEIMSX O4 MAXES +90 106
#note Given my opponent is Steve Glass, I think that when he doesn't have an S he is going to block HEDONISTS for like 6 points next turn. But I decided to play MAXES. MIXES is also a good play.

#note I saw VORTICAL and then remembered looking that word up at nationals and it was invalid. No, it's still totally a word. I don't know what word I was thinking of. I passed the other stuff like COLORIST/CORTISOL. LOTIC/SWIVET is nice too.
