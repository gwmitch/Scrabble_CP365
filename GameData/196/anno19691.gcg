>Harriet: AACHLQR 8D CRAAL +20 20
#note H8 LARCH was clearly the best, and I saw this play, but I chickened out once again.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ALOR D8 .ORAL +14 14
#note Almost the same word!
>Harriet: AHNOQRT 11C Q.T +24 44
#note TRANQ F6 QANAT in the 11 row. A lot of better plays than this but this isn't 100% bad.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AT C11 .AT +26 40
#note Feel my eyes, I got double vision!
>Harriet: AAHNORR 9G HOAR +23 67
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEW J6 WEA. +15 55
>Harriet: ?ACINRU E6 CU. +5 72
#note This was just terrible. I1 cRUCIAN was clearly the best play and J8 ANURIC I saw but chickened out on. I even considered D10 RUN to fish off the stupid U. That would have prevented what comes next...
>Jonathan_Lindh: ITZ 10F ZIT +41 96
#note Sometimes I suck at this game.
>Harriet: ?AFIINR B13 IF +12 84
#note My play simmed as the 5th best choice. Not terrible. Gets rids of the clunky F, the excess I, and opens a bingo lane (or two).
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGOUV K2 VOGUE +23 119
#note I promise you it gets better for me. A lot better.
>Harriet: ?AFINRY A7 FRAYINg +91 175
#note B15 FRAYING was 7 points better and I didn't even see it. This play is probably more defensive given all that can be front hooked onto IT. E4 FRAYINGS is also good and might have drawn a challenge. I was confused between FRAYINGS and the phony FLAYINGS8 at the time however. FoRAYING D4 rounds out the 4 potential bingos with this rack.
>Jonathan_Lindh: KNO 3J N.OK +16 135
>Harriet: BDL 7H BL.D +25 200
#note Can't read my writing here so no rack handy.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BT 9C B.T +14 149
>Harriet: AAGJPST N1 GASP +23 223
#note This simmed as the second best play. I4 JAGS for 30 points simmed as the best but uses an S.
>Jonathan_Lindh: LOO 1L LO.O +18 167
>Harriet: DIU K9 DUI +17 240
>Jonathan_Lindh: DRSU 4H DRU.S +24 191
#note DUI and DRUGS one after the other? Lol!
>Harriet: AEEIJNT H1 JEE. +36 276
#note Best play! This was huge because this set me up for a bingo and got rid of the clunky J for a good amount of points.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EINORSV 12H VERSION +83 274
>Jonathan_Lindh: EINORSV --  -83 191
#note I set up DUI there holding the T (only playable hook) and hoped MAYBE Diana would try DUIS*. I actually didn't think she would, but I guessed wrong...to my benefit. ENVIROS O4 forming PE and ENVIROS was vastly better than this. Common stem bingos are fundamental!
>Harriet: ADEINTT 12G TAINTED +73 349
#note This was the dagger! The miss on CRUCIAN, the second best placement of FRAYING. The challenge and the play of TAINTED redeems all. DUIT drew a challenge too!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EINORSV -EINO +0 191
#note Lost Challenge.
>Harriet: EEINOPW H12 .WEE +21 370
#note AWEE was the 4th best play. Best was C3 WEEPIE for 24 points. I can see why.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?GIORSV 13F VO. +13 204
>Harriet: EEIMNOP O4 EM +10 380
#note O4 IMPONE for 38 points instead of the garbage I played. I jsut wanted that tripe word score lane closed off.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIMN 6B MIN.E +17 221
>Harriet: EHIINOP G2 OP +16 396
#note Horrible play! M9 HOIDEN was 28 points and a lot better. I know that word too! I sort of wanted to be done with the game at this point.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EENY M9 NEE.Y +20 241
>Harriet: EHIINSX N8 HEX +56 452
#note Best play and I was lucky to pick up the X here.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?GIRS O7 RIG +31 272
#note There were outplays that scored much less such as GRISON D1, but raw points become more important than spread at club. Who wants a 260 something final score?
>Harriet: IINS 15A IS +12 464
#note A7 FIN for 2 more.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?S 1H .uS +9 281
#note I12 ISM or I10 ASCI for quite a few more? I think Diana wanted to be done at this point.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (IN) +4 285
