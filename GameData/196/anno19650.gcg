#note BOW, BROWN, BROW are better in terms of just raw points + leave against a random opponent. Against Mike though, I really prefer to have a closed board, especially with a small raw lead and the blank in hand to boot. I stand by this play, which really weakens the top of the board by paralelling, and leaves the rest of the board to fall soon.

#note I can also play PEIN or PRIM, and probably would on a more open board. Here, however, it seems like scoring points now with the blank is better because I'm not getting much better than 60 on this board, at least not if the game goes as planned (even if he ends up making big openings hopefully they are ones I can close).

>Noah: AADEIMO O7 IDEA +33 256
#note I'm usually partial to the O over the I on boards like this, even with IOOO out. Quackle says my average score is indeed slightly higher next turn after IDEA, for what it's worth.

#note Thought of TALUK but it's such an unnecessary risk.

#note This seems fine, though I was really worried about playing it. Keeping AET seemed good with the pool and the C seemed weaker for him to play from than usual, though I will say that I made a counting error and thought there were A LOT more tiles in the bag -- and thus the pool even more consonant heavy. Still though, I don't really like anything else better than this.
