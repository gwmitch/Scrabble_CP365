#note Weird opening rack. Tempted to exchange but ELN and EMN both seemed a bit too mediocre.

#note I want to be as defensive to bingos as can be after his play of DEW. If I'm certain he has an S, I think ODEA is better, but it didn't seem like an S was totally guaranteed here, so I was cool with sacrificing point. Another nice thing about this play is that it opens a decent scoring spot that gives me better responses to Evans's bingo.
>Evans: OO 7H .OO +13 20
>Noah: DEINNOP K4 POIND +22 50
#note This was tough. Again, I want to be very defensive to bingos, which means opening fewer eights lanes. I thought about PION, both spots for POIND, and both spots for POND. PONIED and OPINED, which I didn't see, seem to open too many more bingo possibilities for Evans and not accomplish much that either POIND doesn't. I liked POIND K4 better than POND K5 because the O didn't seem super dangerous, but EN was an improvement over EIN, and the column L scoring spot seemed good for me. Similarly, POIND K4 seemed better than POND K4 because of leave. Finally, POIND K4 opened a nicer variety of scoring spots and worse bingo lanes than POIND K3 or PION K4, while also not opening an S hook in case Evans gets some high-scoring tiles and doesn't have a bingo but does have a good score. So K4 POIND. Any disagreements with the analysis?

#note This felt very weird to play, like it couldn't possible be right. I did indeed miss UNEVE(N), which is odd because I thought of the word. Huge mistake.

#note Also thought about MILLIER and IMPERIL, but dismissed them. IMPERIL is reasonable in a situation where I'm a bit of a dog, but I think I'm not here. Didn't think of IMPEL, which is kind of neat because I can draw IMPELLER/IMPELLOR pretty often. Quackle still likes this better than IMPEL in a sim, I guess because there are already great opportunities on this board.

#note Didn't think of W(ID)TH, which is also a good play. 
>Evans: ?AAAEST 15E AA +9 272
#note Evans's actual rack -- Conrad pointed out AnATASE after the game.
>Noah: EILNNRU D9 EN.IR. +39 312
#note Also thought about RE(Q)UIN, but this seemed intuitively better. It does indeed sim a lot better. I guess part of it is the U working well with the Q on column M.
