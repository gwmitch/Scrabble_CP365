#note It plays above for one more, don't know how I missed that.  Q likes 7G VOE which I didn't even consider but absolutely wrecks the board.

#note Tough turn, I'm down a bingo and I'm getting close to a bingo but there's nothing to do with these tiles.  I didn't like playing this without the E, but I couldn't find much else.  Q agrees with this.
>Josh_Castellano: BEY 15H BYE +26 187
>Sam_Masling: AEIOORS C10 .OO +12 102
#note I don't think it's worth it to drop the ER here and with 6 T's and 5 N's still in the bag I'm fine with the leave.

>Sam_Masling: AEHIIRS 13I HI +12 114
#note Probably AHI here.

#note Wasn't sure that BRAVA took an s.
>Josh_Castellano: AOT A1 OAT +19 236
>Sam_Masling: IILLNOZ L3 ZILLION +90 276
#note Well that came out of nowhere.  I was really hesitant to put this down because a zillion isn't a real number but I'm glad I did.  And somehow now I'm up 40.

#note I saw the C3 spot but for some reason I thought this scored more.

#note Closing off lanes and scoring
>Josh_Castellano: ETV 12H VET +19 306
>Sam_Masling: ADGHIRS N1 .RGS +30 384
#note CP says I should leave off the S, but if he has the blank it's not worth it to give him that big line imo.
>Josh_Castellano: MNU 13A MUN +22 328
>Sam_Masling: ADDHIIT H6 HI. +6 390
#note Apparently I only win 70% of the time after this but unless he has a 9 from RE then it's very very hard for him to come back.
>Josh_Castellano: CO A13 .OC +21 349
>Sam_Masling: ?ADDFIT 15M DeF +27 417
#note And I draw the other blank, weird...
Oh wow FADDIsT plays in two spots.  Didn't know that word.
