>Matt_Canik: CIKNORT 5H ..CK +26 85
#note Man, I looked for 2x2s but didn't see CITHERN. This is risky, holding something like INORT, but with that E open and other opportunities I decided it'd be ok.

>Matt_Canik: BEMOORX 7A OBOE +21 278
#note JEE smells like a fish to me, especially since it went down so fast. Decide to block here. Maybe I should just keep running with OXBO(W) and hope he doesn't draw one?
