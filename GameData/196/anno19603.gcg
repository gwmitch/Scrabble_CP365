#note Definitely too much defense.  I figured George is worse on closed boards, but no reason to sacrifice so much and still give hotspots.  DETAINER/RETAINED are fine.

#note Sim likes HILA in the same spot, to set up my R.  I'm behind, so some risks are needed.

#note BOHEMIAN is cute.  I did strongly consider N8 AMOEBAN to block the best bingo line on this board devoid of bingo lines.  Unfortunately, I wasn't sure if AMOEBAN or AMOEBAL were phony or good, and definitely couldn't risk losing a turn.

#note Sim likes YORE or ONERY.  The U is good because of the Q, and there are a lot of vowels left.

#note Free turn really gave me some breathing room.  I figure if his best play is to fish off KADI, I should block it.  I was also low on time.
