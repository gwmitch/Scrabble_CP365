#note Man this is so bad. SOYA is head and shoulders above the rest here. GOY is also an easy play that's better.

#note dicks. SEABOARD. I am so bad. I didn't want to play ROSA(C)EA for 36, but Q likes it way more.

>Matt_Canik: ?AEGNOS O12 SAGO +32 243
#note I decide early on that if I can't find a bingo from the N then I shouldn't bingo here since SAGO is so strong for me. I see NONWAGES* and NONGAMES* and can't decide if either of them are good, causing me to completely overlook NEGATONS!!!!

Even if I do see NEGATONS, I don't know if I'd play it. I'm still down points and a tempo so I think I should cash in points while I can and worry about that bingo later.

#note Held and (correctly) released.
>Matt_Canik: ?AEHNNS L1 HENN. +24 267
#note I didn't see the three bingos here - UNSHA?EN KPV. I guess those are the plays here if I'm not horrible at scrabble. 
I can play HAS but I just don't see me bingoing often enough with ENN?... the S is weak on the board but still helps me bingo. I decided to make as many lanes as possible to confuse chris.

#note So I NEED to score a ton to outrun chris' play and get really lucky to pull a bingo here.
