>Jonathan_Lindh: AIM 8H AMI +10 10
#note AMI F8 would have been better. Too many obvious extensions of AMI. In fact, I'm about to play one...
>Harriet: ?ELNORS K5 SNORkEL +80 80
#note One of a bunch that hits the double double. AMIR, AMIE, AMIS, and AMIN are all good. There may even be others.
>Jonathan_Lindh: KU 10I UK. +17 27
>Harriet: DEFGITU H10 GIFTED +54 134
#note This was the pivotal move of the game. GUKE* is phony but Tom didn't challenge it off. I confused it with the valid GUDE. Correct play is F6 FEUDING which I was about to play. This play would be huge.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IQ G11 QI +27 54
>Harriet: ?ABEIRU 15H .AUBRIEs +83 217
#note I told you GIFTED would be huge! DAUBRIES was the best bingo and even drew a challenge! H1 AUBRIETA is also nice, although 3 points less.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AETTUYZ -AE +0 54
#note LOST CHALLENGE
>Harriet: AEGIIMY 14M AYE +25 242
#note AYE was highest scoring and 3rd best play but L2 YAGI sims best due to better leave. I'll take the points and plugging up an S bingo lane.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EOTV J2 VOTE +17 71
#note This is election season after all.
>Harriet: BEGIILM I3 MIB +24 266
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ATU L4 UTA +14 85
>Harriet: CEGILNW M6 WING +17 283
#note Quackle wants me to fish off the W with H4 WIT. Come on Quackle! Where do you see any bingo lanes that could fit a C or G? My play is more defensive with the lead, and once again, scores more.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AORT 13K TORA +20 105
>Harriet: CELNORT 7E CLONE +16 299
#note CORNLET* looked tempting but I wisely passed. CLONE was not on list of top choices. Preserving the lead here.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EINSV 13C INVES. +33 138
>Harriet: CEEOPRT 12A COPE +30 329
#note Best play again!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AOX A12 .OXA +39 177
#note Unlucky.
>Harriet: EFNRTUZ F7 .UTZ +33 362
#note Best play! 4 out of 9 turns I got Quackle's best play! Not bad.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADDINOS B14 ID +27 204
#note Unlucky again.
>Harriet: EFLNNRW 8M .EW +18 380
#note Quackle likes WREN M1 better and probably rightfully so as WREN leaves better rack balance. I did NEW to block NAWS* which isn't even a word. I need to work on my 3's and 4's.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEHOPS 10B GROO. +19 223
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEHOPS --  -19 204
#note GROOZ*? There's TROOZ, GROSZ, GROSZE, and GROSZY. This is a mutant hybrid of these words and therefore needs to go.
>Harriet: DFLNNRT F12 D.FT +23 403
#note Best play! I'm getting the hang of this! 5 of 11 plays are best plays.
>Jonathan_Lindh: OR E5 RO. +10 214
>Harriet: AHLNNRY D4 NAY +19 422
#note Quackle likes NAH a whole lot better in the same spot. I'm not sure why.
>Jonathan_Lindh: GHO C3 HOG +20 234
#note This was a very smart move given Tom was behind and 2 S's were out. AGAR is valid and so is SHOG. Time to plug this up.
>Harriet: EHP B2 PEH +27 449
#note I don't remember my rack, but this definitely ended up being a great play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILRSS A4 SAILERS +82 316
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILRSS --  -82 234
#note Tom is desperate here and I know HON only takes a front hook of C for CHON. Tom is drawing dead here.
>Harriet: ADEJLNR 2J .ANED +18 467
#note Quackle likes other things, but I think I can milk this and play L12 JO for another 18 points.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILRSS A4 AIRLESS +82 316
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILRSS --  -82 234
#note I was right!
>Harriet: JLR L12 J. +18 485
#note Done and done!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILRSS 1M RAS +14 248
>Harriet: LR 3I ..L +7 492
#note K1 LAR is the outplay and best play but after a bad try of GIL* in a game against Steve, I doubted myself. I really should know my 3's cold. I really should.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EILS 10D LE. +12 260
>Harriet: R E10 .R +4 496
#note Could have been 501-248 if I remembered MOR was good. nstead, it's 500-260.
>Harriet:  (IS) +4 500
