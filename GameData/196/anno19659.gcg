>Margaret_Harkness: EILNOSU -??? +0 0
#note No idea what the rack was just she changed 3.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: BDFOOTY 8D BOOTY +26 26
#note And so it was that it came down to the final game, when I knew I would have to inflict a blowout to have any chance of winning the thing. The game started well: my concentration was fucking absolute, and I decided quickly that I am so good with F that keeping it was more beneficial since B and D don't go together. FOOTY is preferred by Quackle, but hey - it's about comfort and the margin is tiny, it's mostly because it's points. BOOFY is superior and new, FOODY also plays well. 
>Margaret_Harkness: EPZ 9C ZEP +32 32
>Daniel_O'Dowd: DEEFIIJ 7F JIF +34 60
#note Perhaps the pivotal moment of the tournament. I phony again, but she doesn't spot it and it goes unchallenged. Thus the entire game is changed on one move. I could instead play JEFE, a word I knew, perhaps I was deliberately trying to go bingo-aggressive for obvious reasons. 
>Margaret_Harkness: GHLLRRS -?? +0 32
#note Again, unknown rack, swapped 2. Must have had horrible luck cos her tournament results since this indicate she's at a high level.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ADEEITV 10D DEVIATE +82 142
#note Bingo number one. 
>Margaret_Harkness: ABHT 11H BATH +26 58
>Daniel_O'Dowd: DFIINNU H4 NIF.. +15 157
#note A bad pickup, I remember I spent a while agonising on NIFFY being valid, on it being worth it. There are lots of better moves. Apparently I missed IF/JIFF, which is at least consistent. New hook BEDU yields DUN/FUN in 11, while DIF/JIFF for 32 is also fine. BEDUIN also plays, FUNDI/FET are new, NIDIFY too.
>Margaret_Harkness: AMX 12K MAX +31 89
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ?CDEINU 12B INDUCEs +72 229
#note Luck falls my way at the critical juncture, bingo number 2. CUNDIES, DEUCING, EDUCING, NUCLUDE among others hook MAXI for a higher score, or there's INDUCES/SNIFFY for 84 - I am certain that part of this board vision poorness was time control.
>Margaret_Harkness: AEGNRRS 5D EARR.NGS +86 175
#note Bingo number three keeps her in touch. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AEMNOSW 4C WAME +28 257
#note WAME is score-greed on a hard board, since bingos are not likely in the next few moves. Better can be achieved with 4A MEOW/WE for more points too - odd that I should miss that, I guess these tournaments are as much stamina and mindset as much as anything else, because if I had slept a full night I am sure I would see such things, but then without the caffeine I'd never last a full day, and I'm sure the 7 games thing changes it too. WOXEN also does enough, WOMANS plays too. 
>Margaret_Harkness: Q B11 Q. +11 186
>Daniel_O'Dowd: NOOOSSU 13B SOON +29 286
#note But here we see one of my best plays of the whole tournament. From that rack to get out with OSU is a triumph! OONS is a new word, this is best and makes me already a massive favourite.
>Margaret_Harkness: EKW L10 WE.K +21 207
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ADEOOSU -OUAO +0 286
#note Here I decided to cash in some of my lead for a change of tiles, knowing that bingo pressure might affect her. I therefore missed KUE/XU for 32, ODA/OW for 27, KUDO, DOUANE, DOONA.
>Margaret_Harkness: ADEILRV -???? +0 207
#note Another swap.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: CDEEISY N11 DICEY +35 321
#note I decided to risk MAXI, having obviously seen it a few days earlier, and DICEY, which doesn't quite look right in the vein of HOLEY two games earlier. The ES leave is also perfect. Quackle agrees - DEICE is new and also good, ABSEYS is there.
