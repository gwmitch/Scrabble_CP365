#note Kolton overdrew and revealed AEL. I put back the L which I wasn't totally sure about. Quackle agrees.
>Noah: AEFJMOS 9C JAM +28 28
#note I thought I liked the board shape best after this play, though I could be convinced otherwise. It also seemed better than JAM 7C because it set up FOE, though Quackle thinks it's close. 
>TeamK: LPU 10D PUL +19 95
>Noah: EFNNOSV H4 FOVE. +15 43
#note I dismissed OVENS too quickly because it just looked like there had to be a better play on a reasonably open board, but really it's best by a lot. NNS is not so great and 12 points really is, plus I'm setting up my F really well. This is a huge mistake.
>TeamK: ADELRST K8 DARTLES +78 173
>Noah: DENNSST 9J S.ND +9 52
#note Feels really weird to make this play, but it looks right, keeping the board as open as possible to a comeback.

>TeamK: INOORTV 15L OV.N +24 231
#note Actual rack.
>Noah: HIINOSY M2 NOISY +34 160
#note I could do YONI 4K but I I don't see much point -- easy to block off and scores so much less, plus the S doesn't have much hook value on this board.
>TeamK: EFIORTW M11 FEW +35 266
>Noah: AEHINWY 2J WHI.EY +46 206
#note Opening a pretty good scoring spot isn't great here but it's outweighed by keeping slightly better with a pool well-stocked with vowels, going for blanks, and scoring two more.
>TeamK: GGIIORT 1F TRIGO +23 289
>Noah: ACIINRR 2B CIRRI +22 228
#note Not a lovely play but seems good -- AYIN is not what I want to do right now as I'd rather get some chances at good racks than probably have mediocre racks.
>TeamK: EGIKOOO D1 I.OKO +20 309
>Noah: ADEHNUZ 4K ZE.N +41 269
#note Seemed better than HA, as DENUZ wasn't doing that much on this board besides ZEIN, while ADHU maybe could bingo, do something with the Q, etc., while keeping HA and letting me draw another tile toward the blank.
>TeamK: AEGIOU G7 A.IEU +17 326
>Noah: AADHLQU H11 HADAL +35 304
#note QUALD is not a good keep here and I really need to go for the blank. Most other plays here are also short, though QUA(S)H is an interesting idea. With Kolton consistently turning over vowels though, II?? is pretty likely from him and any of those tiles puts me in a rough position after QUASH. HADAL still accomplishes the goal of keeping the board more open to a comeback, and making it so that I can still maybe win after a block (ACQUIRE, SQUAT, etc.). 
>TeamK: GP O1 G.P +27 353
>Noah: ?IOQRUU 6M .OU +8 312
#note I regrettably didn't see UDO here, which may be a huge mistake. UDO leaves open multiple threats but also blocks bingo possibilities for Kolton through the D or A--S. Like with YOU, I probably only win if I draw ACQUIRE* plays, but UDO makes it so that I'm much less likely to lose if I do hit one.
