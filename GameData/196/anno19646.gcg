#note I couldn't remember if POGEY or POGIE* was invalid, so I decided to forego the risk and play ATOPY.

#note if I know PIGGIER, VIRL becomes the play immediately. But I didn't. 
>Patricia_Barrett: ?ADENOR I2 ApRONED +65 112
#note RAT(I)ONED I8 is sick. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEHLRZ J2 HAED +35 104
#note A weird position. The obvious equity play candidates are HAZE/HAZEL/HAZED but those give up a lot. RAZED is out because I don't know PIGGIER. LAZ(A)R is an option as well, as is just not playing off the Z this turn. 
But above all of those sims ZA, 2.5 ahead of any other option. I saw it but DEHLR just seemed so counterproductive as a leave. I guess Pat just can't score well after ZA. (Indeed- Pat scores 8 fewer after ZA than after any other candidate plays except HAED and HALED J5, which were my other two main candidates.) 

Also noteworthy - based on pat's reaction to her draw I think she has a pretty solid rack.

#note No spot for ZORILLE :(
>Patricia_Barrett: FNORT L4 FRONT +31 191
>Patricia_Barrett: FNORT --  -31 160
>Matt_Canik: EEHILMU 6C ELEMI +32 186
#note Obviously Pat didn't have a Z play or she'd have done that last turn. So I don't need to block the spot. I don't see anything that really pulls a lot of words there, but holding an E will help my odds some if I play something like H1 UH. But them I'm only drawing 2 fresh tiles. I decided to run with the equity and just draw a bunch of new stuff. Q prefers this. 
>Patricia_Barrett: FNORT 7C FOR +25 185
>Matt_Canik: ABDHSTU 3B BAH +29 215
#note I decided it was probably appropriate to inhibit the Z spot now while holding DS for IMPLODE later. Q prefers me to just pull the trigger on HABUS/IMPLODES now by about 3.

#note aw :(
>Matt_Canik: DEOSTUV L1 VOTED +40 255
>Patricia_Barrett: ?AAESTT M3 AT +10 237
#note Pat spent a really long time here. I presumed she was holding pretty well and a blank was definitey within range. This was her actual rack, so she had about the best possible leave that would justify this play. 
>Matt_Canik: IIRSTUW F10 TUI +13 268
#note I don't know how the knowledge that Pat is holding really well should change what I do here. Maybe I play WI(G) and try to pull a counterbingo? But there's really nowhere *to* bingo aside from the marginal line on B and the line she'll probably play in on N. This held the W to counter Pat's bingo on the TWS and held an S incase she had to expose a vulnerable spot.

#note I have to dodge a Pat bingo but score well enough to outrun her in this game too. Q says this is the no-brainer best play...
