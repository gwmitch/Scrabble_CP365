>Josh: ?AEIRRW H8 AIRWaRE +68 68
>Josh: ?AEIRRW --  -68 0
#note This is an ISC game for the books. Josh sees valid bingos, but correctly reasons that passing them up for AIRWaRE* is undisputably correct
>Mack: AEINORV -  +0 0
#note Mack correctly challenges off the phoney, and decides to pass, thinking that, well, AEIONRV is a pretty good rack so Josh's impending bingo ought to give Mack an 8 right?
>Josh: ?AEIRRW H8 WARmIER +70 70
>Josh: ?AEIRRW --  -70 0
#note Again, Josh employs the principle that a valid opening bingo should never, ever be played when a phoney one is available. Brilliant play.
>Mack: AEINORV -  +0 0
#note Mack sees that he has AEINOR and Josh has a W, so Mack obviously is going to have the edge in a 6-pass scenario. Accordingly, he passes back, still also under the impression that, should Josh play a valid bingo, Mack will have an eight to come back with (in this case, he actually saw OVERRAIN*, which seemed plausible enough). 
>Josh: ?AEIRRW -  +0 0
#note ISC ends games after 4 straight zero scores instead of the traditional 6, so the game actually ended here (this pass did not occur, but was included just or the sake of this comment). Both players lost the sum of the point values on their racks, resulting in a -9 - -10 victory for Josh. Quackle won't end the game for some reason, so annotation ends here, but the final score was really -9 - -10 not 0-0. Despite the somewhat low-ish score, this game is certainly an exemplary prototype for how the game of Scrabble should be played exceptionally. Josh's realization that phony opening bingos are always superior to valid opening bingos demonstrated an unparalleled mastery of the game of Scrabble, and, while he lost, Mack must be admired for going with his instincts and thinking that AEINORV is just simply bound to make an 8 with whatever Josh might float. Thank you for witnessing this truly historical, masterful Scrabble game!
