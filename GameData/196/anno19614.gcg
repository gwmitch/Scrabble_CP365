#note HELP!   Is the F really so awdul that's worth not scoring the extra 4 pts?  Or is DIN -that much more bingo prone?   Q rates my play -14- pts worse...

#note Yeah, ZEK J4 was clearly better.  ZESTER at K4 actually graded pretty low comparatively

#note HELP!  I like mine better than REGRAFT L2, figuring my leave is better than just B.   Is it churning to try for blanks that makes  Q's play better?

#note AJEE was best.  My play was rated -much- lower than I woud've guessed.

#note HELP!   ROUEN rated 7 points better.    I felt saving a more consonant-heavy leave and not opening the board was worth sacrificing 5 pts in score.   How am I so wrong?
