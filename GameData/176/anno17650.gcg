#note Unsure between this and YEAN. ANY and NAY are plays I missed. All of them are pretty good plays. NAY a few points better than anything else. This and YEAN have the advantage of blocking with a small lead. I don't think that's a huge priority, but seems at least somewhat important. This sims pretty much evenly with YEAN, but I think the gap between AHN and ANN might be a little wider on subsequent turns, which rack leftover value doesn't take into account, so I would guess YEAN to be a tad better. YEAN and NAY seems to be the options, then, and I don't really know between the two.

#note I thought this maximized my ability to score well out of all the plays on columns M and O, which Quackle seems to agree with. I don't think I considered blocking the A column seriously enough here though, something that FOLATE accomplishes well. Keep in mind that spread is not a factor in this game. After FOLATE, there are definitely winning lines for him, usually involving multiple bingos, though even two bingos for him is often not going to win. On the other hand, a 3x3 can actually put Nigel ahead. With fine places to score later with BE, I think FOLATE may be right.

#note Now the column A blocks aren't as good as FOLATE, with TWIG, and TWAE as my main choices. FEIGN is another play I missed. It seems like TWIG might be the best play here though.

#note Ironically, the turn where I block the T is the turn where it is probably the biggest mistake equity-wise, but I couldn't figure out how I would lose after this.
