#note FORGAVE looks like not a bad choice here, just to clear out this rack as quickly as possible and maximize the chance of drawing something to help the Q.
>Lucas_Freeman: AEORSST 4D ROASTE.S +68 92
#note A sloppy play.  He had OSETRAS or OSSETRA L6 for 15 more points.
>Dave_Koenig: AEEFIOQ D2 AE.IE +5 69
#note I didn't know what to do here.  Already staring at a deficit and thinking that I was about to fall further behind, I figured it was worth rolling the dice by setting up a big hook.

#note If you had asked me if I thought I would score 100 points over the next two turns after AERIE, I would have said "no way!"  Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.

#note I just learned this CSW-only five a few days before the tournament when David Eldar played it against me in Facebook Scrabble.  It is by far my best play.

#note His bingo took away my RUSTLED/LUSTRED on column O.  At least I still bingo, but with all the S's and blanks gone, my comeback chances are looking bleak.

#note Fishing mostly for an A, but also setting up a new lane to distract him.  Putting the L at 14N would make it easy for him to make row 15 plays himself, but this sets me up without giving him as much.
>Lucas_Freeman: FGI 14L FIG +26 432
#note He took out BLITHER
>Dave_Koenig: BEHILRT N10 H. +15 359
>Lucas_Freeman: AEILOP O5 LEIPOA +29 461
#note I hit my draw and with available bingos on row 1 and column O, he couldn't stop me.  So instead he scores enough to outdistance me.
