#note 2nd best to omenta at 8c.  Wanted to keep it open.  Thought this would provide a good leave.

#note Nice try!  I'm fairly familiar with -able & -ably words.

#note Q like fishing off a T.  Gave this a shot, hoping he'd be gunshy.  Wasn't sure about it.  
>Eric: BELORXY 9F BOXY +44 44
#note I saw that he had boxy too.  Ugh.

#note Missed TUNICAE at 12e.  Wrote down UNCIATE which is no good.  UNCINATE is good though.

#note Pretty sure this was my rack.  I didn't want to get hammered at the triple word; too forever to make this move.  I think GI(E) at n1 may have been a good move with the Z and Q lurking.  I would put me in a good position if he didn't have the Z.
