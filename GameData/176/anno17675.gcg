>Jim_Burlant: AFIINOR 8G FINO +14 14
#note Context:  King Of The Hill Game.  Chris and I are in first and second, separated by 4 spread points.  Darrell Day is a game behind us in third, but he's got us both by over 220 spread points.  Translation:  win the game, win the tournament.  Lose the game, and there's a good chance I may be finishing out of the money.  As for this, these are the right letters, wrong play.  8H INFO is apparently somewhat better.
>Chris_Cree: ELLOOOQ -LLOOOQ +0 0
#note Actual rack.
>Jim_Burlant: AAAINRT 7H AA +8 22
#note A little fishy but not terrible.  Best would have been 9G ANA.  I didn't look to do more than dump the two A's, since Chris had just played for 0 and was more or less looking at a random rack.
>Chris_Cree: BEKRVWZ -EBRW +0 0
#note Not sure of his rack but he picked up a boatload of counters and I think he kept ERZ and threw something like 18 points of consonants back.  Yuck.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AILNRT 9F ReTINAL +70 92
#note 9C RELIANT scores 2 more but has vowel placement issues that this does not.  Q agrees - this is my best bingo.  81% to win.
>Chris_Cree: EGOZ L8 G.OZE +34 34
>Jim_Burlant: ?CCEPWY 6F YEW +24 116
#note Yikes!  Q says I may be slightly better off playing PEW 10E bothto set up an S hook and to prevent easy front A hooks on row 5.  But this is a minor glitch; I'm still 86% to win with this.
>Chris_Cree: DDEO 11J DO.ED +32 66
>Jim_Burlant: ?CCGJPT -CGJP +0 116
#note That's not the draw I needed, that's for sure.  Apparently I should also throw the T back in and exchange 5. 20/20 hindsight makes me certainly wish I'd done that.  Keeping CT? is a 3-point dog to keeping C?.  79% to win.
>Chris_Cree: BRU 8L .RUB +21 87
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEEETT 10E TEE +14 130
#note  I know DETECTOR is good, but when I saw M1 dETECTE(R) I thought about it and couldn't convince myself it was good.  Being in the driver's seat with the tournament on the line, I was taking no chances.  dETECTER is good, and it wins just shy of 88%.  If you don't bingo, it's this or 7C CETE.  81-1/2% to win.
>Chris_Cree: EEILNRS 13F RELINES +75 162
#note This scores identically to LIERNES, but placing the L at 13H makes it a little harder for me to come back for big points at 15H than it would be if he put down LIERNES, which is why this is Chris's best bingo.  He's 57% to win...but not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEINT 5H ACETINs +74 204
#note Apparently I should play 11A INEXACT for 81; I was fixated on taking out the A front hook on row 5 (no 2x2's are available, btw).  If you whiff on INEXACT as I did, this or ANCIENT are your best choices.  I thought that, since there was only 1 X instead of 3 S's, the X was the less probable threat to open up instead of giving up an O column S hook with something like ANCIENT.  64% to win.
>Chris_Cree: AADT 4J DATA +21 183
>Jim_Burlant: HLNTTUW 12I LUN.T +16 220
#note These racks!  I was so blinded by the clunkiness of this rack that I never saw the star play of 6L NTH.  This is a very strong runner-up in the sim, however.  Still in the driver's seat at 67%.
>Chris_Cree: AFY 3M FAY +30 213
>Jim_Burlant: GHKRSTW O1 WH. +36 256
#note For the second time today, I have somehow scored this word played on a triple for 27 points.  This is definitely best, but geez Louise, I need to learn how to count to twelve and multiply by three!  71% to win.
>Chris_Cree: HI 6N HI +25 238
>Jim_Burlant: EGKPRST F2 PERK. +20 276
#note No clue.  I hated opening up but was getting very worn out by trying to work through these repeated counter overloads, which are the kind of racks my brain generally just does not process well.  Best is apparently G12 KEG to set up the S hook (I never saw KEG but rejected DUNK J11), but that could backfire if he's got an S.  I'd feel a lot better about those choices if I were sitting on the case S.  Q justifiably hates this, but I don't have any good options.  72% to win.
>Chris_Cree: COX 11D COX +38 276
>Jim_Burlant: GIJMSTV 3C JIV. +28 304
>Chris_Cree: GOO 5C GOO. +18 294
>Jim_Burlant: EEGLMST M3 ...G +15 319
#note I'm surprised this sims as well as it does.  I repeatedly missed 10K plays throughout the rest of the game.  This is actually a very strong choice, but 10K plays GOLEM, LOGE - those are definitely best.  Still 76% to win.
>Chris_Cree: ABEIMOU -ABE +0 294
>Jim_Burlant: BEELMST G1 BES +26 345
#note Normally, this would be way too dangerous to take out.  I was starting to run low on time, and I figured he had probably thrown the Q back in because this is not a good board for the Q, so I didn't worry  about Q extensions like BAROQUE.  I just didn't want him to be able to play with JIVE back hooks.  Best are 10K plays that I never saw and 6J BE.   
>Chris_Cree: AR H1 AR +23 317
>Jim_Burlant: ELMOSTU D2 L.M. +12 357
#note No great options - scorewise, this is about as good as anything else.  And I was down under two minutes by now - no time to really think this through.  Best is apparently I2 MU.  Fortunately for me, Chris was about to make the game-deciding play.
>Chris_Cree: DEINRV 14B DRIVEN +30 347
#note More on this shortly...
>Jim_Burlant: EOOPSTU 15G SPOUT +24 381
#note As I put this down, Chris exclaimed, "WHAT?!?!?", clearly in shock.  He had mistracked and thought the S's were out.  Down to barely 1 minute on my clock, I saw the unseen pool of AIIMSQU, and realized that that there was nowhere for him to score enough to win, since he wasn't going to be able to go out ahead of me.  I pretty much autopiloted this once I saw that this gave me outs in two all over the place, so that was enough.  The better sequence, which wins by 4 more, is 15G SUPE/SPUE.  Whatever - this was enough to win the tournament.
