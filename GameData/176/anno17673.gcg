#note If there was one win that I really felt bad about, this was it.  Mike has been MIA for club as of late, and he's been very open about the details of his myriad health issues.  He's recently been dealing with having his medication adjusted, and as this game progressed, it was clear that he was not all there.   This wasn't just because he was making plays I'd have expected of a division 4/5 player, either.  As the game progressed, we were going ethrough the ritual of correcting the score on a given turn, and on the very next turn  he'd have yet another completely incorrect score that wasn't even close to what the actual score was.  So, in short, while his playing style even under normal circumstances is a bit unorthodox, what you'll see here is nowhere near what he's capable of.  He's much better than he showed here.
>Jim_Burlant: AABEGJW 7H JAW +26 26
#note Clearly best, but the ABEG leave is so negative that even with my 14-point scoreboard lead, I'm only 47% to win.
>Mike_Early: AFT 6I FAT +21 33
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEGKM L2 GAMBED +31 57
#note Wasn't sure about whether GAMBE took the D (it only takes an S) but figured I'd take the chance.  This wasn't so much as held.  Best legitimate option is 5J DEBAG 29.
>Mike_Early: IT F6 TI. +7 40
>Jim_Burlant: EIKNRXZ 3K Z.X +38 95
#note Hmmm.  Q says I should try to milk my counters for points rather than blow them all at once.  XI M3 scores 40 and leaves me ZEK E5 for the next turn. 
>Mike_Early: AEIPSTT E1 PATTIES +72 112
#note Only bingo for Mike, who's 45% to win in a short sim.
>Jim_Burlant: EIIKNOR 1E .INKO +33 128
#note Couldn't decide if I wanted to play PINKIE or this and opted for the EIR leave.  Q says it's either this or POKIER in the same place for 36.  50% to win.
>Mike_Early: AY 5J YA. +29 141
>Mike_Early: AY --  -29 112
#note At this point in the game I figured Mike just wasn't paying attention to what he was doing; it was only as the game got further in that it was becoming apparent that he wasn't hitting on all cylinders.
>Jim_Burlant: AEHIIRW 3C WI.HIER +30 158
#note Best.  Scores 30 points, clears out the W and the duplicated I's.  66% to win.
>Mike_Early: AAELNRY 9G AY +22 134
>Jim_Burlant: AACEELY 5K A.Y +20 178
#note Hmmm.  Against a random rack Q says I should either play K5 ATE (missed it), K6 TELAE (missed it), or 5K ABYE (rejected it because I didn't want to give up the S hook down the O column.  I never considered any plays holding the Y, which ruled out most of my options.  Simmed against a random rack this gives up huge equity.  Q says I need to play with patience and hold the Y.  Even against an inferred AERS, it says this is a huge dog and that I should open up the O column.  While ATE K5 is probably right, I don't know that I agree with the rest of its analysis - YMMV.
>Mike_Early: ?ABERUU 10A BUREAUs +64 198
>Jim_Burlant: ACEELNS M7 ENLACES +76 254
#note Best bingo, and I'm 72% to win.
>Mike_Early: INV 12J VIN. +14 212
>Jim_Burlant: DEIOORV A6 OVER.ID +45 299
#note Best.  90% to win.  
>Mike_Early: DEHNORS 13A SHORNED +90 302
>Mike_Early: DEHNORS --  -90 212
>Jim_Burlant: ?GLMORT E9 G.M +12 311
#note I don't have any really good options here - not knowing the OVERBIDDEN extension, I just wanted to make sure I put down something that didn't give him the opening he needed to bingo.  This is kind of weak but 2L GORM is a bit dangerous, even if it doesn't give him a bingo back. This still wins 98% when simmed against his rack.
>Mike_Early: DEHNORS B4 HOD +18 230
>Jim_Burlant: ?LLOORT C9 T.OLL +12 323
#note You have to know it to play it. TORNILLO K8 scores 64, but bingoing here is not best. A1 TORO is best, but I was fixated on building another rack.   This isn't one of the original choices but given that I'm sitting on the blank, I'm not worried about giving him something on row 14, especially since it will give me something back on row 15.
>Mike_Early: EN B13 EN +6 236
>Jim_Burlant: ?INORSU 15B SOURINg +74 397
#note 15B DIURONS or DURIONS would be better here because of the unseen Q, but that's just equity in the duck's eyes. 
>Mike_Early: EOR 2L .OER +19 255
>Jim_Burlant: ACEFORU F12 FUC. +15 412
#note I gauged by Mike's reaction to his tiles that he'd picked up the Q, so I went about blocking a potential Q bomb.  Even if he bingoes, none of the bingoes that's available scores more than 83.  So, even if he bingoes and I draw the Q, it won't be enough.
>Mike_Early: DEGINQS K11 Q. +22 277
>Jim_Burlant: AEOR A1 AERO +21 433
#note 12E LOAFER scores 27.  Quackle is having trouble processing this end game for some reason.  Final score recorded as 447 - 280.  Kinda sloppy on my end after the lost challenges made this one a cakewalk.
