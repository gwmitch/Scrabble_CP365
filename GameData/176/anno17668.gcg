#note gotta figure he has ES as a leave after this play, especially because he played it fast
>JD: AABEETU D7 U.BEAT +20 20
#note difficult rack, I considered ABUSE but it gave too much back. EAU at 7B sims well too, about a point back, but ABET doesn't really bingo that much.

#note not out of the woods yet - I need to figure out how to constrict the board while playing through the clunkers. really, the first order of business should probably be to block the 3x3, which is the only way I can lose the game immediately. for that reason, plays like wirer, work and rework all sim better. I thought that EKRRW had nice scoring potential next turn after my play, but first things first, and I should be able to score fine with the Q.

>JD: EKNRRTW B11 KREW. +24 386
#note I have no business letting him get a second shot at the 3x3, although his rack is close to random. KREWE has best valuation but NETWORK at 6H is surely the smart play.
>MC_Frentz: EINORSY O2 .YROSINE +86 361
#note of course, I benefit from my mistake because NETWORK would've allowed TYROSINE/NETWORKS - but still, no question that I should've blocked.
