#note 2014 Bay Area Matchplay finals round 2.
>Jesse_Day: ACDLNTY 8H CANDY +30 30
#note better than DACTYL or YCLAD? I liked the resulting defensive board setup, but at the same time, what if cesar doesn't think of DACTYLIC and I draw the other C? I should really play DACTYL. but YCLAD and CANDY sim about even.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEINQTU K1 ANTIQUE. +86 86
>Jesse_Day: AEEGLLT 1G TALL.GE +30 60
#note he blocked GALLETED. I forgot about TALLAGED.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BDGRRUW I6 BR.W +14 100
>Jesse_Day: EIIMOPR 3I OP.IME +22 82
#note quackle actually likes fishing the I a little better than playing this, even though by bingo percentage is not that high I have a nice shot at bingos from the C (COPREMIA, COPREMIC, COMPILER etc).
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DGLRUUX N2 R.DUX +58 158
>Jesse_Day: AIMORRS 2H ROA. +18 100
#note I saw SIMAR but figured I would keep the MI- to threaten column O
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EGIKLOU O6 IGLU +24 182
#note quackle says UKE for a lot more points

>Cesar_Del_Solar: CEFKOUV 3B CUKE +36 218
>Jesse_Day: EGNOOPS 5B OPEN +32 206
#note PESO was an intriguing option with both blanks and a ton of Is left, and two esses - has to be a reasonable chance of me hitting a bingo from the C next turn. in fact my average per turn is higher after PESO than OPEN even though I ditch the S.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEEFNOV 10F VEENA +28 246
>Jesse_Day: GHOSTTZ J10 .ZOTH +25 231
#note the key play of the game, I could get wiped out, hence why quackle prefers SHOTT, but his rack is pretty random after VEENA and I put a lot of pressure on him to make the right decision. down 40 going into this play I like taking this risk.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EFIIOOO 11J .OO +24 270
#note he really must exchange on this turn and try to draw a premium tile
>Jesse_Day: ?EFGSTY L10 F.GY +22 253
#note FOGY and HEFTY sim very close. not a big difference between the two.

#note even if he ends up bingoing here (and I just blocked row 7 which makes it less likely) I can now outrun
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DEINOST M11 NOES +34 330
>Jesse_Day: ?DEFORT 4K .F +20 363
#note I could try to block every possible bingo (6 total - IDEALIST, ALIENIST, DILATANT, INSTEAD, SALIVATE, LINTIEST) but I figured with the blank in hand that I would try to make sure that I can outrun a scoring play (worst-case scenario ISATIN at N10) and maybe bingo back if he has drawn into the lucky bingo.
