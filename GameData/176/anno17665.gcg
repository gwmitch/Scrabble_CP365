#note meh, I should really find tinhorns here. bethorn looks a little better, doesn't up up too much which is important on a closed board.

#note tempting to just block at the bottom-right since that's the overwhelming best bingo lane, but it cripples my rack too much to play down there and I can outrun this way.

#note she just created a spot for QIS. ideally, I would find a way to win even in the event of a Q draw - my play at least leaves QUALE, but if I'd looked more closely at the endgame I would've realized it would surely get blocked. this play at least wins all the other endgames.
