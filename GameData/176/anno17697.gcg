>Jesse_Day: ADEEFQU 8F QUAD +28 28
#note 2014 Bay Area Matchplay finals round 3. I (Jesse) lead 2-0.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BEHIOTU F8 .UBIT +22 22
>Jesse_Day: DEEFJRZ 11E F.Z +30 58
#note I'm surprised that FRIZED at 11D does so well since it opens cheap options, but maybe that will allow me to get rid of my J more effectively.

#note Q suggests just taking the points for ZEK

>Cesar_Del_Solar: AAGIIOR D4 O.AGRI +16 172
>Jesse_Day: AFGLNRV 14A FLAG +29 219
#note I didn't want to open up new lanes to use, especially with four esses unseen, but this way I tend to just give up cheap points and keep a worse leave.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEHIIOO I12 OHIA +25 197
>Jesse_Day: CENRRVW 13H W..NCE +28 247
#note again, trying not to set up the S I don't have. WHERVE gives up 5 points extra per turn, but wins a sim because the leave is so much superior.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EIILLOS A12 LI.E +24 221
>Jesse_Day: NORRVXY H13 .YN +40 287
#note I was starting to fastplay cesar. I thought I was being very clever, but of course I missed the easy play of WRY.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEILLOS K10 LEA.S +27 248
#note sets up the S hook nicely
>Jesse_Day: EORRTVX L6 VORTEX +30 317
#note it must be worth it to kill off the board for good. I sacrificed some equity to get to this point, but if WHERVE were on the board he would still have a great lane, whereas now he's in big trouble
>Cesar_Del_Solar: CIILOOU 8A COI. +18 266
>Jesse_Day: BEGRRSV B6 GR.VE +15 332
#note if I were losing this game I could play SVEDBERG! Cesar has to hit a 9 to win, basically
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AILOOTU 8L .OUT +12 278
>Jesse_Day: BDERSST N6 DR.BS +14 346
#note just playing it safe. DUBS actually blocks all of the bingos that DRUBS does (he's still 5% to play a 9).
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AIILOSY M5 OI +9 287
#note he made a nice two-tile fish for ELYSIAN here
>Jesse_Day: EMNNPST F1 PENM.N +14 360
#note PENMEN at 3H is a better play.
