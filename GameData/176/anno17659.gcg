#note This is turning into a really interesting board.
>Spherulitic: CEIRTTV 9I ETIC +21 298
#note I cannot play ABORTIVE.  Right now the riskiest lane is from the E; this takes that out while leaving only a weak (but easy) lane in row 10. Opp is down two bingoes; if he hits row 10, there's nothing else there. If he hits column N, I get a comeback on O.

#note This rack is why FEY was better last turn. Also, FEY would have been more points. 

This play tries to obscure the L lane by ensuring any bingo there must start with LA, LE, LO, or LU. Also there's no more I's out.

#note I was very low on my clock, and my opponent was a nice older gentleman, so I'm glad he didn't block this, forcing me to play out from the C.
