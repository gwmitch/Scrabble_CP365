#note Portland Area Matchplay, Winners Bracket Round 4, Nigel Peltier vs. Noah Walton, Game 2. Also considered CRIB, didn't know TERBIC. This sims best by a fair bit, but that doesn't account for Nigel's play, which I have experienced to be pretty defensive following an opening play. Still, this is a fine option, and playing the opening rack tends to be much harder after an exchange one, so I'm fine with this.

#note An interesting rack that we discussed after the game. Conrad, Nigel, and I all liked it.

#note Looked for some sort of setup or play that kept the X, but none of them score enough to justify forgoing this.
