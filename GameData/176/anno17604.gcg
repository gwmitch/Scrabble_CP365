>Josh: GLOPTVZ H8 PLOTZ +52 52
>Emanuel: ADEEMNN I12 AM +18 18
#note This doesn't look right, but this is a really hard move. He took a lot of time here.
>Josh: BBEGORV J10 VEG +28 80
>Emanuel: HN 11H .H.N +22 40
>Josh: ABBCLOR -CARLBOB +0 80
#note These are the type of plays that I need to avoid making. I was ultra-scared to give Emanuel any better opening than he already had and wanted to go for the good stuff. Fallacious reasoning that really bites me in the backside. CARBO at G4, BABO(O) at 10D or COAL at G7 are all decent and better options.
>Emanuel: EKL 14H LEK +26 66
#note can I capitalize on this opening now that I drew 7 new tiles? I don't have good chances to, which is why my exchange was a really bad idea.
>Josh: ANNNTUV 15E TUNA +18 98
#note now here I am playing 18 points, opening up some scary stuff and keeping VNN.
>Emanuel: BDEINR 15J INBRED +42 108
#note And just like that my chances drop a ton.
>Josh: DLNNRTV -LNRTV +0 98
#note yup. Too many Rs left so I shouldn't keep RT or DR. Maybe NT but I want to keep a tile that is worth more than 1 point.
>Emanuel: CFIS L9 FISC +26 134
#note THENS???
>Josh: DINORUX -  +0 98
#note another terrible move as I am overconfident of my word knowledge. This could have gone far worse than it did.
>Emanuel: GUY 9F UG.Y +14 148
#note At least Emanuel is down to like 7 minutes at this point.
>Josh: DINORUX 14C DOUX +55 153
#note I didn't apply the same "keep points on your rack" logic here because I noticed the D at 015 as a possible lane. Dunno, probably ROUX instead
>Emanuel: DEIIORT M3 DIORITE +76 224
>Josh: ADEIINR N5 DENARII +79 232
#note whew
>Emanuel: AY 8H .AY +13 237
#note wow, lucky he couldn't score this turn
>Josh: EEHNTUW O8 WE +40 272
#note I thought the pool was still vowel-heavy when it wasn't. I should just take the points with WENT. It's 10 more...
>Emanuel: EGMRS O1 GERMS +37 274
>Josh: BEHNTUV 13B BETH +32 304
#note I took a long time here. L2 is one more point, maybe that's the right play. I considered everything else there was to consider and missed the higher-scoring BETH. Bad. L2 cuts his score and his bingo%. 
>Emanuel: LOO 7I LOO +16 290
>Josh: AACLNUV F6 VAC.A +20 324
#note Almost went for the known phony VULCAN*
>Emanuel: IOORSTT 14N OI +11 301
>Josh: ALNORUW G7 WO. +32 356
>Emanuel: ?AERSST 3F ASSERTe. +60 361
#note K1 mAESTR(O)S. Emanuel saw it afterwards, but he was down to around 4 minutes.
>Josh: AAELNRU D11 AU.. +8 364
#note I don't know what's right here. I'm only down 5 so maybe just score and go for the blank? H1 UN(S)EAL looks to accomplish that, but maybe LAURAE 2F is right.
>Emanuel: IQ H1 QI. +36 397
>Josh: ?AEELNR C6 REcLEAN.. +65 429
#note so lucky, I thought this always won and it does, no matter my draw. 
>Emanuel: EFIJNOP L1 JE.P +48 445
>Josh: T O8 ..T +8 437
>Josh:  (FNOI) +14 451
