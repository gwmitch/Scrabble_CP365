>Sean_Wrona: AIILOSY I3 OILY +13 13
#note Ugh, I don't like keeping multiple I's or a Y on this board, but I guess I'm wrong since this sims so much worse and the board is wide open...

>Sean_Wrona: AEISTVW G8 WAVIEST +70 83
#note I seriously didn't remember whether APO took an S.  Wow.

>Matthew_O'Connor: DEO J4 DOE +20 71
>Sean_Wrona: CEEIIIN I8 NIECE +14 97
#note Easily CIVIE.  As usual, I didn't think of it.  IONIC gets style points, but I slightly prefer this over that.

#note I think I DID see WEIGELIA even though it didn't fit, which is progress...

>Sean_Wrona: ?AEEILS N5 rEALISE +75 204
#note ALIENAGES wouldn't have been worth doing, but man, that's cool...  I think I was actually failing to see my bingos ending in S, which is embarrassing, and was freaking out about CHAINE not being good even though I knew CHAINES was good, but then again, I don't think he's studied sixes much so he'd likely assume it's valid even if it wasn't...
>Matthew_O'Connor: ANN O7 NAN +19 152
>Sean_Wrona: AEFLRRT O1 FLARE +28 232
#note Didn't consider anything else, buy yeah, I can see why the other plays are better.  TURF scores nearly as much and leaves a more balanced leave (AELR).  All those plays like FLORA block the fairly major risk of -TION bingos.  I just wasn't thinking much, but this is hardly fatal...  I don't see the point of playing for bingo leave anyway, since this board is pretty much shut down at this point except for the OILY hook (and I would take care of that later...)

>Matthew_O'Connor: LV D12 L.V +16 168
>Sean_Wrona: IMNRRTT M3 TRIM +18 250
#note I was suddenly paranoid about him bingoing on column M, when row 2 is still the greater concern.  Yeah, I like MORT better.  I'm actually surprised TRIM sims etter than the O plays...

12:43
>Matthew_O'Connor: NRSU 15A RUNS +23 191
>Sean_Wrona: EINRSTX O11 SIXTE +51 301
#note Wow, I just missed the column K hotspot.  Those plays are clearly better, especially since this is the last S and this doesn't open a dangerous line (although my lead after this is certainly big enough to take it...)

>Matthew_O'Connor: DEERT L1 TREED +24 215
>Sean_Wrona: FIKNOOR N14 IF +19 320
#note By this point, in addition to blocking the bingo line I stupidly opened, I'm also fishing for the T for TROOZ.

10:28
>Matthew_O'Connor: DQ 9F Q.D. +21 236
>Sean_Wrona: BDKNOOR 2G B.NK +28 348
#note And that takes care of that.  Game over.  See, see, I've stopped choking so much!  And I'm no longer letting him get into my head.

9:54
>Matthew_O'Connor: M 4G M... +7 243
>Sean_Wrona: CDGOOOR G4 .O +4 352
#note Easy does it.  I didn't brain fart and give him a place to bingo by playing GO or something (which I KNOW is horrible, but might still screw up and do) and am still giving myself a shot at TROOZ.  Unlikely fish, yeah, but this is still way safer than playing more than one tile in row 5...  COO could conceivably give him a bingo, although it would be hard...

>Matthew_O'Connor: ?HOPRUY J9 sH. +43 286
>Sean_Wrona: CDGOORT A8 TROO. +42 394
#note And I hit it...  Of course, now I see that it doesn't even sim the best since it's almost impossible to go out afterward...  Talk about having a one-track mind, but in this case it was a relatively minor error throughout...
