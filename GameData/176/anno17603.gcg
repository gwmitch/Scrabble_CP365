#note this seems right. I looked at this rack awhile cause it looked bingoey*
>Jason: AHIOPRT 5H .TROPHIA +76 76
>Josh: ADEINRV I8 INVADER +65 87
>Jason: AIKU J2 KAU.I +21 97
>Josh: AEFMRST 13C FERMAT.S +78 165
>Josh: AEFMRST --  -78 87
#note Now now, me. Before KAU(R)I, I was intent on playing F(O)RMATES, because I was sure of it. FERMAT(E)S was my backup plan. I saw FERM(A)TAS as a distinct possibility. But I used logic and thought that I was only half sure FERMATA was valid, but like most -ATA words, I first imagined FERMATA was plural of something, but I knew FERMA wasn't good. So I came to the conclusion that I was simply making FERMATA up, most likely. FERMATE I thought was good too, but maybe it was an adjective. I was pretty sure FERMATES was good though
>Jason: EFW H13 FEW +34 131
#note blocking FRAMES.
>Josh: AEFMRST 6A RAFTSME. +71 158
#note I think I had already seen this but was too sure of FERMATES. FERM(A)TAS is still available fort 194, and if this for some crazy reason also turns out to be invalid and challenged, and then for another crazy reason the A is left open, I will attempt FERMATAS. 
>Jason: ?DEEERT -  +0 131
#note Jason sees his great options and decides that he has basically a free challenge. But he still loses a turn, so it's kind of faulty logic, but I don't blame him for challenging.
>Josh: IIIQTYY E4 QI. +24 182
#note Here I still feel pretty well about the game. I can score next turn a decent amount of the time so I didn't feel the need to exchange. Still way below my average score/equity after RAFTSME(N), but I have been quite fortunate thus far. I also considered Q(A)T but I didn't like my options next turn.
>Jason: ?DEEERT O1 REsE.TED +131 262
#note A1 TEnDE(R)ER is 9 more but this could still be better since it seems more dangerous to leave the A open than the R.
>Josh: IIOTUYY -IIOTUYY +0 182
#note But after this draw and his last play I feel obligated to do this if I wish to compete in what will probably be a points/leave duking out until the end of the game. Maybe I should still play J11 YOU or M1 YOUT(H)
>Jason: CDEIJNU 11H J.UNDICE +86 348
#note bleh, play it at 11H... Jason said he wanted to give me a chance instead.
>Josh: AEGLNST A4 ST.ANGLE +80 262
#note nice draw, I'm still in the game I guess
>Jason: OUX L11 .OUX +24 372
>Josh: ?ELLOTT 14K E.TOL +24 286
#note Spent a long time looking, but there is nothing, good thing too. But I noticed something I could be going for here.
>Jason: AELY C3 LEA.Y +30 402
>Josh: ?HLNOPT A4 ........HOLd +57 343
#note But I had a feeling that I should have kept looking. But I couldn't resist, I was so focused on playing this.
>Jason: CGINO L3 CO.ING +26 428
>Josh: BINPSTY 9A .YP +12 355
#note Saw I could draw into B(E)ZI(L)S here, so I tried to create a distraction and maybe draw STIBINE or something. I could also draw BEATNI(K)S, but I hadn't noticed. That doubles the aptitude of this play. I didn't want to plat (H)YP though, since I didn't think it appropriate to be that desperate. I'm still in the game even without a miracle. P(L)Y sims best because for some reason the simulation claims I bingo more often post-PLY than post GYP, which I have just now established manually to be false. I bingo twice as often after (G)YP ceteris paribus. 
>Jason: OW 15N WO +26 454
#note this seems like the right play as it rids Jason of the bigger threat.
>Josh: BEINSST 2H BI.ES +23 378
#note Now I need to see BEATNIKS as a possibility and play off my S somewhere. But maybe I don't score enough... Hmm. Maybe I just need a miracle and BI(K)ES is the miracle-seeking play.  9I (N)IBS permits me to draw the most bingos, but Jason is likely to block everything really well except the K, which I can draw a couple of things into, still BEATNIKS and also INSTROKE. So maybe (N)IBS is the miracle-maker.
>Jason: ABRU 1E BURA +30 484
#note Jason said I had no available bingos from his point of view.
>Josh: AINSTVZ 15A .ITZ +22 400
#note I didn't think I could block everything, but I could apparently, so 14D STIV(ER) or D9 SAVIN are the right plays. 
>Jason: DEIOR 13A .ROIDE +14 498
#note My play would have been -16 if Jason had seen (P)ERIDO(T). 
>Jason:  (ANSV) +14 512
#note This was a really crazy and hopefully entertaining game.
