#note if he sacrifices 3 points to make this play, does that make it more likely he has an S, or maybe even a Y?

#note just JO bingos 75% next turn, but I wanted to open up.

#note of course, sometimes it makes bingos out of non-gos

>JD: ?BEGORZ 11C Z.G +26 324
#note I was happy to dump the Z because I didn't see any massive potential plays with it, but GOBO at 3C sims 1-2 points better. a closer look says that this is because I hold the blank an extra turn (reflected in improved "rack leftover value") but I would rather get to the bingo faster, since that will likely guarantee a win.
>John_Karris: EOU 12J .OUE +10 226
>JD: ?BEOQRY 11G Q. +11 335
#note I am bad at these plays. I wanted to ditch the Q and avoid worst-case scenarios, but after BOYO for 28 at 3C I could draw one of the two Us, or at the very worst just end up playing QI. BEORY? is only 38% to bingo.

#note low on time, not a lot fits at the bottom-right (of course, nothing fits if I'd just played cuvee) so I figured I would just empty the bag. even if I block at the bottom-right with something like SIEGE he actually still bingos 5% of the time (where??)
