>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEMRW 8D MAWED +28 28
#note Should I just played WARMED?
>Jason_Eyolfson: EQRU G5 QUE.R +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: EHOORST 10E RESHOOT +79 107
#note Good thing I didn't play SHOOTER...
>Jason_Eyolfson: ADEHNRR H10 .ARDEN +33 49

>Jason_Eyolfson: GHIORST 15B SHORTI.G +63 143
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIJPRT C12 PIT. +18 201
#note I really hated this turn. Maybe I was too obsessed with killing the S. I thought of PITIERS but not PITIES, how does that even happen? RIPTI(D)E also works. JI(M)P?
>Jason_Eyolfson: FIK D11 KIF +33 176
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIJNRS E10 .IN +23 224
#note Didn't want to let him get easy points here.
>Jason_Eyolfson: ?AAEGLN 4H .ANGAbLE +72 248
>Jason_Eyolfson: ?AAEGLN --  -72 176
#note He said he had to try it because it was too tempting. Lucky he didn't see anything valid here.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIJRSY 14A JE. +24 248
#note J(U)S certainly scores a lot better. Never thought to fish for a J bingo by playing (OX)Y.
>Jason_Eyolfson: ?AAEGLN 3F AG.N +24 200
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IRSTTY 12C ...Y +9 257
#note Damn, I should have seen YTTRIaS right away. I didn't know the other bingos.
>Jason_Eyolfson: ABO 7C BOA +14 214
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ILRSTT K10 ..LT +4 261
#note Seriously? I'm pretty sure this rack is right, but it seems so wrong.
>Jason_Eyolfson: AAMS 4C AMAS +24 238
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IIRSTV J1 VISIToR +67 328
#note OVARITIS and VITRICS, I didn't know either. *AGINS.... suppose I need to work on fours with no S-hook.
>Jason_Eyolfson: EF 3C FE +24 262
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEGNOU 1J .OGUED +39 367
#note I couldn't turn down the points.
>Jason_Eyolfson: ACO 6A OCA +15 277
>Matthew_Larocque: EENPUUV A6 .VEN +21 388
#note This was cringe-worthy, but I figured I could withstand a normal bingo,  just not an unlikely 3x3 through this O.
>Jason_Eyolfson: ELN 6I L.NE +3 280
>Matthew_Larocque: DELPUUW 5L WUD +12 400
#note Best block I could think of under the time I had.
