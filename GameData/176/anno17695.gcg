>Jesse_Day: GIINTUV 8G GUV +14 14
#note 2014 Bay Area Matchplay finals round 1. not an easy choice but it wims a sim handily
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEFGRSY I6 GY.E +16 16
>Jesse_Day: AHIINST 10C TAHINIS +74 88
>Cesar_Del_Solar: CEFRRSX D9 F.RCER +22 38
#note FARCER looks liks a nice play to me but quackle likes CAREX because of the higher bingo chances next turn - I think this is better
>Jesse_Day: AAINTUU 9B TU.A +16 104
#note q prefers either exchanging or playing ANURIA - ANURIA gives up a lot of points, especially with a lead, but the way this rack is looking I won't be up too much for long. I think exchanging is reasonable
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EIORSSX 15A OXES +49 87
>Jesse_Day: ACDILNU B13 LU. +20 124
#note duncical!!
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AINORSZ 6F ZIN.AROS +90 177
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AINORSZ --  -90 87
>Jesse_Day: ACDFINO 11C A.ID +28 152
#note with my knowledge of his rack I should just play FAN or FIN at 8A and block the cheap Z play
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AINORSZ 8A ZA +35 122
>Jesse_Day: CFNNOPT 7B COFT +15 167
#note given what I know about his rack I should be dying to kill both of the Gs - hence why PONG at 6F wins a sim. missed opportunity
>Cesar_Del_Solar: INORRSS 6C NOIRS +16 138
>Jesse_Day: ?HIINNP 14B .N.IP +15 182
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BELRSTV -BLV +0 138
>Jesse_Day: ?HIINOY 5E HO +24 206
#note if I infer an ERST leave from his last play, then HOOF at D4 for 4 less sims even with HO. he is likely to be consonant-heavy, since if he had a bad rack and vowels he probably could've just scored at 15F. nonetheless, I think taking the points is ok.

>Cesar_Del_Solar: AABDNNR M11 BRAND +29 272
#note surely he's giving up too much by not just playing brand at 2A
>Jesse_Day: ?AEEIMT 3G MEATIEr +83 348
#note no matinee with Q out
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ADELNOT 15K DE.AL +30 302
#note nice play
>Jesse_Day: ?AEEOUW A1 WA. +27 375
#note tough for me to lose from here - low on time but figured I'd take the points and block the scoring spot at 2B. Q points out I can also play OWE at 2F since all the hooks for EME are gone
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ILLNOOT M1 TO.NILLO +58 360
#note sick
>Jesse_Day: ?EEEOUW J2 U. +4 379
#note Q says not to even bother block the Q play
