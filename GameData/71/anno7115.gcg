#note JD: best by far is taking the points with GAUDS at 10B. Can't say I considered it at all. My leave is nothing to write home about after VEG so it makes some sense. even DEV is better.

#note JD: I wonder why I didn't think of RISKIEST. not too big of a mistake though.

#note cBB: No idea what to do here.
>Magra: BCEINOU 1A BO.ICE +36 295
#note jd: when I said I had a clabbers bingo conrad correctly guessed my rack. quackle says BEDOUIN is better, s hook and all.
>DaCron: ?AELNPR 14G o.ERPLAN +78 331
#note cBB: I saw s(H)RAPNEL but didn't think I had it, lol. I do that way too often. Potential game-losing mistake. FWIW, JD overdrew by 2 here, and I threw back MO giving him II. Q agrees, but with how volatile this bingo is...
>Magra: IIMNTUZ O12 ZITI +82 377
#note JD: in a weird sequence of events, I overdrew by two, and conrad left me with the two Is I used to make this play.
>DaCron: IIOORRS L11 ROI. +8 339
>Magra: ADELMNU 3G MAUL +22 399
#note JD: the star play looks like ULAMA at B7 which is not an easy find. I bet that outruns any bingo conrad can come up with. my play is pretty reasonable though. MAUND at 2F or 3G look ok too.
>DaCron: EIORRST H1 RO.. +12 351
#note JD: huh, I did block something.
>Magra: AADENPU K10 PAD +19 418
#note JD: well, this play is the reason we uploaded this game. His last play probably implies a great leave like EIRST or EMRST drawing to an ugly bag. There are two bingo possibilites here - TIMBERS/TIMBRES at 10I or FIBSTER which I totally didn't see over the board. I ended up trying to figure out if I could fish the P and still win - in that case, he can draw either the J or a different tile after bingoing, if he draws the J he loses, if he draws the other tile he wins. So as far as I can tell, it works out the same as just choosing to block one of the lanes entirely!! Quackle seems to agree. Let me know if you have any opinions. conrad and I probably spent about ten minutes looking at this position.                           cbb: PLEASE DON'T BLOCK THE SPOT. PLEASE DON'T BLOCK THE SPOT.
>DaCron: BEFIRST M3 FIBSTER +104 455
#note cBB: Gah, I drew BF. Game over. Wait a sec...oh hey, that's convenient.
