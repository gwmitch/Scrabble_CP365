#note Not a whole lot of options. Exchanging is one of them, but I want to take out some lanes. In fact, I blocked ENVIRONS. Interestingly, SILV(EX) 6A and VIOLIST B6 come out on top because they assure me a place for the Q. (-6)

#note I thought about a whole bunch of plays here, including many options across row 6, but the possibility of a column N bingo deterred me. Quackle hates this play over things like FIST or FIGS 6I, but I'm not so sure I agree. After such a play, no matter what he has, Chris has got to at least think about Q-sticking me. A play like OF does not telegraph the Q at all. On the contrary, it appears I'm trying not to draw it.

#note Eh, QIS or QI N12. I'm doomed if he bingos anyway, so why not empty the bag?

#note From a very inauspicious beginning to a lucky ending. If the blank weren't the last tile in the bag, I would have surely lost.
