#note Boo - 9F UNAI 22. Got lazy here.

>Quackle: EEEINST 6J .EE +5 41
>Geoff: AIINRSZ L9 Z.IN +26 76
#note Quackle prefers I set up my S with 5K NAZI 32. Given my opp fished off two E's for five points just now, that's not too appealing, though my own S makes it more so. 
>Quackle: EINNSTU 13F TUNNIES +73 114
>Geoff: ADILRRS M8 LARD +26 102
#note LIARD, same spot. Wake up!
>Quackle: AEFILOP H12 I.FO +24 138
>Geoff: FIIPRST 11K F.. +24 126
#note Do you like this? I think it's okay, but there are other better-scoring options, for sure.
>Quackle: AAEJLPV 12C JAVA +30 168
>Geoff: ?IIPRST E4 TIPSIeR +71 197
#note Getting a blank on a one-tile draw, heh.

>Geoff: DEMOOWY 13B YOW +41 238
>Quackle: EGHLNSX D3 HEX +39 236
>Geoff: DEMOORT 14A MOTE +38 276
#note Maybe DOTE or DOTER same spot? Would give up less and keep M for YOM if needed.
>Quackle: GILLNSU C2 LUG +22 258
>Geoff: ADGOORY 1A ORGY +42 318
#note Only two good plays here, in my opinion. So, ODA first or ORGY first? Know-nothing sim says 2.5 for ODA, sim with opp holding an S says a point or two the other way.
>Quackle: DIILNRS 15A INS +38 296
>Geoff: ADEEOOR 4G RODEO +12 330
#note Uh, I don't know. Everything that sims ahead of RODEO opens up the board in a way I don't want to yet. Happy to turn over 5 and draw to AE with this pool, but...

>Geoff: AAEENNS A1 .NE +3 397
#note You can go outlive someone else, you outliver, you. Curiously, Champ Player whiffed on this, not even generating a block of the A column. ONE is 100% to win.

#note The best out sequence, US(N)E(A I11)/opp (L)EV/A(V)A and out, was six points better.
