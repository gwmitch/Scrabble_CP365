>Matthew_Bernardina: AENPSTV F7 VENA +17 17
#note VAN or xV works.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADINORU 7E A.O +12 26
#note E10 AUDIO 14?  Fishing off the U for 2 is second.  Weird.

>Ryan_Fischer: DINOORU --  -21 26
#note I sort of sensed this was phony.  I know TENDU.  Didn't realize this was DONUT's faux anagram until after it was challenged off.  Was just frustrated with this rack.  ODOUR is okay I guess.

#note I don't know how I missed QUIN 6B 35, but I did.  Bleh.

>Ryan_Fischer: GILLTUZ 6B LUTZ +26 98
#note Missed ZIT J2, too.  Yuck.  QUILT is 2nd, which I did see, but it's hardly the route to a bingo.  ZILL, but it keeps the U (which I guess could be used from the Q later, but do I really want to?).  LUTZ is fine since I'm down.

#note C(ON)Y would do just fine.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EEEGNRX D3 NEX. +22 238
#note EX 13L 20.  Would've stopped my bingo too, though he couldn't have known that.

#note I saw LAO(G)AI, but not moving ip up to work 14 to score 30.  Lots of vowels to come, so losing 'em now is a good idea.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?ABIILO 1C OBeLIA +36 431
#note Fuh-huck.  I missed 1B BOLIvIA to go out.  I really didn't look that hard at all.  Oh well.  That was a 74-point error.
