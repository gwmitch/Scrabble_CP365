>Seth: ?AEESTU J9 SAUTEEd +74 86
#note This is his best scoring bingo, but he has some nice nines through HO.
>Dave: ABLORSY 15F BROA.LY +45 82
#note I wrote on my scoresheet "ABLORSTY SORTABLY ??"  I was surer that the alphagram contained a word than I was that that was the right word, but nothing else came to mind.  I probably would have played it if I didn't have such a good second option.
>Seth: AERVW L10 WAVER. +30 116
>Dave: AEIIIRS 10E AI +12 94
#note Not a happy spot, but this creates another hook for me, and this isn't the worst two-I leave in the world.
>Seth: DELOPR 11C POLDER +30 146
>Dave: EEIIRSY C9 YI.ES +28 122
#note I might have missed EYES 12C here, but I do not think it's a good idea to play it at this score.  It could easily lead to a dead board within a few turns with few comeback chances.
>Seth: IZ 10L .IZ +35 181
>Dave: CEEIIIR 7C ICIER +16 138
>Seth: CMNT 13I C.M.NT +26 207
>Dave: EEFIORU B12 FOU +19 157
#note I'm not sure why I didn't play at 7I on this or the next turn.  Did I forget about the spot?
>Seth: BOX B8 BOX +58 265
>Dave: AEEFIQR E4 FAQ.R +34 191
#note This does open the board more than FERIA or FAQIR 7I, but can it really be right with that awful leave?
>Seth: GOT D3 GOT +20 285
>Dave: DEEIIMR N4 DIMERI.E +76 267
#note Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.

>Seth: NS 12B ..NS +21 339
#note This sent me a strong signal that he did not have the J.  If he had, I probably would have seen TAJ or JNANA on row A or JANE or JADE O12, or else he would have played off more tiles to give himself a better chance to draw into those plays.  Furthermore, his play implied a strong bingo rack, so I figured there were duplicate A's and N's in the bag.  In other words, I had a good chance of drawing JNANA, so I bingoed in a way that set up a second spot for it.  It was also good to put an N into open space, since that was likely to be a hard letter for him to bingo through...
>Dave: ?EILNTU K2 NUTLIkE +70 380
#note ...That was my super-sound reasoning, I thought, but I completely missed LUTENIST O1.  Sigh.
>Seth: ADNST O11 STAND +34 373
#note Turns out he had DONATES, so that for example, INUTILE would have given him a bingo.
