#note so bad, i saw PINYON but couldn't pull the trigger. but PEONY is also better or PINEY. -6.5

>Maddy: ?CDERSU 13G CRUShED +83 199
#note although with the inference that she has a bingo that brings up hammy's stock a little bit. so it's probably close i think.

#note amazingly she didn't have a V. i'll discard the moves that quackle makes that make no sense: B13 TAO, I5 TAXI, B12 TA. H13 RAT sims better than my move, didn't really think of it, but i almost certainly need the bingo to hit the triple to have a shot at winning. -3
