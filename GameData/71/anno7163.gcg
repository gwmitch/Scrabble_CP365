#note INDEX 6F does the same thing only better defensively. That looks smart.

#note I guess I'm getting too cute here, keeping OVER with an open lane for OVER- bingos. Sim says to take the points with REVUE G11.

>Evans_Clinchy: EOPRRTV M5 PROVE +19 238
#note Missed CONVERTOR 12D, although I'm not convinced that it's a good play. I need to keep bingo possibilities open, because outrunning Brian here doesn't seem likely.
>Brian_Cappelletto: ?AAILMR 10I AdMIRAL +71 334
#note Would Nigel have found the best play here? Would Dave? Would Brian, if it had mattered and he'd actually been trying? Who knows?
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEGHRT 2F HA +28 266
#note Desperately trying to open a lane. Little did I know that there were no possible sevens in the pool with BEGRT. I have no idea what's right here, but I don't think I'm beating Brian no matter what.
>Brian_Cappelletto: BNORSTW 1F SWOB +39 373
#note Brian correctly passes up BROWNS 1A, noting that a miracle BARMIEST would beat him 399-385. This plays it safe.
>Evans_Clinchy: BEGIRTT E8 .B +9 275
#note If I'm gonna fish off the B, then maybe (PROVER)B is better.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEGIRTT 11H GREA. +23 298
#note GREAT is not great. Since Brian is going out no matter what, I might as well steal his best spot with LIGATE O10.
