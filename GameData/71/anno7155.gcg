#note Sim approves. Thought about ROADIE or AROID, but ADER is too strong to blow it up for a crappy score.

#note Sure, why not fish again? Scott's opening exchange makes me even more reluctant to open longer with this rack.

#note I wanted to choose the right fish. Ideally, it should (1) score a bit, (2) get rid of the A to make double-doubles more likely, and (3) open a bingo lane. This made the most sense to me. Quackle says a lot of options are close, giving the edge to OF G7. That's more likely to hit a bingo, but it only scores 6 and I'm probably fishing on a crappy board again if I miss. Tough call.

#note Maybe tack on the T for the extra three points. This board isn't open enough for me to worry about the inferior leave.

#note OK, maybe keeping the T wasn't so bad after all...

#note DHOW K8 is better. IIWY is pretty dreadful.

#note Still plenty of vowels unseen, so maybe turning over another with MINAE instead of NIM would be reasonable. Digging deeper into the bag with both blanks unseen can't be a bad idea.

#note Maybe GRASPING for better defense, but it doesn't make a huge difference.
