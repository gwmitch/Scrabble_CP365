>Mike_Early: AILSSW 8D WAILS +24 24
#note The second S is inferred since I was pretty sure Mike wouldn't have dumped one for only 24 pts on an open if he didn't already have one.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEFNO 9C FOE +17 17
#note Best, with the 7E placement also worth consideration. 
>Mike_Early: GHIT C9 .IGHT +24 48
>Jim_Burlant: ACDENNY 12C .ANDY +24 41
#note The sim gives slight preference to 10B YIN, with this choice roughly 1 point behind.  I considered YIN, but thought it was needlessly volatile.
>Mike_Early: AGJ H5 JAG. +12 60
>Jim_Burlant: CDELNRU 5H .UREL +24 65
#note I briefly considered UNCR(A)DLE* but thought the better of it.    This is best, with 12A UN(HANDY) a close second.  
>Mike_Early: ?AITUVX K5 .XUVIATe +84 144
#note The only playable bingo, and Mike is near 80%.
>Jim_Burlant: CDEEKNT 12J N.CKED +28 93
#note Once I saw that I could turn the rack, score 28, and draw 5 to ET, I stopped looking.  How does the adage go, find a good play, look for a better one?  I certainly didn't do that here.  J10 KENT and 13K DECK are the standouts.  This choice is a 17-point dog in the sim.  But the draw did bail me out in the short term.
>Mike_Early: HMP N11 H.MP +22 166
>Jim_Burlant: EEFRSTT 15H FETTERS +95 188
#note  I'm now winning 51%.  But not for long.
>Mike_Early: BEIINRR 14F BRINIER +82 248
#note The word itself isn't a hard find, but what was impressive was that it took Mike maybe 1/2 a second to see the 5-tile overlap and put this down.
>Jim_Burlant: ?BDEOPR O7 PROBE. +38 226
#note The only playable bingos are PREBOARD and PEgBOARD on row 10, and I missed them  - I was too busy trying to find the 8 down the O column that wasn't there.  However, the sim says the bingo is not the best play here.  M9 BROKE, which I missed, wins the sim and this choice is the runner-up by 2.7 points.  This play sims roughly 2-1/2  points better than the bingos.
>Mike_Early: GZ 10B Z.G +40 288
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADSTUW F10 WU. +15 241
#note Now I start to struggle.  With no bingos playable, I felt that anything down the L column wouldn't help, as he would shut down anything I opened up.    This play sims in a virtual tie with 11A WAG for sim winner honors.
>Mike_Early: EILOU 15B LOUIE +10 298
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADNNST 10J D.N +8 249
#note Quackle likes M2 ANDS and M2 ANTS - I don't.   I think he's too likely to kill whatever I open up.  I'd rather leave the M column open and hit it on the next turn.   I do think I should have unloaded the A, given the pool, however.  
>Mike_Early: DEISV M3 VISED +35 333
>Jim_Burlant: ?AANOST J4 O.A +16 265
#note Quackle prefers M11 SKA and M12 KA.  I thought it would be a good idea to open a line for my S and T.  I'm winning 11% right now.
>Mike_Early: AIIMORY -AIIMO +0 333
>Jim_Burlant: ?AINNST 3D INStANT +61 326
#note Best bingo here is 3E TANNISH.  Despite the 7-point gap, my winning chances are only 22%.
>Mike_Early: AIR N6 RIA +17 350
>Jim_Burlant: CMOOQTY D2 Q. +11 337
#note With a third Q spot open I could try to score but I figured that if I did something somewhere else, he'd just force my hand and make me unload the Q on the next turn anyway, so I might as well unload it here.  Neither the sim's nor Championship Player's top suggestions make much sense here.  Sim winner is MOA H1, and Championship Player's top choice here is idiotic to me:  COT 4B, which gives him the chance to Q-stick me if I don't draw an A.  However, both CP's and the Sim's runner up makes more sense than my choice:  QI 7F.
>Mike_Early: AEEELOO 13M A. +20 370
>Jim_Burlant: ACMOOTY H1 OC. +15 352
#note And I get the A one turn too late to address the spot Mike just took.  That pretty much killed any chance I had in this game.  And at this point, time was running short and I was playing speed Scrabble to not go over.
>Mike_Early: EEELOO B13 EE. +8 378

>Mike_Early: ELOO F3 .OLE +6 384
