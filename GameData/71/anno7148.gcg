#note Trying to keep things fairly tied up after Jeff's fish.
>Jeff_Clark: ADEEINT 11J EDIT +15 40
#note DE(M)ENTIA would've been sweet. I know it's high-prob, but it constantly gives me problems in study. Add that it needed to hook to ICE, and I'm sure I'd have missed it too.
>Jason: AGHILST 13A ALIGHTS +77 123
#note Not knowing SMIRKY, it's between the 13A placement or the safer N5 placement. Given that Jeff had just blown up his rack, I felt like taking a risk wasn't a bad idea here.
>Jeff_Clark: AEINPRT A8 ANTIR.PE +149 189
#note Definitely violated the NASPA Code of Conduct here (I hadn't seen my good post-bingo rack yet). But, as I said to Michael Bassett a few minutes after learning that Jeff drew into AEN, "If I'd know that, I'd have (played ALIGHTS in the same spot) a lot sooner than I did!"
>Jason: ?EFLLOS B2 FELLOwS +74 197
#note I haven't learned SMIRKY in the past five minutes, Quackle. Don't know where it started, but Jeff calls winning despite an opponent's trip-trip "slaying the dragon," and there was no reason to believe I couldn't slay the dragon here. New game, except that there's a few tiles on the board and I've got an eight-point cushion.
>Jeff_Clark: EJNO M9 JE.ON +40 229
>Jason: BDEIOST A1 BOD +26 223
#note Would've been nice to know BEDSIT. I even looked for 14J plays, too.
>Jeff_Clark: IX 14J XI +50 279
>Jason: EEIOSTV 15H VOE +28 251
#note Definitely couldn't complain about his X play given that it enhanced my options.

>Jeff_Clark: PZ F2 Z.P +34 345
>Jason: EEINRST D3 .RSENITE +68 345
#note For whatever reason, it didn't registed that Jeff's ZEP meant I didn't have to worry about TRAINEES giving up the triple line. Oops.
>Jeff_Clark: ABGNORS I2 BROGANS +64 409
>Jason: ?DGNORU 5G UN.ORGeD +70 415
#note Phony. Thought it might be good and felt like I had to put it down. GUeRDON is three more, but OW or OY for37 is quite probable (as it turns out, Jeff had MEOW for a shitton# sidelapping it). I felt like I needed the free turn here. And if he didn't challenge, this board was less likely to give up a huge counterplay.
>Jeff_Clark: EEMNOUW J4 M.W +33 442
>Jason: AAORTUW C5 AWA +19 434
#note Just replace one of the A's with one of the E's, and OUT(G)REW's an easy decision. I don't know what CP's smoking suggesting AW at N13. Considered OUTW(e)AR, which is in the middle of the pack. Don't ask how I missed the 4L placement of this word. Although, any Quackle suggestion loses to optimal play given the three tiles I drew and the one I left.
>Jeff_Clark: AEENOUY N2 NEE.Y +34 476
>Jason: LORTTUV O1 VOLT +31 465
#note Without having looked at the other two losses yet, I'd have to say this game was a microcosm of my day. My close calls/small mistakes always seemed to get hammered, and every time I seemed to have momentum, Jeff would snatch it back. Props to him, though. He played the three games he won today very well. Finally, as Tangredi asked me in Dayton '07, referring to a game with Dean Saldanha: "How do you lose a game with four bingos?" I've done it twice now that I can recall ... both times because my opponent tripled-tripled. So that's my answer.
>Jeff_Clark: AEOU N12 EAU +10 486
#note The O6 placement would've made the score an even cooler 490-481.
