#note I didn't want to play this in the more dangerous spot for 6 more points, but I missed ANTHILLS.  TALLISH had been blocked by JOE, I mean by Mic.
>Mic: AEINRST K4 TRAN.IES +82 162
#note As it turns out, this wouldn't have triple-tripled through TALLITHS in the other spot.  Hopefully I won't need those extra points later.

#note Phoney.  EARLAPS is the only valid 92-pointer, but better yet is LAPSERS N1.

#note I guess I could have blocked OR/RELAPSER, but the only way to do that is by playing IN N8.  That wouldn't really work.
>Mic: ORVV 10B V.... +16 462
#note Phoney unchallenged!  VARA, VARAS, and VERA, but VERAS is only the last name of a so-so reliever in baseball.
>Joey: IT 5C T.I. +8 450
#note Mic originally hid one of his final tiles, which I didn't understand because I thought I was losing by 5 before realizing that I misread his 423 as 428, thinking that I would have lost by 5, and I also would've realized that only 99 tiles were in play.  Wow, what a wild game!
