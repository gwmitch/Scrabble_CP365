#note There were some higher scoring plays that didn't use the Q, but this seemed like enough.

>Joey: AEHLNOO J3 ALOH. +34 115
#note Missing LOTAH 15A, which uses the same letters for 5 more points.
>Jason: AEKLS 15F SLAKE +43 170
#note And it would've blocked this.
>Joey: ENOSTVW 14J WOVEN +51 166
#note But I also wouldn't have had this.
>Jason: AIU M6 U.AI +5 175
>Joey: EHPRRST 3I H.RPER +30 196
#note I didn't think of THESP O11, which scores a lot more, but isn't as dynamic.

#note GOD K13 looks a little better, just in case of an abundance of consonants.

>Joey: ??DFGOO 1H DoGFOOt +89 414
#note The only bingo I was sure of was FOGDOGS, which I'm not sure would win.  The problem by playing this is that it gave Jason a free challenge, and it made my challenge grid all red so far.
>Joey: ??DFGOO --  -89 325
>Jason: AEFL 4L ALEF +37 377
>Joey: ??DFGOO 8A OF +21 346
#note I still have FOGDOGS, which is in fact the only bingo, but it looked even less likely to win, now.  Still, there was probably a better way to threaten a second bingo spot than this, but my brain was feeling a little overworked.

#note When I announced what letters the blank were, Jason thought I must be feeling that way.  He's right, Blanks Stink this game!
>Jason: BINOZ M11 BIZ. +30 418
>Joey: DGO 13I GOD +16 391
#note Another potential interjection for this game.  It is not to be confused with the waffle stuck to the ceiling.
