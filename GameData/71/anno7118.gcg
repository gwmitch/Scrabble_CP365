#note The leave isn't anything to write home about, so playing long with NOODGE is probably better.  Also possible is NOD D11, to set up -ING on column C.
>CeLe: BINORW 4C BROWNI. +26 133
>Dave: DENOOSY C2 NO.ODY +32 137
#note TYES scores a surprising 45 points, but this is probably a litttle better.
>CeLe: PX 6H P.X +28 161
>Dave: AEELMSU 3G AM.ULES +31 168
#note Not bad, but UNSEAM 2B scores the same and has a more balanced leave.
>CeLe: AHJ B1 HAJ +39 200
>Dave: ACEELOT 1A O. +15 183
#note A temporizing play.  I'm not trying hard for the bingo, though an A draw would give ESCALATE, as much as waiting until I have something better to do with the rack.  Meanwhile, I don't want her to have easy plays to pad the lead at A1-2.  However, I just spent the case O and there are lots of E's remaining.  EH was better, and EH/ET is also reasonable.
>CeLe: DNRT L1 TR.ND +14 214
>Dave: ACEELTT C12 CAT +22 205
#note Didn't know what to do here.  Setting up CATE on row 15 could be suicidal, but her last play implies that she was having rack trouble, and I just didn't have another way to score.
>CeLe: BGU B13 BUG +22 236
>Dave: AEEELST 15A A.EE +24 229
#note This isn't bad at all, but there's a case to be made for playing more aggressively with REED 5I, both to set up the S hook at M5 and to wait on row 15 until I have something bigger.

#note Here is where I lost the game.  I had missed a move or two in tracking and didn't realize that we were already down to one in the bag.  I finished the game with eight minutes left, so no excuses.  If I took the time to check the remaining pool and work things out, I could have won this, believe it or not.
>Dave: FIIRSTV 15L FIST +43 361
#note The only way to win is to go out fast in order to stop her from cashing both the Q and the Z, and thereby grab a ton of points from her rack.  If I had just reasoned through one at a time what tile I could draw, it would not have been too hard to figure out that FIRST is better than this.  In either case, a vowel draw will win for me.  Almost all the consonant draws lose in both cases, except for the M.  After FIRST I have two spots for VIM.
>CeLe: ACEQVWZ 6N Q. +31 415
>Dave: IMRV 13M R.V +12 373
#note VIER and VIRL are two points better just because they stop ZEAL, but it's only bookkeeping at this point.
>CeLe: ACEVWZ 11M Z. +10 425
#note A mystifying play from CeLe, but fortunately for her it doesn't matter.
