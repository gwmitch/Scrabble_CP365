>Evans_Clinchy: EFOOORW 8D WOOFER +32 32
#note Coincidence #1: Last time we played, I opened with WHOOF from an opening rack of WHOOFRR. This time, WOOFER.
>Scott_Appel: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 0
>Evans_Clinchy: BDHNOTY 9C BODY +26 58
#note Or maybe BOTHY E7. I liked holding onto the H, though. DNO seems like one of those useless in-between-type leaves -- not good enough to bingo, not bad enough to score with.
>Scott_Appel: ADEGG C9 .AGGED +22 22
#note Coincidence #2: Last time we played, Scott got bagged. This time, he plays BAGGED.

>Evans_Clinchy: ACDFTWZ 5E FAZ.D +36 187
#note WAFTED is better. I should have stopped to think harder about the value of the Z on this board. CZ offers lots of possibilities for next turn if I draw the right vowels -- AZOIC 11E, COZ 4C, CZAR 2E, etc. It's worth the point sacrifice to wait with the Z.
>Scott_Appel: GO 7F GO. +18 112
>Evans_Clinchy: CIINRTW 4D WIN +19 206
#note Or WIT, but I liked holding back the T for the TWIN hook, and there are still four N's in the bag. Quackle also suggests TWINIER, which is good for digging into the bag for the unseen SSSS??.

>Scott_Appel: JY G1 J.Y +26 220
>Evans_Clinchy: AHIQRRT C2 QAT +31 270
#note Two other options -- AIRTH 11E, to take out the hotspot and play a little defense with the lead, or AIRTH C1, which is a nice little Q setup. Or I can just drop the Q now and take the points. I was fine with this, but I can be persuaded otherwise.
>Scott_Appel: ?AILNPU 11E sPINULA +90 310
>Evans_Clinchy: HIMOORR 12I HOMO +29 299
#note All four esses still unseen. Gotta open an S-hooking bingo lane and pray for a good draw.
>Scott_Appel: ILS J6 LIS +18 328
>Evans_Clinchy: AEINRRU 4H .AREU +17 316
#note Quackle is suggesting five-tile plays from 13K (URAEI, INURE, URINE, URARI) which just look suicidal. I think I have a shot in this game if I just keep a solid leave and pray to beat Scott to the esses.
>Scott_Appel: AEINORS M9 ERASION +76 404
>Evans_Clinchy: EIMNRUV L7 VUM +13 329
#note Meh. Maybe just cut bait and play VENOM or VERMIN for 36. Bingoing out isn't gonna happen.
