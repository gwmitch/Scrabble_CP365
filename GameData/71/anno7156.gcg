>Matt_Bernardina: EIINSSU -IU +0 0
#note Sims best, with exchange ISU 4 points back.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: JLOW 8E JOWL +28 28
>Matt_Bernardina: EINPPSS I5 PIPS +26 26
#note Didn't see PEPSINS, although I know that word from biochemistry.  Didn't look hard enough at it to be honest.  JOWLS keeping EINPPS does surprisingly well among the non-bingo options.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ABENRZ F2 ZEBRAN. +40 68
#note I held him here, mixing up this with ZEBRINE, before remembering that this was good.
>Matt_Bernardina: ?DEHNSU E8 .EHU +28 54
#note I thought about UNmESHED but didn't play it, I was gunshy all tournament, and especially so against Kenji.  Didn't see ENtHUSED which is the best play.  
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EEIKLNR 11D R.NELIKE +74 142
#note And if I find the bingoes he doesn't have this.
>Matt_Bernardina: ?DFLNRS 3A FLiND.RS +74 128
#note FLiNDERS and FoNDLERS sim very close, with FoNDLERS slightly ahead.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AIV H1 VI.A +24 166
>Matt_Bernardina: AEEIIOR A3 .AERIE +30 158
#note Lucky that the F stayed open to bail me out of this bad rack.  Any of the 4v6's starting with F here do well.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AGV D1 VA.G +24 190
>Matt_Bernardina: BCDIOOO H6 BO.O +14 172
#note Blocking CONOID was unfortunate for me.  BOLO is third behind D9 BORIC and 10C BOHO.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: FRUY D9 FU.RY +32 222
>Matt_Bernardina: CDIOOST J2 OOTID +26 198
#note Lots of plays sim close, including LOTIC and CYSTOID with my choice.  LOTIC at least doesn't give up big counter plays in row K...
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEGNT K4 AGENT +33 255
#note ...like that.  I'm dying of a thousand cuts this game so far.
>Matt_Bernardina: CEISTUY L2 ECU +16 214
#note Once again I'm blind to plays in column H: LYTIC for 42 is the play.  I really had no idea what to do with this rack, but at least I've opened another bingo lane that I'll likely need.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEHMM 13B MA.HEM +38 293
#note I should have asked if he played this with the X in hand, or if he drew it.  I didn't see the possibility for a big X play, but with my next rack I'm not sure I can do much about it.
>Matt_Bernardina: CINSTWY 14A WYN +34 248
#note Again I don't even look to the TWS's; TWINY for 45 is tops in the sim.  H11 LYSIN 53 is neat.  I liked WYN because it scored and forked another lane open, plus kept CIST.  
>Kenji_Matsumoto: OX 14E OX +55 348
#note Kenji was right; I'm about 4-5% to win after this play.  Time for things to get interesting.
>Matt_Bernardina: ACIILST 12H ITALICS +83 331
#note Scored as 85.  I'm at around 25-30% to win now, but with that last blank still out I have a shot.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EIIOT B1 IO.ITE +24 372
>Matt_Bernardina: ?DDGNOS M4 SODDiNG +66 397
#note I didn't see 10I as a spot for bingoes, but I did see GODSeNDS N5.  Champ says GODSeNDS is 100% to win.   I'm not quite sure I buy that.  If I draw the Q plus anything besides the U, he can block 1A and Q-stick me.  GODSeNDS is likely the best play because it prevents what ended up happening, and I'm in trouble no matter what I play if I draw the Q without the U.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AAEEQRU N12 .ER +6 378
#note Nice setup that I can't block because of TT being left in the bag.  97% to 0% in a flash, after being at 4-5% just a couple turns ago.
>Matt_Bernardina: TT J11 ..T +7 404
#note Nothing I can do here barring a sudden shift to SOWPODS (TELT#).
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AAEQU 15K AQUAE +76 454
#note Fun game, even if I lost.  It's a great Scrabble story if nothing else. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto:  (T) +2 456
#note Final score recorded as 456-406.
