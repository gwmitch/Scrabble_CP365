#note best
>Edwin_Roth: MV 7G V.M +15 15
>Mike_Lean: CEFIIRT 4H .IFTER +18 30
#note thought about this one for a while.  really couldn't come up with anything good, i don't know why.  i like fico best in hindsight.  i was trying to open the board up with lifter.. i knew it was just horrible, i still don't know why i did it.  i think at this point i was just like you're taking too long make a decision and deal with it
>Edwin_Roth: EEJ J2 JE.E +30 45
>Mike_Lean: ?CDEGIR 2J .ERID +26 56
#note WOW, you really can't find receding mike? i think i was so focused on not having a spot for ergodic i didn't look hard enough for an 8.  
>Edwin_Roth: ACKMS 6J SMACK +42 87
>Mike_Lean: ?CDGIOP 1M PIC +28 84
#note pic or pig, i dunno.  pig probably would have been better. 
>Edwin_Roth: AA 7K AA +8 95

>Edwin_Roth: EHOP 8L HOPE +49 144
#note S$&#
>Mike_Lean: ?ANOORW 9M WAN +25 109
#note i'm down 60.  i can start to fish and start focusing on leave or i can just keep scoring and try to overpower him.  i'm not going to fall in the trap i always do and get caught fishing while scoring 12, 15, 15... let's hope i don't get another O
>Edwin_Roth: EGT 10L GET +19 163
#note i can tell already this is going to be a really tight board. 
>Mike_Lean: ?BBFOOR 11I BROO +15 124
#note didn't see fib.  i see it next turn.
>Edwin_Roth: IQ 12H QI +25 188
>Mike_Lean: ?BFHNSV I3 F.B +26 150
#note another winner.  trying to avoid exchanging when i'm down 60.. but anyway i don't think i'd ever turn down 26
>Edwin_Roth: AGU H12 .UAG +42 230
#note just what i needed.  he's at 83% now
>Mike_Lean: ?EHNSVY 14F HE.VY +30 180
#note somehow i'm scoring with these garbage racks
>Edwin_Roth: AEORT 13J ORATE +15 245
#note the first thing i think is "crap does that take an S, or an R, or what?"  of course now i think of orating, so orate would probably take DS.  everything's easier in hindsight
>Mike_Lean: ??ANNSS 14L NAN +14 194
#note what do i even do with this.  for some reason i just really didn't want to put that S on NAN.  i don't know why, but i just didn't want to do it.  i think i wanted the opportunity to play SH and LOUIES.  i'm at 30% now
>Edwin_Roth: AIILO 15B AIOLI +11 256
>Mike_Lean: ??ISSUX O4 XIS +32 226
#note just insane racks, all game.  best behind auxesis (??)
>Edwin_Roth: EOR 10H ROE +14 270
#note DAMNIT.  i finally build a bingo and he blocks it.  good move by him i guess
>Mike_Lean: ??GNSTU 13C TUNG +17 243
#note ooh TUGS 15K would have been nice.  i was thinking i just wanted to open something up for myself with both blanks
>Edwin_Roth: IO 12B OI +4 274
#note well played.
>Mike_Lean: ??LNSYZ 11C LaZY +33 276
#note you can't think of zany, or lazy one spot over to give yourself glazy?  i think i felt pretty flustered at this point.  tournament on the line, down 30 with junk in my rack and nowhere to go.  i saw lazy for 33 and was like oh wow that'll give me the lead and unfortunately didn't think too hard for something else.  pretty rookie mistake
>Edwin_Roth: AT O14 AT +10 284
#note wow ok this isn't good.  all consanents, no vowels really left in the bag.  
>Mike_Lean: ?DLNRSS 11I ....DS +23 299
#note AWESOME find.
>Edwin_Roth: W L10 ..W.. +18 302
#note i was hoping he didn't know this, because i knew he had the W.  unfortunately he knew it, fortunately he didn't get 35 out of it.  but wow, he's up and i have DLNRS?.  i'm screwed now.  or am i?
>Mike_Lean: ?DLNRS K1 L.N. +10 309
#note this sims 100%.  i can't believe i found this.  seeing the out play yet?
>Edwin_Roth: DEENTU 14A EN +8 310
>Mike_Lean: ?DRS 5D DiSR... +18 327
#note :) ballgame.  fun one, a nailbiter the whole time.
>Mike_Lean:  (DEUT) +10 337
