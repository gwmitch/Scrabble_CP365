#note Tried to figure what I could dump off while keeping bingo lines open. Then realized the G in VIGIA was a bingo line. Then realized I had a bingo from a G the whole time.

#note HAO sets up EX and keeps XI at 10F in reserve. Obvious in hindsight. Too focused on keeping the A for each hook to SPIC.

#note Should've blocked, in hindsight. But I figured as long as he didn't have the bingo (and he'd just played three), I could run. Big mistake number three, and it's three too many.
