#note quackle sort of wants me to play through, but the only play is OBI at B13 which is terrifying. no thanks.

>Magra: EEIINOV -  +0 324
#note argh, all I have to do is not challenge this! the bad challenge drops my winning percentage by literally 57%. yikes.
>Isaac_Apindi: OTW O6 WOT +33 325
>Magra: EEIINOV O1 VINO +27 351
#note I am now in all sorts of trouble. the best I could come up with was grabbing for points and trying to keep a spot for the Q, but quackle thinks this is much inferior to playing short and not emptying the bag. That may well be right. I probably lose no matter what if I draw that Q.
>Isaac_Apindi: BCMSTTU 15L STUB +27 352
#note this is a tough, pretty interesting endgame that appears to have no clear win. what would you go for?
>Magra: EEEILQ G3 QI +25 376
#note not quite right. I should play LEE at G2 to set up a higher scoring Q play, which is kinda awesome.

>Magra: EEEL L4 ..E +6 382
#note blocking his best M spot
>Isaac_Apindi: MT 2N M. +8 376
#note this is actually not right because it gives me ELEMI to go out! optimal is to dump the M elsewhere or play his best T play.
>Magra: EEL 1M LE. +10 392
#note missing ELEMI
