>John_O'Laughlin: AIMOU 8D MIAOU +20 20
>Evans_Clinchy: DELNNQR H7 Q.ERN +14 14
#note Sim says QUERN is bad defensively. John averages 40 points next turn after this, versus 35 if I trade. Maybe you can infer a bad rack from MIAOU and tweak those numbers a tiny bit, but trading is probably still better.
>John_O'Laughlin: ADOPY 10F PA.ODY +22 42
>Evans_Clinchy: DLNOORV D4 VROO. +20 34
#note Or maybe OVOLI, but this is four extra points and I liked the defensiveness of the V here.
>John_O'Laughlin: TV 9G V.T +24 66
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEGILN K6 DELA.ING +76 110
>John_O'Laughlin: AFLU 13I FU.AL +26 92
>Evans_Clinchy: CEEFKNS 12D FECKS +46 156
#note Passing up FLECKS 8J since there's no need to open the board.
>John_O'Laughlin: CENOR 8J C.ONER +27 119
>Evans_Clinchy: DEJNOTW 11C JOW +41 197
>John_O'Laughlin: IWZ 14L WIZ +37 156
>Evans_Clinchy: ADELMNT N2 LAMENT.D +76 273
#note Wow, horrendous miss of MANTLED. I just forgot there was a seven in that rack.
>John_O'Laughlin: EEELTY 15H EYELET +40 196
>Evans_Clinchy: AADIOUX 4J AXIO. +28 301
#note Sim recommends AUDIO at either J2 or 14D, both of which make juicy X setups. Neither play is that defensive, though, so I'm fine with AXIOM from up 77.
>John_O'Laughlin: BGI O1 GIB +24 220
>Evans_Clinchy: AADOSSU M3 S.DA +25 326
#note Shrug. This seemed like the hottest spot to take out.
>John_O'Laughlin: EPU 5B PU.E +12 232
>Evans_Clinchy: ABGIOSU 14G ABOS +26 352
#note Not a great play equity-wise, but I figured blocking this lane was a reasonable move. John's only hope after this is to draw an eight through the P.
>John_O'Laughlin: A K3 A. +9 241
>Evans_Clinchy: EGIINTU 13B GITE +22 374
#note Figured I'd leave the spot alone. I don't have any reasonable blocking plays, and even if he does bingo, he'll offer me counterplay.
>John_O'Laughlin: HI I6 HI +18 259
>Evans_Clinchy: ?INRSTU 2F INcRUST +70 444
>John_O'Laughlin: ?EHNRRT B1 TERa.H +36 295
#note Best, with TRENCH 1A two points behind.
>Evans_Clinchy: EI O7 I.E +8 452
