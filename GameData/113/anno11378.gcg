#note wahhhh I thought about leaving the -ED open as a lane and sacrificing a point and playing JOW up top and then I didn't! his rack is pretty random - I might as well maximize my chances of hitting a bingo.

#note weird play - on what is suddenly a really closed board, playing long and reaching for a blank looks reasonable. also, idiot! idiot! you blocked replanted for yourself!

#note the S looks pretty valuable right now.

#note it was probably time to cash in the S. SKUA keeps an O for row 12.

#note arsine is not that great of a fishing rack on such a closed board, but there are no alternatives. I liked my play because it sets up a scoring spot with the case S in case I miss but on reflection there is one definite best play - AE at 8N, fishing and blocking the main scoring spot.
