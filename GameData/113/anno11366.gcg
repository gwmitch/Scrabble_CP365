>Timothy_Anderson: BIKL H7 BILK +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEIIU I10 ADIEU +13 13
#note One of those situations where I have to chose between dumping my rack agressively or exchanging. I totally forgot this takes an X on the end too, that would have been bad. This ranks behind 6 or 7 exchanges as well as the simple AI I9.
>Timothy_Anderson: CD 14H C.D +10 30
>Matthew_Larocque: AIINOSW 11I .OW +14 27
#note I didn't want to play something like WINOS or WAINS for 27. (D)IWAN does the trick. WINOS still takes the sim.
>Timothy_Anderson: AEM H12 MA.E +42 72
#note Almost seemed like he was setting that up.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIIMNS G12 AM +20 47
#note I can't remember what I was thinking on this play. Even a fishing play like AI 10K would make more sense. I was probably saving the (DOW)N hook, but the stupid double I leave is hurting me.
>Timothy_Anderson: EJT 11E JET +25 97
>Matthew_Larocque: AIINORS 12K OI +9 56
#note Looking back, this messes up the easiest place to land a bingo, which is what I'm aiming for. However it still edges out the other plays for sim winner.
>Timothy_Anderson: HOR 12C RHO +21 118
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AINRSU 15A URbANIS. +74 130
#note He held, thinking it might only work with a Z.
>Timothy_Anderson: AX 14E AX +52 170
#note But it's hard to challenge with a play like this available.
>Matthew_Larocque: AELRSVY I1 SLAVERY +79 209
#note Lucky draw. There's a second bingo through the I! But it only scores 65.
>Timothy_Anderson: ?DGIIRS 5D RIDGI.St +86 256
>Matthew_Larocque: AGILQST 1F QAT. +39 248
>Timothy_Anderson: ENOPV D4 P.OVEN +24 280
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGILST 2E FIG +25 273
#note Dinking off the F at 14D ranks about equal to this - must be all those unseen Es.
>Timothy_Anderson: EE J5 .EE +17 297
>Matthew_Larocque: ACELRST M7 CARTELS +79 352
#note SCARLET because there's nothing he's going to do down there. Besides, something like Z(A)NY or Z(A)RF would be even worse. I always forget the anagram CRESTAL.
>Timothy_Anderson: NOO C2 ONO +10 307
>Matthew_Larocque: ELNNPTU 8L P.NE +27 379
#note I looked at the B2 spot for awhile but couldn't find LETUP for 37. I think I actually doubted UN(A)PT because I knew INAPT and forgot if both were valid. UNP(E)NT 8A and LUN(A)TE 8J rank a little better too.
>Timothy_Anderson: EINU C9 INU.E +15 322
>Matthew_Larocque: BDILNTU B2 DUB +27 406
#note TUB because there's still two 2 x T unseen.
>Timothy_Anderson: ARW A1 WAR +25 347
>Matthew_Larocque: EFHILNT O4 FLIT. +12 418
#note Brain died here, just wanted to finish the game. FLITE scores 25 at B6.
>Timothy_Anderson: EGOTTYZ 6B ZO. +32 379
>Matthew_Larocque: EHNO N1 HONE +19 437
>Matthew_Larocque:  (EGTTY) +18 455
#note I was overscored by 2.
