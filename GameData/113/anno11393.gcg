>Matthew_Levine: IQ L8 QI. +22 44
>Matthew_Larocque: BCDEGHT K9 B.ECH +28 122
#note I figured I should take the points here, but sim results say dumping BG leaving CDEHT ranks best. I know it has synergy but where am I supposed to bingo?
>Matthew_Levine: DHI M7 HID +32 76
>Matthew_Larocque: DEGMORT 11C GORM +19 141
#note This looks underwhelming but there isn't a whole lot here. MET(H)OD is 26 points though.
>Matthew_Levine: EX N9 EX +32 108
#note I guess he was feeling really desperate.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEELRTU O8 TRUED +41 182
#note Oops, paid no attention to the C at all - found the best play if you ignore that, though!
>Matthew_Levine: INR C11 .RIN +10 118

>Matthew_Levine: IKS A12 KI.S +48 166
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEINRT 15D TIARA +28 250
#note When I first started playing Scrabble in tournaments, I would have totally fished with RETINA here. Like I simply couldn't pass up the chance to draw a bingo. Even if I might not have a spot for it. TAENIA for 31 instead.
>Matthew_Levine: EOV 12K .OVE. +22 188
>Matthew_Larocque: EFILLNT 13G FILT. +16 266
#note This seems like a filthy play but this board is pretty locked down. I'd have opted for (K)E(R)F if I had noticed because it's 32.
>Matthew_Levine: BEO N5 OBE +16 204
>Matthew_Larocque: CELLNOU O1 UNCLE +26 292
#note OUNCE
>Matthew_Levine: PT H12 P.T. +9 213
>Matthew_Larocque: AILORUW M2 WAUR +17 309
#note Just trying to reach the finish line.
>Matthew_Levine: GJVW -GJVW +0 213
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAEILO M11 A.A +12 321
#note I don't see the advantage to A(V)AIL besides turnover. I'd opt to exchange instead of that, he'll score too much after A(V)AIL.
>Matthew_Levine: NR 3L N.R. +6 219
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIJLOV 2K JO.A. +36 357
#note This isn't the first time I've played this and gotten away with it, and it surely won't be the last.
>Matthew_Levine: DO 7I OD +12 231
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGILV 6C GLAIVEd +69 426
#note Obviously I know OYEN isn't a word, but the timing of this play was ridiculous. This needs to happen way more often.
>Matthew_Levine: AZ 5E ZA +46 277
>Matthew_Larocque: EMNOTW H1 TOWNE. +30 456
>Matthew_Levine: ?DESS -  +0 277
#note He challenged. Might as well if he doesn't know it, right?
>Matthew_Larocque: M L1 M.. +8 464
#note  Close - shift two to the right. 
>Matthew_Larocque:  (?DESS) +10 474
#note It's almost worse to get stuck with esses and a blank at the end of a game as opposed to high point junk haha.
