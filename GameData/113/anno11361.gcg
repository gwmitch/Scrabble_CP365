>Matthew_Larocque: ACEIMNP H4 CAMPI +28 28
#note A food prepared by North American Indians.
>Huguette_Settle: EEL I5 LEE +15 15
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EENNOR J6 NEuRONE +72 100
#note One of those racks that looks like it has at least 15 bingos, but it only has 3. I was half guessing when I played this, one of those hunches in the back of my mind. One of the anagrams scores 74.
>Huguette_Settle: AEU -  +0 15
#note Huguette knows I like making up garbage, but occasionally I make up real words!
>Matthew_Larocque: DFFGIJR I10 JIFF +37 137
#note I almost didn't play this, thinking only JIFFY was a word.
>Huguette_Settle: AEU H13 EAU +14 29
>Matthew_Larocque: DGIOORU 11D ODOUR..G +40 177
#note Ok, I actually knew this was a stinker (har har har). But it seemed like such a good way to dump these stinky letters. Held but not challenged.
>Huguette_Settle: AACDNRS 3B CANARDS +86 115
>Matthew_Larocque: BEIOOQY 10D BOY +36 213
#note OBEY in this place sims better, there's still a bunch of Es left.
>Huguette_Settle: LPY 12B PLY +32 147
>Matthew_Larocque: EIOQTVW G8 QI +23 236
#note Dump the Q or dump VW? I(N)WOVE D2, says Quackle. With the I and open U, it's reasonable to put this off I guess. 6 x I remain unseen too.
>Huguette_Settle: BGN E2 B.NG +14 161
>Matthew_Larocque: EORSTVW C2 V.W +9 245
#note I think I missed WORT for 27 at K5, I surely would have taken the points.
>Huguette_Settle: A D3 .A +16 177
>Matthew_Larocque: EEORRST 15D RERO.TES +59 304
#note Only bingo, but 59 points isn't so bad when literally nothing else scores.
>Huguette_Settle: HI 14J HI +28 205
>Matthew_Larocque: DGILMTU K2 GUILD +21 325
#note Or TUMID which I didn't know.
>Huguette_Settle: AI 13B AI +12 217

>Huguette_Settle: A 6G A.... +8 225
>Matthew_Larocque: EILMNTT 8J .NMELT +30 386
#note I think the only reason she let me have this nonsense is her counter-bingo.
>Huguette_Settle: AINOSST O7 S.ATIONS +59 284
#note ASTONI(E)S for 70. And an insane play for 87.
>Matthew_Larocque: DIIORTZ M7 Z.RO +24 410
#note Ouch, painful miss of IODIZ(E)/IODIZ(E)R. Or DITZI(E)R. I'm looking at the valuation column and it appears my choice was somehere around the range of god-awful. Despite the blank being out, the contents of the bag look clunky as hell. The simple ZIT L12 would have been fine over this. 
>Huguette_Settle: AVW 13K VAW +24 308
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIIKTX L12 K.E +20 430
#note I saw D(I)XIT, but I think I held off on it because she would play something like OUTs for 22. Can't remember if I saw the (WAN)K spot, but it's possible I was unsure if WANK was valid. Champ player likes DI(R)K, K(A)E, or I(R)K.
>Huguette_Settle: ?EEOTU N10 UT +11 319

#note -10 timer. I don't usually get away with 2 phonies in the same game, and they weren't even good ones!
