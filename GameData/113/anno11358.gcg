#note This play. THIS PLAY. I really don't even know where to start with this one. It takes real skill to be handed a chance at a 600 game and then do.... this thing. THIS THING. It's like the epitome of my shortcomings in scrabble. Think so hard that you miss the most obvious thing of all. I think it was about 4 or 5 seconds after I hit the clock when I wanted to cry.
>George_Latis: ?EIIQTU -  +0 37
#note That wasn't supposed to get challenged.

#note Guess I whiffed (D)EARY, which could also be (D)ERAY. 3C ARRAY scores a lot too.
>George_Latis: AFLPS K1 FLAPS +54 179
#note I held this because I knew DAYHOME was questionable when I played it. Let go because I have a good counter.

#note George you're really being too nice to me here.

#note INTONER plays for 73 too, at a slightly more risky placement.
