>Mike_Ryan: AKORT 8H TROAK +28 28
>Matthew_Larocque: IIINNOT K5 INI. +8 8
#note I guess I missed INION 9J because that's the type of fearless play I usually make.
>Mike_Ryan: ACHRT L1 CHART +28 56
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNOT I8 .ELATION +60 68
#note O(R)IENTAL still sims better, but both bingos are pretty crappy so let's just get the show on the road.
>Mike_Ryan: DGU 15G DU.G +18 74
#note Lucky me.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIRVY K11 EVERY +32 100
#note DE(L)IVERY is a pretty ordinary word that I never even came close to seeing. Whenever I try to find a bingo ending in Y I never get one, so it's like I subconsciously just stop trying. DERIVE 14B and DEVI(C)E 1H sim better too. Was tunnel visioned into (DUNG)Y.
>Mike_Ryan: BOSS 1L .OBS +24 98
#note Is it reasonable to assume he would have two esses here?
>Matthew_Larocque: CDFITVW 3K V.W +18 118
#note 13E FICT(I)V(E), that's just cool.
>Mike_Ryan: AFIS 10F FAI. +15 113
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEEFIT 9F EF +23 141
#note Or maybe DEFEC(T) for 30?
>Mike_Ryan: DEINNST 11A INDENTS +78 191
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDEIIT B7 ACTI.IDE +76 217
#note I mostly guessed this based on one of those vague hunches I sometimes get. The funny part is there's an even more obscure sounding word here - CTE(N)IDIA. Held briefly.
>Mike_Ryan: AIJLS C3 JAILS +29 220
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINOPQ 10A Q. +22 239
#note 14F, that was just bad to miss. Or PEON D1 since I'll get my Q down no matter what.
>Mike_Ryan: EO D3 OE +17 237
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGINOP 8H .....ING +39 278
#note Cool, but..... clearly not as good as PIGEON(IT)E! Or OPE A13 but I guess my strategic prowess is too feeble to understand.
>Mike_Ryan: AEY A13 AYE +26 263
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMOPRU M8 .MPURE +26 304
#note I kinda didn't like this, but it's the cowinner of the sim with OPE C13.
>Mike_Ryan: AZ 14F ZA +34 297
>Matthew_Larocque: ADELLOR C13 DAL +24 328
#note Nothing scores good here, sim wants OLD/DOL 8D. Because AELR is a good leave or something?
>Mike_Ryan: GH 13G GH. +16 313
>Matthew_Larocque: BEELORU A5 BEL +8 336
#note Argh. I was super concerned he was ready to bingo. I just didn't want him to get it on the TWS. When I put his rack in to the sim, it basically says I'm screwed no matter what, with 6C (L)OBULE giving me just over 20% chance to win. And that BEL is immeasurably awful. It's so far down in the abyss that the second worst play on the list is still about twice as good.
>Mike_Ryan: ?OOPRST 2D TORPOrS +65 378
#note A communication decive in an airplane.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEORUWX H1 R.UX +57 393
#note Best but he's going out.
>Mike_Ryan: ?MNOU O1 .UmMON +10 388
#note MOUNd E5.
>Mike_Ryan:  (EEOW) +14 402
#note Not bad for drawing only the Q and the X, right?
