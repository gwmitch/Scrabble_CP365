>Bob: AGKW 8G GAWK +24 24
#note Strap in, this one is D'Antoni/Nash Suns fast.
>Matt: ENOORSU K2 ONEROUS +77 77
>Bob: ADEIRST H8 .IRDATES +80 104
>Matt: ?GHOTTT J2 HOT +31 108
#note Yeah, GHETTO to dump more junk is better.  GTT is ugly even with a blank.
>Bob: GHO L2 HOG +34 138
>Matt: ?AAGLTT 15H .AGiTTAL +77 185
#note This rack makes 3 8's, all which play on this board. This scores the most.
>Bob: JR 6J J.R +26 164
>Matt: AAEFMOZ 14N ZA +46 231
>Bob: BEIPRRS 12F SP.RERIB +74 238
#note Pretty!
>Matt: AEEFMOV 11K EMOVE +32 263
#note I was more sure of EMOVE# over AMOVE#, plus there are 7 more E's vs. 3 more A's to come.
>Bob: IX 13L XI +40 278
#note Can't seem to shake him yet.
>Matt: AADEFFL O7 LEAF.D +36 299
#note I really wanted to play AEFALD# but no place for it.  Took me a while to find this.  EFFED# scores best and means what you think it would.
>Bob: AEIU 10F AU.EI +9 287
#note The only turn either of us would score under 24.
>Matt: AEFILNV N1 FLAVINE +82 381
#note Well that was a fortunate draw.
>Bob: DIMNNOU G1 MOUNDIN. +64 351
#note But he's still not going anywhere.  Also UNMONIED# for 79.
>Matt: CEENQTY H1 YEN +43 424
#note Trying to draw an I for F6, and I have other places to drop the Q if he blocks next turn.  Quackle suggests EYNE in the same spot for 46.
>Bob: BEEEPW 14D BEWE.P +25 376
>Matt: ?ACEQTY 13C QAT +30 454
#note Didn't occur to me to burn the blank for 68; QuAY or QuEY look pretty nice.
>Bob: DIORSTU 4A TURDIO.S +80 456
#note He comes back one last time...
>Matt: ?CEILNY C3 p.INCELY +82 536
#note ...and I am finally able to put him away for good.  He thanked me for letting him believe he had a chance to win.  20 turns, 8 bingoes, several of them fun.  Great game.
