>Jackson_Smylie: CEIRSTZ 8G ZIT +24 24
#note I thought for a long time on this turn. I wasn't quite satisfied with ZIT. I guess that was just my "don't break up a bingo rack" side speaking. CERS is still a very very good leave. I guess I didn't really consider much else, just exch z and exch cz. I was looking for better options, but ZIT is best.

>Jackson_Smylie: ?EIINTY K6 .ENIlITY +70 160
#note NImEITY, (C)YTIdINE, (S)YENITIc are the three words I didn't know, the two first ones are better than the word I played. I also saw Id(O)NEITY which isn't as good obviously.
>Eli_Shupak: AEP 9G APE +32 48
>Jackson_Smylie: DEKPQST O4 K..PT +48 208
#note Yes, phoneying is rarely the best play. Yes, KOEPT is a complete phoney, no word like it. I've played Eli maybe 5 or 6 times and maybe 10 online, and I know that he rarely if ever challenges me. Although my spread was already around 800 at this point, more spread can never hurt, and I really really really needed this win. Against someone who will more willingly challenge I would always play DESKT(O)P, but I felt it was completely okay to phoney.
>Eli_Shupak: U 8N U. +2 50
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEEGQS 10G GED +33 241
#note The exact same situation as last turn. I am going to be playing many phoneys right now also to test him to see how far I can phoney without him challenging. I know HIPE* isn't a word, but it scored way better than anything else, kept a decent leave for keeping a Q, and gave me an S hook.
>Eli_Shupak: INW 4L WIN. +22 72
>Jackson_Smylie: EEEHQSW M3 Q. +22 263
#note I'm not going to sit around waiting for an I because a) that spot will likely be taken by him and b) if I want to draw an I, I have to get rid of many tiles which requires using my S.
>Eli_Shupak: GI N2 GI. +19 91
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEEHSW 12H WEE.ED +28 291
>Eli_Shupak: ?AACDLO 1I COLADAs +85 176
#note Aaaaaaaarghhhhhhhh
I held him on COLADAs* for about 3 minutes before accepting. I was really about 50/50 on it, I just had no real idea. I saw that he could have played CArLOAD or CALAnDO in a few places, but didn't really think that was a large consideration as I don't think he knows those words. I accepted just because I could dump a few bad tiles for some points and didn't want him to catch up. Bad Jackson.

>Eli_Shupak: II -II +0 176
>Jackson_Smylie: EHJRSVY H12 .HEY +39 363
#note My win % is at 99.90% ish, so the play doesn't REALLY matter. But I chose WHEY over WHYS because a) I want to keep my s to use the ZAGS hook (and block it), and playing WHYS allows for a lot of high scoring bingos. i want to limit his combacks. I also could block the E in whey easily if I keep JRSV with a play like JIVER or JEER. If I draw IE I also have JIVERS (which isn't a huge chance :P).

>Eli_Shupak: ILMO 2A MILO +17 260
#note 2E, 5D.
>Jackson_Smylie: FLORRSV 11C VORLS +30 445
#note Again, I phoneyed knowingly -- VORLS allows fewer bingos than ROLFS and keeps a better leave. It also allows fewer underlaps.
>Eli_Shupak: AGSU A4 .UGAS +39 299
#note LEARN. YOUR. J.Q.X.Z. 5S!

I just failed. Wow. I know it doesn't really matter win-wise, but Wow. I held him on JUGAS* and I only remembered the L back-hook for JUGA, but I talked myself out of it thinking I must have assumed JUGA took an S and remembered only the L hook. Gahhhhhhh
>Jackson_Smylie: AAFOORU 1A AA +20 465
#note aaaaahhhh. I didn't think too hard on this play but still - missing FA(V)OUR is not only un-canadian but just stupid. It still wins 100% though. :/

#note It wasn't a very good game, but I was generally pleased with my playing when I wasn't phoneying or not challenging phoneys.
