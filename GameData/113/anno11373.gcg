>Jacob_Williams: JNU 8G JUN +20 20
>Chris_Canik: AAOPRSY 9H PAYOR +18 18
#note I was afraid of this. Q likes (J)AY significantly more than PAYOR. 
>Jacob_Williams: MOP 8K MOP +15 35
>Chris_Canik: ADINOST I6 AD..TIONS +63 81
#note I'm really glad he didn't play MOP at 10I (which was a better choice for him, unless he really wanted the hooks), because it left me this. There is only one other bingo on this board for me, and it's also a 9. 


Spoiler:
TANDO(OR)IS. 
>Jacob_Williams: AIR J4 AIR +9 44
>Chris_Canik: DFFGOTU H12 GOUT +30 111
#note I'm overly paranoid about leaving triple words open, but in this case, I was correct to slightly screw my leave in favor of not giving him the 1H or 8O triple spots (GUFF or TUFF in either 3G or 7L). GOUT is best.
>Jacob_Williams: AEEILRT 3G ATELIER +72 116
>Chris_Canik: DFFILLY H1 FI.LY +36 147
#note This is where one begins to see why a double-F leave isn't actually that bad. FI(T)LY is, however, better than any other option, among which are D(A)FF or FLY at 2J. 
>Jacob_Williams: DHN K2 H.ND +24 140
>Chris_Canik: CDFILOV L1 VI.D +37 184
#note Best.
>Jacob_Williams: AITV 4D VITA. +18 158
>Chris_Canik: BCFILOT 1D CLIF. +16 200
#note Interestingly, Quackle didn't generate CLIF(F). However, after inputting it, it performs fairly well in a simulation. B(I)OTIC E3 is a bit better, as is (MO)TIF K8. 
>Jacob_Williams: ?ESUZ 13G Z..UlES +50 208
>Chris_Canik: ABEMOTT 10I .OMB +29 229
#note Correct.
>Jacob_Williams: EOU E1 .OU.E +10 218
>Chris_Canik: ACEESTT N6 CASETTE +75 304
#note Probably the better placement is any of the other two (N1 or N5). I was more paranoid of leaving MOPE one space short of the triple than of leaving O12 for a double-triple or a floating E at N7. 
>Jacob_Williams: BHOO O12 HOBO +48 266
>Chris_Canik: EINRRSW 11I .WIS +45 349
#note Cool spot. Quackle agrees that dropping the S is worth the points over (V)IEW.
>Jacob_Williams: AW D4 .AW +11 277
>Chris_Canik: EKNQRRX 15E NEX. +11 360
#note Mistake here. I didn't like leaving two lanes open (C5 and 15A), so I chose to block one instead of exchanging. Quackle likes exchanging all 7 best of the exchange options.
>Jacob_Williams: AEGLN 14B GLEAN +22 299
>Chris_Canik: AEKNQRR C12 KA.E +16 376
#note I was very low on time at this point, so I didn't sit and realize that nothing bad could happen if I took a few more points at the D column. This ensured that both lanes (C5 and B7) were irreversibly blocked. There are actually no bingoes to the G in GLEAN anyway with what's in the pool.
>Jacob_Williams: ?DEEEGI 12A EE.ED +22 321
>Chris_Canik: NQRRR 2E .N +8 384
#note I was almost completely positive that EE(K)ED was not valid, but challenging and losing while holding the Q made the game uncomfortably close, so I chose to ignore it.
>Jacob_Williams: ?GI 1L .aGI +21 342
#note He went 20 points' worth of time over his clock, and I was damn close to going over as well. Final score is 348-384.
