#note OXEN or just OX are slight improvements here. It's worth 6 points to keep a more balanced leave.

#note I knew STELENE did not take an S, so I didn't play MOROSER at 15G. This will be important later.

#note TITFER E3 is a huge miss.

#note Word knowledge error. Didn't know REEN 9D.

>Lucas_Freeman: AEKNOST --  -49 244
#note Dumping the K at 5B is the obvious choice. I knew STELENE did not take the mouse but I plunked this down anyway. I was hot, tired, and losing focus.

#note The blank is a T. This will be important later.

>Lucas_Freeman: AEGNSTU 13B GU +26 326
#note I should have played GUS. The S does me little good on this board when I'm reading the blanks correctly.
>Joel_Wapnick: EY J10 YE. +29 413
>Lucas_Freeman: ACEINST O3 ACETINS +96 422
>Lucas_Freeman: ACEINST --  -96 326
#note I'd read the blank as an E the whole time. Were I right, this would easily have been the best play. ENTASTIC was best though, and ACETINS came off in a heartbeat. Embarrassing mistake, especially just four moves after SKEAN.
>Joel_Wapnick: DINW N2 WIND. +18 431
>Lucas_Freeman: ACEINST 9F ANT +25 351
#note FANG I5 gives me a little hope still, though I clearly didn't deserve it.
>Joel_Wapnick: ARU 15E ARU. +6 437
>Lucas_Freeman: CEIJSTW 11B J... +11 362
#note Leaving too many points on the board. JEWS B7 scores a ton and still offers an -ITIC bingo in the northeast quadrant. DIORITIC looks like a reasonable shot if Wapnick doesn't block.
