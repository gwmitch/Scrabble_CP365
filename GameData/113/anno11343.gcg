#note Chickened out on ZUPA#, conflating it with the Italian word for soup, ZUPPA*.  The last thing I needed to start this tournament was a word challenged off.
>Bob: DGIMNPS H7 D.MPINGS +75 75
#note This is actually TWL!  I certainly thought it was worth the 10 points to challenge.
>Matt: ?ABEIVZ 14C AVIZE. +38 54
#note PAV# actually sims highest, but this is 2nd.  I'd rather cash the Z now and hopefully bingo next turn.

#note I've had a really big aversion to double N's lately; they've really clogged my racks and they're difficult to get rid of sometimes, hence why I chose this over FAW#.  I have options with the F on this board at 10F and 14J next turn.

#note CHaNTIE# is one more, but I think this is fine.

>Matt: AELORRT 3J RO.L +8 290
#note Yeah, I chickened out on RETAILOR.  It looked vaguely familiar, but it's been a while since I've looked at it and I could only convince myself of RETAILER.  Ugly play, but I luck out next turn anyway.

>Matt: EENOOST B1 OEST.ONE +81 453
#note All 4 of my games against Bob were like this, bingoing back and forth and lots of points.

>Bob: BEEEEIQ 9G E.E +18 404
#note BEE is a bt better, since it dumps the B yet keeps two spots to dump the Q next turn.
>Matt: KMRSU 5J MU.KS +26 515
#note MUSK M6 is 33.
