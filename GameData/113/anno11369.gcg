#note not worth messing up my leave for defense here. i get a lot more back keeping ERN than he does if i put the E there. hard to figure this out in a game for some reason. (-4)

>cesar: ADEENRR 11E RE +12 67
#note i think the main problem is that RE scores too little (from a quackle point of view) and that it's way too easy for him to shut down the board (from a human point of view). so RE is bad all around. i'm surprised quackle likes ENDEAR that much better. i guess i don't really understand quackle. (-7.5)

#note i did lay down INOCULATE first, but 3 less points and maybe worse defensively doesn't make up for the cool factor :P

#note quay doesn't necessarily imply anything. i can't pretend i wasn't worried about the double double, but i figure i gotta try to find the best play here, which is 15K AFRIT by a long shot. i'm not very good at scrabble so i can't find plays like that. (-8)

#note wow. FEIST is a word. sigh. (-10) at least i picked this over AFTER (although quackle likes it a little less)
