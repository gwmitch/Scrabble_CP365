#note Other bingos are PROMISE 7I, and  REIMPOSE/PROMISEE at I1, all of which score less and are way more dangerous.

#note Quacke likes OVER 2K a lot better, but I don't think opening row 1 is a good idea with a 100-point lead.
>Quackle: EENNTUX H1 ENU. +21 285
>Mack: AAFORST 2F FA.O +15 381
#note Quackle likes N10 FATAL or 7C FAVA, but I like this for defensive purposes.
>Quackle: ?AEINTX N8 .AX +35 320
>Mack: AAIIRST -  +0 381
#note  The only bingos Quackle could possibly have is CREATINE 1A or AGENETIC 1D. If I play any tiles, I will empty the bag and lose to CREATINE. High-scoring plays such as AVAST 7D will also lose to CREATINE. I considered blocking plays, such as AE 1G, after which Quackle can not bingo, but didn't want to let him have JAW at M13. While passing does work best IF Quackle has CREATINE, as I can accumulate a lot of spread by J-sticking him, it is inferior to AE if Quackle doesn't have it, since AE blocks several plays at 1A. If I pass and Quackle does not have CREATINE, he might play JAW 13L, after which plays such as TARSIA 3A and AVAST 7D will win by a small margin. On the other hand, Quackle might try fishing off the J with JO M13, but I could then play AE or  STRIAE 1C which I did not see, or any other blocking play after which he wouldn't have a bingo and lose. All in all, AE is probably a better move as the odds are against him having CREATINE, but passing worked out better in this game.

>Mack: AAIIRST 13M TA. +18 399
#note The only winning moves here are those that block JO at both M13 and 12N.
>Quackle: J -  +0 407
>Mack: AIIRS 15J I. +9 408
#note Since Quackle can't play the J, I can simply play off 1 tile at a time to get more spread. However, I must be very careful not to give him a spot for it in doing so.
