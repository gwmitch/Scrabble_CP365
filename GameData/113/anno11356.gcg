>Matthew_Larocque: BEHNORR 8D BORNE +20 20
#note Kind of a weird rack, with no plays seeming to stand out. I liked BORNE because at least it provided good defense.
>Roland_Simon: FIX 9C FIX +30 30
>Matthew_Larocque: CHIILRU C9 .ILCH +26 46
#note I didn't know FICHU which would have been a lot better.
>Roland_Simon: AH B10 HA +28 58
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIORU A11 AUREI +21 67
#note Or AURAE. Sim likes AE(C)IA, although that could be painful if he gets a 2x2 bingo.
>Roland_Simon: EEG 7E GEE +21 79
>Matthew_Larocque: ADMORTT B13 ART +18 85
#note I didn't even like this as I played it, but I wanted to keep scoring all the same. Perhaps ATT instead though. TA(BI)D is cool but I didn't know the word. Sim likes fishing the T off at D10. ADMORT? makes a bingo if the 7th letter is any of ANOSWZ, or 26/71 unseen letters including the blanks. So 36-37% chance of drawing a bingo. Not bad I guess if I'm clever enough to find something like TSARDOM. I didn't know MATADOR.
>Roland_Simon: EIMT 6G MITE +13 92
>Matthew_Larocque: DEGMOPT 5D GEMOT +24 109
#note I was juggling between TEMPO 5H and MOPED 5F. The latter might have been fun, if by chance he forgot about the s-hook. I played GEMOT because I like the P more than the G, and it was pretty defensive. (C)OMPTED for 30 is the sim's choice. It's possible I saw it and wasn't sure, but more likely I was just fixated on the overlaps.
>Roland_Simon: BDIIOOW 5J WOOD +21 113
#note After the game he told me he regretted not playing BIDI instead of WOOD. BOW 4E sims better than anything despite the leave.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DDOPRS 4L DORP +29 138
#note No bingos. There's 4 eights using this rack; two being the obvious PRODDERS and PLODDERS. The other 2 being DROPSIED and DEWDROPS.
>Roland_Simon: FUU D3 FU.U +16 129
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEENPS 9H DEPENdS +63 201
#note So frustrating. I just killed my timer here looking for a 3x3. There is one, and I managed to come up with it, but I had no more confidence in it than anything else. He was sure to challenge so I didn't want to guess.  The good news is I'll never forget the word thanks to this. Indeed I was able to play it sans the S for 26 points in the tournament after this!
>Roland_Simon: ABIRY L7 BI.ARY +24 153
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEGNOY O4 .OGEY +33 234
>Roland_Simon: ADISV 3I DIVAS +34 187
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAENTV 6B VA. +14 248
#note I didn't know (C)AVATiNE, but there's no way I should have missed TAVE(R)NAs. I'm positive I saw TAVErNA on my rack too, but I somehow whiffed playing through the R. Lucky for me, I still manage to recover from this.
>Roland_Simon: AELNOSS 2H LOS +12 199
>Roland_Simon: AELNOSS --  -12 187
#note Not good, Roland, not good. I'm pretty sure this is what his rack was, he talked about it after the game. Sims says he should play ON C3.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENOQT 12C .OTQuEAN +88 336
#note First time playing this word. I questioned if Q(I) for 31 was better, but I figured I probably won't get to play this again for a long time.
>Roland_Simon: AELNOSS H12 .LAN +12 199
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILLNT C2 LIN +18 354
#note ALLANITE. One of the countless "a mineral" entries. You could make a 365-day calendar for the amount of minerals I've come across playing scrabble.
>Roland_Simon: EJKSU 2F JUKES +41 240
>Matthew_Larocque: AELRTWZ 14F ZE.L +33 387
#note Sim says I did something horribly wrong by not playing W(A)LTZ instead.
>Roland_Simon: CIINOST J9 .OI.TS +28 268
#note I guess that's why.
>Matthew_Larocque: ARTW N9 .WART +16 403
>Matthew_Larocque:  (CIN) +10 413
#note He didn't know SWART so he took the free challenge. My final score ended up as 396 from timer penalty and an extra 3 points I gave myself somewhere apparently.
