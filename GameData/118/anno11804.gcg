#note an auspicious beginning. as a side note, i almost hate being obviously lucky as much as i hate being unlucky. caldera is better because it doesn't expose the vowels.

#note ok good, now i can stop feeling bad about being lucky!

#note unfortunately i don't know collins strategy enough to know if keeping the horrible leave for 39 points is worth it, but an exchange is too far behind. now JAI# i remember. it's still not a word.

#note ourie is better, but i wasn't sure enough of LIPO#. this 5-pt challenge is pretty lame by the way. (-1.5)

#note what do you guys think? PUTZ may be a tiny bit better because of the leave. the pool is clunky. this is an interesting move. i just wanted points unfortunately (but ZIP is too ugly). i guess drawing the Q here for me is not a bad thing, but maybe eliminating that volatility with PUTZ ends up being better.. but that barely puts me ahead. not sure what's right.

#note i wanted to see if there was a word like HANDPOT  or something insane like that but couldn't see anything. quackle suggests i am totally screwed, but J5 AD gives me a supposedly tiny shot of 2.78%. don't see how. POND gives me the same win % but a lower "equity". i was pretty sure i was screwed but was trying to get an out play with the best leave i could
