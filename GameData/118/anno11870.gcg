#note Yeah that was a mistake. I drew fast enough however that he didn't notice it, but not fast enough so it could be considered fastbagging.

#note Phony, but it seemed good to me at the time, and anyways, it was too risky to challenge.

#note I remember having an M. At this point I am scared of playing mib because of the S hook it takes. a many ply sim prefers bikie to mib very slightly.

#note Quackle seems to either prefer 6 letter words starting at O1 or words that use the triplle word score at O15. I played me because it took a 40 point lead and blocked the possibility of (R)EDLINES should the O have been in the bag. Quackle claims my move wins 63.81 percent of the time, which is impossible with 1 tile in the bag.  GENOM at 12A is supposed to win 75.85 percent of the time, however I think that should be 87.5, losing only if the O is in the bag. I feel like my move of ME is a guaranteed win. All moves that ignore the bingo of (R)EDLINES would win 87.5 percent of the time, losing to only the O in the bag. The question to consider is can Justin outrun me if he has the right combination of tiles after I play ME. With an E in the bag, I have an unstoppable OCTANE in two locations. With an S in the bag, a play of indole at the top is simply not enough to outrun me. With an L in the bag, Justin's best play of S(E)INED cannot outrun LAC(QUEYS) which I would never have seen, or even a billion played which I would have seen. With a D in the bag, Justin's out of 2 with L(E)SION followed by E(R)E loses by 16. With an I in the bag, Justin's best sequence of (T)ONED (to block (RE)ACTION) followed by SALE loses by 26. With an O in the bag, Justin plays S(E)DILE followed by (W)E(e)N to lose by 4. Finally, with an N in the bag, Justin played (G)ELID followed by (AL)OES to lose by 10. Therefore, me had to have been the right play, as it won with all tiles in the bag. (if anybody can find another guaranteed win that saves spread, please post it in the comments section)

#note Also phony but I didn't challenge because I still had a win without challenging.
