#note Played way too fast. JUKU.

>Will: AGHOOUX E9 .OX +26 56
#note I thought about H/AG for a while, but it seems like if Stefan doesn't bingo it will just get blocked every single time. It still might be worth trying.
>Stefan: LW 10D L.W +35 66
>Will: AAGHIOU D10 .AOGAI +25 81
#note Q prefers LOUGH/LAUGH. I thought HU would be much more of a sure thing for next turn than AAI/AIO. Still, the JOUKS hook is already pretty heavy, so LAUGH wouldn't make things that much worse for me...
>Stefan: AEMT C8 TEAM +26 92

#note Oh, man...no other option really appealed to me here, as much as I wanted there to be something.
