#note This is where I started to worry. The board is relatively closed, and I have to take the points, but what I draw out of the bag is critical!

#note FUCK!!! THIS COULD LOSE ME THE GAME!!!

#note FUCK!!! HE GOT THE OVERLAP!!!
>Winter: DEHIOXY O1 EH +39 282
#note Coming back is not impossible, but it's going to be a fight!
>Jack_Eichenbaum: CIP 12A PIC. +11 306
#note Wow. I can't believe he did that.
>Winter: AADIOXY A12 .OXY +48 330
#note Looking better, but by no means over.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: ERW C12 .REW +18 324
#note Shit. That's going to be a problem.
>Winter: AAADEIZ 14K DAZE +35 365
#note AIDE might have been better. Doesn't sim well, but leaving him the W was dangerous.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: AGINV 15C .AVING +42 366
#note Shit. This is a problem.	
>Winter: AAAEIJU G8 JU. +25 390
#note Wow. This is going to be tough. I see ARC and want to play AA to block, but I don't have another J spot. I think he has NARC at first--thankfully the N was actually gone, otherwise I lose for sure.

Quack likes AA for some reason, but I couldn't see how to win that way.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: ACLRT 15M ARC +28 394
#note Oh shit, that's why--HE HAD TALC!!! Wow, he missed three winning plays.
>Winter: AAAEI 9J .A. +3 393
#note Took me forever to see this block. Don't know why Quack doesn't like it.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: LT 14C .L +4 398
#note Wow. He missed (G)L(AD) too. No wonder Quack said I couldn't win.
>Winter: AAEI 10M A.E +5 398
#note Now I screw up with A(L)E, missing E(POXY).
