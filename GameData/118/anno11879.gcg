>Winter: AAORTXZ 8G ZAX +38 38
>Ruth_Hamilton: AEILNST 9F SALIENT +83 83
#note And she's off, with the easy-peasy bingo. Always the easy-peasy bingos.
>Winter: AAJOPRT 8L AJAR +39 77
#note Basically a tied game, but I lost the momentum that comes with going first.
>Ruth_Hamilton: MOT 10J MOT +26 109
>Winter: EFIOPTW 11I FEW +35 112
>Ruth_Hamilton: CEITW 12K TWICE +29 138
>Winter: DINOOPT 10F OPT +28 140
>Ruth_Hamilton: FR N8 .RF +14 152
#note Her racks fizzles at last, but I don't expect my lead to last long.
>Winter: BDGINOO O11 G.OID +21 161
#note Quack likes OD, but it favors a bingo leave. It can't know that Ruth tends to play closed. I'll take the points and turnover.
>Ruth_Hamilton: IRSUV 11C VIRUS +34 186
#note Yes, she is like a virus.
>Winter: BDEMNOT D8 BED.M +26 187
#note What are the odds she'll be able to play the B off the triple, I wonder? I considered MO(V)ED, it's not like leaving that hotpost at B10 is safe, not against an Inconvenient Ruth.
>Ruth_Hamilton: BNOY 8A NOB.Y +36 222
#note Of course.
>Winter: AIINOTV E5 VIN. +20 207
#note Quack likes IV(Y), but again, I've learned the peril of giving up points to try and bingo against a player who I know will close down those open lines right away. She does that. Trust me.
>Ruth_Hamilton: KNPY M11 P.NKY +28 250
#note She never fizzles for long.
>Winter: AAIOOST N12 .OO +27 234
#note My rack sucks, but at least I caught a brief break and was able to score. Now if her rack could just FIZZLE!!!
>Ruth_Hamilton: ?EEORRT 5D O.ERTiRE +70 320
#note MOTHERFUCKER!!!
>Winter: ?AAAIST 13E ATAxIAS +66 300
#note Three A bingos are deep. I was lucky to find just one and have a spot.
>Ruth_Hamilton: ACELO H1 LOCA.E +27 347
#note WHY CAN'T SHE FIZZLE???
>Winter: AGHILLR 3H .HIRAL +30 330
#note  ,wType a note here!
>Ruth_Hamilton: DQU L1 QU.D +48 395
#note COME ON!!!
>Winter: EEGILSU C11 .EG +18 348
#note Ugh. Okay this was my stupid. I take back everything I said.
