#note Oh, brother...I looked for a while for some other option that didn't exist. I figured enough of the time, Stefan would lack an S or a Y and have his best play be blocked by the bingo to make it worth taking the gamble.

#note A little more final than PARIAN/PIRANA, which admittedly do deal with a lot of the threats in the danger spot (but not Y(vowel))

#note OK, this is just not the right approach here. Stefan is probably at least as likely to catch up by scoring as he is by bingoing, and this doesn't help matters. BIKIE for points or KIR to preserve vowels are better ideas by far.
