#note I had no idea what to do here. I saw just about all the options there were to consider and just played CURIN(G), hoping I could score with the J next turn, especially at H4. 

If I played JU, my two least attractive tiles, I would have to play JUR(A) or JUR(A)L, giving Jason a chance to score with a J word. I didn't think the 11 or 12 points were worth it in the end with how much I was giving back. JU(G) is also something I considered but it also gives back so many more points.

If I get rid of the J, I play 9F JIN, which gives Jason a hook he's more likely to have than me and leaves me with a bad combination of tiles. If I play H7 J(A)IL I still have a bad leave and I increase the value of an S that Jason is again more likely to have than me more than twofold. If I play J(A)R or R(A)J, I give back an A hook that I have 2 shots to draw. The A's value is increased fivefold after RAJ or JAR, and I don't have it either.  J(A)RL does the same thing as J(A)IL and leaves just as unattractive of a leave. JI(B) is worse than RAJ or JAR since the E is the most likely tile on Jason's rack and I have but 2 shots to draw one for (JIB)E. 

If I don't get rid of the J I can play CURI(A)L for 11, which seems alright as it doesn't only give one good thing back and gives me my best leave with the J. CLUIN(G) which doesn't give me anything possibly good next turn but at least gives me turnover, LU(B)RIC which I missed, which forks the board and leaves me with a decent leave without giving much back except a freak X spot. CURLIN(G) which maximizes turnover, which is only a good thing in a few scenarios, mostly I'm still stuck with crap. Then there's CURIN(G), which gives me two decent J spots to use next turn, one that might score 40+ points and will stay open a good proportion of the time. This is why I chose CURIN(G). I don't know if it's the right play. Quackle definitely doesn't think so.

The problem is that I have no idea what Jason might have kept after his last play so I really have to rely on myself overall. The other option is exchanging, which is basically as bad as CURLIN(G) but might yield some good things. 

Really hard turn to start things off.

>Jason: ?ADOPTT --  -74 12
#note Well, he used the spot I kind of set up.

At first I held. Then I made sure I had never seen this used or played. Then I made sure it wasn't in Jason's studying range (TT + AA with UP seemed to make this around 13000 to 16000 probability). Then I thought if the word made any sense. Then I challenged.
>Josh: GIIJLQT 4H Q.ILT +48 61
#note I briefly looked at what I was going to be giving him and what I was leaving open and it didn't look like he had anything. I don't think I should have spent too much time since he obviously didn't see anything he thought was more plausible last turn. Would you have spent more time searching?
>Jason: ?ADOPTT 9F POT +13 25
#note It turns out that Jason had missed a word he's missed before and I've missed before, since it's really hard to see. TeT(R)APOD. We as a community need better tools for seeing 8s. This play looks fine, since Jason knows I'm going to try and shut down the board if I can this turn.
>Josh: EGIJNOS E3 JINGOES +86 147
#note Too bad I'm lucky... ALWAYS KEEP THE J!
>Jason: ?ADHT 3B HAD. +30 55
>Josh: AEEILRU 3K EAU +10 157
#note (L)IEU K4 gives him more to work with, and A(G)UE 6D does too, as well as scoring less. 
>Jason: ?ALTTVY 6H V.TALiTY +67 122
#note very good find
>Josh: EEILMRS C1 ME.SLIER +61 218
#note This is the only available bingo. I looked for a while. Such luck. I wasn't happy that I was opening another 3x3, but Jason was understandably much less happy.

#note What do I infer from his last play?

I'm asking this for a specific reason. Now that it seems like I have the game pretty much clenched, I think I should be going for as much spread as possible.

Some context provided will let you know that this is the last game of the club tournament. Emanuel and Michael are both 3-0 and they are playing one another for 1st. Me and Jason are both 2-1 and I have a bit more spread than him. 

Therefore I need to ensure that I can make 2nd place. Emanuel has around 470 spread, Michael 370 or so. I have around 370 as well, so if I win and Michael loses, I get 2nd. Nobody else is close to my spread. If I win and Emanuel loses, I have to win by 100 more than what he loses by. 

So after this turn, I can either be ahead by a bingo and have the case blank in hand (if I play B6 KAE, 1A KA(M)E or O5 T(Y)KE/K(Y)TE, B6 KA or 10G BEAK).

Or I can bingo and be ahead by more than 100, to hopefully keep that lead and ensure second place. 

I saw the only bingo options available. BETAKEn/BETAKEs in two spots and T(i)EBrEAK at M5. What option is the best for me if I want to maintain an 100+ points lead?

I think that given everything I should just take the points at 10G. I chose this cause scoring spots are what I want. Jason wants to bingo. I think I want a scoring board so that I can maintain an 100+ point lead. Maybe there are enough places to score though. After 10G bingos I can draw an X-bomb, draw points at 1A, play down to the Y at O6, etc. I guess there is no need to create more spots. Also, I didn't like that 10G plays gave Jason an S hook that isn't likely to disappear anytime soon. 

Another really interesting play! Scored as 71

#note goodbye to 3 bingo tiles!
>Josh: DMOPRUZ A5 DROP +41 329
#note Preferred the MUZ leave to the DRUZ leave which is why I played DROP over MOP, and I thought I could save 1A for later.
>Jason: AEIORST 15A .OTARIES +77 283
#note noooo!
>Josh: HLMNUUZ 14F HM +32 361
#note 05 H(Y)MN and 1A MU(M)U have better face value than this. I missed them both. Given the pool it would seem HM is better because of the X-bomb threat after Jason has drawn 7 new tiles. But it could be that the leaves of the other two plays are just so much better that they're worth leaving F14 open for. I saw that this also reduced his bingo percentage.
>Jason: OOO -OOO +0 283
>Josh: ILNUUXZ 1A UN.IX +45 406
#note lol
>Jason: CEOR O4 CO.ER +39 322
#note OK I'm going to win now I think
>Josh: ALNNUYZ 11B .ANZU +36 442
#note Considered this and (WE)NNY. I didn't want to give him another bingo lane. I didn't see K6 (A)NNUAL, which beautifully sets up my Z. 
>Jason: FO 7M FO. +20 342
>Josh: ADILNOY 10B .Y +10 452
#note Emptying the bag wins if I can score a bit, I knew that. I thought I would bingo with this sometimes. I guess not. I should probably play G1 YO or something. Then I might bingo. 
>Jason: GN C10 ..NG +28 370
>Josh: AADILNO 12E ANIL +18 470
#note K6 (A)LODIA for the best endgame. This is 4 off. 
>Jason: DEEOSV H11 E. +2 372
#note But Jason couldn't find the other spot for my tiles, and probably missed K2 D(EL)E(A)VES too, cause if he did he would play (L)O I think.
>Josh: ADO 2J ADO +13 483
#note This permitted me to seize 2nd place for sure
>Josh:  (DEOSV) +18 501
