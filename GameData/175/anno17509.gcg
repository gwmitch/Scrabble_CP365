>Dave_Koenig: ABDMOST 8G MOB +14 14
#note Quackle's kibitzer suggests TOMB, and it may have a good point.  Although the T is a good bingo letter that you'd usually want to keep with AS, it has negative synergy with the D.  Also TOMB sets up my S for the double-double lane.  DOB# also looks objectively better than my play, as AMST is a stronger leave than ADST.  In MOB's defence, I was happy to set up the CSW hooks MOBE# and MOBY#, on the hope that they might not know them.

>Dave_Koenig: ACDOSTT E5 TOD +14 28
#note Couldn't get the E in open space for CODETTAS#/COSTATED#.  There are a bunch of close plays here.  I liked this particular one to set up S ending plays to 8A in hopes for a good scoring backup play if I should fail to bingo.
>Vince_&_Dan: AEHLNST J2 HANTLES +78 91
>Dave_Koenig: ACEOSTT 4H CO.STATE +78 106
#note A Collins only bingo that is definitely the best play.  It scores enough more than the other bingos COATTEST and COSTATE to be worth opening up the triple-triple lane with the E.  Don't play scared.
>Vince_&_Dan: DEEIORS 9B OSIERED +71 162
#note This is not a totally safe bingo, but it's probably the right choice to play it for one point less than EROTISED# in column N, as that is even more dangerous.
>Dave_Koenig: AIINOUV H1 VIN.A +30 136
#note This is my highest scoring play and clearly the best of the options that I knew, despite the three vowel leave.  However, I did not know the useful word INVIOUS#, which would have cleaned out this rack nicely while still scoring decently.

#note Nothing better.
>Vince_&_Dan: IX 10B XI +52 250
>Dave_Koenig: ?ENRUUZ 3M ZE. +56 202
#note This keeps it close, but with the blank and two U leave, I'm still going to be struggling to keep up, unless I get very lucky to hit a two U bingo.  Blanks are great for bingoing of course, but when you've got awkward low point tiles with them, often you're forced into fishing for few points with them.
>Vince_&_Dan: ABDEGR 11C BARGED +25 275
#note Very good play by Vince and Dan.  With their lead it is a good idea to play long, both to make it harder for me to bingo and to race to the unseen blanks and the end of the game.
>Dave_Koenig: ?LNRRUU F11 .URL +7 209
#note I would love to have UNRULIER, NURTURAL, or NEURULAR here, but it wasn't going to happen.  I do what I can to manage the rack and open the board.
>Vince_&_Dan: EINW H11 .WINE +39 314
#note Another strong play scores well and takes out the triple line that I was seemingly setting up.  I look to be in dire straits, down by 105.  But watch out!
>Dave_Koenig: ?AMNRTU C1 tANTRUM +83 292
>Vince_&_Dan: EO G2 OE +8 322
>Dave_Koenig: EFIQUWY B5 WYE +41 333
#note Suddenly they're hitting vowel trouble and miraculously I take the lead.
>Vince_&_Dan: AHI A6 AHI +32 354
>Dave_Koenig: AFFIIQU 14B QUAI. +28 361
#note This is a tough call.  The natural FAQUIR might be the best way to play, but it might just give them easy plays to A15.  With only one more I unseen, I thought that this play gave me a good chance to hit A15 first by underlapping QI.  Also, I was counting on the likelihood that they might not know SQUAIL#.
>Vince_&_Dan: P N2 P.. +18 372
#note This is where I knew I was in trouble.  The only reason they would play like this is if they had the blank and were very close to bingoing.
>Dave_Koenig: AFFIIRV 15A FIR +31 392
#note *Maybe* my best practical chance is to read the situation that they are about to bingo and play FAR I13 to make that difficult to do, reasoning that I now have both I's for the Q underlap and that I need them not to know SQUAIL# to have a chance.  In this particular situation, they would have still been able to bingo with TOWNLETS down from L4, but they would have had to find it.
>Vince_&_Dan: ?ELNOST 13H .NSOLEnT +66 438
#note They missed a much stronger bingo of ENTRESOL to the triple, but after my draw, this is a guaranteed winner.
>Dave_Koenig: AFGINPV N9 PAVI.G +26 418
#note I have no chance to win here, and I frustratingly looked for an out in two that didn't let them make a huge J play, but there was none.  There are ways to stretch out the game an extra turn that are better for spread, but at that point it wasn't worth the effort and I took my best out in two.
