>Zev: IJNX 8G JINX +36 36
#note Facebook Scrabble, Zev has just beaten me twice, the second time after finding NIO(B)ATES for an unlikely 3x3!
>Josh: AEENORS 9C ARENOSE +75 75
#note I was hoping that this would be more of a strategic game than a luck game, but let's see how things pan out.
>Zev: EFZ 8A FEZ +56 92
>Josh: GPY 10A GYP +31 106
#note I don't remember all of my racks, but this was by far the highest scoring play that I saw. I think I also had another S.
>Zev: BGU 10I BUG +13 105
>Josh: ABCST 10E TAB +25 131
#note only two I remember
>Zev: ADI K10 .ADI +12 117
>Josh: CCEIRSV B1 CRESCIV. +84 215
#note I noticed that I had blocked my own CREVIC(E)S, but I kept looking and thanks to VOID challenge found this. I don't think I knew it. Maybe I shouldn't play words I checked the validity of, who knows? This brings me to a comfortable lead, but last game's freak 3x3 was still fresh in my mind. The more options each player has, the harder it is for the more skilled player to come out victorious. 
>Zev: ??ADENT 1A A.cENTeD +140 257
#note You all knew what was coming! I'm really considering playing facebook Scrabble like tournament Scrabble, where I'll only play words I think are valid and where I will pass if I play an invalid word, but I guess that's only fair if everyone does the same.
>Josh: AFIMOOU 12K .UOMI +18 233
#note I guess DUOMO instead. I thought that OO was better for me to have than II next turn, and that he would have more trouble scoring on the triple with an I than with an O for the same reason. OO works better in words than II does, and he's equally likely to have either. I thought that factor was enough to make DUOMI better than DUOMO. Rationalizing strategically when the game was probably set to fall into Lady Luck's hands, so why complicate tiny strategical questions?
>Zev: ADIIITY 5A A.IDITY +26 283
#note good find, although it would seem N10 DI(M)ITY is a better play than this. I guess it's important to play defense and not open 3x3 lanes, which DI(M)ITY fails to do. 
>Josh: AEEEFHS 13M FE +24 257
#note What to do here? I decided to rely on luck since that seemed to be the factor at play in this game, but I missed the most luck-inducing play, 4B (S)HEA
>Zev: DENV O11 V.NED +33 316
>Josh: AEEHOSW 11D HAWSE +47 304
#note Here I must have decided that I could still win the game without too much luck. This put me within reach to maybe score more than Zev without a bingo.
>Zev: OOP 12B POO +20 336
#note Ooh, is Zev vowel heavy? Maybe I do have a chance here!
>Josh: EGILLOT 4B .TOLE +22 326
>Zev: EHLOT 13C HELOT +34 370
#note 6E THOLE scores 4 more but maybe this is the right play. Who knows? I guess Zev didn't have the case S here and he was trying to block the only hook left for mine. That's a plausible inference, right?
>Josh: EGIILNT 3F LIGNITE +63 389
#note Ooh! I get to bingo now! But wait, should I really score 40 more points than anything else reasonable for this turn? Look at what this gives back! J2 Is a killer Q spot. Oh wait, M3 is a killer S spot too! So if I pull ahead by 20 points, there's a very good chance I can hit one of the two spots... Hmmm, Quackle isn't liking my chances. What could that mean? Well, if I infer a Q on Zev's rack, the bingo is no longer the highest valued play on the simulation's list! What if I infer an S? If I infer an S, the bingo pops right back up as Quackle's favorite play! So I guess I have to "hope" that luck is right by my side, no matter what I do...
>Zev: AQU 2J QUA +67 437
#note Hey, no fair, that's more points than the bingo I just played!
>Josh: AEKLRUW 1L WAUK +55 444
#note So! Another interesting position as I know Zev didn't have IS or OIN on his previous rack (as QUAIS and QUOIN are better). This would make the I the most likely tile in the bag, followed by the N and the S, and then an O as there are two of those unseen. This makes Zev more likely to have an O than any of the other tiles. This is pretty theoretical though, as he needed combinations of tiles rather than individual tiles to make obviously superior plays. 
>Zev: MNOORRS 14B MORON +37 474
#note So obviously I didn't do ANY of the analysis I just showed when strategizing about my last turn. This is 4 off ROM 14D. 
>Josh: AEILRR 7J AIRER +15 459
#note Or ARIEL. 
>Zev: RS H11 .RS +13 487
#note So I wanted to post this game for two reasons. Number one is to rant about games where luck seems too imposing.

But the most important reason is that being on "tilt" because of perceived injustice in this game always gets in the way of making good plays that I can be happy with, no matter the results. I could have figured I was probably going to draw the I and maybe going to draw the S, but I really just thought I was going to lose no matter what. I did lose, but there's no evidence that I *HAD* to lose; just results orientation. I didn't make the right play every turn, I'm sure of it. I really could have made up the 30 points that I lost by. But those 30 points don't really equate to 30 real points anyway, so I could have lost the game regardless. It doesn't matter. Make good plays and you can feel victorious even when you lose. That is the moral of this annotated game, and if you've read up to this point, you are awesome and I love you! (Or maybe I told you to read it in which case thank you)
>Zev:  (L) +2 489
#note Thank you for tuning in! Until next time :D
