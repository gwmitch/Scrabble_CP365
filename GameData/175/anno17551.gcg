>Emanuel: ELPW H6 PLEW +18 18
>Josh: AEFGNTU G8 FAG +19 19
#note I really wanted to get rid of the U but for some reason I couldn't find GU(L)F or F(L)U. I guess this isn't that much worse.
>Emanuel: MN 9F M..N +10 28
#note what is he up to?
>Josh: BEKLNTU I8 U.BLENT +16 35
#note That would be a good question to ask before making this play. I knew he wasn't going to challenge but I thought this was good. Star play is 6D UNKE(P)T. I'm missing a lot of stuff thus far. To be fair I'm also playing another game at the same time against Lorna Katz but that doesn't really justify this play. I inferred he didn't have any points on his leave from MAWN though. Still much much worse than UNKEPT.
>Emanuel: NRTZ 12H N.RTZ +30 58
>Josh: EEEFIKV H12 .EIF +25 60
#note I3 FIVE?
>Emanuel: ?ABEEGU K6 BAGUEt.E +70 128
>Josh: EEEIKUV L2 KEEVE +28 88
>Emanuel: AY J10 YA. +32 160
>Josh: IIIOPRU 8K .ROUP +27 115
#note these leaves are tremendous. Do I play GUIRO for 6 less or do I exchange? It feels like I'm making a lot of wrong decisions this game.
>Emanuel: DINNR 3H DINN.R +16 176
>Josh: GIIIMRY H1 MI.I +24 139
#note I drew 4 consonants though! I can play through III...
>Emanuel: JOSS 11D JOSS +30 206
>Josh: GIORRTY 12B TROY +37 176
#note Now the big question is would Emanuel play that if he didn't have another S? I thought he would (he did take a while to play), so I chose this. Maybe if I had seen GYRO I might have played that instead. GYRO looks like the right play. This at least scares Emanuel if he doesn't have the S hook for it. 
>Emanuel: NOORTW N7 O.TWORN +18 224
#note no S for Emanuel so he makes a good play and races for the good stuff
>Josh: AGHIORV O13 OVA +20 196
#note G13 GHI looks good here. Some other plays too. Not sure if this is correct or not.
>Emanuel: AU 2J AU. +15 239
>Josh: DGHIQRT G4 QI +22 218
#note Still G13 GHI maybe. Not thinking GR(IT)H was a word was huge for me this game.
>Emanuel: AL 11A LA +4 243
>Josh: DDGHRST M6 TH. +24 242
#note Because 14F GR(IT)HS has to be the right play now.
>Emanuel: ACOTX A7 COXA. +42 285
#note First laid down ACT 10A, then this. He was worried it was Collins only.
>Josh: ADDGIRS 5D GAD. +12 254
#note Another turn where I had no idea what to do. This wasn't a good play.
>Emanuel: IILT 1F LI.IT +10 295
>Josh: ADDEIRS B10 D..ED +29 283
#note I took the only thing that scored... Didn't think anything else could win
>Emanuel: ?EEEIOS 6D OSE +15 310
#note 14E IOl(IT)ES
>Josh: ACHIRS 1L SHRI +38 321
#note I win the game if I see RACH(IT)IS. Wow, what a terrible game to lose. I knew this was phony. 

This game was boring on all fronts and was a comedy of errors...
