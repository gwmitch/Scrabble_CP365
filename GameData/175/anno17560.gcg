#note Game 4 of the BAT EB CSW division.
>Richard_Spence: ?EEILRR J2 RELIERs +72 72
>Winter: AKO 7F OAK +24 48
#note On the way to the tournament, we discussed PHO# and Winter told me PHOH# was also good.

Then we both assumed PHOH# was a variant spelling of the Vietnamese soup, and we were both mistaken.

>Winter: DLV 3I V.LD +12 60
#note Clearly I made the wrong choice here. I thought ROAK* was a CSW word, but apparently not. OOP# is though, and I could've played REJECTO(R). Meh#.
>Richard_Spence: CEEJORT M1 JOT +38 110
#note Opp blocks EJ(E)CTOR, but I was confused over this play.

#note I didn't like SWARED*/SIFF*, but given my lack of CSW, I decided to let it go. The game could've been potentially tied or lost if I challenged.
