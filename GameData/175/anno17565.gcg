>Cecilia: ANUU 8F UNAU +8 8
>Chris: AEEISVY G6 VI.Y +15 15
#note This *should* limit her options enough that its better than veiny, maybe? I also wanted to play a closed board against Cecilia because she seemed proficient on an open board the last time we played. Idk though. 
>Cecilia: ?AGIMTT 9I MATTInG +70 78
#note So much for defense! And that's not all...
>Chris: ABEEGKR O7 KE.GER +39 54
>Cecilia: GLLR M7 GR.LL +8 86
#note With her scoring so little, I take an opportunity to take a small lead and close the board...
>Chris: CEEHPSW 12H CHEEPS +39 93
#note Picked this over WHEEPS because of its defense and that the W is a great tile on this board after CHEEPS. CHEWS 13K is better pure equity though so idk.
>Cecilia: ACEEINS K3 CINEAS.E +70 156
#note Is this real life bro...
>Chris: EFORTWY H12 .OWY +36 129
#note Considered TOWY J4 but now I'm down and figured TOWY could mean death by strangulation for me even with a mere 20 point+tempo deficit. 
>Cecilia: ABO J5 OBA +25 181
#note The trapdoor is closing...
>Chris: EEEFMRT L4 FET +30 159
#note I guess MERT is better than MERE so FEE?
>Cecilia: DI 10J D.I. +18 199
>Chris: AADMOOR G13 MOA +25 184
#note Considered DOOM F13 but the board was gonna be closed next turn anyway; better to prepare for the scoring battle.
>Cecilia: ENO I12 .ONE +26 225
#note I drew the Q and was praying she didn't block F7 lol. 
>Chris: DEFOQR F7 Q.OD +34 218
#note Can't read the last tile but whatever
>Cecilia: ADZ E10 ADZ +29 254
>Chris: EEFIJRX 13B JEFE +42 260
#note Thought of FEZ and JEFE; didnt think of JEEZ, which I like best now. I don't like FRIEZE for 44, but FEZ or JEEZ would have stopped what happened next...
>Cecilia: BI 12C BI. +42 296
#note le sigh lol
>Chris: IIINRTX B13 .IN +20 280
#note Drew a bunch of i's hehe. I don't think i can play the X for 22 and still hope to win, so I try a prettty obv setup, but apparently she thought it was a fish, because...
>Cecilia: ARV D8 VAR +14 310
#note She blocks the bingo lane and not the setup xD
>Chris: ?IIORTX A14 XI +42 322
>Cecilia: AL I5 LA +12 322
>Chris: ?INORTT 14F T... +9 331

>Cecilia: RRRSSTT -RRRSSTT +0 322
#note change 2
>Chris: ?IINORT 3D NITROlI. +60 391
#note Yay, found one :)
>Cecilia: LP H2 L.P +8 330
#note A nice try by Cecilia. If I don't have the D, I'm in trouble here. 
>Chris: DO I1 DO. +5 396
#note Can't read my rack here. This is the only sure win i'm pretty sure. Lots of bingoey stuff in the bag.
>Cecilia: EERSST 1I .ESERTS +27 357
>Chris: AHW 4B WHA +22 418
>Cecilia: O B3 O. +5 362
>Chris: AAAANUU A5 AAAANUU +71 489
