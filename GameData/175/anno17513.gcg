>Gunther_Jacobi: BCHIINN 5G INCHIN. +26 58
#note INHIB(I)N says Q or NICHIN(G)/CHININ(G) if I'm going to play to the G for the obvious reason:
>Rafi_Stern: FL 5E FL....... +36 133
#note Already?
>Gunther_Jacobi: BEORTTX 4K BO.TE +24 82
#note Q doesn't like this much and thinks (S)OX is the play. Needed another O for (F)OXTROT.
>Rafi_Stern: AEINORT F3 RE.ATION +62 195
#note (S)ENORITA too but that will give too many pts back.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEILRTX E5 .LAX +27 109
#note Just (S)IX is quite good or even AXL(E) 33 if I'm going to leave EIRT. FLAX is also bad because it blocks a useful file.
>Rafi_Stern: DEI 9M DIE +27 222
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEIORTU H1 ROUE. +18 127
#note Apparently TAUO(N) in the same spot is almost 4pts better.
>Rafi_Stern: ACDEINS 11B INCASED +79 301
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAIKTYZ H11 .ITZY +57 184
#note ZI(N)KY needs to be found here. Only observed ZA(I)KAI in that particular spot.
>Rafi_Stern: AAEPRRS B7 PARE.RAS +74 375
#note I wasn't 100% on this hence a hold.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ??AAABK A8 KAB +51 235
#note I saw KABALAS BAKLAWA BAKLAVA but not KABAYAS KABAKAS. KAB still wins the sim by 8pts.
>Rafi_Stern: DIMNOSW 13E MID.OWNS +64 439
>Gunther_Jacobi: ??AAEMU C2 sqUAMAE +78 313
#note Got a nice and long hold here primarily because this blocked OUTVOTE, yet he also said he'd never seen it.
>Rafi_Stern: EOOTTUV O1 VOT. +21 460
#note Strange that Q suggest OUT(S)ET here. Why?
>Gunther_Jacobi: AFINRUW 14D RIF +31 344
#note Or FUN A13 which this game isn't.
>Rafi_Stern: HO N2 HO. +32 492
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADENTUW 12L ANEW +26 370
#note This is played in the wrong spot, bad. But WED C13 is very clever and best.
>Rafi_Stern: ELPQTU 13A Q.T +24 516
>Gunther_Jacobi: DTU 2A DU.T +8 378
#note Lose 6pts by not seeing DU(C)T. Too many misses in this game, although none were quite critical, bad habits are forming.
