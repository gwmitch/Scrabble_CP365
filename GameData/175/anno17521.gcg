>Ed_Cunningham: MORT H7 MORT +12 12
#note Given how the day had gone, my words as this, the final game, started: "The best part about this tournament is that it's about to be over in one more game."  Little did I know.
>Jim_Burlant: AADEGII 10E AGI.A +10 10
#note Despite the points given up to I6 AIDE and I7 IDEA,  between the better leave (DEI vs AGI), and board position (this takes away the wide open S hook on row 11) this sims just about interchangeably with those two plays.  AIDE I6 wins 43.4%; this wins 43 and sims barely 1 point down. Given his next rack, it wouldn't have mattered what I put down.
>Ed_Cunningham: ?EGOOSV G2 GrOOVES +68 80
#note And, if you're keeping track, this is the fifth time in six games my opponent has a blank bingo no later than turn 2.  This word plays at J4 and 11I for 73.
>Jim_Burlant: DEIIPTW 11I WIPED +27 37
#note Best, but it's already bleak - 23% to win and my next rack doesn't help anything.
>Ed_Cunningham: AEH 9H .HEA +24 104
>Jim_Burlant: AEINTUU M9 UN.UE +14 51
#note Without an open T, this rack is garbage.  I was about to exchange the U's when I saw this.  While AIT is admittedly a tad vowel heavy, I couldn't justify turning down 14 points when I had a decent leave and didn't have to worry about those U's coming back from the dead at a more crucial stage of the game.  The sim agrees - this is best, exchanging UU is second best.  18% to win.
>Ed_Cunningham: GOX 11C GOX +40 144
#note And now the bagging begins.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AIOQTW 9C QAT +32 83
#note This is where I really started to unravel.  I dump two U's and the second tile out of the bag is the Q?  I almost threw OWQ back into the bag out of frustration but noticed this at the last second.  Interestingly, OW 12C sims very well.  19.6% to win, and that's about to go downhill fast.
>Ed_Cunningham: IKRSY 12D RISKY +47 191
#note Ouch!!!!
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIOVW 3D OVe.WIDE +64 147
#note Plays at J2 for 74.  The smal consolation I can take:  Even the J2 placement only wins 20%.  This wins 16 and sims 14 points down.
>Ed_Cunningham: EJN 5E JE.N +22 213
>Jim_Burlant: ABELLNR 4A BALE +22 169
#note An annoying rack - it looks like it should have something, but doesn't.  I really had no clue here - Best is apparently 12L LUNA, winning 17%.  This outscores it by 8 but leaves me without any vowels.  While YELL would have prevented the next nightmare from unfolding, my next draw was so ridiculous it wouldn't have mattered what I put down here.
>Ed_Cunningham: TUZ H12 .UTZ +48 261
#note Ouch!!!!
>Jim_Burlant: LNNRRRR -NRRR +0 169
#note Enough of this BS already!!!!!!  Apparently I should exchange 6 and keep nothing but an R, but whatever.  That wins 3%; this wins 2.
>Ed_Cunningham: BMOS A4 .OMBS +33 294
#note Small consolation:  unless he has the case S, he can't hit me with any power tile bombs - he's used all of them except the Q and the second blank.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEFFNR L3 NAFF +34 203
#note I suspected the hook was phony (it is) but didn't care.  This game's been over for several turns. At least something good came out of this - my best legitimate play is 2B AFF for 24.  This wins 0.2% more often and sims 5 points higher.  Woo hoo!
>Ed_Cunningham: EEP K3 .PEE +31 325
>Jim_Burlant: AEIORRT H1 RO. +21 224
#note While ROWEN scores 33, there are only two E's left and I'm therefore treating my E as if it's an endangered species.  This is best - it wins  1.11%.  What miracle can I conjure to win this game?
>Ed_Cunningham: CEHT 2A ETCH +24 349
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIRTT F1 TA. +10 234
#note By now I'm seriously frazzled and wound up missing both ZARATITE and ARIETTA.  ARIETTA N4 wouldn't have helped me and ZARATITE would have at least made this a respectable game.  That said, even ZARATITE only wins 15%, as I'm still down 21 points, XQJZ?? are gone, and I'm probably going to be sitting on an overload of I's and have no real chance of bingoing again.  
>Ed_Cunningham: DIR J6 RID. +15 364
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIIRT 12L D.I +14 248
#note Or B4 ARIA.  Whatever.
>Ed_Cunningham: EY B6 YE +32 396
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIIRT C4 .I +2 250
#note No clue, just moving tiles to end the game.
>Ed_Cunningham: AILNRSU N3 URINALS +61 457
>Jim_Burlant: ACEILRT 14D TRAC.ILE +64 314
#note At least I get to save face.
>Jim_Burlant:  (LNNO) +8 322
