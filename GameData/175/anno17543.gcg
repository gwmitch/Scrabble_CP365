>Matt_Canik: BDILNPR 8F BLIP +16 16
#note I just played this in three seconds and didn't notice blind until after I hit my clock. SLOW DOWN!
>Mariah_Smith: AITW 9E WAIT +17 17
>Matt_Canik: DENOORU E9 .OO +12 28
#note This was an extremely frustrating turn. This seems to be the best move according to a sim...
>Mariah_Smith: MU D11 MU +12 29
>Matt_Canik: DEINRUW 13C UNWIRED +83 111
#note My next play is so much worse than this one... I need to play it!
>Mariah_Smith: EIV 11D ..VIE +10 39

>Mariah_Smith: ?AIPRSV K2 PARVISe +80 119
>Matt_Canik: AAACEET 4H ACE.ATE +20 150
#note I know that this takes a D and not an S on the back. I think that knowledge makes this a better play than A(P)ACE. 
>Mariah_Smith: ETZ H1 ZET. +39 158
>Matt_Canik: ACEEFLO L8 FOECAL +38 188
#note Whoa, this isn't a word?!?!

>Mariah_Smith: EHN 6B HEN +31 219
>Matt_Canik: ABOOORT A6 TABOO +28 296
#note Maybe I should play BOOR 4B here and hold the T for next turn?

Sim says I definitely should. 
>Mariah_Smith: HNU B10 HUN +27 246
>Matt_Canik: GNORRSX 4B NOG +25 321
#note I didn't especially know what to do on this turn. My gut said (P)RONG but I wanted to score more points than that. SOX 14H is 38, but PRONG sims ahead. Both beat this by ~6. 
>Mariah_Smith: ELRT G2 REL.T +21 267
>Matt_Canik: DILRRSX -  +0 321
#note I finally picked up my D for ACERATED! Only I don't recognize RELET as a word so I challenge. Oops!
>Mariah_Smith: DIIMO O1 IMIDO +44 311
>Matt_Canik: DILRRSX 9K D.RR +19 340
#note Another turn where none of the available options are any good. So I created one. I don't intentionally phoney often, but this tournament I think I did 6 times. 
>Mariah_Smith: AY 8N AY +17 328
>Matt_Canik: EILSSTX N1 LEX.S +45 385
#note Mariah either has the J or the Q now, so I don't have to worry about her bingoing. Phew.
