>Sheldon: OOPRT 8H TROOP +20 20
#note I thought there was a secret S hook for this, but it's SCROOP, not STROOP*.
>Josh: AEEGLSY 9K YAG +18 18
#note Wasn't entirely sure of this play but I knew it was probably close to my best bet. I missed I6 GY(R)E, which seems to be a decent option too
>Sheldon: ACD I6 CA.D +10 30
>Josh: EEELSTT L8 ..LETTE +18 36
#note RESETTLE blocked. I didn't know (PA)TTEE, that's a cool 6. I wanted to maximize the value of my S here, and I didn't think he had one. But no need to increase the chance that Sheldon will get a lot of points with a bingo. Since this was an open division tournament, I felt spread was paramount, though. But in that case I should have been phonying.
>Sheldon: DY 11J DY. +14 44
>Josh: BCEEGNS -BEG +0 36
#note I should just take the 35 points I guess. I guess I felt like the best way to win by the most points against a less-skilled player was to fish instead of score.
>Sheldon: AMO 6I .OMA +10 54
>Josh: ACEEENS K5 E. +8 44
#note 15H ENCASE. I'm playing like I used to play!
>Sheldon: ??IIRRS N7 RISkIeR +63 117
#note Sheldon took forever on this play, understandably so. He didn't knot GRIGRIS or RIBIERS or COMAE or YAGI
>Josh: ACEENSW O6 WEN +26 70
#note the failures of fishing part 3
>Sheldon: AEEILSZ 13H EQUA.E. +52 169
>Sheldon: AEEILSZ --  -52 117
>Josh: AACEFKS O12 FECK +61 131
>Sheldon: AEEQU 7F AQU. +25 142
>Josh: AALLSSZ F6 Z. +31 162
#note 15G SALALS nicely sets up ZE(E) if I draw an E, and given Sheldon's leave I know there are only 5 in the unseen pool. AALLS bingos far more than AALLSS so I guess Z(A)S.
>Sheldon: BEET L3 BET. +14 156
>Josh: AALLNSS M3 ANAL +30 192
#note Still SALAL, never saw the possibility. NASAL too.
>Sheldon: ETV N1 VET +17 173
>Josh: DEILRSS 15F SIDLERS +88 280
#note I drew a bingo after not fishing!
>Sheldon: EMO 1L MO.E +36 209
>Josh: DGIJNNV 8D JIG +32 312
#note J2 JING(O). Bad miss
>Sheldon: IIIII -IIIII +0 209
>Josh: DEHNNSV 14J HE.D +31 343
>Sheldon: FOOR 9B ROOF +22 231
>Josh: AALNNSV B7 VA.NA +10 353
#note No point blocking, he likely didn't have the P.
>Sheldon: BNRTU A11 BRUNT +28 259
>Josh: LNOPSUX 2N .X +18 371
#note Thought this might bingo sometimes, it doesn't. Better to just play something else
>Sheldon: AHN 14D NAH +27 286
>Sheldon: AHN --  -27 259
#note He tried to slip this through!
>Josh: LNOOPSU B13 POO +20 391
>Sheldon: AHNW H12 WAN. +12 271
#note aww
>Josh: EEILNSU D8 ..ULE +24 415
>Sheldon: GHIIIIU 8A H. +15 286
#note -11 to my next move
>Josh: EINS 13L .I.. +14 429
>Sheldon: GIIIIU 11D .UG +8 294
#note -1 to 13H (A)I
>Josh: ENS F6 ...S +22 451
#note I12 EN first if I think he's going to block my best out which he won't
>Sheldon: IIII J10 I. +5 299

>Josh:  (III) +6 468
