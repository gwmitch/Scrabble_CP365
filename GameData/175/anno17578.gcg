#note I didn't think of HATBOX here, which scores the same but keeps the stronger GR leave.  It does give them very easy scores off the X to A15 though.  On reflection, I think my play is probably a little bit better, but I should have thought of the alternative.

#note GAW 8A seems like the natural play, but I was trying to keep the left side of the board open for vertical bingos.  Turns out it would have made their next play even more damaging.

#note I had to do something creative.  I considered TORMENTAS*, which I knew was phony, but I didn't think they would let it fly.  (TORMENTA# is a plural of TORMENTUM)

#note With only seconds left, Bob and Sammy made this poor play, which assured that I could get two more turns to keep scoring.  There was no legitimate way I could score enough to get close, so I had to do something creative.

#note In their rush, they made the phony LON*, and I didn't notice it until after I made my play.
>Dave_Koenig: EHI M3 E.I.H +38 407
#note ERICH* is a phony but a plausible one, as ERIC#, ERICK#, and ERIACH# are all acceptable.  They did not question it, and it stayed on the board.
>Dave_Koenig:  (TT) +4 411
#note If I had challenged LON* off the board and then played ERICH*, the game would have ended in a 415-415 tie.  This would have put Bob and Sammy in the difficult position of deciding whether to forgo challenging and accept the tie, or to challenge, possibly either winning or losing the game depending on the validity of ERICH*.  Considering that they had only a few seconds on the clock, they would have had to make that decision right away.

Unfortunately, I didn't notice LON* in time, which we all knew was phony and was just an oversight on their part.  But it goes to show you that sometimes there is hope even in seemingly hopeless situations.
