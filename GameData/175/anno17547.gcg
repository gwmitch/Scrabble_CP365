#note TANUKI and hope she doesn't play the S? TIKI? INIA? HAIKU? Or just exchange?

An S will be enormous on this board. It would be super awesome if I can get one. 

Sim lies TIKI by a lot.

#note Thought process: 
I KNOW that she has DILW on her rack- that leaves DJS? as potential candidates for the one unseen tile.

Initially I wanted to fish an R- if I pull an S or blank I have BANISHER or THERIANS and I win. If I pull D or J I lose. 

Then I spotted CHAR- with a D/S/? I have S(E)REIN or N(E)REID. The only way I lose is if the J is the last tile in the bag. But for that to be true, she would have missed (T)WIDDLeS. So I think it's less than likely that the J is in the bag and I'm quite optimistic about my chances!

(Q: play IHN(E)RE and you win in all cases except J too but you make the endgame much harder for Leslie is the J is unseen)
