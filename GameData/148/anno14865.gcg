#note Yeah I saw FATLIKE. For only 2 points, I decided to take the word I was 10000% sure of. Mistake, obviously.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACLLNSU 5K .ULL +7 91
#note I wasn't sure what to do with this turn. I decided to try for a setup and maybe block an X while I'm at it. Still have no idea. Adam liked the boring L3 CLAN. That sims a couple points ahead of this. A dozen plays sim within a few points of each other here.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AACNOSU 3L CO.A +26 117
#note I thought AAL was worse for giving back parallels, but M2 AA is basically the same points without giving anything back. Blugh, why didn't I consider that one?
