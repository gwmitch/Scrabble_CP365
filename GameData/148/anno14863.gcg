#note First problem, the pairings. In the first round Rick changed the pairings to play me in the first round, because he hadn't heard from me (even though I ALWAYS show up), and I had to play him with 14:xx minutes. Now I have to play Kenji with 16:xx minutes, in part because my last game before lunch went long, AND she wanted a recount.

#note One of two good moments in this game.

#note Not getting the easy racks I need to play Kenji with a low clock, that's what I was thinking, not quite yet in control of my emotions, not yet feeling Zen.

#note Took way too long to find this, but let's make that three good moments.

#note Around this point, in light of Kenji's scoring, I started to feel what the universe was telling me, that this game was not mine to win.

#note No idea what to do, so I opt to keep the E.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CZ B4 C.Z +34 244
#note At this point, I have gained control over my negative emotion, and I barely feel a tingle of negativity.

#note My previous play had blocked my bingo, but I accepted this as God's plan.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?ADELNW J4 WANgLED +72 316
#note I am at peace. This is expected, and all is well with the universe. Everything is at it is, and as it always was.

#note This is fine. Egypt's president was just deposed by the military, and Edward Snowden is still being persecuted by the U.S. government. In light of that, this bingo is unimportant.

#note The Sage Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is the largest grouse in North America, where it is known as the Greater Sage-Grouse. Its range is sagebrush country in the western United States and southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. A population of smaller birds, known in the U.S. as Gunnison Sage-Grouse, were recently recognized as a separate species.

#note Though I will lose, it is important to feel the joy of this moment.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEY K4 YEA +28 483
#note It is also important to rejoice in the fact that I am even able to play Kenji, one of the best players in the world, easily capable of finding plays like this, before his retirement.
>Winter: AEEIUWY 14N WE +22 335
#note At this point I take a moment to look for my scorecard, so I can see who my next opponent is, and determine whether she is waiting for me. If so, I should not spend a lot of time on this play, but rather hurry up and finish, out of consideration for her.

It is important to keep Scrabble, or any other activity, in perspective with one's ethical duties to the rest of society.

Winning at Scrabble is not possible without ethics.

#note I suppose I lost focus a bit, thing about sage grouses, and world politics, and why the women on this planet evolved to be so selfish, and I forgot about JANE (fixated on JADE).
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ADEJN O1 JANE +49 561
>Winter: AIUY C9 AY +17 368
#note Life is too short to spend the next five minutes looking for the best play, not when there is so much going on in the world.
