>Winter: ABOPTUV 8G PUB +14 14
#note First and foremost, make the best play, an if it happens to set your opponent up to play the phony (PUB)E, so much the better.
>Mark_Pistolese: AIQ H7 Q.AI +13 13
#note Looking good.
>Winter: ACMOTUV 10E VOM.CA +17 31
#note Yesterday I miss VOMITOUS, and today I find VOMICA. Exactly what I need, reminders that my body has become a disgusting, vomit-inducing, pus-filled disaster zone that women would naturally steer away from.
>Mark_Pistolese: ADL 11F DAL +25 38
>Winter: AOPSSTU K5 OUTPASS +100 131
#note It does now, but this is pretty much the zenith of this game, as you will soon see.
>Mark_Pistolese: FGLO L2 GOLF +21 59
#note When Mark gives me the G...
>Winter: ?DHILNN 2E HaNDLIN. +64 195
#note I start thinking that I might just have him, and that was my mistake.
>Mark_Pistolese: ACOX 3C COAX +39 98
#note It begins.
>Winter: EEIIIMU -EIIIMU +0 195
#note Interesting. I never even looked for EMEU, and I would have been loath to keep three Is anyway.
>Mark_Pistolese: AEERRST 12B TEARERS +91 189
#note As I marveled at Mark's play, I was reminded of the tears that ran down Michelle's face, when we broke up after my overreaction to her casual revelation that she had herpes. Turned out she didn't actually have THE herpes, the genital kind, HSV-2, but rather HSV-1, which most of us have...
>Winter: DEEGRYY 4D DYE +38 233
#note DYE, or rather its homonym, DIE, is appropriate.
>Mark_Pistolese: AEKTW 13C TWEAK +65 254
#note Yep. EDGY. That's exactly how I was starting to feel, until I regained my composure and realized that whatever happens is meant to be.
>Winter: BEEEGRY H1 E.GY +39 272
#note EDGY is how old Winter would have felt, as his lead dwindled like the sands of time, like the possibilities for love. But new Winter, no longer jacked up on the meth, feels at ease, understanding that what happens, happens for a reason. If winning tiles manifest themselves on my opponents' rack, it is a sign that I still have much to atone for.

Also, that "Breaking Bad" resumes on August 11.
>Mark_Pistolese: EORV 8K .ROVE +33 287
#note Another sign, that I must prove myself worthy of the win.
>Winter: BEEEIIR I8 .I.E +17 289
#note I don't know what BICE means. Let's find out...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bice

Ah, I see. BICE is a bluish hue, and thus, by placing the word on the board, I help cleanse myself of blue emotion within my own physical.

One must learn to channel all negative emotion from her own physical and out onto a totem--in this case, the Scrabble board.
>Mark_Pistolese: EINSZ 1A ZINES +55 342
#note ZINES, another word for comic books, a reminder of when I used to work at the comic book store and fudge the prices of the zines I was taking in credit. Technically, I did ask the boss' right-hand man, once, if I could take some specific issues, of which they had scads, at the cover price, instead of the prices listed in the guide, but then I started just doing it for any issues I wanted from the back.

It took over twenty years, but I guess I am finally being held to account for that.
>Winter: ABEEFIR M3 RIFE +29 318
#note Yep, RIFE, with symbolism, this game is.
>Mark_Pistolese: DHILNOR O2 INHOLD.R +66 408
#note Ah, INHOLDER, perhaps my greatest transgression. Samantha Inholder, a dormmate at the University of Texas. She still had one more year to go, after my graduation, and some time in 1996, I think, I went back to visit her. We went out, then back to her dorm room, where we played strip poker and got blitzed and naked. She resisted, but I was fixated on my goal, and eventually I got my way.

Repercussions were inevitable, and so Mark races out of my reach.
>Winter: ABEEMNR N8 .ERBENA +30 348
#note And now we come to my second greatest transgression, or perhaps my first, when you consider how many young women I drugged. VERBENA is an abortifacient, and I, being of the belief that using condoms are an affront to God, instead preferred to make sure that my dates and I shared a drink after the foul act (that would be the sex), and that the drink was properly laced with VERBENA extract.

However foul you consider my actions, you have to admit that they work. To the best of my knowledge, only one of my conquests ened up pregnant enough to have to go to Planned Parenthood.
>Mark_Pistolese: ?GIJOT 13I JOTtI.G +44 452
#note It DOES feel good to jot down my trangressions every now and again, as way to unburden my soul and find the inner peace that allows me to deflect any pain that would otherwise arise from vicious assaults like this one.

Coincidentally, just the other night I saw "This Is the End", in which one of the characters is assaulted by a Rape Demon.
>Winter: MOTTUUW J6 MU +22 370
#note Momentarily overwhelmed by the weight of a lifetime of transgression, I lose my focus and give up equity.
>Mark_Pistolese: AEIIN J13 .E +4 456
>Winter: OTTUW I13 .OW +15 385
>Mark_Pistolese: AIIN 5A INIA +8 464
#note So there it it, a lesson in karma, delivered via Scrabble tiles.
>Mark_Pistolese:  (TTU) +6 470
