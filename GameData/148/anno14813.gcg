#note He clearly has a bingo rack.  How do we proceed?  Outside chance he doesn't know ALANG.  Keeping a vowel seems important here.  Other consideration was GLEN I5, keeping PRN.

>E_Tran: EEINNOR 4K ONE +11 41
#note This blows the board wide open for him to bingo.  I'm just giving up on bingo defense, and hoping to counter.  Too hasty?  TENON was my other thought.  ENO(W) is slightly better for defense, but keeping the same leave.
>Albert_H: ?DGIRTT 3G GRITTeD +85 113
#note The R should be the blank here, not the E.  I still find his rack strange: what did he keep last turn, and then turn before that makes sense?  If I knew he was keeping suboptimal leaves, I should be playing more defensive here, instead of giving up on bingo defense
>E_Tran: AEIIJNR H1 JA. +30 71
>Albert_H: AHY F6 HAY +23 136
#note So he did know ALANG al along
>E_Tran: EIINORR 8A ORNER. +30 101
#note And the destruction of my rack is completely.  2ply likes this.  It opens the board for future bingoes.
>Albert_H: EEIQTU B8 .EQUITE +72 208
>E_Tran: DGIIRVX 15A GRID +41 142
#note XI first, or GRID first?  2ply says XI wins more, but GRID values more.  Makes sense; Need to get lucky; might even draw a bingo with GDIRV.
>Albert_H: EFW 12A W.FE +28 236
>E_Tran: HIRRVXY E10 IVY +32 174
#note Hate that this kills both lines he just opened up for me.  But the next best plays are about 15pts behind.
>Albert_H: AU 10B .UA. +13 249
>E_Tran: BDEHRRX -BRDHX +0 174
#note Sim likes BRED(E) a lot.  I just didn't see a good long-term plan with BREDE.  Where will my X go next turn?  Felt I needed to bingo sooner.  I ditch the D because I need an S.

>E_Tran: EIIOOUV -IIOOUV +0 265
#note Exchanging this junk into the bag seems better than VOI(C)E.  2ply says to ditch the E also.  
>Albert_H: ACERS O7 CARSE +31 387
>E_Tran: ?BEKNRU J10 ..URB +20 285
#note Do I have a crazy outside shot at winning, or should I give up and go for spread?   The pool is also gross, so playing short is also advantageous
