#note John liked BEVEL a bit better, and I agree with him.

#note Oops, I let John get away with a phony here.  FENKS# does not lose its S.

#note I had a tough time choosing between plays here.  WEB 2M looks best from a pure points and leave perspective, but it might give back big plays on row 1.  AREW# 4L looks like a good choice too.  My play is also not bad.

#note HOD in the same spot scores a bit more, but I didn't like the ILNR leave quite as much as DILR.

#note I thought TIDDLIER# was good, but I was just a bit too unsure to pull the trigger.

>Dave_Koenig: ?ADIIRU B9 mUDIRIA +69 288
#note The safer way to bingo was DAQUIRI# at B8, an alternate spelling of DAIQUIRI.

#note Not sure what to do here.  There's a case to be made for trading, but I didn't mind leaving three vowels, because with the remaining tile pool, my rack is very likely to even out on the next turn.  There's a good chance that he will be suffering a vowel shortage, so putting them back in the bag could actually be helping him out.

#note John made me wish that I had played OIDIA instead.
