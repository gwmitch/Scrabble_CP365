#note Better plays here, but this results in the best leave.
>Ryan_Fischer: BLRT 6B BL.RT +15 107

#note This is second best, move it one over for an extra point.
>Ryan_Fischer: LOW -  +0 107

>Siddharth_Murali: EFU H12 F.UE +33 264
#note Stopped writing racks now because it was getting read off of my scoresheet.

>Ryan_Fischer: EFGIU E2 FIGU.E +24 158
>Siddharth_Murali: ACDIT B10 DAC.IT +26 333
#note D1 DITA scores more, but it obviously depends on the other two letters.

>Ryan_Fischer: EHY 1F HEY +46 310
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EINOST 10I STONIEr +68 425
#note Didn't even think of looking for an EX-word, which would have been better. Or FISTNOTE. This is next.

#note Did I 'bag' my opponent? Maybe, maybe not. Blanks were even but QZXJ isn't really a thing of beauty. Maybe it was just coincidental.
