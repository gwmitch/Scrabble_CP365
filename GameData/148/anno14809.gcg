>cesar: ?GIMNTT 8D MaTTING +74 74
#note CDS: i wanted to open with MITTING but evans didn't get it.
#note EC: cesar teach me to get jokes :-(
>evans: EIIOPRW D7 I.POWER +28 28
>cesar: ADFIIKV 13B VI.ID +18 92
#note CDS: VIFDA# looks best here, but we're not in the Orkney and Shetland islands, we're in Murica.
>evans: CIISTVY B10 CIV.Y +44 72
>cesar: AEFJKLR C3 FREAK +45 137
>evans: CEILRST K2 RELICTS +78 150
#note CDS: to lict again
#note EC: i licted your mom
>cesar: AEFJLOU 4H JOU.E +40 177
#note CDS: i prefer this despite the 8 extra points of JARFUL.
>evans: DEOOTTY B5 OY +28 178
>cesar: AEFIILR A5 FRAIL +36 213
#note CDS: prefer this to 2J FRAIL despite the worse leave because of points and it kills a powerful spot; still, maybe it's worth keeping the better leave if he's going to bingo next turn.
>evans: ?DEOPTT M4 sPOTTED +73 251
#note EC: This one sims best. TETRAPOD offers crazy counterplays.
>cesar: AAEILSW N6 WAIL +34 247
#note CDS: AWA sims much better. it's a significantly better leave, and it gives up about as many points as WAIL does. (-9)
>evans: BHILNNU O6 NUN +27 278
#note CDS: that coulda been worse i guess.
#note EC: Yeah, I spent a while looking for something bigger here, but there was nothing. NUN sims best. I gotta kill this spot.
>cesar: AAAEEGS D1 AGEE +21 268
#note CDS: i'm surprised i played that; i'm usually more of a chicken. saw 2J AREAE and like it even less, mostly because i need more points, but it sims better. (-1.5)
>evans: BEHILNO 1A OBE.H +30 308
>cesar: AAQRSUU 10J QUA.S +47 315
#note CDS: playing the S is 13 more points and there's two more Ss out, I know I still need to get lucky to win this game.
>evans: AILMNOS 11I LIMA +33 341
#note EC: It's either this or (OBEAH)ISM, which is a lot of points. OBEAHISM sims about 2 better. I didn't realize at the time that this was the case I, making it much less important to block the QI spot.
>cesar: ABEHNRU 12L HABU +32 347
#note CDS: nothing's even close here; will i get lucky?
>evans: DENORSS N12 .OS +10 351
#note EC: Ladies and gentlemen, I present my ugliest blown game of the year. Just straight-up whiffed on a natural SONDERS for a sure win. Shoot me. Shoot me in the face.
>cesar: AAEGNRZ H1 GAN.A +39 386
#note CDS: i think i just have to hope he misses. a many ply sim inferencing the S tells me F10 ZANDER, maybe so I can hope to bingo back. 2J GRAZER also looks good. if he bingos i'm likely screwed unless i can bingo back, so quackle doesn't like keeping the Z here. GANJA is about ~16.5% back on ZANDER by win% (41.8 vs 58.3) but I actually don't really understand why it's so much of a difference when looking at the details. I think it needs me to increase entropy/variance next turn.
>evans: DENNORS E13 .N +2 353
#note EC: Fishing for an E here, but I don't deserve an E because I suck.
#note CDS: i got lucky
#note EC: Yeah, you got lucky to be paired with an opponent who sucks.
>cesar: EEERTXZ 14I EXERT. +29 415
#note CDS: this and NEXT win 100%
>evans: DDENORS 15E NERDS +23 376
#note EC: I missed every play ever.
