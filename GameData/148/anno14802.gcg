>Jesse: ADEIJQR 8D JERID +42 42
>Nigel: ABILNVY E8 .NVIABLY +82 82
>Jesse: AILNOQU 15E .ANQUI +54 96
#note I was all set to throw down JONQUIL, but this is pretty good.
>Nigel: AAGLOOS K11 GAOLS +31 113
>Jesse: AILOOOW L11 OLIO +19 115
#note I thought this would have to be best, but keeping AOW doesn't really improve my scoring prospects for next turn with no scoring spots for the W available. if I play ALOW for 8 more I bingo almost as much next turn and only score 4 per turn less.
>Nigel: AHNOOTU H1 AUNTHOO. +89 202
>Jesse: ADEENOW J9 OWED +24 139
#note trying to leave the board open. quackle thinks my move is ok but keeping the D does improve my bingo percentage by at least 10%.
>Nigel: ?GIKRST 5E TuG.RIKS +110 312
#note ouch
>Jesse: AAEEENT 10C EA.E +9 148
#note the standings going into this game: me 21 +1330 kenji 21 +1207 nigel 20 +1073 jim 20 +1007 bowman 20 +736. I assumed before this game that I needed to win one out of two to win nationals with my spread position but I wasn't anticipating getting blown out. I could've started cutting spread but I guess if I want to stay ahead of nigel in the standings (and putatively in position to win the tournament) the magic number is 129...so going for a bingo and trying to cut the big lead seems right.
>Nigel: ADEGNRU 2C UNARG.ED +66 378
#note alright, time to start desperately cutting spread
>Jesse: AADENOT 8J DONATE +34 182
#note more of the same. I went for the hyper-volatile option trying to get back into contention for the final, but I would rather play DONATE at B10 in retrospect as a slightly more spread-cutting option. really, I hadn't anticipated being down by 200+ points so I was playing as if a comeback was possible
>Nigel: EINRSXY 1A NIXE +48 426
#note I'm sure nigel passed up sexily
>Jesse: ABEPPTV 7M BAP +23 205
#note this is more or less the point where I was like, good lord, I have to stop the bleeding! however, there are not a lot of vowels left. doesn't matter much anyway.
>Nigel: EHILRSY 14B HIL.Y +51 477
#note well, I blocked slithery.
>Jesse: EEPTVWZ 14J P..TZ +54 259
>Nigel: ?EFFRST B4 STuFFER +74 551
#note he told me that he passed up restaffs to take out the more threatening lane.
>Jesse: EEORSVW A8 OW +35 294
#note aand I don't know. I was all set to play OVERSEW and he blocked it. just missed this.
>Nigel: ACEEIMT A11 AMICE +50 601
>Jesse: EERRSUV L1 VEER. +24 318
#note in time trouble, didn't see that I had given him emetic.
>Nigel: CEIMT 3J EM.TIC +23 624
>Nigel:  (RSU) +6 630
#note final score 630-308 including a time penalty for me
