#note World Scrabble Championship Qualifying Tournament, Princeton NJ. June 15, 2013. Round 1 (CSW12). 
>Alyssa_Faria: LOO 9E LOO +12 12
>Lucas_Freeman: ELLNPTT 10C NETT +14 40
#note Not sure why I thought this was better than LEPT or PELLET, or PELT at 10C. It's clearly not.
>Alyssa_Faria: EEINRTU 7H RETINUE +61 73

>Alyssa_Faria: DESZ O5 ZEDS +51 124
>Lucas_Freeman: ?HILOPT 6B HOPLITe +73 137
#note Missed SHOPLIFT. 
>Alyssa_Faria: ADHR N6 H.ARD +36 160
>Lucas_Freeman: EEJLQSU 11E SEQUEL +42 179
#note Tough decision between SEQUEL and QUEP for me. I decided that opening the A-hook was worth 12 extra points because an opponent might not spot it whereas I know 100% that it's there. She had an S though. QUEP would have held more value to me if I was certain of HEARDS, which I wasn't.

>Alyssa_Faria: AFI 15L .AIF +33 229
>Lucas_Freeman: ABEIJUW L2 JUBA +31 244
#note JUBA versus JUBE J2. Three E's unseen versus six A's led me to sacrifice the three points here.
>Alyssa_Faria: DIN 12F DIN +25 254
>Lucas_Freeman: AAEIRRW M1 WARE +31 275
#note AWhiffed on AREW in this same spot, scoring 9 more points.
>Alyssa_Faria: EOR N1 ORE +34 288
>Lucas_Freeman: AIORRTY 7C YA +26 301
#note Trying to score well and take out the best scoring option on the board. UNARY H11 seems like the obvious choice, but Alyssa's string of short plays and a blank unseen made me wary of opening.
>Alyssa_Faria: ADI 14L .ADI +27 315
>Lucas_Freeman: GIMORRT 1M ..G +21 322
#note GRIM 13J is far superior. I couldn't pull the trigger on MAA and I just dumped the G for points because I wanted some of Alyssa's time to think about TRIM/MAA next turn. Didn't work out that way.
>Alyssa_Faria: BN 13K N.B +23 338
>Lucas_Freeman: IMORRTV E3 VRI. +14 336
>Lucas_Freeman: ACEMORT (challenge) +5 341
#note Earned the nickel. I'm close to one minute on time now because of SEQUEL.
>Alyssa_Faria: AUW 4B WAU. +14 352
>Lucas_Freeman: ACEMORT 3C MO.ER +32 373
#note Ruined my chances by tacking on the extra R. Saw the OOSY possibility one second too late. 
>Alyssa_Faria: NOSY H1 NOSY +44 396
>Lucas_Freeman: AACEITX C10 .IXE +22 395
#note Eleven seconds left, INEXACT still loses here. AXE F1 ties by blocking all outs while GOO 9A is met with TUNICA H10. Other replies lose to ENATIC C9.
