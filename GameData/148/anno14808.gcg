>Evans: BIORRST 8H ORB +10 10
#note EC: Obviously my first instinct was to pass and hope for the U.
>Rafi: AAENNSW J4 NAWA. +18 18
#note RS: Aw crap. Missed WANNABES.
>Evans: BIPRSTT I7 B.ITT +18 28
#note EC: A lot of options sim close here. One possibility is just TAB, which leaves bingo possibilities nice and open.
>Rafi: ELNOSUV 11E VOLU.ES +40 58
>Evans: EHMPRST K5 HEMS +46 74
#note EC: Sim says just HEM is a bit better, which I totally disagree with. Why is the S worth 8 points when I have too many consonants and the board isn't that open?
>Rafi: CHIINOY 10I .YIN +30 88
#note RS: THIONIC is pretty good, and THIO sims better too.
>Evans: NNOPPRT I2 PROP +19 93
#note EC: Sim likes PRONTO F6 a bit better. It's a pretty play defensively.
>Rafi: ?CDHIOO H1 HOOD +42 130
#note RS: I actually saw the bingo, but HOOD is a better play. Unfortunate that I wasn't able to play such a cool word.
#note EC: Whoa, that is a cool bingo indeed! Nice find, dude.
>Evans: AGINNST M4 STANING +69 162
>Rafi: ?ACGIIL F7 dIAL.GIC +68 198
#note RS: Seems like there should be more, but this is the only bingo.
>Evans: ENRTTW? H11 .NWET +27 189
#note EC: Ugh, WRITTEN does play after all, since EVOLUTES is good. I wasn't sure which one of EVOLUTE or REVOLUTE took the S. This becomes even more relevant later...
>Rafi: AAAEEER D9 AREAE +21 219
#note EC: I held for-EVER on this. I told myself all along this was the phony one... but then couldn't pull the trigger on challenging. Fortunate, since this one's good.
>Evans: GJOQRT? -GJOQ +0 189
>Rafi: ADEEELL 13H .ALLED +22 241
#note RS: This was a little bizarre on my part, not noticing the far superior WELLED. DELE/ES is also a good option.
>Evans: ?AMNORT C9 fORMANT +89 278
#note RS: Very nice overlap by Evans, and a gutsy play as well. I held on REVOLUTES* for a while, but couldn't remember whether it took the S or not. This would have been a big turning point as I could have blocked the bingo lane - I should have realized how big of a swing my decision was before releasing the hold.
#note EC: Wow, lucky to get away with this. Thought at the time this was the good one. TRANSOM C3 for 79 is probably the best valid play... looks better defensively than TONEARM.
>Rafi: DEEEIKQ 15A KI.ED +33 274
#note RS: With 3 U's unseen, KITED is better than QI.
>Evans: DEGORUX N6 XU +52 330
>Rafi: EEEQRUZ L2 ZEE +28 302
>Evans: CDEFGOR O2 FORGE +20 350
#note EC: This looks kinda weird in retrospect, but I liked shutting down this area.
>Rafi: EIOQRUU 2N E. +10 312
#note RS: Didn't notice QUID, which gives me a fighting chance - the E hook is very difficult to block without having the only other E, and according to Zyzzyva I can also draw TOREUTIC or TUTOYERS down below. My play gives me a 1/12 shot at TURQUOIS, although it might be better to distract with ED or NE to make it look like I'm setting something up.
>Evans: CDEFSTY O2 .....TS +36 386
#note EC: Meh. I like points.
>Rafi: IIOQRUU 7C QUO. +22 334
#note RS: Thought this was better than QUID because of the E hook. Blahhh.
>Evans: CDEFJVY L12 J.FE +30 416
>Rafi: AIIIRU 15H .UI +3 337
>Evans: CDVY 2G C..Y +19 435
>Rafi: AIIR 14B A. +8 345
#note RS: Low on time - missed the V block.
>Evans: DV 9C ..V. +6 441
