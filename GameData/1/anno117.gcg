#note Annoying to fish and pick the Q, but I should have persevered: QI J5 sims several points better.

#note "New word blindness" strikes again. ZEP 4J is hugely better (maybe even hugeously so). Note, Stu apparently underscored his last play by 2 points.

#note This was rather weak. It's a tough position, but OF is probably best in this spot.

>SG: ILPRSSV --  -20 354
#note This was a big break. If not for this misstep, I was likely toast. And while I wouldn't be completely out of it, 3 losses at this stage would be really tough to recover from.
