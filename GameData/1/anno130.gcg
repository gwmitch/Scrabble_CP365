#note This was probably a poor play. The simple PICA A1 seems like a better way to block the triple line, as BRUCIN allows easy 50-point Q plays. On the other hand, opponent's last play suggests he probably didn't have the Q, so maybe setting up a hotspot to counterbalance the column O threat was a reasonable idea. Also, the extra tile turnover gives me 2 more chances to draw the blank, but that's probably too much to hope for.

#note Interesting endgame: the best sequence for Michael (which he did spot in the post-mortem) is to play AVe 7M! But this would still not be quite enough to win.
