#note I hadn't managed to sleep at lunch, but at least I was less agitated.
>Robert_Kahn: ?ADGHNO E8 HANGDOg +77 95
#note HAGDONS at 10B would've been 7 more.
>JD: DEEHNRT H3 ENTHR..ED +64 84
#note ok ok I can do this
>Robert_Kahn: AEIITV 5C VITIA.E +20 115
>JD: ?AEORSW 15A OvERSAW +92 176
#note best, but REENTHRONED is sick!
>Robert_Kahn: PP D4 P.P +14 129
>JD: AEGILRV 8A LAIG. +33 209
#note LAIGH looks pretty good...unless I was more up on my 11s and knew about REENTHRONED, that is. LAIGH sims even with REENTHRONED actually, but I suspect this is because quackle expects me to play REENTHRONED next turn.
>Robert_Kahn: OY D12 OY +21 150
>JD: EIRUVXY I1 VEX +38 247
#note I was rather hesitant about VEX here given his fishing, but the V didn't seem that easy to hit. that said I had a clearly superior, tricky move - IVY at C10 creates a spot for EAUX next turn which he is very unlikely to block. what a tricky find!
>Robert_Kahn: DIN J5 DIN +18 168
>JD: DIORTUY A6 DI.UTORY +63 310
#note given that I have DYVOUR, this is a tough play to make, but I didn't want to chicken out. Problem is, this is actually no good!!! I always make phonies that end in Y.
>Robert_Kahn: AINORST K7 AROINTS +66 234
>JD: AEEFNOU 1G FO.EAE +39 349
>Robert_Kahn: AQU J10 QUA +67 301
>JD: AFLMNOU F2 FOL.UM +21 370
#note this takes out the last real lane on the board.
>Robert_Kahn: BGI C7 B.G +11 312
>JD: AEJNSTZ 2L TAJ +22 392
#note RAZES or RAJES don't seem like options. TAJ creates unnecessary new lanes, so maybe JAW is the play. but I like turning over an extra tile.
>Robert_Kahn: MU M2 .MU +10 322
>JD: CENSTWZ 12I W..S +14 406
#note I was absolutely baffled on this play. I wanted to block the sneaky lane on row 13 (QUAI/IS - something). ultimately it seems not to matter much.
>Robert_Kahn: E G1 .E +10 332
>JD: CCENRTZ 3H ..EC +13 419
#note CODEC to dump both the Cs is quite nice. really it doesn't matter a ton.
>Robert_Kahn: AEIILRS E5 .I +7 339
#note as long as he holds onto his A I can't play NERTZ.
>JD: CENRTZ 12C C.. +6 425
#note it seemed worth trying to set up nertz.c
>Robert_Kahn: AEILRS 10A .I +4 343
#note he should just go out.
>JD: ENRTZ N4 NERTZ +18 443
