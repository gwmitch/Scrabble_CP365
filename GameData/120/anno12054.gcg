#note quackle likes OIDIA at 7H. sorry quackle, there's no way in hell I'm doing that. I guess I could see TIARA be a little better, but I might as well interfere with his apparent G setup a bit.

#note I'm not surprised that HOVE at 12L wins a sim, but I'm not playing that here. the only extenuating circumstance is that FEH may have been a setup play for the J, since he had FEH for more points at the bottom-right. but it's still too risky.

#note an embarassment of riches, but this is the best-scoring bingo available

>JD: BEMNQRW J10 W.B +25 352
#note I guess with a nice pool unseen I could try to play WEBER or something to block, but it doesn't seem worthwhile. BREW at 4L wins the sim by a lot - there are very few scoring tiles left, and that W is going to be hard for him to bingo through. I was probably a little too cowardly on this play.

#note again quackle suggests tampering with the lanes on the right, but this seemed like the best chance I would get to dump the Q.

#note wrier sims a bit better because it more effectively blocks his setup for the T.
