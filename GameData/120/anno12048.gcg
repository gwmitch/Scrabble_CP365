#note A good example of why Quackling is pretty frustrating to me. I'm down early, so there doesn't seem to be any good reason to shut down any part of the board with the V here. Maybe I'm supposed to play it at L7 and hope I can pick up an S first? It just seems so natural to play the "friendlier" letters here, hence WEDDED.

#note I considered lots of plays here, spent probably about 10 minutes, and eventually had to give up. The plays I considered were: W(E), W(E)T, WOT, TOT(E). I got really paranoid about WOT, because he really only had one unlikely bingo lane to work with, and I didn't want to give him a new one - that's too paranoid, right? Didn't consider OW in the bottom right. What looks good here?

#note Gotta block the 3x3, and I will win no matter what with this play, saving VEX for next turn. That said, VER(T)EX maximizes spread. I was low on time, so I went with this play.
