#note Wasn't sure if I could outrun a Q stick with JE(E)P, so I opted to force a block, with some helpful tiles still unseen to me. It seemed like he'd have to sacrifice a lot to block this play, and perhaps I could outrun him if he blocked it. Quackle says I am in great shape to outrun with a J play in the bottom right. (R)IPE doesn't show up in the sim, but it looks like I win with most all draws, except for EI and EE, which seem like pretty unlikely draws, given his previous plays. I ran out of time, so decided to go with RIPE.
