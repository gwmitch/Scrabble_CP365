#note I didn't think this play was so bad, since it enabled me to decide what letters I'd have to bingo with in the top left, since going in front of ER isn't too easy, unless she has FH. Perhaps I overthought this, but I was just trying to make her think alot, and I just never hit anything this game.

#note Another awful pickup here. Sometimes you just don't draw the right tiles. M(I)XT seemed useless, so at least this gave me a good shot at a big X play, with a decent leave if I hit it, and forced her to deal with the I, or keep fishing herself.

#note Quackle thinks G(ED) will win if a certain tile is in the bag. I assume it's the A going for QUASSIA, but she will be able to block it no matter what.
