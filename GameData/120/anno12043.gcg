#note AARGH, if I'd seen it (I did after I hit my clock). Interestingly, AGORA sims at the top, too.

>jesse: AEGORRZ 6J Z.EA +43 59
#note I didn't see ORZO here which is way better than my play. ORZO would've saved me a lot of trouble.

#note I've played conrad a lot and given his early lead I know exactly what will happen if I don't create some lanes for myself...quackle wants me blocking the S but to me that seems to be doing his work for him. the only quackle suggestion that looks reasonable is GRUGRU which I'm not sure I knew, but I'm fine with my choice.

>jesse: DEELMRU J8 .EM +14 81
#note no spot for relumed, needed a new lane

>jesse: ?ADEISU 14I DAUtIES +79 232
#note quackle vastly prefers me playing RESIDUA/ARUGOLA or SUBIDEA, citing the improved defense. I didn't realize that DAUTIES would give up so many points.
>dacron: EEFIQTT O12 FE.T +33 249
>jesse: ADEHIOY 15E HEADY +47 279
#note AHOY scores 6 less but keeps a much better leave on a wide open board.
>dacron: EFIIPQT 13B QI +26 275
#note I think I need to ditch the Q here?
>jesse: AIINORV 14A VINO +39 318
>dacron: ?EFIPTX 12L FIE. +32 307
#note The big mistake of the game was here. I didn't even think of playing F(I)X, keeping a fantastic leave. Maybe I'd have a had a shot after his next play.
>jesse: AIIKNRT 5A TRAIKIN. +76 394
>dacron: ?AOPRTX 4C AX +38 345
#note if I had EIPT?, maybe I'd have a 3x3? I passed on EXPIATOR because I didnt think I'd win much after, and this kept a good leave. Apparently, it doesn't win nearly as often as I thought. 
>jesse: CDELMOS F2 MED.COS +24 418
#note I felt pretty good about my play at the time, but much less so now. I didn't like COMETS because the C would give him a great new bingo lane. that said, something like MOTELS here takes away the highest-scoring lane (the T) and also only gives him one turn to fish. blocking the ARUGOLA hook or RUGOLAS should be a lower priority because those bingos will not be worth that much, and I should be able to outrun him in general if he does bingo there.
>dacron: ?OPRRTW G11 W.. +8 353
#note Drawing RW was really rough.
>jesse: CILNOTT 8A TINCT. +33 451
#note TINCT at A5 blocks his potential out-bingo of RAPTORS, but TINCTS guarantees a win.

>jesse:  (ORU) +6 467
#note conrad played better than me throughout this encounter, but I had enough lucky breaks that I was able to win anyway.
