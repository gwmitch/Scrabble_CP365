#note I missed the word NITID. Unfortunately, this rack was in trouble against his opening rack with the Q. Still probably should've seen NITID. Kenji suggests the play of exchange DDIL. I thought about it briefly, but dismissed it too quickly, as well. My opening rack isn't going to do much with the board, so is there really a reason to play here? I think there are a lot of reasonable options here...

#note Scored as 13. Right about here my stomach took a turn for the worse, and it was really hard to concentrate.

#note I made this play way too quickly. I felt like I was trying to keep pace, and needed a nice draw out of the pool, but I'm not completely out of this game - even GOOIE(R) puts me even! Obviously, that was the play.
