#note I5 BUHR looks nice, setting up a decently heavy hitting HIS J6. Also, HUSH surprisingly yields about the same bingo% as BUSH, which I would not have guessed - so not setting up the Y bomb is slightly better defensively. Not sure why F5 BUHL is so great, but either of those other two would have been a mild improvement.

#note Not sure why I did this instead of K3 WHEEN. It's not an enormous difference.

#note VET sims better. I thought it was kind of closed, but L becomes a reasonably hittable line.

#note Finally! This seems clearly best.
