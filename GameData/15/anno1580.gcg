#note Quackle likes N3 CARBINE, but I didn't want to open the TWS lane.  I wanted to play BACTERIN but was wary of plays starting at 1K.

#note 5E COONTIE, G3 WOO and FOOT and 4C TWOFER are all better

#note For some reason I wasn't sure abouth BLOTCH even though it's a common word.

#note Quackle prefers 3! DUTY and PATY but I'd prefer not to open a lane.

>Dave_T: AFPPQTU 15A PUPA +30 383
#note I have no idea what I was thinking here.  I need to play 3A QAT.  I have the last U so he can't really exploit it.  
>Adrian_M: IOV L1 VIO. +11 305
>Dave_T: AEFIJQT 3A QAT +36 419
#note I was running low on time (I had 3 minutes and he had 19) and I didn't realize the bag was nearly empty.  I never would have emptied the bag if I was paying attention.  B13 JEU should win for me even after a bingo.
>Adrian_M: DEEINST O5 DESTINE +80 385
#note I can't believe I lost this game.  He basically had a 118 point outplay to win by 4.  I've never lost a game like this so now I've learned my lesson the hard way to not empty the bag.
