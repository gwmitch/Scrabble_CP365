#note Maybe I shouldn't have opened the S hook, but I thought I could use it later.  Quackle slightly prefers ARISTAE.
>Sonia_L: ABCCEOQ 14J F.B +33 117
>Sonia_L: ABCCEOQ --  -33 84
>Dave_T: DEIKLLO 8K .LIKE +30 222
#note L3 KELOID is best, but I didn't know it.
>Sonia_L: ABCCEOQ N6 PU.ER +19 103
>Sonia_L: ABCCEOQ --  -19 84
#note Nope.  But VOMITER is good.
>Dave_T: DFLOSSV 14J F. +26 248
#note I completely missed DELFS here and decided to take the points and remove the hotspot.
>Sonia_L: BFU 14E FUB +14 98
>Dave_T: ADLOSSV 7G DO +23 271
#note maybe I should have played N11 OVALS but I don't like Quackle's preference of blowing both Ss with SALVOS for 29.
>Sonia_L: PU 10J P.U +11 109
>Dave_T: ALOSSUV 6H VAU +14 285
#note I'm surprised Quackle prefers OVALS over VAUS.  I had greedily decided to keep that spot to try to hit the TLS.
>Sonia_L: DEHOOUY N6 YO. +18 127
>Dave_T: HLORRSS N12 RHOS +21 306
#note I know the board isn't S friendly, but why play SHORLS for only 8 more points?
>Sonia_L: EEEEE -EEEEE +0 127
>Dave_T: CEELRRS 13K .EC. +20 326
#note My play scores well, but 11D CRENEL is best, though I didn;t know it.  Quackle's 2nd choice 15A SCREE seems way too volatile.
>Sonia_L: EQRU 10C QUER. +16 143
>Dave_T: ELNRRSS D9 N.RL +8 334
#note I know adding the S is best here, but I have trouble parting with it for only 2 points.
>Sonia_L: DEMO 15B DOME +15 158
>Dave_T: AAEERSS H10 SA.E +23 357
>Sonia_L: APY 14A PAY +27 185
>Dave_T: AAENORS M3 ANOA +13 370
#note 9D NAOI is best.  I played this over 5I ANOA because I was growing restless and wanted to open things up more.
>Sonia_L: BDEENO O1 DEBONE +36 221
>Dave_T: CEHORST N1 OH +23 393
#note Surprisingly Quackle does not like this play.  It's top choices are 4G CHORTEN, L1 ECHO, and 4J CHON.
>Sonia_L: ITT L3 TIT +14 235
>Dave_T: CEGRSTX 9N EX +29 422
#note Quackle prefersB12 Grad for 6, probably because of the vowel shortage.  I decide to pass on the 5 extra points and keep my S.
>Sonia_L: IZ A12 ZI. +24 259
>Dave_T: CGGRSTW I11 W.T +16 438
#note I find an out in 4 that I'm amazingly able to play, though I screw up the order at the end.
>Sonia_L: DEGINOT 11B DI.T +25 284
>Dave_T: CGGRS 4J GR..G. +8 446
#note Quackle feels this should have preceded WIT, but I really didn't think she'd block this play.
>Sonia_L: EGNO 8B NEG +14 298
>Sonia_L: EGNO --  -14 284
#note That was lucky.
>Dave_T: CS 9M S.. +14 460
#note I need to play COD first or else I get C stuck.  Besides she can't block this play.
