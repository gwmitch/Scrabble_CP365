>Janet_G: EINRTV 8G INVERT +20 20
>Dave_T: ALOORUW 7J WAUL +17 17
#note J6 WOE is best
>Janet_G: DEELORS H6 CE.TRICS +65 85
>Janet_G: DEELORS --  -65 20
>Dave_T: NNOOORZ 9D ZOON +17 34
#note I can't believe I missed 6I ZOON
>Janet_G: EST D9 .EST +26 46
>Dave_T: EIMNOQR 11B QI. +12 46
#note Quackle likes NOMOI.  I hated what this did to the board but wanted to get rid of the Q.  My play is only marginally better than xch Q.
>Janet_G: COR 6I ROC +20 66
>Dave_T: AEEMNOR 10F ENORM +22 68
#note Quackle likes L7 UTE.  I'd have a hard time fishing here and should have considered 10F ENAMOR and ENEMA which have better leaves.
>Janet_G: EWY 13C WYE +35 101
>Dave_T: AEIIPTU 11J ETUI +12 80
#note H10 OPIATE
>Janet_G: EJP L10 J.PE +26 127
>Dave_T: ADILNPS 14J PADIS +43 123
#note K3 PLACARD is better and doesn't involve a phony.
>Janet_G: AFIR 15H FAIR +27 154
>Dave_T: ?AALMNS 5E ANiMALS +103 226
#note That was fun!
>Janet_G: DFI 15M FID +28 182
>Dave_T: BEEEIOR 4G BEE +17 243
#note Quackle's choice of 4K EERIE seems too volatile.  None of my plays are great here.  Maybe I should have played 14F BEE which doesn't open any new lines.
>Janet_G: ?CNORTU 3I NOCTURn +73 255
>Dave_T: BEIOORU -  +0 243
#note I knew NOCTURNE so probably shouldn't have challenged this.  Turns out NOCTURN takes any of EIOS.  Quackle likes OUREBI, but I would have played BONIER.
>Janet_G: DIKY O1 DI.KY +51 306
#note That hurt.
>Dave_T: BEIOORU 6B OURIE +15 258
#note 12A OI is apparently best.
>Janet_G: AGO 1L GOA. +8 314
>Dave_T: ABHOSTX B2 HATB.X +36 294
#note I really wanted an open E.  2I AH, 10L JOB, and N5 OX all sim better.
>Janet_G: EGG A7 EGG +24 338
>Dave_T: AADELOS A1 DOLE +28 322
#note If I knew INVERTASE I still lose by 1, or 5 if she sees VAHINE.
