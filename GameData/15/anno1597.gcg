>Jason: DEIPRVY 8H PRIVY +34 34
#note "Nice way to get rid of junk," Jeff said. Nearly played IVY before seeing it.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: FHRT J6 FR.TH +27 27
#note And that's a nice way to get rid of his junk.
>Jason: DEGNORU 7B UNDERGO +66 100
#note Was hoping to play the spelling bee's winning word, had to "settle" for this.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: HM 8A HM +25 52
>Jason: ?EGNOQU D4 QUO. +28 128
#note Thought I might be missing something better. Wasn't.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ELP E5 PE.L +22 74
>Jason: ?BEGNOS 11D ByGONES +80 208
#note Of the handful of choices, thought it was coolest; how often do you make the blank a Y? Q said it's best, too. Four turns, four best plays. Don't get used to it, the mistakes are coming.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEUZ F11 .AUZE +35 109
>Jason: ADEGIJT 15E J.ED +36 244
#note Whiffed on JAD(E)ITE. So obsessed with playing through the triple, I whiffed on JADE for 48 at 12A, roughly even with this.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EFY 12B FEY +32 141
>Jason: AEGIRTT 13A GATE +27 271
#note That play made this decision easy.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ENRV L4 NERV. +22 163
>Jason: AEIILRT K5 AI +14 285
#note No, no, no. Not even in Q's top 10, but of the ones that are, (Z)AIRE was the only one I considered. Again, fall in love with certain combos too much and turnover suffers.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: X B12 ..X +26 189
>Jason: EIILRTT H11 .ITI. +7 292
#note Saw TRITI(UM), the best play, but just didn't want to open, esp. after his last play.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AIINRST M2 RIA +8 197
#note Unfortunately for him, no good place to fish off the I.
>Jason: ELMNORT 6A OM +23 315
#note Not worried about the ELNRT leave with this pool.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EEEINST 13H .EENIEST +68 265
#note The low-prob EEE draw pays off.
>Jason: ELNRTTW N10 WRE.T +32 347
#note With the pool so vowel-heavy, it was really tempting to play W(I)LT, but that's how 135-point leads get lost. Decided to play it safe, esp. since it's going to be hard to bingo with the E's gone. Surprised Q likes WILT better.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ACLO F2 CALO +17 282
>Jason: ABDLNTU 1L BAUD +34 381
#note If he doesn't want to close the board, I'll be happy to oblige. :) Again, like it to BALD and BAND because I'm assuming I'll be drawing a lot of vowels soon.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AISW 2J WAI.S +40 322
>Jason: AALLNNT A13 .AL +21 402
#note Dinner was awesome, despite Pete's last comment to me and not having a good answer for the around-the-table question near the end of the evening. (I've since thought of one; I'll be ready next time.)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DIIKOOS 15L DISK +42 364
#note Q likes SKIDOO for 38 at O5 a lot better, as a quarter of the time it blocks my LACTONe and makes it easier to go out next turn.
>Jason: ?ACLNNT O6 LANCe +22 424
#note Took me a long, looong time to find an out in two. "You're making this too hard on yourself," Jeff said at one point. Then he realized CLAN at 10B wasn't going to work, since the blank was a Y, not an E. After finally looking down column O and limiting the blank to an E or O, I found it. It's slightly suboptimal, but at least I found it!
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IOOO 3J OI +9 373
#note "Wonder what this is?" Jeff said, picking the last tile after DISK. "Probably an O," I said, looking at the four unseen tiles. Uh, yeah; he didn't leave OOO.
>Jason: NT G10 T.N +6 430
>Jason:  (OO) +4 434
