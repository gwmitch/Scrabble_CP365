#note this scores best and I thought was pretty defensive, but Quackle prefers a slew of other bingos like GRITTING, GRANTING, RINGGITSm TRIGGING and GIRTHING.  Given his last fishing play, I'm comfortable with my play.

#note 2nd to VANMEN which I didn't know
>Scott_P: EFO 7H FOE +17 35
>Dave_T: ACEIMNQ 6J MANIC +32 239
#note for some reason I thought this was a J setup so passed on Quackle's co-first choice 13G QI.  The duck also likes 13C CINEMA and 6J MINAE.  I would think EQ is a better leave than CQ so maybe it's best not to setup the S hook.

>Dave_T: EOPQSSU 8M SUQ +47 286
#note holding the Q paid off

#note best
>Scott_P: DHI 1L .HID +30 166
>Dave_T: BEEGISU F4 BEGU. +12 332
#note I spent awhile on this play and was way off the mark.  Better are: 10L GIBE, 12B BEE, O1 DEBUGS, F4 EUGENIA, and 14F BE
>Scott_P: DEIJ 4D JI.ED +34 200
>Dave_T: AAAEILS 12C AA +10 342
#note I can see N10 AISLE and  N11 ASEA being better but why open lines with 3G AA or 3G AAL?

>Dave_T: EIILRST 5F .T +8 386
#note how did I miss SILTIER?  I actually thought he was going to play to the TWS and since there were so many A's unseen I had already scored LISTERIA on rows A and B, but no such luck.  playing off the T doesn't result in a great leave but kills the lane he opened.
>Scott_P: AELORTV K3 LAV. +24 277
>Dave_T: EHIILRS 9N HI +21 407
#note I wanted to block the last bingo lane.  Quackle prefers 2H HIE and HI.  Really?  This looks idiotic to me with a blank unseen.
>Scott_P: ?EFOORT 2N FE +23 300
>Dave_T: DEILRST E2 DE.L +16 423
#note 5E DETER scores more.  For some reason Quackle thinks I should fish with A14 AL.
