#note I didn't know MARBLIER, PREMOLAR, or PREMORAL.  This is second to MARBLIER.
>Dave_R: EE 4K E.E +12 93
>Dave_T: ?AELRUZ N6 ZE.L +33 157
#note I can't believe he blocked my 104 point LAZURITE with EVE.  Kudos if you saw ZARZUELA for 122.
>Dave_R: EGOS 10K EGOS +23 116
>Dave_T: ?AFIRRU N2 FUR +19 176
#note He seemed like he'd be easily distracted by a play near the TWS while I build toward a 2x2.  Quackle likes M1 RIFE.
>Dave_R: ANT O2 ANT +20 136
>Dave_T: ?ACILOR 11E CLARIOn +84 260
#note That worked well.  COALIER and CHORIAL score more.

>Dave_R: EJ B6 JE. +26 171
>Dave_T: ADEFGNU 6B .UDGE +16 332
#note I spent several minutes on this play.  He had been fishing for several plays and I didn't want to open a lane.  D4 FAUGH is best.
>Dave_R: ADEV H11 .AVED +30 201
>Dave_T: AFHMNST 14G M.TH +17 349
#note Again, closing lanes.  HEFT has a better leave.  C3 FANUMS is a cool play.  
>Dave_R: IK D4 KI. +16 217
>Dave_T: AFINRSS 3A FIRS +23 372
#note Given his recent fish, FIRS seems best.
>Dave_R: OQTU F2 QUOT. +34 251
>Dave_T: ANNORSW O1 W... +21 393
#note 13J OWN is best.  I had trouble finding a good play and went for the points.
>Dave_R: IIIOOO -IIIOOO +0 251
>Dave_T: AGNNORS 15J ORGANS +32 425
#note Quackle likes 13F NOVAS which kills two lines.  Somehow this play is inferior to ORANGS.  I also may not have wanted to play off so many tiles after he exchnaged 6.
>Dave_R: ?ACDILP G1 DIP +27 278
>Dave_T: ACIIILN A8 .LINI +8 433
#note C6 SALICIN is best.  Quackle hates my play, but I'm OK with it.  I was trying to block OBLATION/BOLTONIA.  Other possible bingos I didn't see: OVATIONS, NOVATION, SOLATION, BONIATOS, ABORTION, ODONTOID.
