>Jim_Peters: AAAAAAA -AAAAAAA +0 0
>Jason: BEFGORW 8D FORGE +26 26
#note Whiffed on BEFOG. Picked up FROW (in Q's top 10) to play this (not in Q's top 10). An inauspicious start.
>Jim_Peters: EEVY F5 EVE.Y +19 19
>Jason: BCDIILW E2 WILD +22 48
#note I overdraw, and I notice I've overdrawn after I pull the blank. (Gulp.) I fleetingly think "If I play WILD here and draw three, he'll never notice," before my conscience steps in. It was a minor upset he looked at the B before seeing the blank. "I don't think I need to look anymore," he said (and didn't). How ironic. I should also mention that we were sitting in the exact same spot we were when we played at MM '06. Bad omens abound. As Scott pointed out at dinner (although I don't know how tongue-in-cheek it was/how much was the alcohol talking), I do look for the bad omen. But when I see a good omen, I tell myself that now's the time for a correction. In my world, doom's always imminent.
>Jim_Peters: AELP D1 PALE +29 48
#note Scored as 23, the banking so-and-so! Must. Count. Opponent's. Score. Always.
>Jason: ABCINTU H1 INCUBAT. +89 137
#note I'm usually good for one decent bingo find a day. This was Saturday's. Counted as 86. (Hey, I'm just trying to keep up with him!) "OK," I mutter to myself while in the bag, "draw the blank he threw back and step on his f***ing throat."
>Jim_Peters: AEEILNT 6H .LIENATE +62 110
#note With all the groaning he did at my finding INCUBATE, I was surprised to see a bingo go down here.
>Jason: AIINTXZ O5 Z.ATIN +45 182
#note Looked so hard to try to double the X or Z while tripling, I missed the star play, NAZI at 5K, which scores the same, blocks the triple and sets up a monster (ZA)X play for later with any A or E.
>Jim_Peters: ?AEELMS 11I MEALiES +82 192
#note Oh God, is that the one he threw back?
>Jason: ADIMPRX 7K MAX +43 225
#note Best, but slightly dangerous, as he can whack me harder with the right tiles...
>Jim_Peters: AHW 5K HAW +50 242
#note ...you know, like those tiles. I'm really trying to not freak out mentally at this stage.
>Jason: DEEIKPR 1A PRE. +24 249
#note Horrible. Running short on E's, I'm not the biggest fan of Q's play of RE(WAX)ED. But missing KEP at 10H for 29 with an awesome leave is inexcusable.
>Jim_Peters: NNOO 10H NOON +16 258
#note Scored as 13. Back to six points he gains in a recount.
>Jason: DEIIIKT A1 .IKI +11 260
#note I don't like Q's suggestion of TIKI at 7A. Only six more, TIDE's way better than IDE and TIKI gives up too much in return. I stand by my play here.
>Jim_Peters: ?IOORSU 3H .URIOSOs +70 328
#note Hold. I hold for a while. When he asks to take his courtesy draw, I'm sure it's been more than a minute, so I agree. It's blocking my U(N)BAITED and I don't see me having much luck winning by letting it go (even though he had RIOtOUS/(OM)S), so I challenge.
>Jim_Peters: ?IOORSU --  -70 258
#note Per my agreement with Him before hitting the judge button, I'm off to Calcutta to work with the poor. Sighing with relief (but not fist-pumping, mind you), we go back to the table. He takes the tiles in his hand and reaches for the bag. "I get to see those," I say. As his hand's in the mouth of the bag, I say it again, more loudly/forcefully: "I get to see those!" I get a questioning grunt in response, but at least he's stopped moving. "The tiles, I get to see them before they go back in the bag," I say. "Why?" he asks. "They're just going back in the bag." It is kind of a silly rule, needed more when an opponent's played a fewer-than-seven-tile phony. And because I'd tracked, it really makes no difference what they are. But he's fighting me so hard on this, I want to know what they are to see just how on tilt he is. "I know," I say. "But I still get to see them." He dumps them on the table, saying "Well, that's a stupid rule." They're DEFGNSS (case S's, eh?). Play continues.
>Jason: ABDEITU 2G U.BAITED +76 336
#note I should've said: "It's blocking my UNBAITED*..." Wow. Was so sure that was good; must've confused it with UNBIASED. We're putting green in the phony chart now, though! First AEIUBNT+C, now AEIUBNT+D. 
>Jim_Peters: ?IOORSU B4 fURIOSO +61 319
#note Wasn't sure, but didn't even hold because...
>Jason: CEJOORY A8 JOY +73 409
#note ...of that. He was quite furioso at this point, but I was full of joy. (rim shot) And yes, I know it's not a synonym for furious, but work with me, people.
>Jim_Peters: GV M10 V.G +6 325
>Jason: CENORRT 12K NO. +15 424
#note Off Q's radar, but sim it and it winds up solidly in the top five. Also considered TENOR for 28 at K1 to run, too.
>Jim_Peters: DFIO 3K FIDO +32 357
>Jason: CERRRTT 8D .....R +10 434
#note I'm not home yet. QUASHES/(OM)S for 95 is a possibility given the pool. In fact, because of that, this is an antithesis to the "don't empty the bag" rule. I should empty it because if he's got six of seven, I give him a chance to fish for it. And as you can see, it's not like I'm going to block it if I pull D or G. 
>Jim_Peters: D C1 .D +10 367
#note Wonder if he fished for QUASHES. I pulled the H, so if the G was in the bag ... phew!
>Jason: CEHRRTT D8 .ETCH +26 460
>Jim_Peters: AEGQSSU 13G QUAGS +30 397
#note "Everything that can go wrong has been going wrong," he said. Yeah, like when his opponent threw back the blank on an overdraw (again), pulled a baby bingo out of the bag post-bingo, had the perfect post-bingo tiles to play HAW for 50 and counterfeit a huge X play, he drew no blanks and no S's, couldn't draw the case S's when they were put back in the bag after a courtesy draw ... oh wait, all that happened to me. I'm sorry, I got confused. P.S. At 13I, it's 72. It doesn't win, but at that point it's very possible I'll panic, think he has won, and my head will explode and while I'm trying to collect the pieces, I'll go over on time. Plus, it would've given him high loss.
>Jason: RRT 5J T... +12 472
>Jim_Peters: ES 8K ES +17 414
#note He wordlessly filled out his cume and initialed the winner's slip and stormed out, leaving me to corner the tiles. Speaking of fist-pumping, I allowed myself one on the way to deposit the winner's slip, after I was sure he was out of sight.
