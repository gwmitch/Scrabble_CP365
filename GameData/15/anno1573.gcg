#note Like the previous turn, the only other real option is to exchange. I thought it was best to play through the junk, hoping to score with the Z.

#note Very close call this time. Obviously the triple I leave is hideous, but it seemed barely worth it to take out one of the few scoring spots on the board.

#note I thought about WITE 12A, but it seemed a little too crazy. Who knows - WITE wins the sim.

#note A tantalizing rack, but this was about as good as I could do. I'm glad I played on this side rather than something at 1A, given Lisa's next play.

#note This appears to be best. It looks like there ought to be a way to block PILL / PILE, but you just can't score enough doing so.
