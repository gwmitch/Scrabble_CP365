>Jason: AEEEEOV -AEEEOV +0 0
#note Jason: Incredibly, I had the exact same rack to open against Pianowski in game 7 of the Hector Invite in January. I played EAVE, best equity-wise, lousy sim-wise. What were the odds I'd draw the exact same opening rack months later and be able to use that knowledge?! (I must've mis-remembered Q's first take on this, as it says keeping AE is slightly better.)
>Pete_Zeigler: DGIJOQV H7 QI +22 22
#note Pete: Duck likes JOG, but I'd rather take my chances holding the J another turn than the Q.  
>Jason: ABEINRX I6 BIN +20 20
#note Jason: Wanted more for my X than the 22 for XI, but Q says that's best.
>Pete_Zeigler: ADEGJOV G8 JOG +22 44
#note Pete: Q's choice of GADJO J2 26 is insane. Scores 4 more points and invites a huge reply with the J next to the double word. My play finishes just behind, and isn't insane.
>Jason: AAENRRX J8 NEAR +17 37
#note Jason: "I can only imagine what Robin Pollock Daniel would say about this play," I said as I put it down. I can hear it now: "Those were your BAD tiles?!" But I couldn't find anything better and Q says this is best. Ha! 
>Pete_Zeigler: ?ADEEVV 10I V.V +9 53
#note Pete: Hearing the RPD namedrop enraged me, and made me play like a moron. I got lazy and fishy on this one, probably due to the confusion from seeing a tile without a letter on it appear on my rack.  Having not had one to this point of the tourney, I didn't know what to do.
>Jason: ADERSWX F4 WAXED +45 82
#note Jason: Nearly played WAXES at K4 for 42. Thought "Boy, it'd be nice to play WAXED for points here." Pause. "Hey, wait, JINN takes the D back hook! And I triple the X!" Call me the accidental genius. (P.S. I better drop RPD's name more often around PZ, and maybe our Bowman.) 
>Pete_Zeigler: ?ADEELO K2 ELODEAs +77 130
#note Pete: best placement of the only bingo, my first of the tournament.
>Jason: INORSTU 12D TURIONS +71 153
#note Jason: "Some of us have to bingo naturally," I pointed out. I then offered Pete a belated congratulations on his first bingo of the tournament. P.S.: Q likes either bingo at 11A better, perhaps because three of the four biggies are played.
>Pete_Zeigler: AFGKUUZ E5 ZA +53 183
#note Pete: I was actually torn between the Z bomb and trying to get rid of a U... for about a second and a half. Then I realized that turning down 53 points would be even more stupid than my usual level of stupidity.
>Jason: AAEHLNS J2 HA +28 181
>Pete_Zeigler: DFGIKUU 3I K..IF +34 217
#note Pete: Fancy Play Syndrome strikes again! I kinda forgot that having 2 U's on a rack is a bad thing. My flashier play only finished 1.8 behind in equity, but is clearly worse than FUGU D6.
>Jason: AELNPST 1D PLANETS +92 273
#note Jason: Part of me wanted him to block up there so I could make the five-overlap bingo at 13B.
>Pete_Zeigler: DEGTTUU 2F GUT +19 236
>Jason: HIOORSY J5 OY +32 305
>Pete_Zeigler: BDEPTTU L2 T.P +24 260
#note Pete: I miss the star play DOUBT H11, but TIP is less than 2 points behind in equity. If these were the biggest mistakes I make in a game, I'd be a lot better than I am.
>Jason: EHIIORS N1 HOSIER +35 340
#note Jason: Tough decision. I considered fishing here, but in the end just decided to run, end the game quicker, maybe outrun the bingo, maybe draw the case blank or case S. I was pleased Q agreed with this.
>Pete_Zeigler: BDEEFTU O5 FEUD +31 291
#note Pete: Quackle likes FE in the corner by almost 4 pts of eq.  I was torn, but decided that burning the U and taking the chance of Jason catching all 1 point tiles made it reasonable to make my play.
>Jason: AAEINTY O1 AY +35 375
>Pete_Zeigler: BEEILOT H12 .BOE +18 309
#note Pete: Best. Opens the board, and gives me at least some level of hope for a moment or two.
>Jason: AEINNRT N8 ENTRAIN +71 446
#note Jason: "You've been studying, I can tell," said Pete. Har har. Hey, this is what I was studying! Reviewing top 2K sevens and eights plus the fours. The back-to-basics approach seemed to work.
>Pete_Zeigler: EIIILRT 2A LIRI +12 321
#note Pete: Wins sim. Quackle knows I need a miracle, and this looks like the best way to catch it. I swear I had triple letters more in this tourney than I can ever remember previously.
>Jason: ACLMOOR A1 C.AM +33 479
#note Jason: Almost there. Needed to add OR. I then pulled the blank, a little disappointing. I didn't need it and I wanted to brag about being 2-1 despite going 0-for-6 in blanks. :)
>Pete_Zeigler: DEISTUW D6 WUD +22 343
#note Pete: and I miss the bingo through the O, because I stopped looking when I saw WU on my rack again. Frustration poisoned my play this game. WUD was second.
>Jason: ?ELMOOR B4 aLEROOM +69 548
#note Jason: Pete took his "obligatory challenge," even though he was "99% sure it's good."
>Jason: ?ELMOOR --  -69 479
#note Jason: That made me doubly surprised when it came off. Obviously confused it with SALEROOM or something.
>Pete_Zeigler: CEEGIST 15L GIST +29 372
#note Pete: CIST is better... must review the 4s again.
>Jason: ?ELMOOR A1 ....MiER +39 518
#note Jason: Still missing MORELLO, the only playable bingo, which I don't know. Way to lose 13 equity points in your first 11 turns and 115.3 in your last three, Jase.
>Pete_Zeigler: CEE 11B CEE +7 379
#note Pete: and I can't complain too much. Other than missing WIDEOUTS, my misses were mostly small. My equity loss for the game, including the bingo, was under 70, with the missed bingo and VAV causing most of it.
>Pete_Zeigler:  (LOO) +6 385
