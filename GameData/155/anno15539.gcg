#note CJ: ARVO D12. (-5) My play is obviously inferior because it shuts the board down against someone whose sense of board control is nothing less than masterful. ARVO also scores a lot more.  JD: Easy there on the praise Carl! This was an interesting play from my perspective because it blocks some lanes when he has something like AVO at D12 available. It seemed to imply something specific like an NN leave, and likely an S.
>JD: AABBENQ 4D ABBA +18 207
#note JD: likely my weirdest play of the entire tournament. I liked this play because it blocks so much of the board simultaneously, even though I may struggle to play the Q off in future as a result. sorry quackle, can't bring myself to play ABBA at 12D. the only reasonable alternative suggested is BABE at 2G, but it seems reasonable after his last play that he might have another A or O. BABE at 4D helps me play off the Q with QAT if I draw a T, but setting up the best lane on the board at 2A seems perverse. James suggested BA at 2F, which is quite devious, setting up a BAA play for next time.

>JD: EFNQSUW 12K QUE.N +30 276
#note JD: I saw this play as playing QUERN to block and saving FW for A6, but quackle loves keeping NQSU here trying to draw for a vowel and hit row 13. I think it's hard for me to stay in control of this board without playing QUERN now but I can buy that I tend to be up by more points on average after FEW.

#note JD: playing one of the esses almost certainly signals the other, hence why I almost played FIG at 2M to conceal, but I didn't want to get killed by ZA. The F is a nice tile on this board, if he opens at H1 I can just play the F at 2M.
>Carl_Johnson: EEGLNRT O10 TE.NER +29 322
#note JD: beautiful play
>JD: ?EEFSTY 5E YE +28 373
#note JD: do I play at N14 to interfere with his lane? there's not a whole lot he can hit but there wound up being a few words (cingular/lingular) that fit there...but putting an E at 15 may make it easier for him to hit a 9! I think I'm fine with my play, and it may help me get spread.
>Carl_Johnson: ACGILNT I2 G.N +4 326
#note CJ: Fishing for CINGULAR 15H seems hopeless since there's no way to burn the T in a way that opens another lane, and Jesse will block row 15 every time. Quackle Championship player does GL(AIRIEST). My play is third on the list. (-10?)
>JD: ?EEFPST 1H FaTES +28 401
#note JD: playing it safe and taking away cheap points, I could also fish the F going for SEPTATE/UPSETTER unblockable
>Carl_Johnson: ACILTUZ 11E .UTZ +16 342
#note CJ: I believe I was low on time here and thought I was blocking Jesse's out. (-12)
