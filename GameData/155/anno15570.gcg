>Terry: CHMOO 8H MOOCH +32 32
>Will: BELSTTY M7 BY +26 26
#note I honestly thought MOOCHY* was good. Terry was dubious but didn't pull the trigger on a challenge. Almost played BYTE in the same spot, but that gets me hammered a lot. The funny thing is that TOBY is at least as good.

>Terry: AERSZ H10 RAZ.ES +75 145
>Will: AEFGNTU 6F FAG +24 127
#note I guess the U in FAG's leave hurts it more than I thought, and that AEGNT is gonna bingo a lot more than I thought as well. Misevaluated this turn.

>Terry: IX E11 XI +22 309
>Will: EHKLNOY N2 HONKEY +43 320
#note Too much equity to turn down, and I need to reach for blanks. Also, a little inferencing made me feel better about HONKEY - XI indicates no E in hand a lot of the time, because DEX/LEX/VEX in that same spot would have been extremely likely to come down if so.
>Terry: DDI O1 DID +23 332
>Will: ?GIILLQ F10 QI +40 360
#note Ouch, that hurts. I was praying that I was dead wrong about the lack-of-E inference and that something would come down with BYE, leaving the monstrous QuILLING 4H wide open. Even a bingo there would have been an improvement for me over DID, since QUILLING would have more than equalized.

#note Suggestions welcome for what the heck to do here, this was a try for DIALOGIC/GLADIOLA
