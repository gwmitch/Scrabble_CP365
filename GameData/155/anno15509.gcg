#note I was trying to will Jesse not to block G8 DEROGATED, but that kind of brain-link trickery only works on my brother.

>Charles_Reinke: EHILOTU M8 OH +21 204
#note This play puts a few more lanes on the board, but my rack will go sour fast if I draw one of the plentiful remaining E's.  I like 11I HUED.

>Charles_Reinke: ELOPTTU E5 PUTTO +17 246
#note I spent a long time on this play, resulting in severe time pressure at the end of the game.  It was between this and TUPELO in the same column; TUPELO is stronger because it gets rid of my L (there are three still in the bag) and keeps no vowels (of which there are plenty).
>Jesse_Matthews: EH F5 EH +30 262

#note Underscored by 2.
>Jesse_Matthews: AABLR D1 LABRA +21 283
>Charles_Reinke: EEEEISW I2 EWE +23 335
#note This blocks most of the bingo lines, and makes it so that bingos in row 1 have to fit perfectly.  However, since I drew most of the remaining E's, bingos aren't very likely.
>Jesse_Matthews: ILWY 1A WIL.Y +33 316
>Charles_Reinke: AEEIIMS 3A IAM. +16 351
#note IAMBI is slightly better; there is no point in avoiding emptying the bag.  
>Jesse_Matthews: IKM 4H K..IM +32 348
>Charles_Reinke: AEEINRS 14A RISE +20 371
#note Focused on blocking B13 FEZ, but this play gives back almost as many points with the same play at 15D.  I spent forever making this play.
>Jesse_Matthews: BCEFZ 15D FEZ +28 376
>Charles_Reinke: AEN 3L ANE +10 381
#note Even though Jesse spent quite a while on FEZ, I was too frantic to see A12 EARN or my other higher-scoring outs.
>Charles_Reinke:  (BC) +12 393
#note Final score recorded as 391-376.
