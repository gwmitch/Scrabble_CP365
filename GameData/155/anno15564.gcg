#note If I didn't have the Q, I'd almost certainly play ZEP instead to keep the valuable R.  However, with the Q you want to give yourself as many chances to draw letters that will help you dump it.

#note AWAVE# E10 is a significant improvement.  I would have known the word if I had seen it, but I didn't think of it.  That's part of the challenge of learning CSW after nearly a decade of playing TWL.  It's not enough to know the words passively.  You need to train your brain to spot them.

#note Part of making the jump from good to great Scrabble is making the absolute most of situations like this.  After I made sure that I had no bingo, it was obvious that the best way to score was on this H1-H5 spot.  But with versatile letters like this, it's often going to be the case that you have more than one word that works.  Generating all the possibilities can help you leave yourself a slightly better rack.  Those small differences can add up over the course of a game or tournament.  I can forgive myself for not knowing NITRY# in this spot, but I should have seen RAINY.  The RT leave packs more punch than IN.  In this particular case, my play may actually be stronger than RAINY, because it holds the I for the powerful 13C spot.  However, I can't give myself credit for making a good decision here, because I didn't think of RAINY.  You need to see all the possibilities before you can make the right decisions.

#note I think that may be the most I've ever scored by dumping three vowels.  Just about the best way to clear out a bad rack.

#note The only bingo that plays.  I also thought of several of the eights this rack could make, including AUTOTUNE# and TENUIOUS#, and the one other seven, which is good in TWL but tricky to see.

#note My CSW knowledge was not quite good enough yet.  If I had known SKLIMS#, which plays at N9 for 49 points, I would have tied the game at 464, after Sammy made the same play as in the game and I dropped the H at 13G.  If as well I had known enough not to challenge VENEY#, I would have even won.

#note Another CSW fail.  The play here is GLISK#, which Sammy pointed out to me right after the game, but I would still lose 464-460.
