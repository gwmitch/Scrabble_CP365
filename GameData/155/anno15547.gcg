#note See the discussion in Part 2 of this series re: HIC. The sim winner here is K10 EH, which makes the board basically dead unless Nigel has an O, S or a blank. EH also keeps a better leave. Plays like these are generally not part of my arsenal; I consinstently fail to spot them. (-8.5)

#note Best. It takes out all bingos. As a result, I will save spread and be at the very top of the 4-6 crowd. Yippee.
