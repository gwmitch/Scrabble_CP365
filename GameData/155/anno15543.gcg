#note i think this is a tough move. i considered L9 BEGRIM for a while but it seems to give a lot back. didn't think of E5 CHIRM, 6F BRIG, or the simple 10A BIG/MIG. 10A BIG sims the best by a bit; i guess it makes sense. although MERCH is pretty defensive i'm just hurting myself more next turn.

#note PAM is a lot better because it actually sets up a word that i have (JAB) vs BAM. right idea but shoulda thought a little harder. (-11)

#note the pool is actually quite nice. i should exchange 7 here. whoops. and don't chicken out on PONE. or maybe M4 PIONEER. (-10%)

#note quackle says i win 50% with A8 TOG but playing it out it only wins 25% of the time. this sucks.
