>Joshua_Sokol: AAB H6 ABA +10 10
#note This is an example of one of my faults. A game where I'm ahead and I'm getting fastplayed. George plays really quickly, and I didn't have time to adjust, which resulted in me almost throwing the game away. 
>George_Asaka: III -III +0 0

>George_Asaka: ACO 8K OCA +10 14
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGLRX J2 LEG +17 143
#note I didn't see the nice fit for AXEL. He's fishing so I should score next to it next turn. What LEG does is blocks the highest-scoring lane and keeps the x for scoring next turn, since I'm fairly certain he's going to bingo with OCAS.

>George_Asaka: OQTU 1D QUOT. +27 117
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABENRS G6 BoRANES +71 248
#note NAbBERS and gRABENS. I wasn't sure of either. I actually might want to play BEAN O1 for 29 though. It seals off easy points. Scored as 72.

#note Cool, TEENT(S)Y and TEEN(S)Y. I'm overestimating TANE here.
>George_Asaka: ORUY F11 .OU +8 169
>Joshua_Sokol: ACGNORT 12D GO.. +12 304
#note Starting to get low on time here. This seems like a mistake. If I wanted to fish I should have played (BAN)G
>George_Asaka: ILP 3C LIP +17 186
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDEENT 3B C... +8 312
#note LANCETED. Bad play again due to time trouble.

#note Challenge. Good.
>Joshua_Sokol: AHNPTVY -PV +0 350
#note I did not know H(R)YVNA in July. Another bad play here. I think I was fishing for an (E)Y play at H12.
>George_Asaka: OOW 13B WOO +15 275
#note Good, he's partially blocked himself.
>Joshua_Sokol: AHNTWY 9E WH. +9 359
#note Can't remember the full rack, but I missed W(R)ATHY. I think I was trying to draw an E and also trying not to draw crap by only playing off a few, as well as blocking the I bingo lane. This is actually simming 10th or so but again I don't have a full rack here.
>George_Asaka: UZ D1 .U.Z +51 326
#note Shit. I did see that, and W(R)ATHY would have maybe blocked it if he didn't have QUARTZ but HRYVNA would have totally sealed it.
>Joshua_Sokol: AELNRTY H11 .YNE +24 383
#note I got my E, but I started having stressful doubts that EYNE or EYEN took an S. I had to go with it though. I had almost no time left. LENT 14A is winning the many ply sim, followed closely by AERY, same spot. I was more sure that EYNE didn't take an S than EYEN.
>George_Asaka: EJNRS K5 REJ..NS +56 382
#note Damn it...
>Joshua_Sokol: AILPRTV 14G V.RT +9 392
#note The only thing that wins here is PAIR 14C, cause it blocks R(E)IVE... I had mistracked, had no time left, and I didn't know what he had at all, so I was just hoping he couldn't go out. I saw SPAIL but wasn't 100%. I played this because of PILA(W) and PI L4 if he blocked.
>George_Asaka: EIRV E6 VIE. +10 392
#note He had all the time in the world to track and see I had PILAW. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AILP L4 PI +22 414
#note This is actually better than SPAIL anyways.
>George_Asaka: R 7M ..R +6 398
#note So I almost totally blew it. I would have if George knew his 5s. I knew that next time I played him I would have to play fast too, which is what I did, and I won by 200.
