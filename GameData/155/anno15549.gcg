>freak_by_ovens: AACEENT 8D CATENAE +74 74
#note eb: i approve of this start. (useless fact: to date, i have posted six of my NSC games. in all of them, i have gone first.)
>ship_relic: ANOOPXY 9F ONYX +50 50
#note cl: i approve of this reponse, even if i didn't approve of his start.
>freak_by_ovens: CDEEPUW 7I WED +30 104
#note eb: the bot claims i should take seven more points with 10f WEE. even had i seen that, the leave is significantly worse. try again, duckless.
>ship_relic: AADEOPT 6J POA +25 75
#note: cl: Q likes it over PAWED even tho it opens a ginormous# 2x2 spot.
>freak_by_ovens: CELMPRU 5D CRUMPLE +82 186
#note eb: CLUMPER# is a word too. that could be a costly 34-point mistake.
>ship_relic: ADEEGHT 6F HE +30 105
#note cl: at no point did I actually count the score for CRUMPLED. I assumed it was about 30. Q still likes this play a tiny bit better than dropping the D.
>freak_by_ovens: AAIIQUY 10C QUAY +38 224
#note eb: no brainer. a nice draw would help.
>ship_relic: ADEGIST M3 AGISTED +80 185
#note eb: um, he's not supposed to get this close. padawans never learn.
>freak_by_ovens: ABGIIIO 11B BIGA +32 256
#note eb: not quite the letters i wanted nor the glamorous leave, but 32 points will do.
>ship_relic: DIORSTU 8L D.RO +21 206
#note eb: i quite enjoy it when my opponent only scores 21 for a DLS-TWS. <mustache twirl> <evil laugh>
#note cl: by this point i've forgotten about CRUMPLED. 
>freak_by_ovens: IIOOOST -IIOOO +0 256
>ship_relic: AIILSTU H1 TULI. +24 230
>freak_by_ovens: AAEMNST 2B MANTEA.S +74 330
#note cl: Dammit. Maybe... this is really the alternate universe where only MANTEAUX is good!
>freak_by_ovens: EESUW (challenge) +5 335
#note cl: Nope.  
#note eb: guess what's also a word? SCRUMPLE#, allowing for c1 NAMASTE# (84)
>ship_relic: AEFIORS 1A OAF +27 257
#note cl: Annnnnd now I can't play the bingo. Thanks, Berofsky. You know how far I drove to attend your wedding?
>freak_by_ovens: EESUW 3B EWE +37 372
#note eb: i believe the other two tiles were an E and an I. or both blanks. or the other two Qs. can't remember for sure.
>ship_relic: EINNRSV O3 ENVIR.NS +62 319
#note eb: stop encroaching towards my point total. if the lead goes below 60 from here on out, then the tile-space continuum will be altered forever.
>freak_by_ovens: ?BEGOSU 3G B.OG +21 393
#note eb: tack the S on to CRUMPLE, says el quackero. while the 36 looks good, i'd like to retain the case S for row 12.
>ship_relic: ?IINRTV 12A VIN +26 345
#note cl: the universe where i pull this game out is the one where he doesn't have the mouse. interesting fact: Elise would like this play because she knows from this position that my only opportunity to win anything this game is high loss.
>freak_by_ovens: ?EIRSTU 13C STUdIER +92 485
#note eb: with the Z unseen, it's probably better to save two points and play SUITERS. because if he hits a Z play and follows it up with a bingo, my lead will be history.
>ship_relic: ?IIKORT H12 K.IR +39 384
#note cl: COME ON NOW EMPTY THE BAG, EMPTY THE BAG, EMPTY THE BAG...
>freak_by_ovens: DFIJLOR 5D .......D +40 525
#note eb: DO NOT EMPTY THE BAG. DO NOT EMPTY THE BAG. DO NOT EMPTY THE BAG. (and score 40 while you're at it. perfect.)
>ship_relic: ?EIOOTZ 15H .ObOTIZE +101 485
#note eb: no worries. at least it wasn't 201 points.
>freak_by_ovens: FHIJLOR N13 JI. +38 563
#note eb: the only play worth considering. that'll do.
>ship_relic: L 14M L. +4 489
>ship_relic:  (FHLOR) +22 511
#note eb: looks like someone's getting cash for high loss. don't spend it all in one place, kid.
#note cl: Na zdrowie, my friend. This round's (literally) on you.
