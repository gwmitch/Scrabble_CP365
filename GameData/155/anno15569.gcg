>Will: EGGHKOY 11G G.OKY +26 54
#note Didn't consider anything at G11, though I probably should have - those plays are good bingo defenders. I waffled over GOOKY vs. MOGGY for a while. I guess EHK does more than 2 points better than EGH on my next turn.
>Brian: IIW J11 .IWI +13 81
>Will: AEEGHOR I3 GHERAO +20 74
#note I stand by this play after Brian's KIWI over something like I6 EGO or 13J WAGE - I have to do my best to cover it first or get goodies with which to respond.

#note I should probably play a bingo here that makes PE, not PA - no need to make the case S more valuable than it needs to be when I'm going up a bingo. I'm not home free after something like UNBALES, though; plenty of stuff still hits down column B with APE or OPE.
>Brian: AMRVY O11 MARVY +46 303
>Will: ANNOPSU C2 PUNA +22 352
#note Should make it to the finish line intact after this. C1 UPON is another similar option.
