#note 2013 Nationals, round 21.
>Lester_Schonbrun: IQ I3 QI +26 26
>Charles_Reinke: ACEINPT J2 PICANTE +88 130
#note EPICANTHI is cool, but not any better than my play.
>Lester_Schonbrun: FHOO K5 HOOF +39 65
>Charles_Reinke: ENORTTU L8 TROUT +19 149
>Lester_Schonbrun: ANY K11 NAY +18 83
>Charles_Reinke: BDEMNSU 9D DUMBS +31 180
#note I probably shouldn't open so many letters for eights.  This play also gives back a lot of comebacks at 8A.  L1 DUMBS is better.  Dummy.
>Lester_Schonbrun: AAEILNT F7 LA.INATE +64 147
>Charles_Reinke: AEMNPTU 8A PUMA +31 211
#note I obviously saw I had PUTAMEN, but didn't realize it played as a 40-point non-bingo at E8.  This is better anyway.
>Lester_Schonbrun: AEEIRST 15F SERIATE +85 232
>Charles_Reinke: AEENTVW L1 VEENA +30 241
#note Very poor play.  B8 UNWEAVE scores 42.  If I want to leave the lanes in that quadrant open, L4 VAW is better as well.  I missed both of those plays.
>Lester_Schonbrun: EKU E11 UKE +26 258
>Charles_Reinke: AGGITWX 14L WAX +31 272
#note J12 TAXA doesn't offer high-scoring overlap plays like my play does.
>Lester_Schonbrun: ?EIRSVW A8 .REVIeWS +98 356
>Charles_Reinke: FGGGIOT 13M FOG +33 305
#note Same word plays at D11 fore five more.
>Lester_Schonbrun: EENRY O9 ENER.Y +28 384
>Charles_Reinke: GGINOOT D11 TOG +29 334
#note D11 GOGO is better.  There is no reason to keep ING intact because a theoretical -ING bingo will most likely not play.
>Lester_Schonbrun: Z J14 Z. +31 415
>Charles_Reinke: ?DGINOS 1L .IG +7 341
#note After several turns of mistakes, I finally make an inspired play.  If Lester can only attempt a block by playing down the N column, I might still be able to bingo at O1 next turn.
>Lester_Schonbrun: DO 2N OD +12 427
>Charles_Reinke: ?DDENOS N5 SOuNDED +72 413
#note Oh well, at least this will make it close.
