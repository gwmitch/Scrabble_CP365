#note What the heck am I supposed to do!? I thought this was absolutely terrible when I played it, but this surprisingly sims 3rd. Above this are WOE h7 and e9, but I hate putting vowels next to those damned blue squares :)

#note EKED is best. This is surprisingly the second best exchange.

#note I had only studied 1500 sevens before nationals. Obviously I know many more from playing, but I still have big vocab gaps. I'd heard of uncrate/uncrated but wasn't sure, I suck lol.
