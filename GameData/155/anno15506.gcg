>Carl: ?AAKOVY I6 KAYO +28 28
#note OAKY I5 wins the sim. (-2.5) My reasoning was that if I hit a bingo across row 10, the board will be dead. Also, my play prevents scoring plays to the TWS.

#note Missing the W hook on ARRANT. EWER A1 wins the sim. (-4) All the rest of my plays sim best.

#note After the game, Joel suggested I play CLEW 15H, hoping to draw into JEFE 13K for next turn. Then he decided that it was just too many points to give up this turn, and too likely to get blocked next turn. Still, I should have seen and considered it instead of slapping this down right away.

>Carl: ACEELRW C12 AW +12 310
#note Quackle Championship player goes with AWE instead, but the basic idea is the same, and the plays run pretty close. Personally, I like having one extra lane to work with.
>Joel_S: ?ADIOST O6 mA.TOIDS +75 410
#note Nice block.
>Carl: CEEELPR 14B CEPE +22 332
#note Best. Silly Quackle CP doesn't notice that PEELER C-sticks me. *All normal plays* give Joel a better way to play out.
