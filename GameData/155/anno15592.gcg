#note I see TEGUA immediately after I hit my clock and swear a little under my breath. 
>Kevin_Leeds: FFI 8L .IFF +30 121
>Matt_Canik: EEEMRTT N2 RETEM +46 188
#note But that's a nice lucky draw on my part to make up for the mistake. 
>Kevin_Leeds: ?ADEENS 12D DEAfENS +82 203
>Matt_Canik: ENOPSTT 10H PEON +30 218
#note I saw N(E)TOP, but on a closed-down board like this I don't want to start fishing for nongos. I elected to score a bunch of points now and see what happens in the endgame. 
>Kevin_Leeds: ILV H12 .VIL +21 224
>Matt_Canik: DGSTTTU 7H TUG +13 231
#note With the penultimate S, I think it's smarter to give up the extra point and set up STAMP. Q prefers goth of those plays to the exchange. 
>Kevin_Leeds: IKLT 11K KILT +30 254
>Matt_Canik: ABDESTT O1 BADS +41 272
#note And then after setting myself up for the S spot, I play it off for 11 extra points. I didn't want to get stuck in a mode where I needed to bingo at 6B to win, I felt I could outrun him enough after this. But with 6H and O11, I should keep the S. 
>Kevin_Leeds: AINO 12L NAOI +18 272
>Matt_Canik: CEQTTWX 14F TW.XT +19 291
#note Now what do you do? WET 13M is winning the sim, but that just makes this game a shitshow to see who can draw a 14J play with the S first. TWIXT gives me plays out of this rack in 2, (E)X for 34 ensures I'm exchanging next turn. But scoring 34 over two turns on this board probably isn't too bad. 
>Kevin_Leeds: CDE O12 .CED +21 293
>Matt_Canik: BCEIOQT 15E QI +13 304
#note I thought hard about BO N14 here. I still have Q plays no matter what and I'm knocking out big spots for his potential Y or H or Z. Ultimately I think I just freaked out and dumped the Q prematurely. 
>Kevin_Leeds: EIR 13H .IER +22 315
>Matt_Canik: BCEORTU N14 BO +19 323
>Kevin_Leeds: HO F6 HO... +16 331
#note From this, I can conclude that Kevin did not have the S. 
>Matt_Canik: CELRTUZ E5 CUT +17 340
#note I'm in a bad position here. I can't find any plays that win this endgame too often- Kevin will be down 10 points but up a turn. However, since I know he didn't have the S last turn, CUT affords me a 50% chance at pulling it. If I draw it, I'm pretty much always winning this endgame. If I don't, I don't think I was going to win it anyway. So let's flip a coin.
>Kevin_Leeds: OY M14 OY +17 348
>Matt_Canik: AELRSYZ 4A ZEALS +54 394
#note Phew. Q says there are many stronger endgame playouts that can net me as many as 10 points, with the strongest being (GOD)LY.
