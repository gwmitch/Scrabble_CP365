>cesar: BEENSST 8G NEB +10 10
#note i think i steamed this move a little bit and played a fast fish. BENT or BE might be better. quackle likes BES too. (-1)
>jam: EY 9I YE +20 20
>cesar: DELRSST 10G SLED +24 34
#note maybe a more overt fish makes sense like DEL H7. at the same time YE implies a good rack i think.

>cesar: AEFGUVW 3A FAUVE +25 127
#note i couldn't stomach the leave of AGAVE at 8K but FAUVE gives a lot back and doesn't score enough. (-7)
>jam: HMO 2A OHM +35 175
>cesar: EGORSUW H10 .OWERS +39 166
#note GURSH is best. i wasn't 100% on it. i think i wanted points but this is just a more scary situation after lowers. (-3)
>jam: IKN H1 KNI.. +36 211
>cesar: CDEGUUX 12G G.EDUC +26 192
#note i did not realize how well GURU could work at 14F. 4-ply quackle is brutal though, giving me a  7-pt equity loss for what i thought was a pretty good move. CRUX also sims better. i don't like taking chances like GURU a lot of the time. (-7.5)
>jam: BFO A1 B..FO +51 262
>cesar: ALMSTUX I12 .X +34 226
#note haha boffolas is so cool! but ALMSTU bingoes with 11 of the 40 tiles in the bag, definitely good for a 34-pt fish.
>jam: CEEGORW 14B COWERE. +28 290
>jam: CEEGORW --  -28 262
#note i'm pretty happy i challenged this off, especially because i was 0-6 at this point and had stopped caring. i did still care about trying to play well though.
>cesar: ALMSTUY M10 MUSTY +34 260
#note a bunch of cool possibilities here. there's BOFFOLAS again, but it actually doesn't sim THAT well despite scoring a lot more than the others. i wanted to do 7F YUM but i think it just doesn't score enough. i didn't consider LUSTY instead of MUSTY though. the difference seems to be a few more points next turn despite the lower bingo %. thoughts? (-2)

#note far better than AZIDe
>jam: IILO 8K .IOLI +18 298
>cesar: ?ADJLNN K11 J.N +20 325
#note i'm looking pretty likely to win now after some fortunate events, but it's not over yet. JAIL J2 is good too.
>jam: ACDENOT D8 NOTECA.D +78 376
#note !?! jesse bingoed with this exact word, natural, towards the end of a nationals game just a few weeks ago, crushing my chances of a win.
>cesar: ?AADLNP 8A PLA. +18 343
#note well, if i'd seen PARKLAND this seems like it just might win, but i passed up PRANDIAL/PALADINS. a tough decision. E9 PAD looks like the best fish maybe because of the score, but i didn't want to have to bingo through the K (i don't think quackle is blocking the right side of the board enough). PARKLAND is still only 59% to win, but PLAN was only 49% - i didn't realize it was that bad. i still felt pretty bad about my chances here though because of the V and too many Rs in the pool.
>jam: ILPRRTV 11C R.V +12 388
#note very nice move by jesse, going for the REPTILIA out bingo if i miss. i'm pretty lucky he had the crap here, but after NOTECARD it's gotta be pretty random.
>cesar: ?AADEIN A8 .AtINAED +83 426
#note wins 100% of the time, but i wasn't 100% sure there were no out bingos possible for him.
