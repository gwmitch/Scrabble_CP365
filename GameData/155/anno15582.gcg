#note Wow, here's an interesting leave fact for you. AEIV is not much worse than EIV! Combine that with the fact the OFAY increases opposing scores by a lot, and FOY is a better play.

>Noah: AEIMQSV -QVI +0 57
#note Very little to do with the Q on this board, plus I didn't like keeping EMSV. It's possible QADI was the correct decision. However, this sims worst, which seems incorrect. I think it's because my rack leftover value after the second play is higher than it should be, because Quackle thinks I can play the Q off easily.

#note This was tough. I thought about QUARK/QUACK, but I just didn't like opening up that easy S hook for a huge advantage. It seemed like I had the upper hand here, and QUACK made this game more like a coin flip.
