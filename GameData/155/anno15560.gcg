>Joshua_Sokol: DEORV 8H DROVE +20 20
#note I'm too lazy to change the names. Michael was first here, not me. Weird placement to start things off.
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEIKTUY I5 KAU.Y +17 17
>Joshua_Sokol: AAMPRTU J5 AA +14 34
>Michael_Kapernaros: ?EEHIRT K5 EH +30 47
#note If this is my rack, I missed like 20 better plays... I think I doubted drove taking an R and missed DIETHER. This was scored at 28.
>Joshua_Sokol: OPSS L3 OPS +18 52
>Michael_Kapernaros: ?EFIORT 2I FORTIEs +78 125
#note Had a few better-scoring plays here with DROVER or FOPS.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIS 1H AI +11 63
>Michael_Kapernaros: DIJOSTU M6 JUDOIST +78 203
#note I almost attempted KAURYS* since I knew he was holding an s.
>Joshua_Sokol: AISTV 13I VITAS +56 119
#note Michael's first phony of the game. I thought it was perfectly valid too...
>Michael_Kapernaros: GLLRRRR -GLLRRR +0 203
#note Showed him this rack before exchanging... We weren't taking the game that seriously.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABCMOT 11G COMBAT. +26 145
>Michael_Kapernaros: DFNORTX M1 F.X +44 247
>Joshua_Sokol: CEPRRU O2 .PRUCER +33 178
>Michael_Kapernaros: DNNNORT J1 D.N +8 255
#note After I played this I noted how stupid it was.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEL G1 LEE +9 187
>Michael_Kapernaros: ILNNORT 4D NITRO +16 271
#note My play is 4th in the regular 4-ply sim, and I guess I understand why ONLINE 2B, ONLINE 3B and INTONE 2B are ahead. When I infer a blank, NITRO still does just as well, but ONLIN(E) is still first. (V)OL(A)N(T) is interesting.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEINOU D2 bU.IONED +59 246
#note When he played this I held for around 30 seconds. I saw UNJOINED so I thought that maybe he was trying to fool me. Phony number 2.
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEILNNT E4 .N +8 279
#note Looking at the sim I agree that my play isn't at the very top. I didn't see T(I)NEAL or (I)NNATE E3 and E4, but they score more than enough for me to have played them. I just hadn't seen anything that scored enough and left me with enough equity for me to play them confidently. 
>Joshua_Sokol: HMOR 8A HOM.R +30 276
#note Michael is obviously scared here, even more if he doesn't have the case S. I'm not sure what the right play would be
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEGILNT B2 LEGATI.N +72 351
#note METALING wins most, but I don't know that.
>Joshua_Sokol: ENW A1 NEW +25 301
#note He's running out of time here.
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEGIWYZ 2D .IZ. +32 383
#note This is by 3rd best win, only bettered by A8 HEW and A5 ZA, apparently. I think I should just play HEW since I don't know what wins he has or doesn't have.
>Joshua_Sokol: Q E1 Q. +11 312
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEEGIWY 9D .EWY +17 400
#note Cool, I made the best play.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEGLLS 10K BA.L +14 326
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEGI I13 .EG +7 407
#note Well now I made a terrible play to compliment my good DEWY play.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGLS 15H E.GS +18 344
#note At least he didn't have time to see his outs...
>Michael_Kapernaros: AI A7 A.I +10 417
>Michael_Kapernaros:  (L) +2 419
