>Benjy: AIJPRTY A8 TYP. +27 75
#note Benjy went into the tank hard on this one. I like JIAO here, PRTY isn't a great bingo leave but it is a synergistic scoring leave and AIJR completely relies on drawing an E to be useful at all, and I might block the B (JIBER) which would be really bad news.

>Benjy: EIJR C9 JI.ER +44 119
>Will: DEHIVWX 4G WHI.ED +34 218
#note WITHED exposes the E as a through-tile but sets up VOX 3G, which is worth going for - good score and great board-closingness.

>Will: ACEHLVX 5A HALVE +35 253
#note The C will play at A4 to the H after HALVE a lot of the time.

>Will: ?ACEIIO C2 CEI.I +25 351
#note The vowel imbalance is not so bad as to keep AO? over CE? - AIOLI is best. Honorable mention to IOTA which keeps the G open and leaves an I with a ton of Ns to draw.
