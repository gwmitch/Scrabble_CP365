#note Sim says tack the L on now, and that practically any other P word aside from PINNA is better. PINNA does hook pretty easily, but I fail to see why it's so amazingly horrible.  Also, what about exchange N?

#note Faking a lane and fishing for HYENA N10 which scores kind of bingoishly#. I imagined Matthew playing something very light-hitting alow row 4 with AGO or EGO to block, after which HYENA brings me nearly even. Also could just play A12 HI or the nuttier N2 HI. Not much point to DIURON that I can see, the H doesn't go well with BHV in the pool (and the W, at least for bingoing), and I'd be drawing 5 tiles afterwards so I'll probably get one of those - also simple plays along row 4 make it impossible for me to bingo and I lose the N10 scoring chance.

#note Incidentally, this is why I should play AREIC on the AREA turn - lots of plays like this/HYENA, WYTED/WYTES, BYTES, etc. would have scored a ton. AREIC guards against that.
