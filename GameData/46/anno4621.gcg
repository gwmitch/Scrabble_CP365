#note SIDH scores one more point in the same spot.
>Dave: ?AEEJNO 9C JOE +24 48
>Joey: ADERSTZ D8 BORTZ +32 55
#note Probably a mistake.  I didn't like 6H ADZ because his last play indicated that he had an E.  ZEDS looks like the star play because it scores a lot and deadens the board.

>Dave: ACEERTU G1 CURETTAGE +65 227
#note Except that it gave him this.  He told me that Jerry Lerman taught, er, played this against him once before.
>Joey: BHIMNTU 1D BUTCH +45 181
#note If only I had the K instead of a B.  Mmmm...donut holes.
