>Evan_Berofsky: BGIITUX 8G XU +18 18
>Jason_Idalski: GLLMMOS 7E GLOM +22 22
>Evan_Berofsky: BDEGIIT E4 BIG.IE +20 38

#note Evan's throwing a vowel out there prevents an exchange, though you can make an argument I should've anyway.
>Evan_Berofsky: ADEFOTT D1 FETA. +32 70
>Jason_Idalski: BCDLNSS 2B BL.ND +24 52
#note Evan's throwing a vowel out there not only prevents an exchange, but allows me to score decently.
>Evan_Berofsky: DINOTUY D9 DUTY +19 89
>Jason_Idalski: CENQRSS -QCR +0 52
#note ERSS is a slightly better leave, but I thought this was better because of the five unseen R's vs. three unseen N's. I think sometimes I focus on stuff like that too much when deciding on a keep while exchanging. (-4)
>Evan_Berofsky: EHINOOS 3A HOO. +22 111
>Jason_Idalski: AEINPSS 1F ASPINES +83 135
>Jason_Idalski: AEINPSS --  -83 52
#note Evan gave me a little grief about this one Sunday night and Monday morning, but I swear it sounded familiar. It is ASPINES#, so maybe I saw Bowman play it on ISC or something. Of course, if I keep ERSS last turn, I have (T)RAIPSES as a double-double. Live and learn. (-34)
>Evan_Berofsky: EEINRSV 1F ENVIERS +86 197
#note It really gets away from me in a hurry.
>Jason_Idalski: AEINPSS 10B PA.SE +26 78
#note I miss S(T)EAPSIN, which my annotator saw the whole time. Le sigh... (-27)
>Evan_Berofsky: EIRRRTT A3 .ITTER +30 227
>Jason_Idalski: AEIKNOS L1 .OAK +16 94
#note KA, 1A. (-11)
>Evan_Berofsky: EEORRVW 11F REWOVE +26 253

>Jason_Idalski: EIINNSW L9 WINE +27 149
>Evan_Berofsky: ACDEORR 13G CORRADE +87 384
#note Can I resign? Actually, I can, but as Rose Nylund said: "They have a name for people who quit. They call them quitters!"
>Jason_Idalski: AGINNOS C12 ANON +13 162
#note Again, spreadless Scrabble. My only winning path looks like it includes a trip-trip, so here goes. Although, I think AGIN here or NOG at 14M is better. Sim says AGIN wins very rarely. (-22)
>Evan_Berofsky: AAAEFOU 15A FA.O +24 408
>Jason_Idalski: ADGIRSZ 6H ADZ +38 200
#note I figured at this point it was time to just play fast/save energy and try to stop this game from getting into Total Scrabble for biggest spread in one game. (-10)
>Evan_Berofsky: ?AAESUY K5 YEA +26 434
>Jason_Idalski: GIIRSTT 8L TRIG +29 229
#note Why are you still viewing this game? Have you really nothing better to do? :) (-15, to (P)IG at B10)
>Evan_Berofsky: ??ACESU O8 .AUChESt +77 511
#note Evan commented that I blocked his trip-trip (aww...), but m(I)SCAUsE* is phony, so I really ended up just screwing myself out of a free turn. :) Well played by Evan. Me, not so much.
