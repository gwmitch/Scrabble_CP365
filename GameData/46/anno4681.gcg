#note This is a really bad play, methinks. Gab said something along the lines of "lame bingos are allowed, right?" as he played RETAINER, to which I responded "not if they block my cooler bingos." I really wanted to play the word SELFDOM. So I kinda ignored better plays like FLOOD M5 and FORMS 4H that kept other tiles besides a blank on my rack. Oh well.

#note Wow. Look at what would happen if I played WHAP or WHAM at B10. He would have OXO for 54 right away -- KEEPING ZOEA? ON HIS RACK for two gargantuan ZOEA spots next turn, and I can't block both. That would have been absolutely disgusting. From my vantage point, though, POH and WHAP/WHAM are probably all wrong -- I should play WHOP in the same spot to unload an extra consonant. Oops.
>yako: ?AEOOXZ 2F ZOEA +69 259
#note Okay, so now what? He no longer has the monster X spot available, but he can play ZAXES for 112, burning the blank and keeping OO. He can play something like ZOOEY or ZOEAL, keeping the X to score more later. He can play ZOEA, keeping OX? and guaranteeing both a big X play and a blank to bingo with later. All of these seem like good routes back into the game. But the coolest play of all is ZONAE -- it scores 98, keeps OX, and gives him OX/AX/NOH for 41 next turn. Beautiful setup.

#note If he had made that ZONAE setup, I'd probably have played VAW and blocked it. Instead he opens a big M hook (MAW, MAWN, MAWS), but I miss it. Instead I take the G hook for six points less. Yuck.
>yako: ?OOX C12 OXO +25 284
#note And now the X scores significantly less. I have a shot at winning this game! But he still has a blank. Hmmph.

#note There's really nothing else even close, is there? Crappy rack, only one reasonable option, I guess.
