#description Jason Idalski plays Adam Logan in Round 5 at the 2009 CanAm
>Jason_Idalski: AHMORRY 8D HARRY +30 30
#note Didn't know HORARY, sim leader. ARMORY I do know, though. (-4)
>Adam_Logan: AEIIOST 9H OI +8 8
>Jason_Idalski: CFIMNOR 10B CONFIRM +80 110
#note I was thisclose to playing INFORM there just to muck things up. Then I look at my "C INFORM" rack and think to switch the vowels. The accidental genius strikes again. I then immediately play this for board configuration purposes, missing CONFIRM/C(HARRY) for 94. But, esp. given his last play, I think this placement has some merit. (-12)
>Adam_Logan: AEEISTZ E10 .AZE +32 40
#note Adam pointed out after the game that he missed Z(O)EAE.
>Jason_Idalski: EIPRTTW 12C WI. +30 140
#note Relieved it sims better than PE(E)WIT, the other play I considered. PEEWIT may prevent the minor disaster that's about to ensue.
>Adam_Logan: DEISSTX 14B EXIST +45 85
#note Well, he picked a great time to do that. PT may have been *the* worst two tiles to draw at this point.
>Jason_Idalski: EPPRTTT -PPTT +0 140
#note PET at 7C? Really? I mean, I guess I see PRTT being less than 15 points behind ERT, but I don't see how I can make that play. (-1)
>Adam_Logan: ?ADEINS 15F INStEAD +79 164
#note What a three-play momentum swing. And given the speed Adam and I made these plays at, the turnaround was as swift as it was stunning.
>Jason_Idalski: BEEFMRT 14K BERM +23 163
#note In the airport with Kenji on Monday, I notice him make a "WTF?" face and I see he's looking at this game. "Did I mess up?" I asked. "Well, yeah, but not here," Kenji said. Then he mentioned BERM, which I vigorously defended. That bottom left corner is so volatile, I felt like I had to create offsetting biggies. Maybe fancy-play syndrome. Sim likes EMBER, 14I. (-8)
>Adam_Logan: ?ADDOQV 13A ODA +37 201
>Jason_Idalski: EFLTTUV O13 VET +27 190
#note FUEL, silly. (-5)
>Adam_Logan: ?DNQUVW -DNVW +0 201
>Jason_Idalski: EEFLNTU 13L FE +21 211
#note WTH kind of word is TEENFUL? I then make a mediocre non-bingo play. FLUTE(R) (and why didn't I play that?) is better. (-40)
>Adam_Logan: ?LQTUUY G10 .ULY +11 212
>Jason_Idalski: AELNOTU L11 UN... +18 229
#note At least I had enough sense to not do what Tangredi did against Solomon at Nats and try OUTLEAN*. Sims best.
>Adam_Logan: ?AAQTTU 7C QUA +29 241
>Jason_Idalski: AAEKLOT B5 OKA +30 259
#note Unlike one of Kenji's opponents at Nats, I remember the QUA front hook. :)
>Adam_Logan: ?AELOTT J7 cALOTTE +61 302
#note ALlOTTE(R), F1. Unless he had a reason to pass on it that I don't know about.
>Jason_Idalski: ABDELPT A1 BALED +30 289
#note Adam wondered in the post-mortem if he should've made a more aggressive play, like mATELOT. Then it took him about two seconds to see that mATELOT gives up BALDP(A)TE/B(AA). Then I had to pretend that I actually would've seen that during the game. Close call between all the fives that go here. ADEPT is probably better. (-3)  
>Adam_Logan: EIOOSUW B1 OW +24 326
>Jason_Idalski: GIILPTT C3 PIG +17 306
#note As CeLe or Cheezy might say: "oink oink bark bark!" Seriously, however, I'm feeling this one start to slip away.
>Adam_Logan: EIORRSU A11 RO.SE +31 357
#note Argh! S, you showed up one turn late!
>Jason_Idalski: EIJLSTT D2 JET +28 334
#note I'm seeing a ray of hope. If I can find one of the two E's (or even the A), I might be able to bingo in time. (This is when Kenji had his puzzled look viewing the game. I wondered what about JET he'd dislike, but it's Adam's ensuing play that has him vexed. What would you do in his spot?)
>Adam_Logan: CIINORU 8J .NURIC +27 384
#note I like this play. CP seems to prefer UNI(t) or ION at E1 (I ran CP three times), but this has a solid 75+% win chance. And considering that even if I bingo, my three tiles will be from a bag of DEGHNNPV, Adam's chances to win have to be at least 80% here.
>Jason_Idalski: AEGILST O3 GESTI.AL +62 396
#note Considered (J)IG to set up the case A, then saw how drecky the pool was and how almost nothing I'd draw would bingo there. CP likes (BO)G a little better, but there's a lot of instances where I'll be really hard-pressed to bingo after his response.
>Adam_Logan: DHINNOV 4L DIV. +16 400
#note Then I had to wait nine minutes and hope he didn't have some brilliant endgame he could pull out of thin air. Lucky he pulled DHNNV and left EGP. Although it's his own fault for giving a Michigan player a C to bingo through. :) Naturally, this is best.
>Jason_Idalski: EGP F6 PE. +25 421
#note *1*-15 vs. World/Nats/CNSC champs. Take that! (It was starting to become a mental block, too.)
>Adam_Logan: HNNO 3K NOH +25 425
>Jason_Idalski: G 1A ..G +6 427
#note Missed the 7-pointer he created. 2-3 and now my sea legs are firmly under me. And how I beat Logan drawing 2/10 power tiles, with the mistakes I made, I'll never understand.
>Jason_Idalski:  (N) +2 429
