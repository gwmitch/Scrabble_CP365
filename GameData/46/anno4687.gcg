>Jason_Idalski: CEOORUY 8H COOEY +28 28
#note (In the game posted on Chew's site, this rack mistakenly had eight tiles, including an extra O.)
>Chris_Sykes: ?DEENPT K5 rEP.NTED +90 90
#note I think I heard Chris mumble "sorry" as he put this down. Probably the first time I've ever heard an opponent apologize on the opening turn.
>Jason_Idalski: AEIORTU 12I AU.IO +12 40
#note Or (D)UO or U(D)O. Leads in valuation.
>Chris_Sykes: AFIJNQU 6J J.AN +27 117
>Jason_Idalski: AEEIRTW 9I WI.E +27 67
#note Ugh. I know I shouldn't dwell on it, but I feel like I had a lot of bingos blocked this weekend, esp. early in games. Ah well. Just gotta keep making my best play.
>Chris_Sykes: EFHIOQU 13E FIQUE +31 148
>Jason_Idalski: AEORSTU F8 SAUTO.RE +62 129
#note Here's a sign it might be my game: I actually picked the "right" bingo here, according to Duck.
>Chris_Sykes: EEHKMOR 15D ME.KER +45 193
>Jason_Idalski: CDEMNRV M9 DEM.N +31 160
#note First mistake comes on turn five, but it's big and stupid. DEVON instead is way better. Hated that the E was my only vowel with only three left. (-10)
>Chris_Sykes: GHHNNOU N10 HO +30 223
>Jason_Idalski: CIRRSTV O11 CRITS +31 191
>Chris_Sykes: AAGHNNU 11B GAUN. +12 235
#note UNHAN(G), M2.
>Jason_Idalski: ?AORTVZ 8A ViZOR. +54 245
#note Good news: Correct to burn the blank here. Bad news: Missed mATZO(S). At least this is second. I'm such a goy... (-10)
>Chris_Sykes: AADHILN 9B DAH +27 262
>Jason_Idalski: AIRTTXY M3 TYI. +14 259
#note Ugh. No real great options on this ugly board, so naturally I made a bad play. (A)RTY leads sim, T(OW)Y second. This is way down. (-5)
>Chris_Sykes: AEILNSV E1 INSLAVE. +72 334
>Chris_Sykes: AEILNSV --  -72 262
>Jason_Idalski: AGILRTX C11 .XIL +22 281
#note The static leader of GLIA at L1 is now out. Inputting Chris' rack, Duck gives G(Y)RI a slight edge. (-1)
>Chris_Sykes: AEILNSV B13 LAV +18 280
>Jason_Idalski: ABGRRST L1 GRAB +34 315
#note Even with Chris' SINE leave, best by a lot.
>Chris_Sykes: EIIINOS -IIO +0 280
#note Well, last game the bag saw fit to punish me after phonying. Why shouldn't it work both ways? :)
>Jason_Idalski: AEGPRST 1J TA.GER +24 339
#note Tough call. Speedy's choices fish, but my lead/the board/Chris' tiles aren't conducive to turning this game into a race for the bingo. Took a long time on this, and I think I made the right decision. Even with Chris' leave, P(OW) leads valuation, with (TYIN)G not far behind. (-9)
>Chris_Sykes: AEINSTW 3E ANTISWE.. +64 344
#note Nice "find" by Chris. Let go because I had the sure win keeping it on.
>Jason_Idalski: BILLNPS 4A BLIPS +26 365
#note I had the score as 339-334 after ANTISWEAT*. I have BLIPS for 26 putting me up 31, guaranteed outs, and there's no way he's scoring 31, much less netting it. Except that I notice when confirming the score after releasing that I'm down five, not up five. I briefly wondered if that silly mental error would doom me, but fortunately it didn't. Best.
>Chris_Sykes: DEFIOO B1 FOO.ED +28 372
#note Best.
>Jason_Idalski: LN C3 N.L +12 377
#note A couple mistakes, but on the whole I feel like I deserved this one, as opposed to the bag just giving it to me.
>Jason_Idalski:  (I) +2 379
