#note The Quack slightly prefers keeping DILS. I guess I don't know anything about exchanges because I have no idea why.

#note JOG wins the sim, but I really don't think it's better. I like leaving JOG for next turn, scoring a bit more and preventing an early board lockdown...

#note Quack says WOW/WE is better. I WTFed at first, but after discussing it with Rafi, he found out that it's possible for me to bingo from the P with HALF the remaining tiles, and other bingos otherwise through different letters on the board. Pretty cool!
>Rafi: EOSTUVY 6E .EVOUT +14 251
#note Rafi mentioned that while IVY sims higher than DEVOUT, he preferred DEVOUT since it blocked a lot of lanes compared to IVY, and allows him 3 more chances to draw the blank compared to IVY. Both plays allow him to keep the S for hooking WAN, too.

#note Was debating between this and MATINEE for a long time. I think ANTIMERE is better, and the duck agrees.

#note So ends a sweet game. I don't even care that I lost...nice to know once in a while I play well. My opp just happened to do better, haha - besides DEVOUT, every one of his plays simmed highest!
