>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: CEOOOTV 8D COVET +26 26
>Jason_Idalski: EIKNRUU -KUU +0 0
#note I'm not convinced KU(E) is better. (-1)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ?EFIOOY 9G FOY +28 54
>Jason_Idalski: AEIILNR D3 IRENI.AL +70 70
#note "Nice exchange," comments Robin.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ?AEIMOO C3 MOO +22 76
>Jason_Idalski: AINNOUU -AINNOUU +0 70
#note Three turns in and I've already put four U's back in this stupid bag. Six exchanges in three-plus games. My patience is already wearing thin. (Duck likes keeping N or AN better.) (-1)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ?AEGIIU 10B IG.U +7 83
#note Robin put it down, picked it up, said "exchange seven" to herself, and put it back down.
>Jason_Idalski: ADDLLTW 10H WALL +20 90
#note DAWT instead. Must've been frustration ... I start playing really stupid from here on. (-5)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ?AEINSY K4 SNEAkI.Y +90 173
#note I hate Scrabble.
>Jason_Idalski: ADDEOST L11 OD +11 101
#note Should've just taken the points and done it at J5. (-4)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ABIRTWZ 13K WAB +20 193
#note BRAIZ(E), 6F.
>Jason_Idalski: ADDEIST J5 ID +16 117
#note I have never hated D's as much as at this moment. I'm 0-3 about to be 0-4. 0-4 with Logan next, on top of it. Pictured the look on PZ's face should I text him saying I got swept. Felt like I was proving those who thought I didn't belong right. I felt lower than the rent on a burning building.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: CIMRTVZ B9 V.CTIM +26 219
#note Naturally, Robin voiced her displeasure in the post-mortem. She pointed to this clunky rack as to how it started. She got to score 26 and go up 102 with the "zed" in hand! My heart bleeds.
>Jason_Idalski: ADESSTT 15A TSADE +38 155
#note My annotator saw the bingo. Lesson No. 1 in how 1800s can have dipsh*t moments. At least it took 3 1/2 games to get to the first bingo miss. Robin probably thought I was an idiot for the fish, fish, TSADE for 38 sequence, but this is the best non-bingo and doesn't sim horribly behind the bingo. (-14)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: EFORRRZ L1 ZERO +50 269
#note grrr...
>Jason_Idalski: EJOPRST 2J JE.PS +60 215
#note My frantic mind (don't ask why it was frantic despite plenty of time on my clock) went: "Crap! No Z play! Wait, JEEPS through the E! Wait, is PROJETS good? I'm not sure. Better play it safe and block the Z." Bzzt! "Grob tally" up to two. (-27)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: DEFQRRU 13A F.QUE +34 303
>Jason_Idalski: ?AAAORT 1K A.O +18 233
#note Three bingo misses in three turns. TAmARAO? (-11)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AADKRRT -AAKRT +0 303
#note WTH didn't she play DAK? Staticly, this is 25 points behind. (The more I think about this play, the more I think this may be a case of the game enterer misreading Robin's handwriting. Perhaps AADRRRT instead? I'm befuddled.)
>Jason_Idalski: ?AANPRT M5 sPARTAN +66 299
#note I knew I had better bingos. My brain refused to find them. Heck, I knew there were multiple anagrams to SPARTAN and couldn't remember any of the three. PlANTAR at B1 is cool. (-12)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: DEILORT N10 DIT +22 325
#note (Scored as 23.)
>Jason_Idalski: BEHINSX 11E HEX +36 335
#note HEX at 14L (gutsy, methinks) or IBEX at O12. (-7)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: EIKLNOR O7 KINO +28 353
>Jason_Idalski: BEINNSU 14F BUNNIES +77 412
#note When I drew what I did and knew I'd be guaranteed to bingo, I had to stifle a sigh of relief that would've been heard in Wyoming. Hands were shaking as I played this, excited to finally be on the board.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AEEGLRR H12 RA.G +18 371
#note Not only does Robin's bingo not play, but she commented that she couldn't even go out in two.
>Jason_Idalski: EGHRTU B4 THUG +19 431
#note ERG at 2D, nine better.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: EELR E4 ERE +26 397
#note I unthinkingly uttered "good game" after it was over, to which Robin snapped "No, it wasn't." Well, then.
>Jason_Idalski: ER N6 ER +17 448
#note Robin commented that she had me mistracked, but her previous play is still correct. Whew. Just whew.
>Jason_Idalski:  (L) +2 450
