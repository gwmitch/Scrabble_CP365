>Jason_Idalski: BDEINRT -B +0 0

>Max_Panitch: AABBENV 12H VAN.A +26 128
>Jason_Idalski: ?EGGRTU H12 .UGG +27 139
#note Saw (S)TRUGGlE, it was blocked, played this quickly. Didn't know dRUGGET(S) or GURGlET(S). Figured this would be fairly close to any bingo to the S. (-14)
>Max_Panitch: BBEEINO 7G BOB +22 150
>Jason_Idalski: ?AEPRTW 6F PAW +24 163
#note This is how bad a shape I was in; I thought I might be missing WiRETAP at 6B ... could not remember if POS* was good or not. But, I end up making the best play; better than TAPEW(O)Rm.

>Jason_Idalski: ADEHILU 1E HALIDE +35 413
#note Wanted to turn over and score, so chose this over HULA. Then saw it set up the X bomb ... I should've picked it up and re-thought. Just tired and lazy. AUDILE is the sim leader. (-10)
>Max_Panitch: ILMOTXY 2D MIX +58 374
#note Rightly whacked. This game is back in doubt.
>Jason_Idalski: ?AEIOOU D2 .IAOU +14 427
#note Oy. If I don't draw the blank here, I probably lose. The E9 placement is preferred by Duck. (-5)
>Max_Panitch: EKLORTY 8A YOK +36 410
#note Gosh, Max deserved to win more than I did. He played this near-perfect.
>Jason_Idalski: ?EEORUY 2B RE... +28 455
#note Now I've got to block the 3/8 chance he has ROTTENL(Y). One of the guaranteed wins; though OUR(I)E is better for spread's sake. (-11)
>Max_Panitch: ELNRTTT 3C L.TER +32 442
>Jason_Idalski: ?EOOUY 7B YO +19 474
#note pOYOU/p(REMIX) is 10 better.
>Max_Panitch: NTT 13L T.NT +6 448
#note One of those games where "deserve's got nothin' to do with it." Max played well, me mediocrely, but I drew better.
>Max_Panitch:  (EOU?) +6 454
