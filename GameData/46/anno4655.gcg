#description Jason Idalski vs Tony Leah in Round 1 at the 2009 CanAm
>Jason_Idalski: DEILMNN 8D MINED +22 22
#note Saw MILDEN, liked it better than LIMNED (also good) ... but still chickened out because I didn't want to start the tourney by having a phony challenged off. So, I start inauspiciously this way instead. After the tourney, hanging in the airport, I knew Kenji was looking at this game when he said: "Now now, don't play MINED." (-4)
>Tony_Leah: CDEGHJW F6 WE.CH +29 29
>Jason_Idalski: AELMNNU 7C LUM.N +20 42
#note Tough call. This and UL(E)MA are simming super-tight. UN(C)LE and UN(C)LEAN are worth consideration, too.
>Tony_Leah: DGIIJOS E10 OI +9 38
#note Needless to say, the range of leave I put Tony on here was far different than what he actually had.
>Jason_Idalski: AAAEINO -AAAIO +0 42
#note Quackle, I'm not playing NAOI or AWA. Just show me the best exchange. This is fifth behind those two plays, keeping AEN (yeah, it worked so well last time) and keeping EIN, but I thought this was one of my few clear-cut calls of the game. (-3)
>Tony_Leah: ADGIJST 6B JAG +35 73
>Jason_Idalski: EGIINOR G10 OI +8 50
#note Or at D11, ever-so-slightly preferred by Duck.
>Tony_Leah: DFINOST H11 FONDS +35 108
>Jason_Idalski: EGILNRU 14F IN.ULGER +64 114
>Tony_Leah: AHIITYZ 13L HAZY +47 155
>Jason_Idalski: EELLRSU 15L REEL +25 139
#note Torn between the only three plays: SUREL(Y), L(Y)RE and this. I dismissed SUREL(Y) first to keep the S and then decided on turnover. Duck is similarly conflicted; all three plays sim closely.
>Tony_Leah: CDIIORT D10 COIR +23 178
#note IDIOC(Y), O8.
>Jason_Idalski: AALQSUV J9 SQUAL. +35 174
#note QUAS(HER). Didn't see it, would've doubted myself if I had. (-6)
>Tony_Leah: ADINTTU O8 UNTID. +36 214
>Jason_Idalski: AAAFTVV L10 FAT... +24 198
#note Yet another "I don't know what to do" play. But Duck agrees.
>Tony_Leah: ABEETTX 8A EXA..... +57 271
#note Rightly whacked for the opening rack mistake.
>Jason_Idalski: AANOPVV 13B PA.VO +22 220
#note I have officially started "g**d***it, I want better tiles" mode. PAVAN at M7 may be a little better.
>Tony_Leah: ABBETTY M9 BEY +21 292
>Jason_Idalski: AGNORRV 14A VAR +22 242
>Tony_Leah: ABEIPTT 15B TEPA +17 309
#note Where in blazes *are* these power tiles?
>Jason_Idalski: EGNORTW N4 GROWN +13 255
#note No freaking clue, again. Slightly best in sim, but TWO/O(BEY) kicks butt in valuation. And CP says it wins about 20%, nothing else above 15. Depending on the draw, given Tony's limited replies, TWO might win this game. (-10)
>Tony_Leah: BEIIOTT 5I BITTE. +16 325
#note BITTIE(R) is probably way better. Tony said he debated between BIO(G) and this. BIO(G) would've worked out way better for me, as I can still play ATOmISE(R), only for more points. Of course, BITTIE(R) works out way better for me, too. grrr...
>Jason_Idalski: ?AEIOST 4E ISOlATE +64 319
#note Yeah, this can't win. But I saw no wins by fishing, unless the bag is like ?S. After working for about five good minutes, Duck says (FE)E(T) is the only play with any chance, winning 1/72 of the time, meaning I have to pull a specific tile (prolly the blank), and hope Tony's rack is the seven worst of the eight unseen tiles. (N)O at G14 is valuation leader. (-25)
>Tony_Leah: ?DEEIOR 3B ROIlED +24 349
#note Tony saw OREIDEs at 3A was possible in Collins, since it makes DI#. REOIlED and EmEROID played at 3C or 3A.
>Jason_Idalski: KS I3 K..S +15 334
#note On the whole, I'm pleased with how I played this one. But, maybe could've won by playing MILDEN to open.
>Jason_Idalski:  (E) +2 336
