#note meow is better, i think i made this move in like a second. focus cesar. (-4)
>Joe: ILNOPT J6 PONTIL +25 25
>Cesar: EEGHLSV 7F VEG +16 32
#note focus and look a little harder, K2 HELVE and i have the S? it's too close to tel anyway.
>Joe: BPU 9F PUB +20 45
>Cesar: AEEHILS K5 HIE +18 50
#note i'm certainly intimidated but i resolve to try my best.
>Joe: CGLO L3 CLOG +25 70
#note misscored as 24
>Cesar: AAAEELS 10C ALAE +12 62
#note a minor setback, but vowel dump tiem. however 11I ALAE is much better. blah. (-5)

#note edley spent a lot of time on this move, during which i was convinced he was going to take the T spot at the bottom and was crossing my fingers hard that he wouldn't...
>Cesar: AGINRRY 8A GRI.Y +33 161
#note and then, after 4 minutes of salivating over TARRYING, my brain suddenly blanks out. hold on a second, am i making that word up? tarrying? why do i want to play it so bad? aha! check if tarried is good. TARDIER.. TARRIED? does TARDIER have an anagram? crap! i would have laid this down in a heartbeat in club. but suddenly i don't think tarried is a word.... is tarry a verb?? argh! (-52)

>Cesar: ACEENRY 14B RE.AY +32 193
#note i missed that spot again, 11B CAKY. throughout all these games there is an innate impatience that isn't there in my early games. i can't do this at these long tournaments anymore. (-5)

#note pretty rotten. i thought i needed to bingo right away but 3I NONCE has the beautiful J setup, another thing i need to work on. (-11)

>Cesar: AEERSUZ 1L ZE.. +23 295
#note J2 ZA seems winningest, but it's close to A6 AUGER or ARGUE. everything is moving around. i really had no idea what to do. obviously argue and auger are wrong because all he has to do then is close the remaining lane - i could draw the blank and use it as an M i guess, lol. (-2)
>Joe: FO I13 OF +14 337
#note this was an interesting move, and i kind of thought he might not have the blank at this point, he also spent quite a while on it.
>Cesar: AAERSTU I2 U.EA +7 302
#note i sort of need a miracle. quackle is again being kind of silly with 13F AUTO, as joe just closes the remaining lane .. i do have ALT- or something of the sort maybe. i could not see any way to fish two while opening a new lane, except for VAU - which seems to be a difficult to use lane, but it's probably better than my move. it sims very close to AUTO. (-2.5%)
