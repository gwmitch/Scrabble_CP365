#note Thought about this long and hard and felt that the obvious BY left me too many consonants, and it would be easier to clean the rack out now rather than have to take 2 more turns to do so, especially if I had another low-probability draw.  Quackle prefers BY 8G and says my choice costs me roughly 2% winning chances.

#note Glad I found the bingo but this draw (AEEU) was an ominous portent for how the game would progress.  Interesting learning point from this position:  Quackle says the best play is EAU 9G, passing up the bingo.  From the standpoint of the board I can see the strength of the recommended play; if Max doesn't have a B he probably won't score well, and anything he does put down will open up the board for my probable bingo.  But I'd have never guessed that the best play would have been to pass up 42 more points just to not hot spots at F10 and H12.

#note When my first 4 tiles came out of the bag as AERS, I was thinking that I was drawing another bingo.  When I saw the completed rack, it took me minutes to figure out what to do.  I saw the obvious hot spot at 12H, but the only things I saw there were REAR or SEAR, and I was concerned that an RSS or RRS leave would leave me with no viable options on the following turn.  I elected to go for volatility with the hope that a good draw to ARS could yield any number of bingos in rows 3 or 4 that would counter his probable comeback play at H12.  Quackle's preference was ARRAS H8 14, and this would have definitely been the best choice had I known it.

#note Yet another duplicated rack despite having drawn to unique tiles.  I had certainly hoped to get more than 50 pts from 2 s's, but when I saw I could clear the rack and get 27 pts in the process, I felt I had to take this play.  Quackle agrees.

#note Yet another duplicated rack.  Didn't see AEON H12, which is the best play.  This play sims second best to AEON.

>Jim_Burlant: CEEGNOV D12 COVE +34 171
#note Too bad there was no R to play through.  This was by far the best play; none of the other choices come close.

>Jim_Burlant: EEEEGNN 5J .ENEGE +24 195
#note This was starting to drain me,  with every rack containing 2 pair or 3 of a kind (or worse) despite not leaving myself duplicates on any turn, and many of the choices weren't easy to find.  I wasn't thrilled about putting an E into a triple-triple again but I didn't know the hook necessary to make the play of NENE H12, which is the best play.  RENEGE is still a strong play that scores reasonably well and does a great job of clearing out a seemingly hopeless rack.

#note Again, not knowing the back-hook to CODE limited my options here.  The BIMN leave didn't thrill me but I figured that the AREA back-hook needed to be taken out.  This is one of only two plays that sims at > 50% winning chances, though it is significantly weaker than NEVI H12.

#note Was too intent on keeping the T (a bad idea given this tile pool) to even consider plays that shed the T.  Thus, I didn't look anywhere else once I saw this play.  BLITZED 3E sims best.  This play still does well, as it is still one of only 3 plays that exceeds 50% winning chances.

#note Best play, nothing else comes even close.

#note Awkward draw causes a so-so play.  Saw the row 14 plays but didn't like the idea of putting anything in row 14 where an unseen blank could have burned me.  Making this play, I cringed at the thought of keeping 2 u's but couldn't find anything better. Amazingly, the simple dump of LULU 5B 8 sims 2nd best in a 3-ply sim, in a statistical dead heat with 14M HUT 21, which is the best play. 
>Max_Dwyer: DET H12 D.ET +32 316
>Jim_Burlant: ?CILUUW 15F CU. +5 338
#note Seemingly weak play yet it still sims in top 5 choices for a 3-ply sim.  Was initially going to play WILe 14J but my gut said it wasn't the right time to cash the blank.

>Jim_Burlant: ?EILNUW 14J WILEs +58 396
#note Opponent told me after the game that he didn't want to open up the triple for me, but my having the blank made this a moot point.  I didn't know the bingo in this rack; in any event I was glad I had not cashed the blank on the previous turn.
