>Max_Panitch: ?ADEEIT 8C IDEATEd +68 68
>Jason_Idalski: AAEEINR D4 AIRE. +12 12
#note Maybe AE, but only because I have a T and D to play through. AEINR's such a "siren leave." (-8)
>Max_Panitch: CIINOUU 6C U.IC +12 80
>Jason_Idalski: AEFLNRS E5 F.L. +26 38
#note FINE instead. Wouldn't have guessed AELRS > AENRS. (-3)
>Max_Panitch: IINOTUW 3D WINO +18 98
>Jason_Idalski: AEMNPRS H6 PR.NAMES +63 101
#note Or SP(E)ARMEN.
>Max_Panitch: AEIOSTU 11E ATO.ISE +36 134
#note Good thing I didn't play SPEARMEN.
>Jason_Idalski: ?GHOOVZ 12K HOG +19 120
#note Sims a shade behind Z(O)O at G10, although both pass up perhaps my only chance ever to play (S)OVkHOZ. (-1)
>Max_Panitch: EIINOOU M9 NOO.IE +16 150
>Jason_Idalski: ?EEOOVZ L6 OOZE +25 145
#note 10L's a better spot. (-10)
>Max_Panitch: ADILNQU 12A QUAIL +50 200
>Jason_Idalski: ?EFIMSV 14J FIV.S +38 183
>Max_Panitch: DEENNTU 15G DUNE +20 220
>Jason_Idalski: ?AEMOTY N10 MY +28 211
#note I'd vaguely recall hearing/seeing aTEMOYA before, but I doubt I find it even on my best days. When I saw this rack, I figured there was something, but my brain was past anagramming by this point. Probably the best leave with only eight unseen vowels. (-24)
>Max_Panitch: EJLNNRT 6J JE.N +27 247
>Jason_Idalski: ?AEGOTW O4 TOWAGEs +87 298
#note When I saw the W first, I thought "aww ... G!" To again borrow from TMQ: "And yea, verily, it came to pass."
>Max_Panitch: AILNRTV B10 VA.LT +32 279
>Jason_Idalski: BCEEHUY 2G YUCH +25 323
#note Yeah, BYE. My brain was trying to convince me VAULTY was bad and I shouldn't play it. Bad brain... CHUB at N2 also does a nice job of blocking. This is pretty mediocre defense. (-14)
>Max_Panitch: ABINRRX H1 X. +27 306
>Jason_Idalski: BDEERRS 4G BREEDS +28 351
#note Since I have the case S, BREED instead is probably better. (-3)
>Max_Panitch: ABGINRR 1J ARBING +41 347
#note I let two phonies go this tourney; both because they were desperation plays by my opponent and I had a sure win keeping them on. Max and I post-mortem; my annotator looks up ARBING and confirms it's phony. I go up to deposit the winner's slip, and when I come back Nathan Benedict points to the board and says "ARBING* is phony." Thank you! At least he didn't say "who kept ARBING* on?" or something like that. :)
>Jason_Idalski: ADKLPRT G10 K.P +19 370
>Max_Panitch: RT E5 ....R +8 355
>Jason_Idalski: ADLRT 10G ..TA +16 386
#note TRAD or DRAT, B4. Limped home, but I at least limped home winning. (-5)
>Max_Panitch: T 12G ..T +8 363
#note Sorry Max and other members of the Canadian team had a rough go. On the whole, my opponents definitely played better than I.
>Max_Panitch:  (DLR) +8 371
