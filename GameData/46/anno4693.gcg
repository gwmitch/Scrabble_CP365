>James_C: AFNPRUV F8 .UV +15 63
#note should've taken the B6 spot with VAN.  I remember taking a while on this move.  I wanted to rid the UV but the AFNPR leave isn't that much better than FPRU.
>bryan: BCO 6B COB +24 57
>James_C: AEEFNPR 9H EF +12 75
#note Much better at C9 playing FE according to Q, but I thought this play gave me a couple of extra lines.
>bryan: ??ADRSS K5 DASheRS +89 146
>James_C: ABENPRR C2 BARR.. +22 97
#note this or L1 BARREN which is a bit too racy even for me

#note nice to get both a J and a Q two-wayer
>bryan: AUV 11H VAU. +7 198
>James_C: AEHNOSX D2 AXE +42 273
#note Q likes 4L EXON. Again too racy for my blood.
>bryan: DIKR N3 DIRK +35 233
>James_C: HMNOOSS 8K .OMOS +21 294
#note probably a mistake.  11b HOMOS or NOMOS is better.  I wanted to prevent an O column play but that thinking might be a bit too defensive.
>bryan: EEGR H11 .ERGE +30 263
>James_C: AEHNSTT L1 TA.H. +22 316
#note spent ages on this.  Q prefers M4 H(I)T. I don't mind this, it really opens it up with a fairly nice tile pool where I feel that my potential to score is still good. Perhaps too aggressive but it's only simming 4-5% worse.
