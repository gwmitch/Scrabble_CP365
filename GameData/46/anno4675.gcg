>Max_Karten: DER 13A RED +18 398
#note final score 408-404, win for the 401. good thing i dont add up my opp's plays. good thing she didnt ask for a recount. good thing that after when i added this 380 + 8 instead of 18, and had myself losing by 6 instead of winning by 4, she didnt sign and hand the slip in before i realized. i actually filled out the slip and signed it and put it on her side of the table and realized while it was sitting there what i did. i kinda grabbed it and tore it up quickly and filled out a new one, she was fine with it. she said "im relieved, now i get to go back down to where i have a chance at winning". she wasnt so amicable when she realized how badly she misscored DEPiCTS while smoking a cig and came back in the room, took the tiles out of the square, set it back up, and started counting it and swearing. i told her if there was something that could be done to change it i would but its too late cause the slip was already entered into the cpu. the director told her the same thing. works for me.
