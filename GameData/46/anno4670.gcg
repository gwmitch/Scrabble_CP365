>Pete: EGKLPRV 8G PERV +18 18
#note Duck likes the exchanges to ELP EPR and ELPR, and VEG 8G all about as well as this play.  It's a jusgment call, and Stand by my play here.  What would you do on this rack?
>Chuck_Armstrong: EOW 7G OWE +21 21
>Pete: BEGKLSU K3 KLUGES +32 50
#note I go for points, duck says keep the S with BULK or BUGLE.  In my defense, I feel exhausted.  At this point, I'm taking way too long on plays, and generally my mind has faded a bit from earlier in the day.  This game will be about mental toughness.  
>Chuck_Armstrong: IIIII -IIIII +0 21
#note Chuck exchanges 5.
>Pete: ABIOOQS 3K .OBO +20 70
#note Best.  any other play seemed just wrong, and the Q didn't seem too scary yet.
>Chuck_Armstrong: PTTU 9E PUTT +19 40
>Pete: AIQRRTZ 4K .IAR +18 88
#note This may have been the most interesting position of the game, and I of course took 5 minutes on it, and blew it.  I didn't like the Z plays; they all seemed to give up more than I liked.  QUIRT now seems obvious, even with the S hook.  LIAR just asks for trouble next turn.  I considered the hyper agressive QUART to try a fun set up, but it was just too easy to use, and I was feeling a bit timid this game for some reason.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEJNS 10B JANES +38 78
>Pete: EIQRRTZ C9 Z.IRE +48 136
#note Well, that worked out, for now.  I briefly considered QAT c9 instead, but figured I should keep scoring.  I knew my mind was cabbage at this point, so better score and avoid complex decisions.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EEGV 12A VE.GE +26 104
>Pete: AAOQRST -AQ +0 136
#note Duck likes VARA, which i considered and SORTA o4, which I didn't.  I decided on this board, playing for the first bingo made sense.  SORTA is a cool play, and exchange 3 does well also.  My exchange 2 is a minor error.  
>Chuck_Armstrong: CHLO F4 LOCH +25 129
>Pete: AIMORST 4B MORA.IST +72 208
#note Well, that L is convenient.  Only bingo.  saw it immediately, then took 3 minutes to try to find something better.  I'm already starting to feel some time pressure.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AFF 2M AFF +35 164
>Pete: AADEHNS 3A DAH +28 236
#note I chickened on the D hook for LIAR.  Yeah, I suck.  AAH E3 is an effective play, and AHA 3b and DEASH o4 win sim.  DAH is about as weak a play as can be justified.  I really was kinda scuffling mentally at this point.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EORT A11 O.ERT +24 188
>Pete: AAEINNS 2A AN +17 253
#note Duck plays big with SIENNA o4.  My play finishes 2nd, kills the dangerous spot I foolishly opened, and fishes at that siren of a leave AEINS.  I swear no leave looks better but is more problematic.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EOX H1 OXE. +33 221
>Pete: AEILNSU 15A .UI +3 256
#note great, now I play weak useless defense while fishing.  I considered XU, and still don't know why I played this.  XU and AUXIN seem the only logical options, since I don't know RUSINE.  the 2 unseen ?s are freaking me out, and I feel like I have to bingo soon.
>Chuck_Armstrong: BEI 2E IBE. +19 240
>Pete: ?AELNRS O4 SLANdER +77 333
#note wasn't that a brilliant fish?  I miss the best spot for bingoes at 11E, and show off my anagramming skills with SLANDER, missing out on 12 points in the process.
>Chuck_Armstrong: OY N6 YO +28 268
>Pete: ADIMNWY M7 YAWN +28 361
#note At this point, I'm probably a bit too confident, especially considering that my mind is not operating at full strength.  WINDY, playing off one extra tile, makes sense here.
>Chuck_Armstrong: GT 5E G.T +16 284
#note Had my mind been working, I would have gotten the inference of what this play meant about the bag.  I missed it.
>Pete: ADDILMU 10K DA. +4 365
#note Duck says DID f12 is best.  I think D(AD) a1 makes a lot of sense here, with an ugly bag, a Q unseen, and chuck likely to fish.  I think I win if I just play off the D.  DAN is a weak attempt to play Defense on a board that can't adequately be defended, and sets up the opportunity for chuck to fish 1 tile, leaving one in the bag.  
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?CEINNT A1 C.. +18 302
#note Chuck's actual rack, unkown to me.  CAD wins 90%.  
>Pete: DIIILMU F12 DUI +17 382
#note I think duck and CP misanalyse this position.  they fish off an I for IF, winning 78.63&.  They say my play of DUI wins 77.65.  they say passing only wins 55%, when I think passing wins in most cases.  I was at about a minute, and I had to play.  I figured my best shot was hope he had the Q, and couldn't bingo.  If I had it to do again, I pass.
