>Jason_Idalski: ?EJOPQR -JQ +0 0
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ABEEINV 8G VIE +12 12
#note Not VIBE? Odd.
>Jason_Idalski: ?ELOOPR J2 bLOOPER +71 71
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ABDENNW K5 WAN +28 40
>Jason_Idalski: BGHIOSU 4I B.HO +28 99
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ABDDENQ H6 QA.D +14 54
#note My fervent pleas to higher powers for the V to stay open go unheeded. Curses.
>Jason_Idalski: EGIOSTU 3L GO +9 108
#note Wow, does Duck hate this play. (V)IG, which I almost played, is like 10 better ... I feared double-doubles, though. I'm already learning how much I sometimes overestimate an opponent's leave. GUSTO, 10F, is the sim leader. (-13)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: BDENNRX N1 DEX +33 87
>Jason_Idalski: EIISTTU 1L TI.E +18 126
#note Robin gave off a "mega-tell" that she was unhappy with her draw after DEX, but I still couldn't stomach leaving this open. Still think, even assuming opponent exchanges, this is better than passing TUI. Simming 6-7 points ahead of the field with no inference.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: BDLNNRV -BDLNNV +0 87
>Jason_Idalski: EIMSSTU 10H SUM +26 152
#note Feared I was missing a seven. Wasn't. Phew. Duck and I in lockstep five of six turns.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: CKNORRS 11I NOCK +26 113
#note Robin's still grumbling. I really want to bingo soon.
>Jason_Idalski: EIIOSTU L9 TI.I +16 168
#note Why not KOI? Because I suck, that's why. Although this sims closer than I would've anticipated. (-2)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ?EEIRRS 13H RERISEn +73 186
#note I could've guessed the leave given Robin's previous turn, but she confirmed after the game. Left RRS, drew EEI?. Big hmph.
>Jason_Idalski: AAEOSTU H12 U.EA +15 183
#note Duck gives a slight nod to A(V)O. I still wanted to keep the board constricted/play defense at this stage, though. Perhaps wrong thinking.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: FGIITTW N9 WIFI.G +28 214
>Jason_Idalski: AAEOSTY O7 AYE +23 206
#note YO instead? 14-27 V-C ratio ... maybe. I still don't mind this.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AENPRTT 14G P.T +7 221
>Jason_Idalski: AGNOSST J10 ..O.S +17 223
#note I hated telegraphing that I have the case S, but I didn't see anything else remotely decent. Wins sim, but I still don't know.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AENRTYZ N6 ZA +33 254
>Jason_Idalski: AGLNRST 12F GN. +4 227
#note Now I feel like my odds of outrunning are slim. I don't know what to call this type of play. A preliminary board-opener? Don't care for Duck's pick of (A)N(EN)T. (-2)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AENRTTY I4 .Y +16 270
>Jason_Idalski: ACELRST 11E LA +7 234
#note Dangerous, but she hasn't exactly been playing like she's got high-point tiles. Like last turn, Duck likes PA(L), but it's assuming my opponent will blissfully unawarely do my dirty work for me. (-12)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AENRTTV 10D VAT +16 286
#note Robin agonized over whether this should play here or at D10.
>Jason_Idalski: CEEFRST E7 FEC.. +10 244
#note Again, EF assumes opponent will open, but maybe it works here. It at least threatens outrunning potential and I can probably play to the AL to open next turn. That being said, I thought it would be difficult to kill all this. (-14)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: DEIMNRT F6 DEN +22 308
#note But she could.
>Jason_Idalski: DELNRST L3 ..LD +22 266
#note I almost longed for my AAEOSTU rack again.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: HILMORT 7H .M.. +16 324
#note Hmm ... I find THROM(b)I intriguing. Gonna be hard to bingo off it and leaves three in the bag, ending the game quicker. Although this may well be better, or even best.
>Jason_Idalski: AENORST 3G ORA. +15 281
#note (V)AN instead? Another "preliminary board opener"? I still like this. (-2)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: HIJLORT G2 J.T +10 334
#note ARGH! I know this could be blocked this way, but a one-pointer where that J is at least gives me eight potential. Now I'm in desperation mode.
>Jason_Idalski: ABEINST 7M B.. +8 289
#note CP says this or BA(T) at 4E win almost half the time. CP is on crack. Fishing for SANTERI(A). Hoping Robin forgets about the bottom of the board like I almost did.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: EHILORU 15E URE. +8 342
#note Well, 0-for-2 on that strategy...
>Jason_Idalski: AEINNST 4D TIN. +8 297
#note (V)AN at D10, eight better. Spread doesn't matter and I just wanted this game from heck to be over.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: HILORU O14 OH +18 360
#note Best.
>Jason_Idalski: AENS D10 .ANES +19 316
#note While she turned out to be great, my annotator did not endear herself to me by saying: "What a defensive game. You had a lot of non-gos." Gee, ya think? *sigh* Why must Scrabble torment me so? 0-3, not even averaging 340, and desperate for a win. 
>Jason_Idalski:  (ILRU) +8 324
