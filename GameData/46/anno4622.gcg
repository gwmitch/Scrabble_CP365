>Max_Panitch: AGY H7 GAY +14 14
>Ross_Brown: AINNORW I8 WON +18 18
#note Quackle likes I6 ROWAN marginally better, but I liked the AINR leave with the G open.
>Max_Panitch: ADEISTU 11C DAUTIES +73 87
#note One S down.
>Ross_Brown: AAEIMNR F5 MARINA.E +64 82
#note C5 MARINA(D)E is too dangerous.
>Max_Panitch: BJO E4 JOB +36 123
>Ross_Brown: EEGKMPU J6 PEEK +32 114
#note Now the race is on to find the X for H11 (E)X???.
>Max_Panitch: HI G6 HI +19 142
>Ross_Brown: DEGIMUW K8 DEMI +33 147
#note Oops!  A little back-formation from DEMIES; proper spelling is DEMY.  Maybe Max thought I'd played DENI?
#note No excuse for not playing DEGUM, which is better in many ways.
>Max_Panitch: EHIST 13C HEIST +29 171
#note Two S's down.
>Ross_Brown: EGTUWXY 12B TUX +47 194
>Max_Panitch: ???? -???? +0 171
>Ross_Brown: CEGOOWY 12K COOEY +38 232
#note A little daring; maybe COWY would have been safer, but I wanted one of those blanks!
>Max_Panitch: ?AAEORS 14G AREOlAS +60 231
#note 5H AgAROSE is much better; I'd had my eyes open for an A for that spot.
#note Three S's and a blank down.
>Ross_Brown: AGGRRTW M10 GR.W. +18 250
#note This sims best.
#note Since I didn't have tiles to reach either TWS, I felt I had to defuse this corner of the board.
>Max_Panitch: EFL 15H ELF +31 262
>Ross_Brown: AEGRTUV O8 GRAV. +36 286
#note Not many E's left, so I liked this better than GARVE(Y), and so does Quackle.
>Max_Panitch: AINZ K3 NAZI +30 292
>Ross_Brown: DEINTTU 3G UNTI.TED +72 358
#note Max held this for a while, but I never doubted it was good.  It isn't.
>Max_Panitch: ?AELSTV M1 eL.VATES +61 353
#note No more S's or blanks.
>Ross_Brown: EINOPRU 1H REPIN. +24 382
#note There are two spots for the unseen Q, one high-scoring.  Do I block it or not?  Max just drew seven tiles, so he's more likely to have it than I am to get it now.  Hm...
#note UNRIP(E) is worth more points, but uses the U, which might bail me out if I draw the Q.  Hm...
#note In any case, there are enough infill spots on the board to survive a Q-stick scenario.  Oh well...
>Max_Panitch: CDFILNR 8E L. +2 355
#note The Q is now stuck.
>Ross_Brown: BLOOOQU 2M .OO +12 394
#note Saving grace:  I had most of the vowels.  Max couldn't do much with one vowel, especially an I that couldn't be played in the open.
>Max_Panitch: CDFINR D10 F...D +16 371
#note I suggested, and Craig Rowland agreed, that Max should have done this in two parts, to get more points out of the X.
#note I also suggested to Max that 5D R(OM) and I13 C(EL) could set up C5 FIND as an out play.  Problem is, threatening to go out in two doesn't earn him enough points.
#note There is a sequence that gets Max a loss by two points if both sides play just right, and in reality it might have beaten me.  Unfortunately, he was running out of time.  Can you find it?  Hint:  It puts four of his six tiles in one area.
>Ross_Brown: BLOQU O1 B. +12 406
>Max_Panitch: CINR I13 C.. +8 379
>Ross_Brown: LOQU 5K .O. +12 418
#note Quackle wants to score more points with L9 LO before Max goes out, but I wanted to keep the L for (YOKE)L in case he didn't go out.
