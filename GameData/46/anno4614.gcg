#note Find the awesome (and I think best) play here. 
>Mike: EIORV D8 VIREO +34 115
>Noah: AEENOTT F13 TAE +15 103
#note I missed EAT/APIECE/TI here. That's a bit of a hint to my play last turn.
>Mike: AZ G3 ZA +31 146

#note KNEE(PIECE)!

#note He told me his rack here.
>Noah: ?BENORT 14I sORBENT +78 243
#note Whoops. I realized it's quite probable that something big is coming after TOSS, but didn't think of BORT(Z), which I think I like better.
>Mike: ?EERRST O8 RETREa.S +122 316
#note Ouch.
>Noah: AAAFORY 10B FA. +14 257
#note This is a bit of a desperate situaton. Obviously, Quackle hates this, but I don't. He should be able to block both my last lanes easily after something like OAF, so I'm going for an open board here. Thoughts?
>Mike: ALUU A8 LUAU +19 335
#note Now the board is probably better than after OAF.
>Noah: AAILORY 13L AY +24 281
>Mike: AHO N9 HAO +19 354
>Noah: AGILLOR 12G GORILLA +84 365
#note What a great draw.
>Mike: DILM 3L MILD +18 372
#note I think he had NRS with this.
>Noah: AADGPUY O1 PA.DY +42 407
#note I knew he could block, but was low on time and didn't see BINITS, so I didn't think it was worth it to block. GUA(R) is 20 better, as he can't block PADDY. Oops.
>Mike: BGNRSX H11 G.X +11 383
#note Not sure why BINITS is so much better according to Champ Player. Must just be a bug.
>Noah: AGU K4 .U. +14 421
#note A(I) is 11 better, because of BINITS.
>Mike: BNRS 9C B.N..S +29 412
#note Nice!
