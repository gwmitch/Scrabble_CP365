#description Chris Williams plays Jason Idalski in Round 8 at the 2009 CanAm 
>Chris_Williams: AAEIUVY 8H UVEA +14 14
>Jason_Idalski: AAJMPRR K7 P.JAMA +34 34
#note Duck likes the K3 placement instead. (-2)
>Chris_Williams: ACINQTY 12H QAN.T +48 62
>Jason_Idalski: EEEGRRX H3 EXERG.E +23 57
#note Sims best by a lot, perhaps still best even after knowing opponent dislikes (and will use a lot more time on) closed boards.
>Chris_Williams: CDIOTVY J10 YO.IC +41 103
>Jason_Idalski: ?CFRRRT 3F TR.F +12 69
#note I put R(E)FT down first and moved the T. They sim in a dead heat. It will prove significant later.
>Chris_Williams: DGOSTVZ 5E DOV. +16 119
>Jason_Idalski: ??CENRR 10B CoRNERs +80 149
#note Didn't even realize at the time that I set up another juicy -S hook. Fortunately it goes unused. Both of us have played very well to this point.
>Chris_Williams: BGORSTZ D8 BO.TZ +38 157
>Jason_Idalski: EFGIINT 6E EF +29 178
#note Gah. Would've loved to go for the kill with FEIN(T)ING, but it's blocked a lot of ways. Duck says except for the opening play placement, I've been perfect so far.
>Chris_Williams: GIORSUU 8A GRU. +21 178
#note It stupidly never occurred to me that Chris had to be keeping a U here (the Q spot).
>Jason_Idalski: AGIINTW B10 .AWING +24 202
#note You don't know how tempting it was to fish off the W on the 1/12 chance I'd have (DOVE)TAILING next turn. Duck likes WI(Z), which I considered (and also gives me a decent shot at DOVETAILING). (-4)
>Chris_Williams: EIIOSUW 13H IW.S +49 227
>Jason_Idalski: ADEITTU C12 IT +23 225
#note Yeah, CAWING is probably stupid given the number of I's out. But it worked out OK for me. Duck wants turnover; DAUTIE at 2B. (-4)
>Chris_Williams: BEIOOSU M9 BOUSE +35 262
>Jason_Idalski: ADELSTU N4 SALUTED +75 300
#note AULDEST/(QANAT)S was supposed to be the play, but this will do. Chris gave a "yeah, that's how my day's been going" sigh.
>Chris_Williams: AAIIIOS 15A A.IO +18 280
#note I'm in good shape, but look at the unseen pool ... especially for someone with an S, bingoing once more is not unlikely.
>Jason_Idalski: DELLNTY O9 TELLY +18 318
#note Tunnel vision. Too focused on blocking the O column. Missed DYNEL at L4. DELLY or YELD is better if I want to go this route. (-17)
>Chris_Williams: AIIIPRS 4K IRI. +8 288
#note Glad to see him score nothing and block column L bingos. At this point, I think I'm going to be all right, although he's fixing the main hindrance to bingoing: the pool's vowel-heaviness.
>Jason_Idalski: DDEEKNN G13 KEN +29 347
#note Quackle says it's a minor mistake, but I think it's my losing play. It's not that I missed the clear sim leader (DOVE)NED (although that is way better), but D(I)KE at M3 which I noticed in the post-mortem and sims three points better. Tunnel vision again. Saw the lucrative K spot once he plays IWIS and cashed it in. There's no urgency to that spot; need to close a bingo lane (although now he can't bingo through the E in CORNERS) ... DIKE probably wins. Argh. This is what I focused on in the post-mortem ... lot of people saw me and came by to comment. (-11)
>Chris_Williams: AAEIOPS F14 PA +22 310
#note Another drawback to KEN is that he can now fish off an H or P for points, which he did.
>Jason_Idalski: DDEHNOO 2I OH +18 365
#note Chose the wrong bingo line. He has (only) three bingo racks which play on row two (ELISION/ISOLINE, ENHALOS and INHALES). I might've overestimated that over the board. If he has INHALES, he also has LEASHIN(G) or SHEALIN(G). If he has ELISION, he has LIONISE(R). He could have SHOALING, SHIELING or EMAILING to the G or SHOALIER to the R. Three potential bingo racks on row two, six potential bingo racks using GRUB. Naturally, I block row two. Just guessed wrong. (-20, to OOH at 3K)
>Chris_Williams: AEHILOS B1 SHOALIE. +76 386
#note Whacked for the mistake. I also notice that SHOALIER is his only potential bingo with his prior leave of AEIOS. Owie. Owie, owie, owie. Another problem with a play like OH is that it allows him to fish. I think my last rack was one where I should play it like Tiekert: empty the bag and eliminate fishing options. Out of 120 possible racks, only seven give him bingos, as it turns out. Why must I mess up?
>Jason_Idalski: DDEIMNO C2 MID +26 391
#note Then I get to play an endgame with about two minutes left, which always consists of me looking at the board for two seconds, looking at my clock for two seconds, looking at my rack for two seconds ... and repeating the process. Not exactly an effective use of time. It didn't help that I cost myself five seconds by (fairly lightly, I thought) hitting my fist against the table, which dislodged some tiles and cost me about five seconds to set the board back up again. Naturally, Adam saw EMODIN (which loses by one) in less than the 20 seconds I had left on my clock after making this play. I hate him. :) (-15)
>Chris_Williams: N 11I N.. +11 397
#note My only real blown game of the tourney. Still, one more than I would like.
>Chris_Williams:  (DENO) +10 407
