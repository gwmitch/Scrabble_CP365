#note i thought it wise to be a little more defensive. i don't know why, because that's not my style at all, but i DID read it right this time :P  -0.5

#note YAW at I1. -10. easily better than my play, how do i see stuff like this?????
>dacrON: ?BEJORT 6B J.B +28 146
#note I KNEW I knew REOBJECT from somewhere. Noah confirmed that I'd challenged it vs him once. I figured I wouldn't take a big equity hit here (i thought - 5 or 7 (Quackle says 11), so I played it safe. If I had no option like JIB I may have tried it. Silly memory.

#note conrad: luckyzar      cesar: hey, i kept ANT and there's nice letters to play through :P
>dacrON: ?BEIORT 4A Ov.RBITE +72 218
#note Quackle says ORBIEsT is better. whatever.
>ZarZar: DEIPQRV M1 D.PRIVE +28 249
#note i'm sure conrad thought i was nuts for doing this, but quackle likes it best. yes! NOW GIVE ME ONE OF THE UNSEEN Us.
>dacrON: DEIILST 8L IDLE +33 251
#note Quackle wants just ID. Given the pool, it makes sense, but IDLE seems fine given the pool too. And it is 14 more points + gives me another E to play through if I need it.
>ZarZar: AAFGNOQ N7 F.AGON +19 268
#note i had a feeling this was wrong, but it's just barely behind G6 OFF. WHERE IS MY U. conrad suggested maybe exchanging. quackle hates exchanging, so i never think of it. -1.5

>ZarZar: AMOORTV M11 VAT +24 308
#note E10 MOOT seems like a MOOT point to me, there is no realistic way to win anymore.
>dacrON: GIOSSUY 11B YOGIS +29 420
>ZarZar: IMOORRZ C11 .RZO +26 334
#note quackle likes J11 ORZO. this is just the simmer though; there's no way ORZO wins any games against conrad. -5%

#note E4 BI is the best fish. i wish there was more than 1 tile in the bag, but there's always the small chance conrad could miss my fish :P
