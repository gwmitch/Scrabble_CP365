#note Okay, the story is I have to beat Gibson twice in a row to cash, and if Winter falls far enough, I could finish 2nd in doing so.  He and Looby are playing to my left for 1st.  I'm behind Gibson by about 400 spread points, same record.

>Ryan_Fischer: ABCDIRR --  -52 26
#note Well, funny story.  So I've obviously seen ABCDINOR before.  Hence, my terrible guess.  To be fair, it's plausible.  To be more fair.  He does know the alphagram.  Hence, his almost insta-challenge.  The kicker: I play BRAC(ON)ID, the game is much more in my control.  So close, yet so far.

#note Blah.  H1 RIDGI(L) 30.  This is 2nd.  A distant 2nd.

#note Of course he has two of the key letters that punish in that spot.

#note Long story.  When I was a kid, on the Apple IIe, we'd have these educational games we could load on 5 1/4" discs.  Stuff like Word Munchers, and Oregon Trail.  There was this counting game where you'd designate how much you had, I think, with terms such as Fermi, Picos, and Bagels!  The details are vague and blurry.  That's why PICO* has always stuck in my head as a valid word.  Oh well.  I shoulda just remembered what hooks PIC takes.  Q likes PIGGI(N) N3 14.  I saw GIGO(T), but that just makes it harder for me to come back.
>David_Gibson: ??ADEST 4E .AuDaTES +72 215
#note Interesting: O1 sTEDfAS(T) 77.  And it is so confusing what hooks CAUDATE takes.

#note Well, I saw 7H OAF 18, but then where do I bingo if I draw one?  So my hope is to leave the T open, and open another lane, which I do with FUGS.
>David_Gibson: IJ N6 JI. +26 266
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEORY L11 .AYER +20 184
#note 12H YEA 15 has potential I guess.  (G)AYER is too easy to overlap, too poor a leave.

>Ryan_Fischer: AFIOOUU 7H OAF +18 202
#note Q suggests x7.  HAHA.  Wow, how far I've fallen.  I figured I might as well save spread, although now cashing is next to impossible.

>Ryan_Fischer: EIOOUUW O4 WOO +19 221
#note Exchange 6 is now the suggestion.  Really, it's hopeless.
>David_Gibson: EORZ J11 .ROZE +37 341
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEIIUU -EIU +0 221
#note This time the suggestion is x7 again.  I wanna keep some stuff.  One U to absorb the Q.  D (a consonant), and the I couldn't hurt.  Q, of course, hates it.  But I figure with the -R lane, -IER words are possible.
