#note so far so good, but i made up my mind i would challenge an S on QUAICH. i know quaiches. i don't even know how the hell one would pronounce QUAICHS. i hate this dictionary. -44

#note amusingly enough he would have had a triple-triple if i had let SOY go.

#note didn't even occur to me to play JOLTER. i think i've forgotten that word. JOLE at 4L is better defensively. -2

#note i was strongly considering blowing the board open with GROOVE until he played that. i just couldn't bring myself to do that. OGIVE maybe. -2

#note quackle's favorite play is 4E VAU. i don't really get it.. upbow is close behind. -0.5%

>Cesar: AACEHIR 13C HA +14 357
#note i probably blew the game here. i just gotta keep scoring and make him empty the bag, not fish. and also, keeping a vowel heavy leave after his D(RE)K isn't smart. but i was running out of ideas. it really is smart to do 4C CAVIARE; i go ahead by 9 and i force him to empty the bag, plus i keep a scoring H. far better than my play. i just didn't see CAVIARE, i need to not be lazy and keep looking. i think i had enough time in this game. -16

#note this gives me the best chances of winning according to CP but it's not looking very good. i need to probably draw the S and hope i can go out somehow, or score with vivas.
