#note i chickened out on ALLUVI(ON)s here!! pLUVIALS??? i totally missed VISUALLy. and ALLUSIVe... big now. the worse thing about this is that i was already running into time trouble and i was worrying about if he bingoed. this board sucks.. if i don't open the board and he bingoes to the S the game is over! but i hated doing LUV, it's even worse now that I know I missed FOUR BINGOS. TERRIBLE. -30.5

#note it was frustrating that i couldn't figure out how to kill the bottom. i saw lOWLAND and gONADAL so i had to kill the lane. but UM gives him back DALApON (which i actually didn't see) and ADWOmAN. so this is a big mistake. ELM L12 is the only way to ensure a win. i couldn't see a bingo he could play after ELM, but i still thought i could be missing something. clearly i couldn't leave that spot open, but ELM seemed easy to score on, so i didn't want to do that. but that's the play. (-25%)
