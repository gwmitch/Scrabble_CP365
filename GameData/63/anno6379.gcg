#note Keeping N is kinda intriguing... telexing maybe?
>Chad_Hopper: CEOOY 7E COOEY +26 26
>Matt_Canik: ?DFINRV K5 FIV.R +22 62
#note Talked myself out of fervid. Don't think it really matters much, fiver takes an S hook and sims just barely 2nd. 
>Chad_Hopper: DEIOSTU 10E TEDIOUS +74 100
>Matt_Canik: ?DEGNST 6H STr.NGED +70 132
#note Looked for some 9s for a little, but for some reason I thought I was looking at STEGODON + ? instead of DEEGNOST + ?. Heh. Oh well, stringed scores more than goldenest or congested or decongest. 
>Chad_Hopper: AAIMN E2 MANIA. +20 120
#note quackle says aidman. heh. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEEGGI O4 GA.ID +30 162
#note DIGGED?? Sigh. Didn't know degade either. Oh wells.

#note Thats hot. 
>Chad_Hopper: ?AABMNS 1I BASeMAN +84 255
#note Or BAtSMAN for 3 more. Either way, nice find. 
>Matt_Canik: DEFOTTV 11D VOTED +30 276
#note Obv. best. 
>Chad_Hopper: NOR 2L NOR +15 270
#note Suddenly, this bountiful board looks like gibson's been here. 
>Matt_Canik: FHLRTUZ C1 F.Z +30 306
#note D'oh. H(E)RTZ.
>Chad_Hopper: HIW 4L WHI. +22 292
>Matt_Canik: HLPRRTU M1 ..T. +18 324
#note I'm really worried that he's setting up an ENOW/xxxOS word here for a lot. This is also my highest scoring play. 
>Chad_Hopper: OP 3K PO. +11 303
>Matt_Canik: HLPRRUW G1 H.P +11 335
>Chad_Hopper: EN H2 .EN +12 315
>Matt_Canik: CILRRUW F6 ..W +13 348
#note Really thought bout exchanging here, but looking at the AAAAEEEEIIIOOUUQY in the tile pool I decided against it because I'll either draw vowels pretty soon or draw a bunch of drek on the change turn. I'm also terrified he'll come down with something at A8 and I really wanted to block the last opportunity to score more than 20. Quackle actually sims this play tops too. 
>Chad_Hopper: EO D2 .OE +22 337
>Matt_Canik: ACILRRU N8 AURIC +12 360
#note Bleh. Just dumping some tiles now without opening too much up. Get this game over faster with. Low risk play, worst case scenario is something like lacy which'll more likely than not give me an equal-scoring comeback. 
>Chad_Hopper: N 3G ..N +12 349
>Matt_Canik: ABILRSU 13H BURIALS +78 438
>Matt_Canik: ABILRSU --  -78 360
#note Figured it was this or make a crappy play for 10. Why not give it a go? (Note: didn't see (R)UB(U)S/(GADID)S/(X)U 9K 28. 
>Chad_Hopper: AI D11 .IA +12 361
>Matt_Canik: ABILRSU 14A BIRL +19 379
#note RAILBUS is just outside the prob range (for now), and evidentally it's outside of his too. Also missed B(A)LISAUR, but I won't worry about missing that. BIRL keeps a U should I draw the Q and doesn't give away many points on the TWS with what's unseen. Every way I played it out, this won for me.  
>Chad_Hopper: ELOQRUY A12 OR.Y +30 391
#note He didn't realize I emptied the bag.
