#note i held this for ages. i was 90% on how phony it was, but saw i could keep a good lead with a good comeback and there were still 2 volatile scoring spots.  i should've challenged, but i didn't.

#note q likes k3 FLYT(E) or L4 FLI(R)TY.  then shedding Q(I) - mine's not too far back.
>froilan: BIJ A7 JIB +44 219
>jc: IKLQTTY K4 TYK. +22 245
#note prefers KYT(E) same spot - probably as a KI/QI set up?  Also likes N5 TI(N)KLY which is interesting.

>jc: EEILQTT L7 .ETITLE +16 261
#note Q likes shedding the Q at L3 or 3C.  Then it likes H12 plays like TELE,TEEL or LEET - leaving QIT.  I wanted to turn over 6 with ?? unssen, and i wasn't too worried about the Q here.  I wonder what others think and whether I was too casual with the Q?

#note froilan struggling with bad racks, but still managing to score.

#note q likes M13 DEV for 28. though it has a similar valuation to P(E)D.

#note here's my thinking - i see PYRUVATE at the top but am not 100%.  I also see it could give Froilan a huge S play from O15.  I therefore think my best bet is to fish off something which gives me the ability to beat Froilan to the line- i opted for (QUIN)T. Q sas that's ok, but it's favorite way is 7a (J)UT.  I was keeping that line open for a possible O ending bingo (though i couldn't envisage what that may be).  Finally, with RRRR unseen, i figured that if i had to go with PYRUVATE then i'm likely to redraw into it.

>jc: ??AERUV 1G p.RUVAtE +63 426
#note i have 2 out bingos in addition to mine. I should've seen the highest scoring one,  but by then I'd settled with PYRUVATE for the win.  (kudos to Jeremy H who found the other 8 very quickly when i quizzed him afterwards).
