>Geoff: AAEGIST 8D AGATISE +68 68
#note Quackle agrees with my placement here.
>Quackle: DDEEPST H4 DESP.TED +64 64
>Geoff: ?AEIORR E4 ARmI.ERO +82 150
#note Thought about pRO(G)ERIA here, didn't think of fAIR(G)OER. I'd have probably gone with FAIRGOER if I'd seen it.
>Quackle: AINVXYY D1 VINY +38 102
>Geoff: EEIJLLO D11 JOLE +31 181
#note This or JELLO? They're about tied in the sim. JOLE would win in TWL, pretty sure - don't have to worry about JOLED#.
>Quackle: AMNOTXY 13B XY.OMA +38 140
>Geoff: CEIILOU 1D .OICE +30 211
#note Quick, ILU or II +3 points? Another close call, VOICE or VOCULE#. 
>Quackle: AAENRST K5 ANESTRA +87 227
#note And the AGATISE# placement backfires, dangit. 
>Geoff: AILOOTU 1A OUT..... +39 250
>Quackle: DEFGHLP 15D DELPH +54 281
#note There's JOLED#. Ouch.
>Geoff: AEILNOU 14A OU +22 272
>Quackle: EFGGNRU 2H FUG +16 297
>Geoff: AAEILNQ G3 QI +24 296
#note Quackle likes the cute Q-setup play 14F ELAIN a few points better. Didn't think of it. 
>Quackle: AEGNRSW 10J W.ANG +21 318
>Geoff: AAEEILN N4 ALIENA.E +61 357
>Quackle: BENRSTU 14H SUBRENT +85 403
#note Apropos of nothing, to this point in the game, there has not been a single multiple-tile overlap. Grandma would not approve.
>Geoff: ?EFIKRW O4 WIFEy +63 420
#note Egads. This play gives me a 17-point lead, with both of us on a random draw from a lousy pool. Also soaks up the O4 hotspot, which plays like FEW don't do (the 15L spot's still around though). FaIK# 15L 54 saves the E, which would be useful...Quackle likes K(A)W# 21...eh, hard to score so little and not take a big spot - seems like that's betting too heavily on a winning bingo (and perhaps on opponent emptying the bag ill-advisedly). A sim puts WIFEy at 48% to win, best plays around 55%. Not convinced the sim isn't giving me better possibilities for bingoing/bingoing out than I would have in real life in this position, though. I doubt my play was right, but don't have a sense of exactly how wrong it is.
>Quackle: DIINORV L1 VIRID +29 432
>Geoff: CHKLRTZ L12 CH.Z +56 476
#note Crap, no vowels. I can see CHEZ loses, but apparently there isn't anything better. Against a human, maybe play TREK and hope he miraculously doesn't block CH(I)Z# C7? (But why wouldn't he play there anyway?)
