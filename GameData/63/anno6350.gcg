#note i was less predisposed to give him more letters to play thru, but i don't know what to infer for him after that. i also forgot once again that EINR is a better leave than AENR. i think that has come up before. FAINER wins the sim. -5.5

#note quackle like JAKE better, which i don't understand. -1.5
>Alex: AIN O1 A.IN +27 196
>Cesar: BDEEETV 10J B.EVE +18 171
#note well i was starting to run out of ideas. i guess getting 24 pts for 3 1-pters is one reason JAKE is better.

>Cesar: DEOQRRT O8 ROT +20 191
#note well i can't leave that open now can i? bad job chickening out on DOTER and not seeing RETRO though. exch QR sims better than my move. DOTER is best. -9

#note woohoo, this doesn't sim as bad as i thought.  it's very close between this, D(O)W or D(A)W at M3. -0.5

#note -16. finding the actual game winning sequence here is an excellent exercise -- i wouldn't have.

>Alex: DEEGINS --  -92 345
#note alex coulda won it with SEINED or SEINE at 13E. i actually didn't even know what his rack was because i had no time and had completely mistracked. i figured it out sometime during his turn though, and saw FEEDINGS* but still not this play. he knew this was phony though.
