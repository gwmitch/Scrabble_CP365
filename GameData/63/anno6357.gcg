#note Dammit.  I was so close to that elusive "perfect game".  Every single play I've made thus far has been arguably best.  Then I have to fall asleep at the wheel and let this stupid phony go by.  There was something about the theatrics of the way she declared the blank that kinda lulled me.  No really, I was just being careless.  :)

#note Why is exchange 7 so great?  Odd.  I would think AGIN is the leave to want here.

#note Part of the reason my spread was so very sad.  TWO late bingos that shouldn't have been.  Ugh.  One would've been tolerable considering she had the blank and it was open.  Away we go.
