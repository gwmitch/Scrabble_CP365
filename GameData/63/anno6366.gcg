>David_Gibson: ?EILRUV 8D VIRgULE +76 76
#note So, because I lost the last game, I've gotta beat Gibson by something like over 300 to finish 3rd and cash.  Stranger things have happened, right?  ...but not when he opens with a BLANK bingo!  Grr.  That's two of four games he's opened with a bingo versus me this weekend.  Sure feels like more, prolly 'cause he did it in WV, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: EFKOSTV F6 FO.K +19 19
#note Hopefully drawing the Y eventually, I could use all the luck I can get.
>David_Gibson: AEGINST K5 TEASING +92 168
#note It just isn't fair! :)
>Ryan_Fischer: AESSTTV 10A VASTEST +78 97
#note He held me on this!  That's almost as good as a challenge... right?  :D
>David_Gibson: ELY A8 LE.Y +30 198
>Ryan_Fischer: AAACIRY J4 CAY +31 128
#note Haha, beautiful: D6 CA(V)I(T)ARY 32!  In this case I should've just played AY, leaving that hook open, and keeping that good consonant.  This closes things up too much.
>David_Gibson: EHWW L3 WHEW +38 236
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEIMR D8 .I.AE +16 144
#note Little consolation that this is best.
>David_Gibson: FO 11C O.F +24 260
>Ryan_Fischer: AEMNOPR M1 PROM +33 177
#note Figured why not open the 3x3 since spread no longer matters.  Q likes POEM a bit better; don't know why.
>David_Gibson: ACNO 1K CA.ON +30 290
>Ryan_Fischer: ADENRTZ E3 DAZE +33 210
#note Should've played ADZE, but again, could use volatility.
>David_Gibson: IPQU D1 QUIP +61 351
#note Le'dammit!
>Ryan_Fischer: DNORRTX C10 ..RD +12 222
#note Missed TOX(I)N, will get it next turn.  I guess I was trying to draw some magic X bingo for 230 through a 3x3 not yet open.
>David_Gibson: I 1D .I +11 362
#note A couple years ago in Atlantic City, I fished for a 3x3 through Q.  None of that was to happen here!
>Ryan_Fischer: GNORTTX 9H TOX.N +27 249
>David_Gibson: BIMR 3C M..RIB +24 386
#note So amusing that this word came up twice, and that it was the second best play both times, according to Quackle.  It's pretty much best here, blocking column B and leaving a good leave (don't know what).
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGLRTU H1 DU. +18 267
#note H1 TU(B)AL 24, but a pretty mediocre leave.  Not that AGLRT is any better.
>David_Gibson: NU F2 U.N +10 396
>Ryan_Fischer: AGIILRT G10 .IL +3 270
#note I don't know how amused he'd be if I tried RI(N)GTAIL O-1!  Q says 6B GRI(EF).  What does it know?
>David_Gibson: ?ABNORT 13G TABORiN +79 475
#note He probably left ARNT? last turn, considering his fish and this play.  Aw.
>Ryan_Fischer: AADGIRT 14H GAD +23 293
#note TAIGA N10 26 is interesting.  I just thought I'd blow things wide open now that they're hopeless anyway.
>David_Gibson: ELO 15H OLE +30 505
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHINRT N8 HAIRNET +83 376
#note Drawing this after all that is such salt in the wound!  :)
>David_Gibson: EEGIJOS O7 JOGS +56 561
#note Check that.  THAT is such salt in the wound!
