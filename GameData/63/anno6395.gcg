>Tony_Sim: HWZ H6 WH.Z +19 19
>Toh_Weibin: AABEFOT I9 ABAFT +24 46
#note Really tough choices here - 6F FA(W), 6F BO(W)AT, I9 OAF and I9 ABAFT are pretty close. The sim results are in that order, which makes my move 4th.
>Tony_Sim: EGM J9 GEM +31 50
>Toh_Weibin: EEINORU H11 ROUEN +31 77
#note K10 EUOI would have been my choice, if I wasn't too fixated on the high score of this move.
>Tony_Sim: ?CEENOV 15C CONVE.Ed +63 113
#note Turns out that if I played EUOI, he wouldn't have a bingo.
>Toh_Weibin: IOORRTV 10I ..VOR +10 87
#note This move was unwarranted - being only behind by less than 40, I should have taken the points with TIRO K10 and not open the board stupidly with BEVOR. Moreover, it would be harder to capitalise on my openings because of the repeat tile (through O or R openings) required for bingo. I guess this was a desperate response to his bingo.
>Tony_Sim: GLRW L8 GR.WL +22 135
>Toh_Weibin: AIIORTU 8K A.UTI +18 105
#note Was considering AURI(C) C11 but I couldn't stomach the leave.
>Tony_Sim: UY 7M YU +20 155
>Toh_Weibin: AINORSX 6H .OX +29 134
#note Another very tough move, though it appeared very easy for me. Other choices are 14J AXION, keeping the S for a power play next turn; C10 ANOXI(C) blasting the board open and (W)AX H6. Again, CP says it goes in that order, followed by my move.
>Tony_Sim: ABF 6L FAB +31 186
>Toh_Weibin: AIILNRS C11 NARI. +14 148
#note My moves these game reflect my uncertainty to catch up on a closed board. This move opens up for a catchup bingo - I was very afraid of something like LARI I5 which could give him a 50 point reply. The highest move from CP is SLAIN.
>Tony_Sim: AINO 5I NAOI +24 210
>Toh_Weibin: EIKLLRS O6 SK.LLIER +82 230
>Toh_Weibin: ADEIMOP (challenge) +5 235
#note Wasn't 100% sure of this but I had to try it for the style and skilliness*.
>Tony_Sim: EJ G13 JE. +38 248
>Toh_Weibin: ADEIMOP 4J MODE +42 277
#note I reckon this move cost me quite a lot - PODIA is an obvious choice. Other than that, I'm ashamed to admit I wasn't sure of MODI.
>Tony_Sim: ?DDENST D6 STENDeD +75 323
>Toh_Weibin: AIIOPTU 7H .OI +24 301
#note This or UTOPIA? Again, tough choice, but once again, I shouldn't be afraid of turnover especially when I'm less than 50 points behind.

>Tony_Sim: CDER 8A CER.D +24 384
>Toh_Weibin: AEINSTU E1 SINUATE. +72 405
#note Quite a lucky pickup, maybe he won't be able to bingo back...
>Tony_Sim: EGIIOST A1 EGOISTI. +86 470
#note Oh well, at least I tried!
