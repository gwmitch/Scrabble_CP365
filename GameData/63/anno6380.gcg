#note Quackle likes DAH J6. I don't. =\
>Jacob_Williams: EHLOY 9C HOLEY +31 41
#note HOYLE 9E was more. 
>Matt_Canik: ADLNORU 8A LOUD +31 54
#note NODULAR doesn't play as a natural, and this trumps it as a 2x2. 
>Jacob_Williams: EGG 10G EGG +14 55
>Matt_Canik: AIIKNOR 6I KORAI +25 79
#note I know conventional wisdom says play KOI and keep the stronger AINR, but I've always been against keeping a bunch of semi-prone 1-pointers because odds are I DON'T draw the bingo and then I'm stuck there, unable to score with a bunch or one-pointers. 
>Jacob_Williams: AEIOSST A5 ISO.ATES +59 114
#note Only playable bing. 
>Matt_Canik: BDEINPW 5H WIPE +38 117
#note No questions here.

>Jacob_Williams: FNO O1 FON. +24 154
>Matt_Canik: CINNPRW B2 PIRN +14 149
#note Because I don't see more points except for SCRIP which leaves the lovely NNW. CNW looks a *little* nicer.
>Jacob_Williams: OY N1 OY +25 179
#note EGGY. 
>Matt_Canik: ?ACLNWX C1 WAN +20 169
#note Trying to dump a clunky W while holding the X for more points. 
>Jacob_Williams: DEIORRS 2B ..RODIERS +68 247
>Jacob_Williams: DEIORRS --  -68 179
#note Austin Scrabble Club gives you your entry fees back if you play a 9 at club (thanks, geoff!), so he's just going for style points here. 
>Matt_Canik: ?CELOUX 11A .XCEL +28 197
#note Nothing dangerous about this, gives me the lead, and doesn't give him anything. 
>Jacob_Williams: DEIORRS 12D DORRIES +76 255
>Jacob_Williams: DEIORRS --  -76 179
#note I guess he thought it gave him something. 
>Matt_Canik: ?EFIOTU 11I OUTFIrE +71 268
#note Since I know his rack, this is relatively harmless, whereas 12E risks outfires/outfired. No other bingoes. 
>Jacob_Williams: DEIORRS 1C .ORDIER +36 215
>Matt_Canik: ?AINNRV O8 RAV.NINg +149 417
#note Wewts. 
>Jacob_Williams: CI K11 .IC +5 220
#note Phish. 
>Matt_Canik: EEJQSUU F11 SUQ +27 444
#note Kinda wanna stop him from bingoing, this clearly isn't the best way to do it but for some reason I didn't feel worried about -est/-iest bings. 
>Jacob_Williams: AEIRSTT 14A ARTIEST +83 303
#note doh
>Matt_Canik: EEEJLMU 8L JEE. +19 463
#note ADZ 15G is unblockable, this is the best way to rid myself of the J.
>Jacob_Williams: ADTZ 15G ADZ +41 344
>Matt_Canik: ELMU 15A ME +26 489
#note (I)LEUM for an out, missed it and took points instead. (sadly, this will be my new highest-scoring club game... and I've been going on and off for 4 years now...)
