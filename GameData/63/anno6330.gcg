>Dominick_M: DEZ 8G ZED +26 26
>Cesar: ?EHIKQR -KQ +0 0
#note anyone agree with QIs for 44? i guess equity wise it makes the best sense. it's hard to give up 44 points. -Q seems to sim better than -KQ but i'm wary of it. (-6)
>Dominick_M: ABEN 9F BANE +26 52
>Cesar: ?EHILMR 10E HI +13 13
#note 10E LI and IZAR are quite a bit better than my move. is it because HELM? has more synergy than ELMR? or EHMR? or HI gives up too much? this move is a good indication that i don't consider defense like i should. HI does leave the best leave in terms of my next score, but it gives up far more than the other two, so it sims worse.  -6
>Dominick_M: EFLOY 7H FOLEY +23 75
>Cesar: ?AELMRW 11B WARM +32 45
#note spent way too long on this move. i was pretty sure MALWARES# was good in csw (i forget exactly why i knew that) but didn't think it had made its way here yet. this is dangerous, but i'm down by too much and my time is dwindling.
>Dominick_M: AEHRS A11 SHARE +46 121
>Cesar: ?AELNRW K4 REN.WALs +90 135
>Dominick_M: GGO 13A .GOG +12 133
>Cesar: CIIIKRY L11 ICKY +27 162
#note i considered CIRRI but i liked ICKY much more. turns out ICKY gives a lot more back, and i score more after CIRRI. i guess that makes sense. -2
>Dominick_M: EOP 12A .OPE +38 171
#note did he set that up?
>Cesar: CIILRST M3 CRITS +29 191
#note i keep having these racks and good players sitting next to me looking interestedly at them, and i'm wondering what the hell i'm missing and running my time lower and lower.  13L KILT is liked best, i don't know what gets into quackle sometimes. does anyone see themselves making this play? -1
>Dominick_M: DO 10J O.D +21 192
>Cesar: AFIJLMN J2 FLAM +23 214
#note i decide to hold off on JAY and channel my inner luckbox. i missed FLYMAN, though. (still, doesn't seem right after his play). INFLAME is also interesting. -6
>Dominick_M: IQ I1 QI +16 208
>Cesar: EIJNNRS 13I JIN.S +48 262
#note woohoo! well, i did see JINKER. i just thought it was wise to be a little closed -- although JINKER provides good insurance especially against something in the bottom row. -11
>Dominick_M: ARX H2 RAX +24 232
>Cesar: AEINRTT 4D RETA. +24 286
#note now i'm horribly low on time and i need to hurry up. i decide to fight a possible bingo with scoring. quackle prefers fishing with G3 TA, it just scares me. RETAX is also not very smart because of its hook, but i decide to just go for it. TA is probably better, but i just don't like doing that now. -6
>Dominick_M: BEGOT 14F BEGOT +29 261
>Cesar: EIINNST 5E TIN +14 300
#note just a few mins on my clock and EEIINNST doesn't ring a bell. BOO. bad.  -41 (also, maybe do YIN if i'm gonna miss a bingo. notice PRETAX/bingo there almost certainly kills me).
>Dominick_M: DETUV 3A DUVET +23 284
>Cesar: EEINPST A3 .IPNET +30 330
#note no quackle -- i 'm not playing 12L CEP. is quackle insane?????????????? -16 equity?? i'm not counting this if i do a mistake tally.
>Dominick_M: EO 15H OE +25 309
>Cesar: ?ELNOOS 5M .N +2 332
#note greedy zar. BO shouldn't sim that much better than my move because he's not going to let me have a bingo, quackle.  -12
>Dominick_M: AAIUUUV 6M .UI +9 318
>Cesar: ?DELOOS 14L .OD +16 348
#note vei had about 40 seconds left and for a second i thought solenoid fit. have you ever lost 121 equity in one play? cuz i have. pOOLSIDE for 134 and out, dummy.
>Dominick_M: AAIUUV 15D VIA +14 332
>Cesar: ?ELOS O11 cLOSE +23 371
#note -8 just LOSE then use the blank somewhere cool. total equity loss = 250 pts. i am awesome at scrabble.
>Cesar:  (AUU) +6 377
