>Ryan_Fischer: DIINOUU 15D DINO. +19 249
#note I think the 7th tile was a 2nd I, not sure.  I find it hard to believe I left two Us.  DINO(S) kills the S lane and scores most, but there's an exchange, and (G)UIDON, that rank higher.  Two exchanges, actually, and IDO(L), which I considered too.  I wanted to leave two lanes on the off chance he hits one, 'cause then I have a chance to hit back.  Don't know if that logic is sound, but things are about to get really hairy.

#note Dammit.  BU(G) is brilliant, almost completely locks it down.  Woulda saved me a lot of grief had I seen it.  Don't know why I didn't play O(V)UM over C(Y)MA.  Guess I wanted to hang on to that last U for the Q.

#note Okay, so it begins, the duel of open and close.

#note I don't understand why Champ likes HOURI and HUB so much.  I don't want him to get down a bingo.  Period.  Seems like the best way of preventing this is restrict how he can do it.  Ending in A, F, or T only seems a nice distortion for now.  HOURI sims much better, I guess because it restricts the left side, too.

#note This is the move that really frustrated me.  He was starting to talk about "oh, so frustrating."  Coffeehousing, but not maliciously, but distracting enough so I don't notice his play.  So he slaps down DE(I)*.  Like 15 seconds later, I'm like "HOLD, HOLD!"  And he's already drawn tiles.  I honestly forget what the rule is here, but didn't think I had a leg to stand on (except for "the spirit of the game is to allow the challenge").  So what happens next is really frustrating after my endeavors to try to defend.  After the game he did apologize, saying he didn't mean to.
>Ryan_Fischer: AINQRRU B6 QUA +36 368
#note Well, Champ does it again, finding that 4F INR(O) stops the threat.  QUA wins, but is very scary.  RA(ZEE) is very cool, and also stops it.  As does N(U).

#note He first tried to lay this down forming IQ.  He caught it, saying "it looked good upside down!"
