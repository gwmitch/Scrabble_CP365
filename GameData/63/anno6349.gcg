>james: ADEHNOW D11 HOW +23 137
#note this doesnt sim so well - i liked the leave and setting up the line along row 14.  my other choice L2 WON sims very well (scores 29).  also liked is HOW at I1 and d11 HAWED.
>debbie_stegman: AEEENRT 10E .ENERATE +65 133
#note best bingo- other one is TENEBRAE
>james: ADEINOU 1K .ENIA +39 176
#note Q slightly prefers L1 UDON for 37, m9 ADIEU.
>debbie_stegman: GHI 3I H..GI +26 159
>james: ADDKNOU M10 DUNK +31 207
#note a few plays slightly preferred - 4H KA(TI)ON for 43.  then 14A DUNK, 14D KUDO. 
>debbie_stegman: GU G8 .U.G +8 167
>james: ?ADEEGO C12 GAE +21 228
#note This or GOA in teh same spot. or 11I EGO. i liked setting up row 15 with me D? and only one N unseen. Plus it sets up column B for an -ES or -ED bingo.

>james: AAIOOPQ 14A OP. +18 324
#note i wish i was good enough to see K10 (T)OPOI as a great block/Q setup.   My play was intened to block somewhat column B bingos after debbie's fish. i thought that lane more dangerous than the A at o1.  i think this wasnt that good a play???
>debbie_stegman: AEILMNT O1 .NTIMALE +83 278
>james: AAIJOQ F6 JA. +31 355
#note dont know my 7th tile.  this sims best with the 6 that i have written down.
>debbie_stegman: DFIOSTU 12H OUTFI.DS +78 356
#note i literally held this for 3 minutes.  willing it to not be good. i eventually let it go. 
>james: ADILMOQ N6 MAD +27 382
#note as you can see from the last rack where i didnt write down my rack - i was getting low on time.  i also here thought that there was another A left unseen and i was very worried about ZA at N6.  my play does ok in the sim, but is way behind a much better play in the same position n4 MOL.  However, the major endgame fail is about to come.
>debbie_stegman: CRY O12 .CRY +27 383
>james: ILOQRSY 13G QIS +28 410
#note i was too focussed on getting rid of my Q than looking at debbie's possible issue with the Z.  after the game debbie and I thought playing QIS at 14k would be better.....
>debbie_stegman: BEIRSTZ 14J ZITS +43 426
#note however it turns out that k14 QIS to block ZITS doesnt actually win. if i do this then she can play ZIT g13 and i play L8 LYE for 7 to tie the score.  debbie does 14E BE to be ahead by 14.  I can play off RO for 9 points in two places (11I OR, 4j TARO) to lose by one point.  
>james: LORY 7L RY.. +13 423
#note i play a phoney here (bizarro lack of focus at the end after just seeing i screwed up the endgame - though it turns out that maybe i didnt blow a win)
