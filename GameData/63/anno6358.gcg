>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEIMS 8D MEDIA +22 22
#note I don't quite understand why MEDIAE is what Q likes, other than the fact that MEDIA has like 17 hooks and it's better to kill 'em.  :)  Looby agreed with this play, though.
>John_Luebkemann: AIQU D8 .AQUI +32 32
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEFJSS E5 JEF.S +32 54
#note I really think J(A)DES is better looking back, though Q rates it fifth and I played this top play.
>John_Luebkemann: FO F5 OF +35 67
#note Ugh.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDILSSU 13B DISC +31 85
#note CUDS instead of DISC?
>John_Luebkemann: BEGIIMT I2 BIGTIME +75 142
#note Yes, he is BIGTIME.  I silently held (heh) 'cause I know BIGSHOT* is no good.  This is.  He does get away with a phony.  This ain't it.
>Ryan_Fischer: ELNOSTU 3E ELUT.ONS +59 144
#note Weird, I overdrew here, turned up an E, and said "ooh, tough decision"... but he threw back a consonant instead and I got this baby bing.
>John_Luebkemann: IPSZ F10 ZIPS +43 185
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IIKNOR 4L OINK +30 174
#note Feh.  He saw (S)KIORINg almost immediately when I asked.  Oh well.  :/
>John_Luebkemann: ANOR O4 .RONA +27 212
#note There are so many variants, I almost thought this was bogus.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAIRRT H1 RA. +13 187
#note No bings!  Phew!  (Though that makes me sad, and I'm pretty much done for at this point.)  I shouldn't give up, but I've lost so much momentum missing that one bing.
>John_Luebkemann: AEEGNNT B6 GANNETE. +66 278
#note Bogus.  D'oh.  Gibson kinda shook his head and laughed after the game.  GALLETED is what he was thinking of.  GANNET is a bird.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAIRTW N8 AWAITeR +74 261
>John_Luebkemann: CEOY N2 CO.EY +51 329
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: ALLTTUX 13I LUXAT. +26 287
#note Best.  Yay!
>John_Luebkemann: DEV -  +0 329
#note And count it!  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: BGLLOOT K8 BOLLO. +30 317
#note Best, but I'm hurting my chances of catching him if I don't get to that blank.  Just killing those lanes is painful.
>John_Luebkemann: DEV O13 DEV +37 366
#note So much for that hook.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEGORT A4 GRATE +35 352
#note Wow, A8 OARED 41!  I kinda like mine for making that lane easier to hit.
>John_Luebkemann: HY L12 H.Y +28 394
#note He has the blank now.  That's pretty much the ballgame.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEHOPR J13 .H +13 365
#note HOPED surrenders and gives him a likely high-scoring S play (not discounting an out bingo.  Gotta block and fish, which (U)H does.  Mental note: HOPED/EPHOD.  Apparently, simming UH after Champ has at it, about 30% of the time Looby will go catatonic, not block the two remaininging spots, a UH will allow me to bingo out and win!  :)
>John_Luebkemann: ?EIRUV C2 qUIVER +26 420
#note Aw.  :(
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEOPRW A10 PEW +27 392
>John_Luebkemann: N 2G N.. +7 427
