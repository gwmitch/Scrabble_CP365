#note NOCTUOID, which IS an adjective, plays equally well at 5C or 5G for 72 and is safer. But I don't know it, so here we go.
>Quackle: AHIOSTZ 15H HOATZI.S +320 438
#note The highest play I'd ever seen from Quackle before this was 230.
>New_Player: AGIQRST 10B QAT +38 160
#note ERUPTIVE takes an -S (-33.2).
>Quackle: ?AIOORS O4 ARIOSOs +117 555
#note I think any human player would put down OORAlIS at O2 here, hoping for the other W. What is there to lose?
>New_Player: AGIMPRS N4 PAM +29 189
#note Eh, I didn't really look at row 14 because I had it in the back of my mind to keep it open, but does it really matter at this point?
>Quackle: ?ADENOR 5E mAR.ONED +82 637
#note Slowing down with a double-double...

#note DYING, duh.
>Quackle: ACEENOT 12E ACETONE +62 740
#note Hey, I know that takes an -S!
>New_Player: AGMRSVY L10 VAS +32 276
#note I know this play isn't "right," but with the game somewhat out of hand, I decided to try to prevent Quackle from getting more easy points from this spot, with multiple spots to score with the M and Y to fall back on. However, the play in this spot is VIRGAS.

>New_Player: GJMRTXY 14I MY +32 308
#note Same play for two more at 10F.

#note REJIG.

>New_Player: EERSTX 3I EXE.TS +36 366
#note 2I SEXIER prevents the 830+ and is best for spread. I saw it, but I figured I'd stay on form and misplay the ending.
