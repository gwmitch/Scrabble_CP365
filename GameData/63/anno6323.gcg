#note This doesn't sim so badly, but the lane is going to be hard to block now, which is inadvisable. I missed the star play here - not the kind of thing I want to be missing.
>Tom_Singleton: WY 6J W.Y +30 125
#note He seems to be doing a better job of blocking up the board than I am. Not sure what to make of that.
>dacrON: AAEGGHR 11F HAG +26 232
#note Quackle likes G(US)H far more. I couldn't disagree more. Quackle seems to think the std dev of HAG is so large that next turn I may score very little. I do score very little, but not for the same reasons Quackle thinks I will :)

>dacrON: ACEGLRZ N12 C... +7 239
#note I didn't know that this play was right, but I think Quackle's suggestions aren't very good. The issue is,  want to accomplish something here, and no plays really do. Not sure what I should do, so this saved me time.

>dacrON: AEGLRWZ B10 GRAZE. +42 281
#note WARRE(D) wins the sim. Probably because of the comeback here, but there is no guarantee he has an A...and why bother making opening the board easier for him anyway? this still puts me up 52 with a not so nice pool.

#note I'm not debating Quackle here, it's pointless. I get that I missed W(AH)OO. but what the hell does he do after OD? OD neutralizes the board wonderfully. This play is maybe worse than W(AH)OO, but otherwise, a sweet play. Especially If i can get an A.

#note Quackle, I am not playing UN(COY) no matter how much you pay me. (T)WO seems to be a HUGE step up though. Or anything at K9 that takes nothing other than S. This play isn't so good, because it blocks ORA/AHA.

#note happy to see the last O, but now i need to avoid a bingo here.
>Tom_Singleton: EIIRV O4 VIRI.E +13 322
#note This basically ended the game
>dacrON: AEENOOU 13H .O. +4 370
#note gotta take out the huge Q spot.
>Tom_Singleton: EN N10 EN.... +11 333
>dacrON: AEENOUU 6N E. +4 374
#note I don't like dropping the O because I have NO/GO then QUA if I draw the Q. if I play OE then I am stuck doing UNCOY and needing a way to play it then - and I am almost out of time, too. Saving the O guarantees I play the Q if I draw it.
