#note 7G EIDE 21 -- IUY.  Well, it's better than scoring nothing.  He'd still have his next bingo, but I might have a little more hope.

#note E5 AuT(O)BAHN 98; I played that before long ago on ISC.  Not that I'd see it here!

#note I wonder if the 11J placement is better for the board.

#note Funny story: (not funny "ha-ha" but funny "ooowwww") he said he'd've had a 4th if he'd played the bingo elsewhere.  Observing the event changes it.  Yadda yadda*.

#note 13B COX(E)D 30.  But I like my play, saving the G to come back and hook my play.  The C, too, but not as potentially fruitful.  Might be able to backdoor an -ING bingo in two turns.

#note PA(N)GS mighta been a bit better for me in hindsight.  40 is a nicer number for not hitting anything better than a DLS, though!

#note Best.  :)  And blocked RATION(A)L, he said!  I had all but given up bingoing.  Leave it to him to find a way.  Another reason I might have wanted to play PA(N)GS (to open it more later).  To an L, my rack makes CUSPIDA(L).

#note Champ says W(AS) L10.  I don't know why.  Either of my better plays allow him a comeback.  I guess force him to play the K so it doesn't happen?  WI(V)E allows ALKIN(E) which I didn't see.  I had him figured for an O.  As in O well.
