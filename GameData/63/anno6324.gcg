#note W(HE)AL may be a bit better than this. I chose the points because sacrificing 20 pts for ESTU vs LU didn't seem worth it since I was keeping the U either way.

>dacrON: EELNOOU O7 OLEO +17 142
#note Needed this turn to capitalize. Unfortunately, this rack made that impossible. As it turned out, he had nothing there.

#note (SHE)RD maybe?

#note must've missed column J. Almost played OVERPLOT, but after our first game, decided not to risk it.

>dacrON: AFGILNS C3 GAN.F +35 306
#note The game losing turn. I considered (SHE)AF, but not (SHE)LF. (SHE)AF wins the sim, with (SHE)LF in second, my play about 5 points behind the former. I don't think this is really a game losing play. Given his rack, I think I was probably screwed anyway.
>Lester: ?DEGRUY 3A RU.GEDlY +63 362
#note An interesting thought which LEster and I talked about after the game: What if I had played (SHE)AF. What does he do here? I noticed he had GoD(CHILD), and he had GwE(DUCK) as a backup, so maybe something simply like (B)YE and then saving the H1 play for after. Again, this is if I'd played (SHE)AF.
>dacrON: ILNOSTW H11 ...WS +33 339
#note Just (SHE)W wins 16.7% of the time. This play 11%. I didn't really have it in me to leave the hook open since he has a 7/9 chance of having the S. This has the negative of emptying the bag though. Its fairly grim either way, but sometimes you have to be willing to give up the spread.
>Lester: AEFIIMO A1 FI.M +36 398
#note FE(R)MI is 6 better
>dacrON: EILNOST A1 ....LIEST +42 381
>dacrON: EILNOST --  -42 339
#note I thought maybe I could cut spread here, since he had blown our last game on an endgame mistake. I also thought it had a chance at being good.
>Lester: AEIO O1 .IE +16 414

>Lester: AO F2 O.A +6 420
#note A heartbreaker - my last chance for getting the last cash spot gone. A fun game though.
