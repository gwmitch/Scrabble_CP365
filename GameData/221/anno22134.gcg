#note MAULINGS is newly acceptable also
>JD: AEEEIIR H1 AERIE +22 40
#note playing at H1 seemed to leave a more open board configuration and more letters to play through than playing at H11.

#note down 160 points already, I feel that I have to open the 3x3 lane here.
>Jerry_Lerman: CEX B2 EX.C +26 226
#note jerry gave up a massive amount of points to play here - he may have had EXEC at H12, in fact!
>JD: ?AMRTWY 11D TRAMW.Ys +110 170
#note sweet, back to having a real chance!

>Jerry_Lerman: AK 10F KA +36 290
>JD: DGIIUUV L4 VI.ID +22 225
#note VIRID seemed to make it easier to open in future turns than VIVID (playing from the D)
>Jerry_Lerman: HIOR 14E RHI.O +16 306
>JD: GNNOTUU 8L .UNG +18 243
#note I saw OUTGUN but passed it up - that looks much better now. I liked that DUNG set up a potentially big bingo on O1, but the leave is much poorer.

#note gg
>JD: AEEIOOT M2 .OO +17 288
#note I can also totally give up on spread and play GOOIEST at 10J! but COO bingos more often
>Jerry_Lerman: AQT 1G Q.T +12 409
>JD: AEEITTW 13C WAE +14 302
#note I have something like a 20% shot at a bingo that is not easy to block by setting up TWAE on the left. quackle likes putting WAE at 10B because column A is harder to block, and possibly because I can draw ZIT for a good scoring play. he could easy hit me on row 15 after this play.

>JD: AEFIOTT B10 FATTIE +41 343
#note oops, this is a phony, as well as a terrible play! correct sequence is OFTER -> GAIT. was low on time
