#note Close call between this and exchanging.  I opted to play through because I kept 2 I's and I'd have a pretty good chance to underlap the Q on the next turn.  Q agrees - this is best.  That said, exchanging IIOQ and IIIOQ are also reasonable choices.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: OZ J6 ZO. +32 48
>Jim_Burlant: EEIINOT 10F INTO +26 45
#note  NITE/TINE 10E may be slightly better due to leave, but nothing really stands out in a sim.  OI 10E is also a good choice.  Pick your poison.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: HPT E10 PHT +23 71
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEINU D11 EAU +15 60
#note A bunch of mediocre options available.  Q likes 12A BEAUT for 20 - I don't, since I didn't want to open up the world for only 20 points when I could keep things tighter for 15.  Granted, the B isn't a great keep but it isn't too bad when I also have EIN to go with it.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BDLLOY C6 BOLDLY +24 95
>Jim_Burlant: BEGIIIN 11G GENII +25 85
#note Considered 8A BILGE and this.  I figured that as long as he didn't have the other Y, I'd rather unload 2 of my 3 I's.  Q says BILGE was the play and that this wins 3% less often than BILGE at an equity deficit of 6 points.  32% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ERY 8A RE.Y +33 128
>Jim_Burlant: ABEGIIV K2 VIGIA +29 114
#note Glad I didn't heed Quackle's suggestion of BILGE and have yet another set of triplicated I's to grind through.  Finally Q agrees with my choice - this is best, 31% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ENORRW 4G WRON.ER +24 152
>Jim_Burlant: BDEEEOW D4 WEED. +31 145
#note Q thinks that DWEEB 12K (which scores identically to this) wins 1-1/2% more often and sims roughly 1-1/2 points higher at 900 iterations.  Can someone explain why the duck keeps insisting I string the board wide open and slot the triple?
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EIV 2K .IVE +20 172
>Jim_Burlant: BEORRTU H1 BUR. +18 163
#note I rejected TURBO B2 because I didn't want to give back big X plays at A1.  (Maybe a touch of paranoia on my end, but notice how how every time I've opened up a spot that required a specific low-prob tile to burn me, he's had it). Never thought of BURRO and I whiffed on the WEEDY front hook, which ruled out BRUT.  This is a decent, not great, choice, but better plays were available.  BURRO would be my choice if I could do this turn again.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CDU 6A CU..D +12 184
>Jim_Burlant: EFOPRRT E3 FOR. +25 188
#note Q gives slight preference to L6 PROF, but this worked out.  Crawling back in - 42% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CE 13B EC. +10 194
>Jim_Burlant: DEEOPRT M4 .EPORTED +63 251
#note Only bingo - 83% to win in a short sim.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AGHNS N10 HANGS +50 244
>Jim_Burlant: ??EIOSU 14H SOUpIE.t +58 309
#note No bingoes play on row 13 and I knew I had to take out the S.  The trick to this position is that the best plays here leave the southeast alone, and most humans wouldn't so much as look for them:    dE(C)URIOnS, Ex(C)U(R)SIOn, SUc(C)O(R)IEs, and rE(C)U(R)SIOn down the A column. As for plays humans would find, the best looks to be cAEsIOU(S) on row 14, which I couldn't think of. 89% to win with SOUPIEST, which is halfway down the list.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AJM 13G JAM +32 276
>Jim_Burlant: AEFIOTT 8L F.AT +33 342
#note Would normally play FRIT, but the pool has 2 A's unseen and I'm sitting on the case I.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ALLMSSX 15D MALLS +39 315
