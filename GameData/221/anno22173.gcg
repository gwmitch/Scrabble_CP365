#note I held this word I had never seen before, until I realized that CONIOSIS was simply the ending of the longest word in the English language, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis!

>Josh: ELNOSST L3 TELSONS +68 122
#note Good thing I didn't go with my original idea of playing STENOLS*. I always think that's a word. I missed N5 LOSTNE(S)S, which is a better play than this
>Sam_Hollington: DEOPU 3I POU.ED +24 126
>Josh: ADEITUY 13F DUTY +29 151
#note Seemed the pool was consonant-heavy enough to take the risk and the points.

>Josh: ABCEEII N6 CEIBA. +29 180
#note In an unbelievable turn of events, when the game was still very close, Sam played F(O)UL, setting up a huge front A hook. He didn't notice it. I didn't notice it. I do not expect experts to make a play like FOUL in the game situation we were in, and my lack of expectation, rather my lack of credit given to Sam for making such a play completely backfired. He said that he definitely would not have played FOUL had he realized what he was opening! It was just a lapse that I could not take advantage of until it was too late... As you might guess, this is where the game turned for the worst.
>Sam_Hollington: WW H7 W.W +9 150
>Josh: EIIILRR 12C LIRI +11 191
#note M2 R(E)LIER may be worth taking the points. It probably is. I missed it.
>Sam_Hollington: ?EEINPT C8 PETa.INE +70 220
>Josh: EIOORRV 8A VI.ER +33 224
#note But I still could have controlled this game, as I had RI(E)VER for 39. I did not know the word though :(
>Sam_Hollington: EEKV 15A KE.VE +48 268
>Josh: AAEGOOR -AAGOOR +0 224
#note here is my biggest blunder of the game. I felt I needed to go for the blank here and bingo in one of the few spots left on the board, and nothing scored well or did anything worthwhile. Obviously any play forming A(FOUL) would have been more than worth it. 1J AGORAE being the best.
>Sam_Hollington: ANY O8 NAY +38 306
#note another ouch moment
>Josh: EGHIRRZ 2M REZ +32 256
#note I finally noticed A(FOUL). A very devastating moment in game indeed, but I kept my winning chances alive with this play.
>Sam_Hollington: AIM 1L AIM +15 321
#note But this play killed me.
>Josh: AGGHIRR D3 HAGGI.R +26 282
#note I was ready to play GHARRI H1 and bounce back into this game. I obviously assumed Sam didn't see AFOUL and this play confirmed that, but he unknowingly won the game here. So I decided to phony and hope that it was good and that it would get challenged, or that Sam would let it go but spend too long deliberating.
>Sam_Hollington: ?ADELTU F3 AULDEsT +71 392
#note only bingo, good find by Sam here to seal further what had already been sealed.

#note -3 to T(a)X at 11B. Sam was running low on time.
