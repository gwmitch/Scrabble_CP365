#note Best bingo for Chris.
>Jim_Burlant: BEIORSX 9C BOX +28 28
#note Given this position, this is an easy mistake to make.  But it's still a HUGE mistake that I made because I didn't look to do more than balance the rack and score 28.  BORAXES scores 64 as a non-bingo 2x2.
>Chris_Cree: BGINOST H6 BO.STING +62 136
>Jim_Burlant: EIIOORS -IOO +0 28
#note Q thinks it's not necessary to exchange, as its preference is 10C OI.  Then again, this worked out.
>Chris_Cree: DELOY 10B YODEL +39 175
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIRST K5 CRISTAE +96 124
#note Best bingo but still bleak - barely 17% winning chances.
>Chris_Cree: HPT J10 PHT +29 204
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIORU 6J U.AEI +9 133
#note Now the duck thinks I shouldn't play through and should exchange?  I put this down to open up the board because I figured rows 12 and 13 wouldn't stay open long.  8.5% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: ?ANORUW F6 WU. +15 148
#note What's sad is that I had written OUTDRAWN/UNTOWARD on my scoresheet, and I was so fixated on looking for a T that wasn't there that I didn't recognize that the D I just took out also worked.  UNWAXED E5 is best, the bingo is a close second, and this?  Pathetic.  But, if you need any further proof that there's too much luck in Scrabble, look no further than the rest of this game.

#note Or tROAKING.  I finally get one right.
>Chris_Cree: AV 8M .AV +18 273
>Jim_Burlant: AEHJNRT L11 HAJ +35 259
#note I wasn't sure about this turn and took forever on it.  HAJ scared me because of the I back hooks.  TAJ was somewhat safer but also gave back points and also scored 9 fewer points than this.  I considered ANTHER L9, but rejected it when I wondered what I'd do with the J on the next turn?  With every one of my options baggage-laden, I shrugged my shoulders and took the points, all the while crossing my fingers he didn't have ZAIRE.  Q agrees - this is best.  I've clawed my way back to 32% winning chances.
>Chris_Cree: EILNRST 14J TRINE +28 301
#note Actual rack.  Had I put down ANTHER, he'd have hit LINTERS on row 15 and the game would be over but for the final score.  Q  prefers that he play ELINT for 28.   Had he done that, this game would have taken a very differnent path.  Also - this was where Chris started bogging down and taking a lot of time on his turns.  This played a huge factor in how the rest of the game turned out. 
>Jim_Burlant: DEMNORT O12 MODE +37 296
#note Best - 29% to win.
>Chris_Cree: GSW F12 W.G +11 312
>Jim_Burlant: AEEINRT 15G RETIE +19 315
#note As tight as the board was, I had already expected the bingo to not go down, and I changed the emphasis of my play from rack building to turning tiles, keeping some vowels and consonants and trying to outrun him on each turn.  JIAO scores 28, but I was so concerned about his hitting something on row 15 like SUQ or, even worse, ZESTED that I wanted to kill that and never looked at JIAO.  33% to win.
>Chris_Cree: RS N13 S.R +7 319
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIINY 14B EYE +23 338
#note Paranoid about COZ or CUZ that I didn't recognize that this gave up a potential QI when I put it down.  Best looks to be 9M YE for 26.
>Chris_Cree: Q 11G Q. +11 330
>Jim_Burlant: AACEIIN 15A AI +9 347
#note The play I wish I'd seen was INIA I7 for 18, but I was playing a little too fast.  Failing that, this is best of the rest.
>Chris_Cree: LP N8 .LP +11 341
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINOO E4 COO +15 362
#note Making sure that ZA for 27 doesn't happen.  60% to win.
>Chris_Cree: ADFLSUV 4C VA. +16 357
#note Chris was way down on time by now and he only had less than 2 minutes to plan his end game.  His best play is the counterintuitive CUD 4E to set up his S at either D1 or H1, but it won't win for him; it will only preserve a handful of spread points.
