#note VID C2 sims "best", in that Q says it's one of several plays at 100% to win valuates better than the others at 100%.   

My phony bingo was off the board, since it was only 99.7% to win, but it valuates much better than everything except likely for the non-showing actual bingo I had - DEVISAL
