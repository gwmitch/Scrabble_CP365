#note DRyLOTS K2 looks to be the play here. I doubt I would have seen that.
>Josh: DEIIRSV E11 V.ID +16 110
#note This is a classic Josh play. I'm shaping the board, but very aggressively. I'm sealing a lot of the western quadrants but opening a huge spot that I'll usually be able to use very well in the near future. But the play here is definitely 6F VI(A). It's also defensive in the long turn, and there are many places for me to bingo on this board. No need to create another spot I may have to worry about later if my bingo does not fit there.

#note You wouldn't think this game would get interesting, but it did. Completely out of the blue!
>Josh: CIQRSUW C13 C.W +16 143
#note A simulation is telling me to be patient and just score for the time being with QU(A) or QU(A)I at 6F. It is true that I'm not down by too much, but I wanted to make sure Jack couldn't seal the game early by scoring well and taking up all of the hotspots. I stand by this play.
>Jack_: DEIKN G4 INKED +28 220
>Josh: ILQRSSU O8 SQUIRLS +119 262
#note What an amazing pull. This is definitely the only time I will ever get to play this word. It's one of my favorites from the new list.
>Jack_: AAAGIIT 10A TAIGA +17 237
#note Great strategical choice of TAIGA over AGITA for two fewer. The pool is consonant-heavy and Jack can make much better use of the triples he is opening with TAIGA.
>Josh: AEFGIIN H1 NAIF +42 304
#note What an amazing thing it would be if Jack could hit the 3x3 after this. I was not concerned and I definitely shouldn't sacrifice so much to block the 3x3 with FA(T)ING here. But although I also considered NEIF, I didn't think it was better to keep AGI over EGI here, but it obviously is. EG combo sucks. 
>Jack_: AILNRTU A8 RU.ILANT +131 368
#note Whoa!
>Josh: ABEGIMN 1F BE.AMING +64 368
#note And here I thought I was in great shape with my bingo! I should probably play the other BENAMING as it gives less back. Both Y's are out and his rack is random and therefore probably heavy. Would not want him to hit me hard after this.
>Jack_: DEEOP 2B EPODE +26 394
>Josh: ALNPRYY D1 P.LYNYA +36 404
#note I figured I was sacrificing a lot of win percentage here by not playing 3 or 4 tiles, giving myself tempo in the endgame and complicating the game for Jack, but who cares?! I get to play POLYNYA! The best play is probably 3G P(I)NY, blocking the huge J spot and forcing Jack to either not score or empty the bag and leave himself vulnerable in the endgame.
>Jack_: BEEGMOT M1 .EMOT +16 410
#note Jack looked very hard for a winning play, and ended up going with this. Is it enough?
>Josh: EJORTVZ 3G J.VER +53 457
#note Wow, so close. I almost played TR(O)OZ 4K thinking that his best out after that was BEG(S) 8K for 10, and that I won by 6 instead of by a measly point, but luckily I realized that he had BEG/(GEMOT)E just in time!
