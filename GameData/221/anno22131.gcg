#note right idea, FEEB is worse than exchanging because it gives so much back, but the correct play looks like GONEF which gives away fewer free points
>Alan_Whitman: DEZ K4 ZED +37 61
>JD: FFPQRTU 6F PUFF.. +21 54
#note massive error, PFFT at 7E keeps the U!!
>Alan_Whitman: ACD L3 CAD +40 101
>JD: EKOQRTW L8 WOK +22 76
#note playing TOKER or TOWER sets up a QI spot and turns over a bunch of tiles to improve my chances of drawing an I or U.
>Alan_Whitman: ??ADRSV 2H ADViSoR +91 192
#note I had my work cut out for me!

#note with both blanks gone, keeping strong leaves becomes a greater priority, but this scores too much, opens a nice threat and should combine well with all the vowels left in the pool.

>JD: INORSST C4 O.STRINS +68 355
#note I actually didn't even think of NOSTRILS, but this play blocks more lanes on the board which makes it better

>JD: AHINTTY 3L .YAN +45 400
>Alan_Whitman: EU M12 .UE +6 315
>JD: AHIINTT 4C .ATH +28 428
#note I can also play something like SHIT/SITH to block, but OATH makes the prospect of outrunning a bit safer
>Alan_Whitman: AENOPST E8 TOEPANS +71 386
>Alan_Whitman: AENOPST --  -71 315
>JD: CEIINTV 10A VI.IC +12 440
#note I have to block TEOPANS at B9 also, the best way to do this is INVITE at 10B which leaves tons of outs, but my play does the job.
>Alan_Whitman: AENOPST E8 PA.ES +23 338
#note he should block ENTIA by playing POST
#note ran out of time to find the new outs he gave me!
