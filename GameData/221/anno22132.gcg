#note this play makes it possible that he doesn't know either FONDS or FONDU
>JD: AFNORTY F6 FRAY +29 67
#note it will take some work to start finding TRAYF consistently. I also debated playing FOGY, which sims evenly with FRAY - ANRT is a major upgrade as a bingo leave, but FOGY gives up free points at H11.

>JD: BENOORT 12K BOO +18 85
#note quackle doesn't like this placement of BOO, since it gives up cheap scores on row 13. given his last play, he's presumably very close to a bingo, so I liked the idea of forcing him to bingo on column N and give me back a shot at the triple word score. But there's also a good chance he has an A, so I might just be giving him huge bingos on row 13! I think my play is fine against a realistic range of racks.

#note he didn't try FONDS, so he must have some doubts about it.

#note could tell this wasn't a great play, but didn't come up with the best option of APHONY at D4 which is new. I saw TOPHI for 40 and probably shoud've taken that, but I wanted to be more proactive about blocking lanes - but really, the board is still plenty open after my play.

#note important to play this before EX to block up the new lanes on rows 1 and 2
>Daniel_Novinson: GIP K1 PIG +20 311
>JD: CEELRRX 13B EX +41 393
#note the best play is ingenious - CREEP at A8 to set up my X if I draw another E. It als oturns over a couple of extra tiles in search of the blank.

#note I was low on time and went for the sure block of the new lane and emptying thebag so he couldn't fish for anything, but I'm up enough that I should really just play CEE to block at 3B, in which case I can outrun any of the row 14 bingos (although any bingo like EOSINES, ENSILES, HOLSTEIN at row 13 or TELSONIC at row 13 still should beat me).
