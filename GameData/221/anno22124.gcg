#note Always nice when the first rack of your tournament is an easy-to-find natural bingo.

#note Had the annoying feeling that I should have been scoring more with this rack, but I never saw 10A FOHN or FOH. A sim indicates that this isn't much of a miss, and I seriously doubt I would have gone to the races like I did had I found FOHN/FOH.  
>Darrell_Day: OT F10 TO +11 38
>Jim_Burlant: ACEHINN 12F ENCHAIN +83 179
#note Bingoes all over the place but this is best.  Of note:  ANHEDONIC on row 11!
>Darrell_Day: ILO H12 .OIL +18 56
>Jim_Burlant: AELOOUU -OOUU +0 179
#note Play through?  Exchange?  I considered 11I ALOE and 15H LUAU and couldn't wrap my arms around keeping OUU for only 21 or scoring nothing and keeping all those vowels.  A sim is pretty much a tossup between ALOE and this choice.  This has the highest valuation but wins roughly 0.25% less often than ALOE atop the sim.  92.2% to win.
>Darrell_Day: CEEIORT L5 ERECTIO. +63 119
#note Only bingo for Darrell.
>Jim_Burlant: AELRSTV 5K L.V +12 191
#note With ENCHAIN back hooks blocked, no bingoes play.  I considered CAVE on row 8 but didn't like leaving myself without vowels and AERST was too strong to pass up as a bingo fish.  Q agrees  - this is best.

>Jim_Burlant: AEEIRST 15E EAR.IEST +70 261
#note I took a while on this turn, which came down to N1 SERIATE and this.  SERIATE scores 75 to this choice's 70. However, with ?? unseen it opens up both the O column as well as 3x3's on row 1.  This isn't airtight either, but (a) it takes out PINKO, PINKY, and PINKS possibilities, and (b) if he doesn't have a Z, he can't punish me with a bingo-equivalent anywhere.  I'd rather let him play down the N column and give me counterplay down the O column.  A 2-ply sim agrees with me; Championship Player thinks I should take the points with N1 SERIATE.  YMMV.
>Darrell_Day: GU M3 GU. +14 161
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRYY 14B RAINY +47 308
#note Again, not airtight - GRAINY/BRAINY front hooks could cause problems down the A column, but 47 points is 47 points.  Also - blanks are unseen and this turns 5 tiles instead of 3 for YAY.  Q agrees - this is best.  98.6% to win.
>Darrell_Day: NTU 8L .UNT +18 179
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIPWY 15A YEW +34 342
#note My primary concern was making sure that GRAINY/BRAINY front hooks didn't burn me.  Again, not air-tight - something like RAJ could score 49, but that's still more palatable than letting him have 86 for ZEBU.  A sim gives the slightest of preferernces to N5 YAWNED, as it turns 5 tiles instead of 3 with the blanks unseen.  It also kills the N column and restricts the O column. That said, YAWNED and YEW are virtually indistinguishable in a sim.  I'm okay with this.
>Darrell_Day: IMX N4 MIX +39 218
#note It's DEV that now takes the I, not LEV.  Whoops.  Gotta pay more attention and review the new 4's again since they obviously didn't take.
>Jim_Burlant: ABDIPQU N8 .IQAB +36 378
#note Whoops x 2.  It's not often that, with a 124-point lead, dumping the Q for 36 points while taking out two bingo lanes isn't the best play, but that's the case here.  QUIP scores 64 at O1 but I never saw it because I'd had tunnel vision about shutting down the N and O columns.  This is a mistake I can live with, but it's still a mistake.  Fortunately with a lead this big the only real loss is equity and this now limits him to the G, H, and I columns, which I'm about to shut down on the next turn.  
>Darrell_Day: ARZ 6B ZAR. +36 254
>Jim_Burlant: DILPUUW 7H PIU +14 392
#note Ok, I can't score, but I can defend.  Q wants me to groom the rack and leave the bingo lines open - I'd rather just end this game right now.
