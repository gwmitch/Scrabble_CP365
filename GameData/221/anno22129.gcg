>Jim_Burlant: ADEHLOT 8H LOATHED +80 80
#note Ridiculous - this is my third opening rack bingo in 5 games.  
>Sid_Murrali: NTV M7 V.NT +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: BDIIJNR 9F DJIN +26 106
#note Strong play but not best:  JIRD scores 29 at 9G.  Still in good shape - Almost 81% to win.
>Sid_Murrali: ?EEGNST J6 Gr.NTEES +77 89
#note K5 TENTAGES 82.
>Jim_Burlant: BEIIORU 11G OUR.BI +16 122
#note I chose this over the 12G placement because this doesn't give back as many easy plays as row 12.  All that amounts to is that this play is bad and playing row 12 is worse, because OUREBI scores 30 at 8A.  Board blindness.  
>Sid_Murrali: EG 9M .EG +7 96
>Jim_Burlant: EFFGIVW 12D VIFF +31 153
#note At least I get this right.  This is clearly best, and it's just shy of 69% to win.
>Sid_Murrali: EILPRST 13H RE.PLITS +72 168
#note This is the only bingo for Sid, and it's 48% to win...but not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGSTW 14B WASTAGE +78 231
#note You know you're being a luck box when your previous play forces you to keep EGW and you draw AAST and it plays.  This is my only bingo and it's a hair over 70% to win.
>Sid_Murrali: AHI 13B AHI +33 201
#note This is where Sid got hosed by the draw for the rest of the game.  He told me his rack during our post-mortem - I don't remember specifics but it was ghastly.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIILOW 15F WOE +35 266
#note What drawing!  I was initially going to play OI or OIL 15G, but realized that I was still addled with the rancid W, and that WOE scored 35.  I felt the rack grooming could wait one turn because the only two easy lines (row 6 and the F column) were going to probably yield air balls, and the K column would be tough to hit.  Q agrees - this is clearly best.   OI and OIL win 2-1/2% less often and evaluate over 7 points down on this.
>Sid_Murrali: AMY 15A MAY +39 240
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIILO F2 IDOLIzE. +63 329
#note And I pull DEO out of the bag.  The bingo only scores 63, but the non-bingo options don't even score 20, so bingoing is best.  This is microscopically better than IDOLIsED since you can't front-overlap the Z.  93% to win.
>Sid_Murrali: ACMOOOP -ACMOOO +0 240
>Jim_Burlant: CELNNRR 4D CL.NER +18 347
#note Nothing really scores or provides a lock-down defensive play, so the play is to flip as many tiles as possible and hasten the end of the game.  This is best - 98% to win.
>Sid_Murrali: AKO E2 KO.A +29 269
>Jim_Burlant: EINOPRU O11 OP.IN +30 377
#note Again, no airtight options are available, I saw 30 points for this and that was that.  It takes a while for the sim to sort itself out, but this eventually bubbles its way to the top of the heap.  8A PURINE or UNROPE are also good choices.
>Sid_Murrali: AO D11 A...O +19 288
>Jim_Burlant: ADENRRU 3H DARNER +22 399
#note I was fixated on killing bingo lines, so I saw this, saw 6 tiles turned, the elimination of bingoes on row 3 (MAESTRO, MAESTRI), and that was that.  I didn't like giving back a potential QUEY for 52 with this play, but I do keep the U and I hopefully could draw into a Q play of my own if he hits QUEY.  In hindsight my analysis was incomplete:  8A plays like CAIQUE, CASQUE, etc. are also a threat, and given that, an option I didn't consider that looks good is ENDURE 8A.  It outscores this by 2 and prevents 78-point Q plays that could make the end game interesting. I don't know if this is as bad as Quackle thinks (certainly if he has AEMORST or AEIMRST), but ENDURE does look good given the number of rack killers in this pool.  I guess the play here depends on whether you think Sid is fishing for a bingo or a Q bomb?

#note Well, that worked out.
>Sid_Murrali: CRSY N3 SCRY +25 349
>Jim_Burlant: ABEMUU 2I BEAM +25 466
#note Sid was way down on time and I fast-played, since I knew this would put him over.
>Sid_Murrali: EOT 1K TE +12 361
>Jim_Burlant: UU 15N U. +2 468
>Sid_Murrali: O 6N .O +5 366

#note Sid went over on time - final score 468 - 348.
