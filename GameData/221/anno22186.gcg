>Jennifer_Lee: ?CEENPT E8 .NCEPTEd +72 97
#note I saw P(RE)TENCES but thought you could only spell it as PRETENSES.
>Winter: EGILNSV 14B SLE.VING +90 138
#note Quackle prefers (d)EVLINGS. 
>Jennifer_Lee: IIJNRSU H12 JI.N +57 154
>Winter: BOOR 15A BOOR. +28 166
>Jennifer_Lee: IORSTUW D11 WO +23 177
#note WI(N) at 9C is an interesting choice, setting up the T(WIN) hook. 
>Winter: GISW 9C WI.GS +28 194
>Jennifer_Lee: FIRRSTU I3 FRUI. +12 189
#note Quackle likes my play best! 
>Winter: FY J2 FY +24 218
>Jennifer_Lee: EMRRSTU K10 UM +13 202
#note Did not know (A)RMURE, at 8J. I did think of (A)RUM, but it scored so little. I guess my play did not score much more and had an inferior leave. 
>Winter: AHO C9 .OAH +24 242
>Jennifer_Lee: ENORRST 8J .R +2 204
>Winter: ADL 13G D.AL +17 259
>Jennifer_Lee: AENORST L6 TREASON +80 284
#note I saw (N)ORTENAS after I hit the clock. It scores one point more, but I think I prefer how TREASON closes down the board given that I am up after bingoing. Perhaps my play was short-sighted given the narrow lead. Quackle likes TREASON best. 
>Winter: PTT 5H P.TT +12 271
>Jennifer_Lee: ADEIIIU -AIIIU +0 284
#note I saw ADIEU, but was loathe to leave II.  I don't know if I would have played it instead of exchanging. Given one blank still out, Quackle wants me to dump all 7 tiles.
>Winter: AX M8 AX +38 309
>Jennifer_Lee: CDEGKTU 2J .UCKED +32 316
#note GUCK at M11 leaves the much nicer DET leave. It scores nearly as well as my play, with a superior leave. 
>Winter: AAEILRS N9 AERIALS +78 387
>Winter: AAEILRS --  -78 309
>Jennifer_Lee: DDEGOQT M11 DOG +18 334
#note Quackle wisely wants me to play long to try to pick up something to help the Q.
>Winter: AAEILRS N8 LEA +20 329
#note I talked to Winter after the game about this turn. Her saw the S(WINGS) hook, but was concerned he would turn over 7 tiles and pick up the Q. He was also concerned that AERIALS would set up a big Q play for me along Column A. Finally, he thought that playing short and dragging out the game would push me overtime, which it did. 
>Jennifer_Lee: AADELQT 1N DA +21 355
#note Forgot TALAQ, though it only plays at O10, leaving a highly dangerous S hook to the TWS. I was very low on time by this point.
>Winter: HIO 3L HOI +35 364
>Jennifer_Lee: AEEILQT O9 LATE +18 373
#note Dang, EALE at 4L scores 38. I need to learn my fours.
>Winter: AI 4L AI +27 391
>Jennifer_Lee: ?EIIQV B7 QIs +20 393
#note I missed the ISO hook. I was over time at this point and desperate to dump the Q.
>Winter: EERSU 14M ERE +12 403
#note Outplay E(N)SURE at 15G. A bit stricky to see.
>Jennifer_Lee: EIV 7B .I +12 405
#note Missed by outplay (N)EVI.
>Winter: SU 4H U. +8 411
#note Winter played short to push me over time. Also, he thought I was V-stuck, which I also thought.
>Jennifer_Lee: EV 12C ...E +9 414
