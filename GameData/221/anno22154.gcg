>Judy_Newhouse: AAFLT H4 FATAL +24 24
>Matthew_Larocque: LMNOSSY I7 YOM +26 26
#note Almost played MOS(T)LY, and I forgot MOLY was a word. It takes an S! I just don't like to show an extra S unless I get a decent play out of it.
>Judy_Newhouse: AQ 6F QA. +32 56
>Matthew_Larocque: ELLMNSS G5 L.M +21 47
#note Again, passed up M(A)LLS to not show the extra S. I didn't know LEMAN.
>Judy_Newhouse: GUV J8 GUV +23 79
>Matthew_Larocque: ELLNSSZ 11J SELL +16 63
#note Oops, SNELL sets up my other S! I saw SEZ but didn't want to keep LLNS.
>Judy_Newhouse: ?EIIKNR M7 KINd.IER +84 163
#note Good find.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEGNSZ 8L Z.NG +72 135
#note Keeping the Z pays off.
>Judy_Newhouse: AEIUX N4 AUXI.E +37 200
#note ARGH! I held this forever. I didn't think AUXIN took the E hook, but I'd be in big trouble if I pass and she destroys that corner hotspot.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEEEOS O1 SEED +26 161
#note This felt like a forced move to keep me alive. I mean, do I play OE instead for no points? The leave just isn't good enough.
>Judy_Newhouse: IIII -IIII +0 200
#note Big break.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEENOOO L11 .ODEN +23 184
#note Damn it. I thought LOOED was phony. That's so much better than this.
>Judy_Newhouse: HITW M1 WHIT +24 224
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEEEOO O8 .EODE +11 195
#note Passed on ODEO(N), gives back a lot and makes it easy for her to block this side of the board.
>Judy_Newhouse: IO N1 OI +22 246
>Matthew_Larocque: DENOORW 15G WOODE. +30 225
#note I was really sad there wasn't a floating E here.
>Judy_Newhouse: CCSTU H10 STUCC. +11 257
#note Interesting.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BFNNRY N13 FRY +31 256
#note F(ER)NY! Undoubling the Ns makes a big difference.
>Judy_Newhouse: AIORT 13C AORTI. +18 275
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BGNNPR D12 B.NG +18 274
#note PR(O)NG?
>Judy_Newhouse: EIJV E9 JIVE. +34 309
#note Well, that hurt. PR(O)NG would have been worse.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANNPRT 10D N.P +11 285
#note Hoping she cannot block this. Maybe P(I)N would be even better - no TAJ/RAJ/HAJ.
>Judy_Newhouse: AEP 15A PEA. +21 330
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANORRT 14A OR +12 297
#note No bingos.
>Judy_Newhouse: A 15N .A +15 345
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAINRT C4 ANTIARs +63 360
#note Time to get this game over with.
