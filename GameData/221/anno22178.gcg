>Josh: ACDEMOU H4 COUDE +22 22
#note Game 1 of this 13-game tournament. I am playing lowest to highest seed in a snake round robin as I am 1st seed. My last game against Fern was at Nationals in Buffalo, and I somehow managed to beat her. I do think she is underrated. The other options here are DOUMA for 20 and ODEUM for 22, and I didn't consider either since I prefer to keep an M early on over a C and I didn't see any higher-scoring play that got rid of my U. I also like COUDE, as it isn't played very often and can often either get challenged (unlikely) or win me a free turn if my opponent attempts to pluralize. UPDATE: COUDES is a word now. That changes everything here... I would have been devastated losing a challenge I was so sure I would win...
>Fern_Lindzon: AEGINOT 4G O.A +5 5
#note This may not have been her rack, but based on her next rack, this makes perfect sense. Fern struggled for 5 minutes to find a play here, and it's definitely worth considerable time. I believe the right play here is 4C AGONI(C) after 5 minutes, since if you hit another almost bingo-rack next turn, that's going to kill you in the endgame as you won't have enough time to figure things out. This does fork the board nicely though, she just has to hope for something next turn.
>Josh: ?AAAIMX 5E AXI.M +34 56
#note I was thankful she gave me more points for this play.
>Fern_Lindzon: EGINNPT 3I TENPIN +24 29
#note I think this is what she told me she had, hence the previous rack. 16:18 was how much time she had left after this play.
>Josh: ??AANQZ 2M QAt +37 93
#note Other option here is 4A QANAt which I somehow missed. That seems like a good play, I might make it in a do-over, although it seems that this has much superior board control and defense, especially since she is likely to have drawn an S to hook TENPIN.

#note 20:38
>Fern_Lindzon: CDEKL C3 L.CKED +28 71
>Josh: ?AAGNTW B7 WANTAGe +70 206
#note This is a Josh-like play. I played it to keep the bottom right a bit less accessible and openable, but it obviously gives her easy scoring plays, and given her time trouble, I should definitely have opted for the saner placement.
>Fern_Lindzon: BI A8 BI +32 103
>Josh: BGJLSST J2 J.SS +48 254
#note 17:45. This is an obvious play but I looked hard to see if there were any options that didn't shed both of my S's.
>Fern_Lindzon: DLOR C11 LORD +17 120

#note 16:49
>Fern_Lindzon: EPRU G8 PURE +11 131
#note Fern was down to 7:22 here.
>Josh: GHLNRRT 10F G.RRL +12 299
#note This is definitely the equity play. The pool is very nice for HNT and much less nice for RR, which is why I opted to play this over 11F L(E)NGTH, but I immediately regretted that. I still think I would make this play in a do-over though. It's harder for Fern to bingo twice after this compared to after LENGTH, but this doesn't slow her down in the immediate future. She is probably holding something like EIR.
>Fern_Lindzon: EEIIRRV 12G RIVIERE +79 210
#note Damn :(
>Josh: AAEHNTT 11K HAT +26 325
#note I tunneled here and forgot about 1E HATE/HAET. Those are definitely better, imo. 13:26 (I tunnel for long periods of time)
>Fern_Lindzon: ATU D10 UTA +17 227
>Josh: ADEENOT E11 ODEA +24 349
#note I might even have had a bingo here if it weren't for my tunnel vision. Here I was just making sure I was winning the game by closing down one of the two lanes.

>Josh: AEEMNST N7 MEANEST +79 428
#note 10:47
>Fern_Lindzon: EEHINTV O6 HINT +33 283
#note This was a good endgame play, guaranteeing outs for Fern in multiple spots and scoring well, but O5 EVENT is better by 10 points.
>Josh: EIIOSY 6J YO.I +39 467
>Josh: EIIOSY --  -39 428
#note The extent of my greediness will show in this tournament. I just wanted to make sure I was making JESSY* up
