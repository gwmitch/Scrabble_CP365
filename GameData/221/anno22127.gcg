#note Find a good play, look for a better one.  I was so happy to recognize VALIDITY (prior to his play I was expecting to play TIVY somewhere) that I slapped it down.  LIVIDITY scores 75 at J7 and/or J3.  But, given the outrageous luckbox day I was having, this wound up benefitting me.  Play incorrectly scored as 67.

#note Benefitting from my mistake on the last turn.  If I play LIVIDITY as I should have, I'm "only" scoring 64 at 9B on this turn instead of 94 here.
>Paul_Holser: AFMO N11 FOAM +35 138
>Jim_Burlant: BIIOPSS J10 BIO +28 188
#note The only 8 is BIOPSIES.  With the S hook open down the O column I saw no need to burn one of the duplicated S's.  The idea was to score 28 and use one of my dupe S's to take out O11 on the next turn.  The duck agrees - this is best.

#note Had to miss one some time.   I was so obsessed with restricting the southwest that I whiffed on the two standouts: CWM J4 33 and 7D UNWOVE 24.  UNWOVE is the best play from the rack management standpoint, but Paul is still close enough that it could let him back into the game if he's got a 4 ending in H or P (I've got the case M).  Of the available options, CWM would be my choice if I could do this turn again, as it doesn't give him easy points back if he can't bingo to the C that it hangs.

#note No bingoes play, which made this a hard turn.  Breaking up the rack felt wrong and I didn't want to give him much to work with.  Placing the G here left him fewer options than if I played GUL on row 9.  If he still hit for 60 through the G, he'd probably float the vowel I would need for an 8.  Quackle says says I should score 22 with CURVE on row 7.  In theory, that works since ER are the most probable tiles in the pool and without a bingo Paul will be helpless.  That said - it's also a tough call for a human to make since I can only heuristically examine the pool where Quackle knows with 100% certainty whether any bingoes will play.  I'd rather not chance blowing up this rack if I don't have to.  I'm not entirely thrilled with this, but I'm not sold on blowing the rack apart and opening the board given this pool, either.  Regardless, this worked out.
