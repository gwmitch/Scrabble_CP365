>Lisa_Odom: ?BIRSVY 8G IVY +18 18
#note Quackle likes 8H better here, but other options besides IVY aren't even worth considering. I like my placement of IVY better because it creates two lanes seperated by a V.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AOW H7 A.OW +10 10
>Lisa_Odom: ?BOORSU 11B BURgOOS +77 95
#note Best play! Took me a while. How about 7E RUBABOOS for 73? Who would see that?
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGNORS 10H .AGONERS +68 78
#note Dd5 GROANERS is best for Carol but this is more stylish.
>Lisa_Odom: AADDLMT O7 MAD. +21 116
#note Saw 11K MAD for 25 points but wanted to take out cheap points in the triple lane. My play is 9th simming closely with 8 other plays.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EITX F5 EXIT +37 115
>Lisa_Odom: ADLTVWZ M9 V.LDT +26 142
#note 2nd best play. 5A WALTZED which I didn't see scores 40 but dangles a W in the triple line and my play keeps a Z with safer positioning.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENRRTU C7 NURT.RE +18 133
>Lisa_Odom: AAANTWZ N5 AZAN +39 181
#note 3rd best play but top scoring if the W was the 7th letter on my rack. E5 WAT keeping the Z and two A's is Quackle's top choice. Mine is 3rd.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGIKOU L12 OI +12 145
#note Wonder what Carol was trying to do here.
>Lisa_Odom: AELPTUW E2 WAUP +26 207
#note Phony! And not even held. E5 WAP is clearly better but my play has the best leave. Mine is 3rd when compared to valid plays.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEHIN 12A HE.EIN +37 182
#note Nice overlap by Carol!
>Lisa_Odom: AEHLNTY O1 LATHY +50 257
#note Best play! Finally!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ELO A12 .OLE +21 203
>Lisa_Odom: ?DEFINO 11J OF +23 280
#note 2nd best play! I missed cONFIDE B1 for 80. 17.3 equity bleed. Bad play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ERT 8A TR.E +15 218
#note I burned a lot of time on this play so Carol senses I have the blank and is shutting off bingo lines. Smart move!
>Lisa_Odom: ?DEGGIN 7M G.. +8 288
#note My fish doesn't sim, but it is reasonable given the rack. M3 GED which blocks bingo lanes is apparently the best.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AQT G3 QAT +27 245
#note Blocking the A. Wise move because I am close.
>Lisa_Odom: ?DDEGIN 14C DEeDING +72 360
#note Unfortunately for Carol, my incompetence only goes so far. How did I miss 15A ENGIRDED or 15A ENGILDED for 83 points? At least I bingoed here. There was nothing Carol could really do when I got the blank in the long run. Just prolong my bingo.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CER 2B CRE. +18 263
#note Carol setting up an S? We'll see!
>Lisa_Odom: CEEFINP H1 PEIN +35 395
#note Yay knowledge of four letter words! Best play! I think this and DEEDING were the ICING plays.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IJMS M2 JISM +34 297
>Lisa_Odom: ABCEFII 15G FA +26 421
#note 6th best play! c1 BRIEF is best for 20, I'm just paranoid.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EKLOSU I1 ELS +23 320
#note Carol's best play is A2 SOKE for 23 points according to Quackle. I think 4G ANKUSESfor 22 is better because it leaves better scoring outs I think. I don't know I'm tired. Point is ELS isn't a good play because Carol can't go out in 2.
>Lisa_Odom: BCEII C1 C.IB +16 437
#note Best play! I was very low on time.
>Jonathan_Lindh: KOU 2H ..K +17 337
#note 2nd best play! KOR B6 for 19 is better.
>Lisa_Odom: EI N10 .IE +9 446
#note Carol was upset she lost so she didn't challenge RIE* a phony 3! B7 IRE for 7 or A8 TIE for 3 points are my valid out. TIE I actualy saw.
>Lisa_Odom:  (OU) +4 450
#note A B- ish game with 2 unchallenged phonies and 2 blank bingos. I've come to the point where my B- is good for 450 points with both blanks. I'll take that. Game scored as 450-335 because Carol scored JISM as 32 instead of 34. Correct score 450-337.
