>Deen_Hergott: EEJP 8F JEEP +26 26
>Josh: EEHNORV 9H HOVE +21 21
#note It was an interesting choice here between 9F OH, NOH and both 7H and 9H HOVE. I ultimately decided that I was more liable to get punished after OH (Deen's placement of JEEP may sometimes infer that he has a nice reunderlap of JO and clunkier tiles). Therefore the equity of OH wasn't actually something to seek in my play. Same went for NOH. In the end I decided to play this HOVE because it shapes the board very well, and given Deen's likely clunk, he can't usually punish me after HOVE.
>Deen_Hergott: DIY 8K YID +13 39
#note Success!
>Josh: EGIMNRS H7 M.. +8 29
#note This was tough, though! I did not see the simplest play, L7 M(I)RING. I don't think I was aware of that word being valid in the first place. That's definitely the play to make if I don't want to fish here, but creating a very tight board while drawing into a bingo so often seemed attractive enough to be worth it. This is the type of board I like to think I do well on. Most would open a second bingo lane, but there is nowhere for Deen's usual range to go and many spots for me to go after M(EH)!
>Deen_Hergott: CEIKP M3 PICKE. +32 71
#note The clunk has clunked.
>Josh: EGINRRS 4H RERIS.NG +74 103
>Deen_Hergott: IORU O4 .UIRO +18 89
#note Deen never draws well against me it seems. Maybe he will later on.
>Josh: ADIINNO H1 NOI. +12 115
#note This position completely stumped me. I missed F6 AD(J)OIN, which is really bad to miss, and also missed 7H (M)AID. Those plays both seem to make more sense than this play. I'm in trouble very often after NOI(R). I don't know, this was a clear mistake.
>Deen_Hergott: EHU F8 .EHU +22 111
>Josh: ADILNOS 5B LADINOS +71 186
#note And yet... I unfortunately only had 11:34 on my clock after this play. I would need to think fast for the rest of the game.
>Deen_Hergott: AFX E9 FAX +54 165
>Josh: AAFIIOT 4A TAFIA +33 219
#note 11:05.
>Deen_Hergott: ABEIRTU 1D BRAU.ITE +63 228
#note At least all of these damn U's Deen is drawing didn't stop him from keeping the game within reach.
>Josh: AIOSTTY 2B TOY +19 238
#note I chose this TOY over 6E for 20 because this prevented Deen from hitting me with a few different things at A1 or 2B, but I missed OATY in the same spot, which looks barely worth two extra points.
>Deen_Hergott: NOW 6J WON. +19 247
>Josh: ?ADISST 12F SADISTs +83 321
#note This, on the other hand, was ridiculous. Coupled with Deen's previous play that even if correct looks worse than average (i.e bad draw), this play increased my chances of winning by at least 35% from last turn.
>Deen_Hergott: ALNV 3G V.NAL +20 267
>Josh: AADELRZ 1A ZA +35 356
#note Really? Another amazing pull that increases my winning chances by another 5% at least. Despite being 13 more points, H11 A(D)ZED is not worth it here, unless I expect to draw well for the rest of the game at the expense of my opponent, which is likely what would hapeen no matter what play I make. 
>Deen_Hergott: ERW H12 .REW +24 291
>Josh: ADEEELR 14G L.ADER +11 367
#note The questing at hand here is: "Am I far enough ahead that I can afford to sacrifice a lot of equity for defense?"

Interestingly Quackle does not think so. Instead it wants me to play 2B (TOY)ED and outrun Deen + hopefully avoid the Q. I think that's insane. Even if I get Q-stuck after this play, I don't see myself losing. That being said, I think RE(E)LED is probably better here. The A is nice.
