>Puneet_Sharma: AAEIRST 8F ARISTAE +66 66
#note I don't even flinch. Even without working out my play, I assume I'm going to score at least 20, and from my point of view, Puneet is actually behind.
>Winter: BEEOOPT 7H BOEP +22 22
>Puneet_Sharma: AW 9J AW +16 82
#note Pay close attention to this play. It will become a pattern.	
>Winter: EEFNOTW 6I OW +31 53
#note FETA takes an L as well as an ess, so I choose WETA instead. You might think I'd want an open board since I'm "behind", but I actually prefer a closed board, because I think I'm heavily favoured win if bingos are impossible.
>Puneet_Sharma: AF F6 FA. +14 96
#note Spectacular.
>Winter: EEEFNOT E3 OFTEN +23 76
#note Would rather not have given up the S hook, but on this board, turnover favours me, to draw an S or E. Quackle likes the short play, but I expect Puneet to close up whatever spot I open, so I'd rather take the points and the turnover. Remember, I'm playing the opponent, not just the tiles.

>Puneet_Sharma: ADEILST 10D DILATES +72 168
#note I smile at this. I'm totally not kidding. I honestly and genuinely smiled.
>Winter: EEIIMNR D3 MIEN +34 110
#note MIEN brings me to within 58--as long as Puneet doesn't keep drawing the easy stuff, I've already won the game. And if I don't win, it doesn't matter.

Love is all that matters.

And the Purge.
>Puneet_Sharma: AUV F1 VAU +13 181
#note Because I love Puneet, I really wanted to stop the clock and ofter to let him take his play back, while kindly and gently explaining that, no matter what tiles he was holding, this was just an awful play.
>Winter: BEHINRT 1B THRI.EN +42 152
>Puneet_Sharma: ?AEGINS 2H AGNISEs +70 251
#note I almost stopped the clock and called the director (Jason Idalski) over, so that he could point out to Puneet that the rules don't actually REQUIRE him to take advantage of easy tiles.

I think the rules mention sportsmanship, which, in this situation, would be to throw that blank back into the bag.

Puneet is young, and new to the game, and he might not realize that he is allowed to do this.
>Winter: BDIKLUY 1M YUK +36 188
#note I DID NOT play YUK as some sort of commentary on the game. My tiles are not yucky. Puneet's tiles are not yucky. There is no yucky. Yucky does not exist.

The world is beautiful.

Winter loves you.
>Puneet_Sharma: CGO 9C COG +15 266
#note I'll admit that when Puneet played this, I thought it was just another example of his fishy playing style, but the joke would soon be on me.
>Winter: BDDILTU 3K DIT +25 213
#note BID was the play, definitely.
>Puneet_Sharma: UY 3H YU +16 282
#note Surprise, surprise.
>Winter: BDELMPU H10 .UMBLE +39 252
#note I pretty much know what is coming, but I have to take the points.
>Puneet_Sharma: EEILRRS B3 RELIERS +66 348
#note I challenged SCOG, so Puneet gets the moral victory on that one. 

But seriously, after four of these gimmes, you have to laugh right? I know y'all are laughing at this.
>Winter: DJOOOPR A6 POO +27 279
#note Again, NOT A COMMENTARY on the game.

Winter promises.

Winter loves you.
>Puneet_Sharma: AEIO -AEIO +0 348
>Winter: ADGJORV 11C JAG +36 315
#note Okay, I'm within 43 now, but who wants to bet that Puneet just threw back the Q, an who wants to bet that I won't draw it?
>Puneet_Sharma: DEX 4J DEX +46 394
#note YAY!!! HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!!! CLAP CLAP CLAP!!!

Puneet has clearly earned a lot of good karma. Does his dick taste like shwarma?
>Winter: ADHLORV 12B DOH +39 354
#note Coming back to bingo out would be sweet...
>Puneet_Sharma: ?CEINNT 15B INCENT.d +62 456
>Winter: ALQRRVZ 13A VAR +35 389
#note ...but unfortunately, this isn't the dimension where that happens. There are infinite universes, and it's a different one where Winter wins the games, and then finds a good woman (unselfish, highly intelligent, athleticly-mind, emotionally balanced).

But don't you have to admire the beauty of it, getting stuck with both the Q and the Z after all this?

I think it's beautiful.

Winter loves you.
