#note what makes you be able to find plays like nitwit more reliably? (-4)

>cesar: BEHIKNR 6I KHI +25 39
#note khi sims slightly better than bike. however if siri probably has vowels after ami, then bike might be better? i don't know what is more right here.

#note hm
>cesar: BELNNNR G5 BL..N +11 50
#note already felt like i was in a bit of trouble. didn't like 9H BEN keeping LNNR. BENNY also sims better. (-3.5)
>siri: ACEP 4I CAPE +37 88
>cesar: AENNRRR N5 .ARNER +13 63
#note i liked this move. is it totally wrong? quackle just likes 9I ERN or exchanging ANRR but it's all pretty close by valuation/win%... (-1.5)
>siri: EEEEEE -EEEEEE +0 88
#note i wonder what he kept after CAPE; maybe it was wrong to try inferencing anything.

#note i have no idea what i was trying to do here. i remember thinking of voted but must not have seen how much it scored, or something. i think i was partly trying to bait him into hooking something. this is a bad move, ignore. (-6)

>cesar: ADFIRUU D3 FU.U +16 191
#note not sure why aidful sims better even with the details window. this might be a turnover thing. (-3) they both give up similar amounts of points.

#note deposed > seedpod o9 by 2.5% win, i can't believe i even considered seedpod for a little bit. maybe if it scored like 20 more.
