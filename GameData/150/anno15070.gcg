#note exchange one, probably with this rack or CREDIT
>Will: ?ABCHLR 8H BRACH +32 32
#note What to do after ex.1? ETS and AIL (BRACH extensions) are maybe a little more likely in his leave after ex. 1, but then TRIBRACH might offset those slightly. Not worth a ton of thought either way.

#note The P isn't that useful here, should have tossed it.

#note I should probably play LAGENDS - eliminates some nasty possibilities from H11 and takes out the easiest -S bingo line (and scores one more point), at a cost of creating some decent floaters.

#note I might need to keep the leave closer to bingoing here. J7 DAG might have done the trick.

#note Partially blocks 13B KEEF and guarantees him good outs with most of the remaining tiles. I thought I was in decent shape after my bingo but Nigel is actually firmly in command.
