#note Was not thrilled about this lay when I made it. Q is simmingit the highest by a point, with OU(P)H behind him and HOUR next.

#note 17/34 vowels unseen, I'm not afraid of holding DMST for more points.

>Matt_Canik: DDMMOST M2 DOM +17 303
#note No great options this turn, but the pool is over 50% vowels to me so I'm still notafraid of holding DMST. Q prefers this by over 2 points.

#note This turn was really difficult to me. Bingoing gives back strong counters along B a decent amount of the time, but if he can't hit that well then I just win the game. If I play AMID or AMIDE it's a close game, Mike's rack is likely unbalanced, and I've got an S. Tough. I chose this but I am not sure at all. 
>Michael_Baker: ADSY B1 SAY.D +44 387
>Matt_Canik: ACDEFIU A4 .AIFED +43 415
#note Champ player suggests DECAF o11 or EF a1. Mike held this for several minutes before realizing he'd win without challenging.

>Michael_Baker: EGI F1 GIE +14 429
#note Mike's overcounted XENON by 4, so I officially lost by 6 instead and didn't recount. I am very happy with the way I played this game regardless.
