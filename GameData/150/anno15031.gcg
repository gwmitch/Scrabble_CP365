#note I'm 5-0 and Timothy is 4-1, and I'm up 110 in spread. This means I have lose by less than 55 points. Of course I'm an idiot and for the entire game I think I have to lose by less than 110. Kim had told me before the game not to overthink it and just play my best. If I had just done that I would have won! Seriously, I don't need self-sabatoge on top of my normal choking tendencies

#note MID(LIFER) is pretty cool but probably not worth the risk. I looked for a bottom corner play and missed MODI. I should probably just play QI now, but I could draw QAI(D) next turn with QI as a backup.

#note I actually did see NONDANCE but I thought it was NONSENSE! I was a little more sure on this one which scores the max 86 points. CANTONED also works.

>Timothy_Anderson: ANRVW O5 WAV.RN +12 297
#note In virtually any other game I challenge this instantly, but all I care about is not losing by 110 so 12 point phonies don't seem worth the 1% risk that I'm wrong. If only I wasn't so misguided I might have actually tried to, you know, win the game.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLLOR N2 GORAL +25 297
#note Wasn't sure which GORAL was better - but J4 LOG looks better. I forgot about (KAT)A too.
>Timothy_Anderson: ?EGIOSS 4B GEO.eSIS +70 367
#note Ok, unlike the previous phony I actually wasn't sure about this. Timothy generally plays words he knows, though. I did know the word GEODESY so that made me think about challenging this. The sad part is, if I am aware of my spread miscalculation, I challenge this 100%. But instead I defeat myself and lose yet another tournament in the final game! It's getting really old. I finished 2nd or 3rd in like 45% of my tournaments.

#note After the game is over, it's brought up what the actual spread difference needed to be. Yeah, I wanted to facepalm myself.
