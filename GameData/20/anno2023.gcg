>daltonic AAEFIRT 8G FA +10 10
#note [Game 18 Houston 09/2008 Division 2]. I didn't know FERIA, but I liked the AEIRT leave.
>LB: BLMORSY 7E BROMYLS +79 79
>daltonic AAEIRTZ 8A ZAIRE +49 59
#note I didn't know whether bromyls* was good, and it seemed likely. And I didn't want to risk going down by over 100 early in the game. I had a decent enough comeback.
>LB: IJNOU F2 JUNIO. +31 110
>daltonic ?AIOPTW E4 OP +18 77
#note 9G TWO is probably best. I wanted to get rid of POW, but I thought WOP at G1 was too risky. I wasted too much time on this rack, and made a bad play anyway.
>LB: DEEX D1 EXED +34 144
>daltonic ?AEIOTW C2 OW +29 106
#note An AEIO rack, but the WT combo is lame. AEIT? is a great leave, and OW at C2 scores best, but is very volatile. I gambled. WAX at 2B is only 3 fewer, but more defensive, and the better play, especially since I'd probably bingo somewhere else next turn and give her two shots at the spot.
>LB: ANTUV B2 VAUNT +52 196
>daltonic ?AEILST K4 ELA.TIcS +78 184
#note A double-double is only second best here. I didn't think of nines, but for five points more, one played at H7 which is findable. I missed the more defensive BLASTIES or BASTILES.
>LB: APV 1A PAV. +45 241
>daltonic DILLNRU 8K .RILL +18 202
#note Okay, that OW play earlier proves very costly. Let's take away another potential danger spot, and hope to get the second blank. I don't know TRULL or I'd have played that. I missed LURID at L2 though.
>LB: BEEEIN N5 BEE.INE +13 254
>daltonic ADIKMNU O1 DUMKA +55 257
#note I wasn't 100% certain on DUMKA, but it was worth too much to chicken out on. She held, but didn't challenge.
>LB: ACHOR O11 ROACH +35 289
>daltonic EEIINNT 11D NINETIE. +66 323
#note I'm happy the H didn't play at O11, but I'm not happy with my three repeats rack. Oh, wait a second, yes I am happy with it!
>LB: AFIR L1 FAIR +26 315
>daltonic DEEOOSW H11 .WEED +39 362
#note TWEED scores the most, but it burns two E's and leaves me with two O's. Plus, with the other blank still out, giving her an E and D to play through can't be a good idea. I missed WOOED at 12A which is a few percentage points better.
>LB: ARTY M3 TRAY +31 346
>daltonic ?CGNOOS 15D COoN.OGS +64 426
#note Felt great relief when the second blank appeared on my rack. Surely there is a bingo to be found. I spend a long time looking, but the only thing I see is coondogs# which I thought might be good. I missed COLOGNES.
>daltonic ?CGNOOS --  -64 362
#note Oh well
>LB: DGGHO 14D HOGG.D +16 362
>daltonic ?CGNOOS 15A COGON +35 397
#note I wasn't 100% on COGON, but like DUMKA, I felt I had seen it before, and it wasn't time to play scared. CONGa or CONGe at G1 also win, but I didn't know those or even consider that spot.
>LB: EIQSTTU 12A QUIET +54 416
>daltonic ?S F10 u.S +17 414
#note Fortunately her best play gives me a winning out play. Four out of the five vowels work. Make sure you don't mess this up, JD.
