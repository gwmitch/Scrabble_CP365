>Noah: AEILLOR 8G OIL +6 6
#note Didn't know LILO 8G, which is best. I should probably learn them fours. -1
>Miriam_Saldanha: AH 7G HA +20 20
>Noah: AAEELRS 9F AE +10 16
#note ERA is clearly better. -3
>Miriam_Saldanha: AVW 10D VAW +30 50

>Miriam_Saldanha: ADEPRRU -  +0 50
#note Challenged.
>Noah: CDEINTU H11 .ITED +33 153
#note I looked and looked for better plays, but this is best. CUT(L)IN(E) is awesome.
>Miriam_Saldanha: ?DEIRTY J2 DIETaRY +71 121
>Noah: CGIINNU 2H IN.UCING +74 227

>Noah: ADFINQS 1M QI +24 299
#note See if you can find the really hard play I missed here! -13
>Miriam_Saldanha: FOR 8A FRO. +24 180
>Noah: ADFNNOS 5D FONDAN.S +115 414
#note Wow, so I miss the simple QAIDS and get rewarded with this?
>Miriam_Saldanha: ALY 12D LAY +25 205
>Noah: EGJMNOU 4C JOG +35 449
#note Okay, should not have missed JO(R)UM. -6
>Miriam_Saldanha: HTU 6B HUT +20 225
>Noah: BEIMNOU J10 B.UIN +15 464
#note Here, the good UMBO is best. It scores okay for these tiles on this board, and keeps a nice leave. -2
>Miriam_Saldanha: ES 3L ES +33 258
>Noah: CEEMNOX 13B EXON +28 492
#note This game is just one egregious play after another. COME is clearly best. I missed the hook. This nice play also sets up a great X spot, so i just need to draw a good tile or two to get a 60ish play. -12
>Miriam_Saldanha: ABERSV A1 BRAVES +52 310
>Noah: CEEEEIM 15C EMCEE. +14 506
>Miriam_Saldanha: EIMPPRT 14F PR.E. +25 335
#note Nice fit, can you find the best sequence?
>Noah: ?ADEITT B8 .EDAT.d +22 528
#note I looked for a while from the H, but didn't see (H)E(R)nIAT(E)D. Can you find the tough best sequence.
>Miriam_Saldanha: IMPT 13J .MPI +16 351
>Noah: IT 14L IT +8 536
#note The sequence is 12 more points than my play. Total equity loss: -49, but the only real hard thing here is the endgame, I shouldn't have made any of those mistakes.
>Noah:  (T) +2 538
