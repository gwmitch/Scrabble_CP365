>Marlon_Hill: ADINORS 8B SADIRON +70 70
#note One of six opening bingos by my opponents (including those who went second). I also had six. Quackle's favorite play looks like INROADS 8G, and I like ORDAINS 8B best here, since it avoids slotting vowels without sacrificing points.
>Sam: EKNNRYY E8 .NKY +22 22
#note DYKEY D8 and KEY 7E are higher-scoring options with worse leaves. I need help after this play, but it looks best to me.
>Marlon_Hill: AIOT F10 IOTA +19 89
>Sam: EEGNRWY 7G YEW +28 50
#note And I received the help I needed, in the form of GREENWAY C2 96. The only problem was that I had never seen nor studied GREENWAY. Like Marlon said to me after the game, I'm a good player, I just need to get my hands on a dictionary. YEW is the second-best play.
>Marlon_Hill: FO 7B OF +20 109
>Sam: EGHNRRX 9A REX +42 92
>Marlon_Hill: EOW 6H WOE +19 128
>Sam: ?GHNRTV I5 V.. +9 101
#note VOW is an extremely poor play. There aren't even any sevens in AGHNRT?, rendering the A-hook useless! NTH 9G is easily best, and I don't think I saw it. There are several other options better than VOW, though.
>Marlon_Hill: EILQTU 13B LIQU.TE +34 162
>Sam: ?GHNRTU 12H HURTiNG +87 188
#note The reward for my poor play last turn.
>Marlon_Hill: ABDEGNT L7 DEBAT.NG +62 224
#note Marlon commented that the I totally saved his otherwise awkward rack.
>Sam: ACDJOTU 14J JU. +27 215
#note COHEAD H10, a word I didn't know, is best. It would pop up two rounds later against Robert Quigley, as you'll see. Interestingly, the sim likes JUG better at N10 by a decent amount, probably to cut off parallel play and/or bingos on columns M and N. I liked JUG in either place since I had the O in hand.
>Marlon_Hill: OU 11J OU. +12 236
>Sam: AACDFOT 15G FADO +33 248
>Marlon_Hill: AEILNNT N5 LATENIN. +63 299
#note A bingo that would have been prevented by JUG N10.
>Sam: ACDELOT 4F LOCATED +86 334
#note I had been trying to remember all tournament the obscenely common word that I had so embarassingly missed against Joel Sherman in Saratoga (February). This was it. 
>Marlon_Hill: AIMPS O4 PIMAS +50 349
>Sam: AEHLRSV M6 LAV +25 359
#note HALVERS, a cool sticky-S word I just learned, doesn't play. There's absolutely no reason not to play HAVE here, so I must have somehow missed it. In a game this close, those extra 14 points definitely could have come in handy.
>Marlon_Hill: EIP H1 EPI. +24 373
#note Opening the board--does he have the blank?
>Sam: EEGHIRS 6A EH +28 387
#note This seems like the right play to me, but are there any other superior alternatives? I'm not sure I like any of Quackle's other ideas.
>Marlon_Hill: ISZ 2F ZI.S +35 408
>Sam: EEGIMRS A1 EMIGR. +33 420
#note Marlon's play was pretty odd. Since I have the case S, it's harder to figure out what his rack must have been in order to force the S to be tacked on. He probably kept something like BCRR. Even if he didn't have the blank when he played ZIPS, he just picked up three of the five tiles in the bag. No matter what, I think I have to play EMIGRE. I go up 12 with the high-scorer, and I can only hope to draw the blank or outrun him otherwise.
>Marlon_Hill: ABCEORR 5C COBAR +22 430
#note The only way for me to lose is an incorrect challenge, and I didn't really have any idea. I figured it was a spread phony, but didn't want to risk it. Marlon first laid down COBRA 10J, which I would have challenged for sure (BOR*).
