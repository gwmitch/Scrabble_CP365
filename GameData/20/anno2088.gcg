>Ron_Hoekstra: AOR 8F ORA +6 6
>Sam: ?BEILTU E6 rEBUILT +72 72
#note I had heard secondhand that Ron had iffy word knowledge for a player of his rating, and had seen him play JAY from an opening rack of AGJTTY? (what a dream rack!) while sitting next to me, so I decided to take my chances that he wouldn't know or see PrEBUILT. Had I known or seen sUBTILE E5 86, I would have played it instead.
>Ron_Hoekstra: AN F10 NA +10 16
>Sam: ACEEHJT 12C JE. +20 92
#note JACINTHE 10B, a new word for me, is simming slightly better in win%. It's "an orange color" (think hyacinth, they both come from the Latin iacinte), and is good without the E.
>Ron_Hoekstra: AEINPRT H8 .NTIRAPE +83 99
#note He didn't see the hook. PERTAIN or PAINTER 5E are 108 each.
>Sam: ACEEHTZ 14F ZE. +34 126
>Ron_Hoekstra: DDDEIS 13G D.DDIES +33 132

>Ron_Hoekstra: GNOT O11 T.ONG +27 159
>Sam: ACEEIOV 13A AVO +30 192
#note JIVE C12 is definitely the right play. The A at A13 is much more dangerous than the E at 15C. I also tend to think ACEO is more balanced than CEEI.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ILW A12 W.IL +33 192
>Sam: CCDEEHI J10 CHI.ED +21 213
#note CHIDE F2 wins the sim by a little bit, but I'm not about to give up my spot with P? still unseen. I also like playing the D off for the extra tile of turnover, though CHIDE J10 may be better.
>Ron_Hoekstra: IQS I6 QIS +20 212
>Sam: CEEGNOP 5C COPE +38 251
#note When I laid this down, Ron said, "Are you saying I missed a double-double-double-double?"
>Ron_Hoekstra: LOV F2 VOL. +15 227
>Sam: AEGNSTY B2 ANTSY +41 292
#note YANG G3 is clearly best, but I didn't know COPEN. ANTSY is second-best.
>Ron_Hoekstra: EKO A1 OKE +29 256
>Sam: EEGMRRX C1 REG +23 315
#note I liked this, since there's still AAAAIII out for a guaranteed X play on the A column. However, MERGE A6 not only scores 31, it sets up XI or XU B10 or OX B9 with IIIOOUUU unseen. A terrific play that I didn't see.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ?AGNRTU M5 RUNaGAT.. +62 318
>Sam: EFIMMRX 8L F.RM +36 351
#note I wanted to cover the board's biggest hotspot and leave myself the A column for next turn. The sim prefers just playing off MIX A6 now, though I'm not really sure why. I should have plenty of lucrative X plays next turn, and it's doubtful that he'll have a good play on the A column.
>Ron_Hoekstra: AIIOSWY N8 .OW +30 348
>Sam: AEIIIMX A6 MAXI +46 397
>Ron_Hoekstra: FOR G3 FOR +31 379
#note I didn't have much of a reason to doubt SCOPER*, but I guess it's like SWIPER*. Another one that I ommited on the Lipkin chart.
>Sam: AAEIINY 15C INIA +16 413
#note Right play, wrong spot. INIA B8 is best.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ELSUU N3 LUES +12 391
#note SUE 10A is 11 points better.
>Sam: AEY L3 YEA +15 428
#note Uh, let's just say this play rode the short bus. YEA O1 20.
>Sam:  (U) +2 430
