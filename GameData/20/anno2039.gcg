#note If I would have played REBEGIN at 9H, he would have had to find a harder bingo to double-double.  It's the only other 8 in AEEMRTV?

#note DUH. Best.  No-brainer.  What is this kind of play called, the X-grenade?

#note This play was kinda dumb.  ETUIS 1A is it, but I didn't see it.  I was hesitant to do UTENSIL A1, and I shouldn't have been.  Why would he use his S there and leave himself with an unplayable V when he could just go out for 14 points instead?  Actually, maybe he would have.  SI 8A would net 22 points, and I would only score a maximum of 5 with my T (TAM).  Anyway, with SEXT I was figuring I could score some points and block his best out, and whatever net points I lost from the tiles left on my rack would be okay because I'm blocking his VISA N12 and he's scoring 6 less on his out.  It would have backfired greatly if he played VIS N10, but he didn't.
