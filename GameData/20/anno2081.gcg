>Jason: AAHIKTZ 8F HAIK +22 22
#note Somebody's got a case of Fancy Play Syndrome! And somebody forgot the other back hook to HAIK!
>Mike_Weepie: ADQ H6 QA.D +14 14
>Jason: ACOOTTZ 7G Z. +42 64
#note Yes, Q, I see ZOA/(HAIK)A is best. But if I didn't play HAIKA on my opening rack, why the heck would I play it now? Making me take off more equity for that is like double jeopardy.
>Mike_Weepie: EOV F8 .OVE +18 32
>Jason: ?ACOOTT E11 OCA +14 78
#note Nice one-tile pick. And what part of "I forgot the other back hook for HAIK" don't you understand, Q? I can't play TOpCOAT because I forgot HAIKA!!!
>Mike_Weepie: AAEGMNS J2 MANAGES +82 114
>Jason: ?EFNOTT 3G FET.TiON +80 158
#note Was so busy lamenting that I didn't have a spot for OFTENEST that I nearly missed this.
>Mike_Weepie: AX K3 .AX +40 154
>Jason: BEHRSST O1 BEST +32 190
#note BEST? Not best. Whiffed on BR(A)SHEST.
>Mike_Weepie: CLT 13D T.LC +9 163
>Jason: GHJOORS 2M JO. +33 223
#note As I don't know SORGHO (41 at 2B), it was between this or JO(E) at H1. Q agrees with this choice.
>Mike_Weepie: II -II +0 163
>Jason: EGHORSW H1 GR.W +36 259
#note (BEST)OWER's Q's pick, perhaps if only for the style points.

#note Hey, why does this rack look so familiar? :) Played near-flawlessly since whiffing on BRASHEST.

#note Liked this play. E pick, LEANERS fits. I pick, ALINERS fits. N pick, LANNERS fits. M pick, ALMNERS fits. T pick, RENTALS fits. R pick, I hope SNARLER/(YIELD)S stays open. I'm really not blocking, but I'm making it harder for him to hit. Naturally, Q wants me to just throw the U back, which only shows how it doesn't appreciate my genius. :)

#note And I can finally breathe easier. Mike's breaths, however, were more in the form of sighs and grumbles.

>Jason: BEIMRWY 6D YEW +37 483
#note I don't know how, but my track AND count were messed up; there were supposed to be two in the bag when there was one. (Looking back, I forgot to track/count the E in his YIELD play; forgot it hooked and thought he just played through it.) Anyway, I was worried there was a tile missing, so I even lifted up the board. Not that it made a difference in my play, although he probably thinks I'm a lulu now. Don't get the impression he liked me; doubt we'll be exchanging pleasantries in NYC. Maybe he's just like that after all losses.

#note An exercise for the readers: Find his nine, which is nine more (shouldn't be too hard to find, given that there's not too many nine spots). 8-6, and guaranteed to finish the day at least .500.
