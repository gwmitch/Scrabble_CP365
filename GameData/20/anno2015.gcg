>Dave: BEIIMNR 4D BIM. +16 50
#note How do you explain that I saw I needed an N for RENMINBI, and I saw MINIBAR, but correctly evaluated that it was worse than my play, and yet somehow never ever noticed BERM for 47 points?!
>Scott: FGIOU I3 FUGIO. +15 119
#note A nice play which really shuts down the board, already making me a substantial underdog.
>Dave: ACEINRU 5G .U. +4 54
#note Granted, I did not even think about the ATHEISTS hook until after the game, but this is a pretty strong fish, and probably at least as good as UNCIA B4, given the game score.
>Scott: EIOUV C6 OU.VIE +14 133
>Dave: ACDEINR B2 CANID +31 85
#note He blocked CAIRNED B7, which I pray to the tile gods I wouldn't have missed, but this left me with a tough choice between my move and CADI 12A for the same score.  Of course, DITHEISTS would have been much better than either, if I had known the friggin' word.  I liked my play because I figured CADI was almost sure to be met by a play to the triple, whereas if he didn't have an A, I had a possible lane to the A column that could last for a while.  Keeping rows 11 and 12 open was another argument in favor of my play.
>Scott: AINOX A6 AXION +40 173
>Dave: EILNPRW 3A P.W +16 101
#note WEINER E7 is a good play that I would fully support if I was ahead or the game was close, but I prefer playing this way given the score deficit.  I noticed that we were starting to get a blocked up board on which it would be hard for Scott to score too much without opening things back up for me.  A board like this benefits the person trailing, because s/he can build patiently toward a bingo, without the other person being able to keep piling on the points.  It was valuable to take out one of the few good scoring zones here, and I held an L for the possible PAWL hook to score again.  A play like PLEW B11, even though it seems to be opening things up, just makes it easy for him to score well and block up the board in response.
>Scott: EEL H1 EEL +20 193
>Dave: BEILLNR E2 BL.N +12 113
#note Same reason as in the last note for preferring this to a play like BILL B11.
>Scott: EINOOST 12B ISOTONE +76 269
>Dave: EFILORT 11F LOFTIER +79 192
#note So he beat me to the second bingo and currently has a 156 point lead, but all is not lost.
>Scott: AMP 10I AMP +29 298
>Dave: ?AAERTZ 6I .ZAR +33 225
#note Okay, I immediately saw the unplayable LAZARET here, but I spent a lot of time looking for other nonexistent bingos. If he hadn't blocked the R, I might have tried TERRAZZA*, which I had convinced myself might be good. (Or was it TERAZZA* or TERRAZA*?  None of those, it was TERRAZZO, you nitwit.)  After exhausting way too much time looking for the bings, I was only too happy to settle for this 33 point play with great chances to bingo on the next turn.  Why the @&^%! didn't I notice FEAZE, which is roughly 100 times better, even after taking a long time on this turn?!
>Scott: AAJRS M2 RAJAS +38 336
>Dave: ??AEKTY 13H sTrEAKY +81 306
#note Took me quite a while to find this, but I'm convinced it's the best play.  I first laid it down at 13G for one more point, but I like this placement better for the T hook at 14H and for plays through the Y on column N.  Since I'm still trailing, I need the volatility.
>Scott: HNTU K3 UNH.T +16 352
>Dave: EEGNOOY N2 EGO +24 330
#note With the E and Y to hook at O4, this play gives me a fighting chance.
>Scott: CDEGLRR O4 GELD +21 373
#note According to the duck, Scott's play is good enough to win 100% of the time, but a significant improvement is CLERGY N8, which also takes away my ENVOY O4, but also allows him to play out quickly.
>Dave: DENOVY 1H .NVOY +15 345
#note AY L13 followed by DEVON 15K is tied with this for the best continuation.  Note that I cannot C-stick him because he has ROC 11D, ARC L13, and CRY N11.
>Scott: CRR N11 CR. +8 381
>Dave: DE N9 DE... +13 358
#note I only had about 4 seconds left for this play, but missing GELDED is still a pretty atrocious blunder, especially given that I had his time to think on.  Still I would have lost by 7.
>Dave:  (R) +2 360
#note The score being as close as it was was just the tile gods' way of saying to me, "You effed this up.  If you had found any one of BERM, DITHEISTS, or FEAZE, you probably would have won this game."
