#note Not sure what made me think this was better than EDIFY.

#note Not surprisingly this sims something like 43 points better than real plays. If I had anything better than YEP for 8 I probably wouldn't have bothered with this, but against this opponent (relatively new 1500) it's gotta be the right idea. Yeah, I did think of trying it at H7, but that would almost have to be a dead giveaway.

#note I held PYREDINE*, but I knew that I had no idea, and it gave me a good comeback.

#note Yuck. Spent countless minutes trying to get away from this, but all I saw through the E was the even worse SuZERAIN. OK, let's all get it out of our systems: I had a much "more stylish" play than this, hurr de hurr.

#note 9J M(I)LOR(d) would've been pretty cool.

#note Should probably just take the higher scoring spot (M12) after the exchange.

#note Didn't know CARCASE.  Didn't see 6M CA(R) 25.  Saw 11B CACA 24 but didn't pick it.
>Phil: IILNORT 5E INTRO +16 283
#note Another game where I will the right tile onto the board, but in the wrong spot.  IDOL is obvious and best. I remember seeing it but somehow thinking that with this play I could suffocate her to death as long as she doesn't have an ess bingo immediately. I don't think anyone here needs to be told this, but this is not a sound strategy.

#note I had no idea what I was doing here.  6H SPU(D) 28 sims best.  I saw PUD but didn't know ICKER took the S.

#note hooray for me
>Rebecca: EFIPSSU 11D PI +16 350
#note Sacrificed too many points not to empty the bag and missed 6M FU(R) 27 and I13 PE 23.
