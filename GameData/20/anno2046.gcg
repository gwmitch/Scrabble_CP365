>Lisa_Slankard: ADLNO 8D NODAL +14 14
>Jason: ABJNOST 7E JOB +34 34
#note Just noticed that I had a bingo through the I. Since I won't bingo this game, that's a little disappointing.
>Lisa_Slankard: AYY 9E YAY +42 56
>Jason: AFINSST 10B FITS +29 63
#note I'm surprised that Q likes FATS by a bit, esp. with two A's played and no I's.
>Lisa_Slankard: EN E5 EN.... +32 88
>Jason: ABMNRRS D2 BARM +20 83
>Lisa_Slankard: ADQ C7 QAD. +33 121
>Jason: NNOORSU 2B UN.ORN +20 103
>Lisa_Slankard: GIR D10 .RIG +10 131
>Jason: GIILOOS 1G IGLOO +20 123
#note "The E's can come at any time," I think. It's either this or GI(G)OLO, which I didn't see.
>Lisa_Slankard: EMOR 2I OMER +26 157
>Jason: CDEISVX 1A EX +36 159
#note Q seems to like VISED at 14B and SIX at 3G slightly better, neither of which I considered.
>Lisa_Slankard: EEPTU L2 .EPUTE +16 173
#note She seemed pretty frustrated after this play. Meanwhile, I wasn't exacly enamored with my draws either.
>Jason: CDHISUV 8L DISH +42 201
#note Missed DUCI, SHIV and SUCH in that spot. Didn't look hard enough. Q likes VU(G)H third, which I considered.
>Lisa_Slankard: ?IINSTV 12C V.SITINg +61 234
>Jason: CEEFLUV M7 F.VE +27 228
#note I hate what this does to the board, but what else? Besides, I don't need to bingo to win this game.
>Lisa_Slankard: EGHIN N10 HINGE +47 281
#note Crap. And no hook tiles, either. I guess I do have to bingo.
>Jason: CEILUUZ 12L ZI.C +36 264
#note Q says the star play is the intriguing CU(P)ULE, a word I didn't know.
>Lisa_Slankard: DE 15N DE +20 301
>Jason: EILUUWW -IUUWW +0 264
#note Finally the bill fully comes due for incorrectly playing DISH. Q seems to want me to throw it all back.
>Lisa_Slankard: AAT 4I ATA. +6 307
#note She said "That's what I was gonna do," and I thought "Well, you can!" But, she said after the game that she figured I threw dreck in the bag and decided to play short.
>Jason: EEKLLOP 3F EKE +26 290
#note Absentmindedly put down OKE in the same spot first. Q seems to like PEKOE or KOEL along row 14, making (TRIG)O. This was third.
>Lisa_Slankard: EW H3 .WE +24 331
>Jason: ILLOPRT H11 P.LOT +21 311
#note I ran Q twice and both times PILOT(S) at N3 was in the top three. I don't understand that at all. I wasn't enamored with this play, as it killed the (TRIG)O spot I felt like she didn't know/forgot about (which was true) but I needed to open but also score enough to threaten to outrun. Thoughts? I really don't understand how PILOTS wins 30% of the time.
>Lisa_Slankard: AAARSTW L12 .A +11 342
#note One of those situations where leaving one in the bag is not best, esp. with two lines open. (N)AW at I12 wins 90+% of the time, (T)AW at G12 80+%. ZA wins only 30% of the time, and indeed, playing optimally here I would've won.
>Jason: ?CILORU 11G U. +6 317
#note Obviously a really poor time to add one to the "Grob tally." I really can't be mad at missing URoLO(g)IC, though, also Lisa seemed to think that if I looked through the G, at the -IC ending, extending to -OLOGIC ... but that's way too much for me. Honestly, most of my looking came through the T. Still, this wins when I pull five of the eight unseen tiles (including the E she picked after ZA). Sadly, another U (my fifth of the game) isn't one of them.
>Lisa_Slankard: AAERSTW 14J WAST. +28 370
#note Does the job (I can't remember if she saw UROLOGIC or not), but she gets 16 more points in the end by sticking the R on.
>Jason: ?CILORU O1 CLOURIs. +89 406
>Jason: ?CILORU --  -89 317
#note Had to try. Yet another spread-hemorrhaging decision in a tourney full of them.
>Lisa_Slankard: AER J4 .ARE +6 376
#note (A)REA one column left  or RA(ME)E are one better. So, now I'm 4-3 and it turns out in all three games I've lost less equity than the margin or defeat. I'm wondering if this is another MM, play my ass off and nothing to show for it. Plus, I see I really only made mistakes on three racks, including the two at the end. So, I'm a little frustrated heading into Round 8.
