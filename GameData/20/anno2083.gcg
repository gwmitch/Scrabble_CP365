>Jason: BEOSUVW 8G VOW +18 18
>David_Johnson: AIV F6 VIA +24 24
#note I could hear Alex Fiszbein's voice: "Well, that did wonders for the board."
>Jason: ABEELSU 7H BA +15 33
#note Gah! USEABLE can be spelled with the other E! Curses! Didn't trust myself on it.
>David_Johnson: OPW 6I POW +18 42
>Jason: EEILRSU 9I LEISURE +69 102
#note For whatever reason, I just kept chickening out on words I'm 90+% sure on Sunday afternoon. Terribly risky, but I wasn't sure of LEISURE/(POW)S.
>David_Johnson: DX O8 D.X +33 75
>Jason: BEENNSY 11K BENNY +35 137
>David_Johnson: AEIINST 12G ISATINE +76 151
>Jason: DEEENRS 13L DE +16 153
#note Another bad miss. I could not convince myself of NEEDERS, esp. since it should have been in my prob. study, by my math. Didn't even bother to look for another, missed SNEERED as well. Just a whiff.
>David_Johnson: AIM 11F AMI +11 162
>Jason: EEINRSU -EU +0 153
#note I saw E(A)U, but didn't want to close up the -S hook to END. Q likes it, though.
>David_Johnson: IIII -IIII +0 162
>Jason: DEINRST 13A TINDERS +74 227
>David_Johnson: ?HIILRT 10D HIT +12 174
#note Monday morning, I'm shooting the breeze with Viebranz and Bowman when David comes up to me and asks if I had a minute. "When you played TINDERS yesterday..." he said, and I anticipated the rest of the sentence. "It was the sixth-spot of a triple-triple," I said, pulling out my scoresheet. He groaned. "I had a triple-triple," he said. He saw TRILI(T)Hs and then thought "or is it TIRLI(T)Hs*." He didn't realize it was a triple-triple! "If I'd seen it was a triple-triple, I'd have tried TRILITHS," he said. Wow. Talk about dodging a bullet!
>Jason: CEHJUYZ B11 JU.CY +34 261
#note The decision to challenge would've been interesting. He took like seven minutes to play HIT and was down to about 5:00 left. I was peeved he blocked my 69-point CHEZ in that point. He plays TRILITHS, I let it go and play CHEZ, and I'm down like 20-ish with him in big time trouble and a random rack, while my JUY leave is set up for a big JAY or JOY play at 5J. Dunno what I would've done. As it was, I almost insta-played this.
>David_Johnson: ?AILMRT C4 RAMTILs +66 240
#note Only bingo. Didn't know it, but didn't hold.
>Jason: EHKLORZ 15A O.EZ +78 339
#note Didn't even realize slotting the Y there holding EZ could prove beneficial.
>David_Johnson: Q 8B Q. +11 251
>Jason: AAHIKLR 5J HAIK +37 376
#note I'm drawing into HKLR thinking "OK, just one vowel. The pool's vowel-heavy, but I don't want to be greedy. Just one vowel." And I pick AAI. Sometimes the Tile Gods are too good to me. Q likes LAKH at B3, followed by HAIKA (there's that stinkin' word again...).
>David_Johnson: CFOO B2 COOF +25 276
>Jason: AAELRTU D2 ALATE +26 402
#note I'm trying to block the S- front hook for COOF that, um, well, kind of doesn't exist.
>David_Johnson: EF M5 .EF +14 290
#note I'm pretty sure he was already over on time by this point.
>Jason: EGGNORU N4 RUNE +27 429
#note Sure, my plays at the end can be quibbled with. But I'm stunningly going to go 10-6, and in a position where spreads matters, shockingly. I'm trying to wring as many time penalty points as I can and playing super-fast.
>David_Johnson: NTU 14G TUN +9 299
#note He was at -3:26 when he hit his clock here.
>Jason: EGGLOOP 15H POLO +32 461
>David_Johnson: ?AEORRS O1 RARE +18 317
#note Missed (A)ERAtORS and (L)AbORERS. RACE(HO)RS(E) would've been sweet, except that it gives me G(A)GGED.
>Jason: DEGGG 2D .GED +8 469
#note Missed the simple DE at E4, which is 18 better. One of those games where saying "my SSJZ vs. his ??SSQX" is misleading as can be.
>David_Johnson: ?OS 1F bOS +10 327
#note See if you can find his best out of 27, beating the 19 of all the O?S plays at J4. He ended up about 5:30 over, so minus 60. Despite playing mediocrely/inconsistently, I go 4-0, +529 on the afternoon and stunningly, am at 10-6, +688 heading into Monday. A game back of the pace set by Stock, Bowman and Cornelis; tied with Mills; a game up on Berofsky and two up on Greenspan. Wow.
>David_Johnson:  (GG) +8 335
