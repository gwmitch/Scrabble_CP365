#note Was about to play HANGERs when I thought "duh- put the blank infront". Highest scoring along with REHANGs.

#note I was ecstatic to find this. This is the first time I've played two double-double bingos in the same game- I think it's cool how they're parallel. The other one was WHEELmAN.
>Glenn: AIIL H1 ILIA. +18 134
#note I held for a while, and decided that I had never seen it.
>Phil: BDEOTTY -  +0 237
#note Challenge.

>Glenn: VV 8K V.V +9 202
>Phil: AELNORU 6I RUL. +13 303
#note I knew this was a bad play. ULNAE 4B is best, which I saw but doubted myself on.
>Glenn: LOOP 13C POLO +18 220
>Phil: ADDENOS 12C OD +16 319
#note Surprisingly best.
>Glenn: BEU D1 .UBE +12 232
>Phil: ADEFNSY G4 F.Y +14 333
#note Sims best, keeping great bingo tiles.
>Glenn: CGINOOT B6 COOTING +73 305
#note Guess I didn't challenge because of my rack. Glenn isn't usually one to play phonies, so I let it slide without a hold.
>Phil: ADEIMNS N8 SIDEMAN +88 421
#note Highest scoring bingo. I loved playing both a -MEN and -MAN bingo in the same game.
>Glenn: EIIIJRR -  +0 305
#note Challenge.
>Phil: BCEIMOS A8 MIB +39 460
#note MIB is best. COMBINES was soo close.
>Glenn: ITW 14A WIT +17 322
>Phil: CEEORST A14 .E +15 475
#note With mostly consenants in the bag, I figured a bingo starting with S isn't too unlikely. What I like to call a "smart fish." It actually sims well too.
>Glenn: PRY 13L PR.Y +18 340
>Phil: CEKORST 15C STOCKER +98 573
#note Holy crap. I see STOCKER instantly for 98. I announce my score, we add to 573, plus 8 is 581. But wait, he didn't draw his last 3 tiles after PRAY. We empty out the DIJ- 603. I was so pumped- I have no idea if anyone has scored 600 in back to back games before. Either way, so pumped- enough to motivate me to start this journal!
