>Jeffrey: ?AINSTT 8H ATTaINS +64 64
#note INSTAnT D8 better? setting up DWS-DWS?  Ok, more 7 overlap lanes cut off better, I guess -3.7
>Jamie_: AWX 9F WAX +23 23
>Jeffrey: ?EIISUZ J5 UnI.IZES +86 150
#note I didn't even bother looking for a 7 once I saw the 8s but UnISIZE 7C better? -4
>Jamie_: DEKLM L7 M.LKED +26 49
>Jeffrey: AEEORRS K10 ERA +32 182
#note boy I targeted the n (and briefly W & S) to find the orphan REASO(n)ERS but didn't even bother looking through the U.  The tight infill is sweet but the duck says REARO(U)SE 5E sweetest -34.8
>Jamie_: HTU K3 HUT +16 65
>Jeffrey: EGOOQRS 10E GORE +26 208
#note best, and equity points from herein will cease to matter since the win % is 96%+
>Jamie_: UV E10 .UV +14 79
>Jeffrey: BHOOQRS L3 OH +25 233
#note ...saw 2K B-hook but why open the board at this point? and a no-vowel leave? Pshaw! BOHO 2K better? Win 98%+
>Jamie_: DEI M1 DIE +20 99
>Jeffrey: BMOOQRS 1M .OM +18 251
#note I could have opened the board with something like BOSOM 13C but all I could think about was closing the TWS-TWS, duh! 
>Jamie_: N 5I N.. +3 102
>Jeffrey: BEGIQRS N6 QI. +32 283
#note ...and finally I got my I!  best (win % in sim 99%+)
>Jamie_: IN O6 IN +15 117

#note hmm..RE(V)ERB eh?  I didn't see it
>Jamie_: ACEFLOR A8 FORCA.LE +194 311
>Jamie_: ACEFLOR --  -194 117
#note Even with such a big lead I couldn't let this stand, FORCIBLE and FORCEABLE I knew.  This stunk and would be pronounced FORKABLE*.  I also had two spots for my next rack if this were found to be good
>Jeffrey: ADEILOR 4C DARIOLE +70 377
#note Yahoo! no thinking needed...best..okay, I considered the TWS-TWS but ROIDABLE*?  Nah.  If FORCABLE* had been good I would have had it here or B2
>Jamie_: ACEFLOR 3A FRO +18 135
>Jeffrey: AGOPRST B7 PORTAG.S +76 453
#note I didn't even bother with one of the two 7 spots once I saw the 8 blocking the trip-trip.  best
>Jamie_: ETU A7 UTE +21 156
>Jeffrey: ENNNTVY F3 V.NY +18 471
#note Why would I rid myself of my only vowel and open a bingo lane?  2B ENVY best allegedly 
>Jamie_: EF A1 EF. +27 183
>Jeffrey: EEINNPT 2L P.NE +28 499
#note best
>Jamie_: AOW 12D A.OW +26 209
>Jeffrey: AEIILNT 2A .AT +20 519
#note I briefly thought about fishing the I off (for the D/ (E)NTAILED ?) but that would just be piggish at this point...  One last 8 lane you say? Sgt. Closure reporting for duty! even though the probability with the letter pool was really low for a bingo (0?), I just felt I had to finish the job... 
>Jamie_: EJL H1 JEL. +33 242
>Jeffrey: BEIILNO A13 .IB +23 542
#note not best or most stylish, like 7A (UP)BOIL/(VINY)L or E4 (R)OBLE (didn't know it), but I wanted to foil (B)AY
>Jamie_: AACCDY 2G C.CA +10 252
>Jeffrey: EILNO C6 LONE +19 561
#note best
>Jamie_: ADY G12 .ADY +12 264
#note Well, it was a ridiculously one-sided ride, and not tons o' fun for my opp.,but it would turn out to be very critical to secure a better spot for the next and final game.
