#note Tough decision. HEP 7G looks pretty strong, or there's HAP G3. HARELIP scores best and maximizes turnover for a shot at a blank, but it breaks up a nice rack ands opens some hotspots. Another option was to try GRAPHER*, but I didn't think that would fly at this level.

#note This is where I lost it...sure, it was not too likely he would have a bingo through the U, but that lane was clearly more dangerous than a potential 9 through ER. CYANO K2 is the play.
