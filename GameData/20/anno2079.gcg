#note This might be the best play that doesn't allow the bingo.  I spent a long time on this. I especially liked that the obvious response of REP 6D would leave him with garbage on a closed board. I didn't see the possibility of PUREE 6B, which sims best. What would you do with these letters, knowing your opponent's rack?

#note VICAR D2 also sims well. I like what CIVIL does to the board better.

#note Until this game, I had never known this word to be phony. I was shocked! It's not even good in SOWPODS.

#note Wrong! Just because it would have been a fine play last turn doesn't make it better than DHOTI 12H, which seals it up. Ain't no comin' back after DHOTI. It's over.
>Mike_B: K L1 K. +11 357
>Carl: AEIIORT C12 OI +6 442
#note It's really hard to go through all the possibilities with two tiles remaining.  OI is still a full 20 points behind AVOID M1, chiefly because my opponent will never have a bingo with any combination of the unseen tiles. It didn't seem like a bingo was possible, but I might have missed something obvious. I might have mistracked.  Pop quiz:  What is the only 7-letter word my opponent could have?
