#note See, this is one of my big weaknesses. I get tunnel vision with these racks. I'll insist upon playing one specific combination of tiles at all costs. In this case, I didn't even play that particular combination correctly, as Marty's next rack will prove. The correct move here is SOAP I5. I need to learn to watch the board.
>Marty_G: EO I7 O.E +10 64
>Carl: ??AEIMS H8 .MItAtES +81 110
#note The correct play is DIASTEM L2 or INFAMIES H8.

>Carl: IJLPRUV D8 VIR.U +24 134
#note Wrong, wrong, wrong! JEU (ILPRV) actually sims better by 4.5. Don't ask me why.

#note When you see a good play, always look for a better one. FLECK wins the sim.

#note Too greedy for Quackle. WET 3C or COWED C3 are more preferable.

#note Another weakness of mine, although I think Quackle overstates it. When I've got a good lead, I like to shut the board down more than I should, and am more than willing to sacrifice lots of points to do so. SEGO N3 is better than CIGS by 16.5 points.

>Carl: EFLOQSU N1 FUSE +37 377
#note FUSEL is better, but 6 points better? Quackle is being harsh with me. 
>Marty_G: DD 2M D.D +16 273
>Carl: AELLOQZ F14 Q. +31 408
#note I saw TUTELAR as a possibility up north, and TATTLER down column A. Since TUTELAR is more probable, Quackle tells me I should have played ZOEAL now rather than wait until next turn. That advice doesn't sit well with me, since he'll sometimes bingo out with TATTLER, sticking me with the Q.
