#note Q seems to like holding onto the O, which I considered.

#note "101 dalmatians," I said to confirm the score. Paul Epstein laughed.
>Jason: ADIINRT K7 D..AIN +17 73
#note Q seems to like fishy plays here.

#note Argh! He blocked DWA(R)FISH! This began the grumbling, etc. After the game, Ron said "Wow, that was painful to watch," and George asked what was so frustrating. I was making (insert grouchy player's name here) look like (insert happy-go-lucky player's name here). I'm filling in the blanks with "Harriette Lakernick" and "Jason Keller," although your mileage may vary.
>Brian_Bowman: DIM F8 MI.D +7 214
>Jason: ADFLLNO 2G LOAF +38 274
#note The only play. Looked like Brian was going to play here, too, and changed his mind. Lucky it stayed open.
>Brian_Bowman: EGINO C12 EGO +10 224
#note He played GIEN at 3G before realizing he was playing HAN*, then played this. It surprised me; obviously he wasn't leaving ?S but with the blank or S he had the SOIGNE stem; why not fish? Couldn't put him on a leave.
>Jason: DEEELNP E5 PELE +16 290
#note Here's where the collapse begins. Had lost 5.6 equity points before this play, too. Took like five-plus minutes here. The only reason I didn't make this play sooner is that I'm worried about the X-bomb. Ran Q twice, both times NEEDLE at E3, PE at 3H and E(O)N at M11 came in 1-2-3. Considered the first, but didn't like giving him E's to bingo through. Don't like the S hook the second gives up. I guess I'd play E(O)N.
>Brian_Bowman: INX F4 NIX +55 279
#note ARGH! That's what I wanted to avoid!
>Jason: DEEGNOU 3H OE +16 306
#note Had to take a little "timeout" here to recompose myself. Q likes NO(O)DGE at 14B. Gives him a "one time only" bingo lane and closes up a hot spot. Still, this play is second and isn't awful. 
>Brian_Bowman: AA -AA +0 279
>Jason: DEEGNUU D6 DE +16 322
#note At this point, I'm really just moving tiles. Can't block, so try to score decently and not open. Q ranks almost every exchange ahead of this, but with both U's and me ahead, there's a good chance he can get Q-stuck post-bingo and I can back-door the win.
>Brian_Bowman: AT 7B TA.. +5 284
>Jason: EGNQUUW 14B W.G +14 336
#note Ran Q three time and came up with three best plays: UNWE(T) at B3, (PI)QUE at 5E, and G(O)WN at 14B; the latter of which I hate. Damn him for opening another lane just as I can finally block this one!
>Brian_Bowman: ?EEIIRT B2 InTER.IE +68 352
>Jason: ENOQSUU 8A Q.S +38 374
#note The obvious play. I said something like "It won't be enough," because I'd misadded in my head; didn't think I was going up 22. For a second, I thought I'd won. I was so frustrated ... this was a game full of what-ifs. What if he didn't block DWARFISH? What if I'd pulled the S earlier and been able to kill the spot along row 15? What if I'd left the Q for him? What if I'd blocked the T and left him with none playable with his ?EEIIRT rack? If ifs and buts were candy and nuts...
>Brian_Bowman: AY G5 AY +25 377
#note He had a couple other winners, but this was nice. Well played, Brian. I only lost 25.6 equity points, so I feel better about how I played. But it was frustrating 'cause I was so close to putting the game away so many times and couldn't. Ah well. A weird 1-3, +83 afternoon and back to 4-4 for the tournament. Fortunately, a cool dinner group helped me forget my woes quickly.
