#note A case where the demands of the board and the demands of the rack are clearly in conflict.  Even though it really hurts my rack to play off the only consonant, NOON was probably called for here to wipe out the S hook to column O.  Certainly, the way the game continued that hook was a big problem for me the rest of the way.

#note Maybe a bad choice because of the high scoring comebacks it allowed, but I felt that it was important to keep turning over as many tiles as possible to try to get an S to play on the O column before him.
