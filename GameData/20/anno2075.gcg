#note BULGUR is the best play; I didn't know it. This is second-best.
>Keith_Smith: AFILNOV 3C F.AVINOL +82 99
#note FLAVANOL, FLAVONOL, but no FLAVINOL*. It sucks to let an 82-point natural phony go when your opponent has a shitty rack. One of the reasons I accepted was that it gave me a place to put my non-go (I didn't see or know AUGURERS).

>Keith_Smith: AMTT 1L MATT +36 135
>Sam: ACDEIPS 1H PAD +41 204
#note At the time, I didn't know the word PERACIDS. It's in my cardbox as of now (well, the singular, anyway).
>Keith_Smith: DIJ F7 ..DJI +32 167
>Sam: CEHIOSY E11 HOY +28 232
#note Terrible play. HOSEY 12D is best, followed by COYISH 12B and COSEY 12D. Didn't know COYISH, but HOSEY and COSEY are in my cardbox (only HOSEY was back then, though).
>Keith_Smith: KOST 12B KOT.S +35 202
>Sam: CEGISTX C11 G.X +22 254
#note CIG 3M is the only other viable option.

>Sam: ?CEEIST --  -89 254
#note Only I could fuck this rack up. This is incredibly retarded. It's only 3 more points than RECITErS/RETIClES/RECEIpTS 5D!!!
>Keith_Smith: ?EILNPU 5C I.E +6 234
>Sam: ?CEEIST I8 .ICETiES +60 314
#note SECTIlE 14E, anyone? Especially after Keith's fish. 
>Keith_Smith: AEIILRT 15G LI.TERIA +77 311
#note Very important to note that neither of us believed it took an S.
>Sam: ADEEIPV L11 VIPE. +20 334
#note PEAKED B9!!

>Keith_Smith: EFNNORU J11 FON +14 348
>Sam: AAEQRUW B10 WA... +23 382
#note The key to this play is that there are no As or Os unseen. I leave myself, at minimum, QUA A8 41. The sim likes REWAKEN better, but I would never play that, it makes no sense. WAKEN was mistakenly scored as 26.
>Keith_Smith: ?CEINWZ 13L .EW +16 364
#note This is Keith's real rack, I believe. He had WIZENs O10 105, but was quite sure that LISTERIAS wasn't good, as I was. Thank god he didn't play it.
>Sam: AEIQRUU A8 QUA +41 423
#note I go up 59 after this play. The most Keith can get is 60 for CLoZES, CoZENS, or MiZENS, and I'm usually able to outrun him after that.
>Keith_Smith: ?CELNSZ O8 CLoZES +60 424
#note He laid down CoZENS first, but then correctly replaced it with CLoZES.
