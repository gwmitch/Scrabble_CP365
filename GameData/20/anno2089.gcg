#note GRAPHOLECT! What a sick play, I wonder if Bing would find that. LO is horrid. I figured he was fishing holding the blank or S, but have no idea why I bothered trying to block, or why I picked such a stupid word that wouldn't do much to block anyway. OWL 11G is second-best behind GRAPHOLECT.

>Sam: ACEINNT 4D ANTI.CNE +70 151
#note The sim prefers ANTIACNE 2D and 4H slightly, which has to be wrong. Would anyone place the bingo anywhere but 4D?
>Rafi_Stern: AFLOU 5J AFOUL +28 163
>Sam: ACDIJLO F2 JO. +26 177
#note The bag is so vowel-heavy that JIAO 5C is best. I didn't anticipate that this play would sim so poorly.

>Sam: ACDILOT 7G A.TICOLD +67 244
#note SKIVE 15F might be a little better, if only to cover the hotspot.

#note RISE O1 sims best, as I could have predicted, but I was very wary that URD was a setup for RITZ A1 74

#note A play like SUAVER B2 26 or PASH G12 30 would have been interesting.
