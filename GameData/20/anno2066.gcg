#note Awesome post-bing rack, if you ask me!  Saw squaw, but did not look for a spot after I saw this.

#note only 2 unseen e's and the blank will fit on the tws line, and might be tough for my opp to find a bingo ending in E as well, so that made this an easy decision for me, esp since it's almost killing a good lane.

#note blocked a nice spot that I had considered, but wouldn't have used until my opponents G was out of their hands.
>evan: ILRR 14L R.. +12 416
#note best score, but did not see the outplay for my next turn.
>mm: AFST 6J T.. +11 401
#note blatant block, but her outplay here still loses, so why not delay & try to win?
>evan: ILR 4E .IRL +8 424
#note after 6 minutes, I finally found it. other options : LI, o11 for 9 pts, or lid 7a for 4 which blocks her 22 point outplay. li gets me a win if she does not see her 22 points, otherwise a tie. lid assured me of a tie, as she could play fas/snook to go out for 17.
