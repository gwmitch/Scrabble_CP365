#note GLIM 4A and FRILL 4A look like the two best options. Both are much better than FILL.

#note SPURTED! Finds like this should be layups. Dunno if I saw the word or the hook (ILIAD). SoUP is the best non-bingo.
>Randy_Greenspan: AX 13C AX +37 146
>Sam: EEJRSST 6B J.E +26 209
#note JO 6B is better. Of course EERSST is better than ERSST, dunno why I laid down that E.

#note The sim prefers VIREO 14A by a lot. That doesn't seem so smart to me, especially with stuff like RESAWING, RESOWING, and RESEWING out. WOVE would have been an improvement on my play, though, as it semi-blocks the ZAMIAS hook.

>Randy_Greenspan: EEEEINN 7I E.E +4 299
>Sam: AEGNORT L9 OAR..G +25 467
#note The sim likes LOO 9J, but that probably has the opponent playing to the triple and me bingoing out a lot. I like my play much more.
>Randy_Greenspan: BEEINST 8L SNIB +30 329
#note SNIT N3 is actually a few points better, leaving BEEF B1.
>Sam: EENT 14K ..ENT +16 483
>Randy_Greenspan: EET B13 TEE +16 345
#note This is the game I'm capable of playing every time out. I had misses, sure, but I was able to see the board like I sometimes can't.
