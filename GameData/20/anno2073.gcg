>Sam: ILMOSST 8D MISSLOT +74 74
>Sam: ILMOSST --  -74 0
#note Very nice, Sam. MOILS 8D is best. Note to self: Stop playing phonies, this is Orlando D1!
>Steve_Grob: OOW 8F WOO +12 12
>Sam: ILMOSST 9E SOM +20 20
#note I'm not sure whether I considered OMS 9F or not, but the sim likes SOM slightly better, despite sacking two points. Apparently, the opponent scores about two more points on average after OMS. I guess this is due to increased usage of 10F and hook opportunities for words at E9. He really can't do too much after SOM.
>Steve_Grob: ?MOSTTU 10A MUTTOnS +72 84
#note Okay, make that "He usually can't do much after SOM." UTMOsTS (who knew?) I2 looks like the sim winner, despite sacking seven points from UTMOsTS 7A.
>Sam: AILOSTY A7 ATO.Y +30 50
#note LOAMY A7 is clearly superior, I must have not seen it. YOM A8 looks even better than LOAMY. 
>Steve_Grob: IQ B6 QI +33 117

>Steve_Grob: EHY D10 .HEY +25 142
>Sam: ?AEISUV I2 ExUVIAS +67 140
#note The real bingos here are SUAsIVE, AmUSIVE, and AbUSIVE. Didn't know the first two. I think Steve might have held this phony.
>Steve_Grob: ABCDETW 13C A. +10 152
>Sam: CCDNORS 6F CON.C +21 161
#note CODEC 2F is the sim winner, probably because it blocks H1 (mostly) while still setting up an S hook. This also leaves a front hook that I don't possess, and ICONIC kills the S-hook, as it's CONICS but ICONICS*.
>Steve_Grob: EF J1 EF +26 178
>Sam: DNRRSTU B12 URD +14 175
#note This simply gives up too much counterplay at A13. TURDS K2 looks best, and it's not hard to see why. The game could have really turned here; while it's not a huge equity mistake or anything, the shape of the board would have been so different after TURDS, and probably in my favor.
>Steve_Grob: ABD A13 BAD +30 208
>Sam: ANNRSTX H2 RAX +42 217
>Steve_Grob: GIJ E5 JIG +32 240
>Sam: FNNNRST -FNNN +0 217
#note I hate exchanging when I'm down 23 on a board like this. I'll have to open something up if I get a decent draw.
>Steve_Grob: AEGHILN J8 HEALING +78 318
#note I never even saw the possibility of WOOSH. It's not exactly the easiest back hook to spot. Nice find, Steve!
>Sam: GRRSTUZ 11J .UTZ +26 243
#note ZIG 12I is the play that Quackle suggests. Only 13, but sets up the S-hook that is decently hard to block. The problem with this is that Quackle's sim won't have an opponent blocking next turn, while Steve will certainly block as much as he can after ZIG. ZIG is still a viable option though, along with RITZ 12I. RITZ sets up the F hook for FRUG H12 57, volatility I need to set up. Given a redo, I'd probably play ZIG, but it isn't very clearcut.
>Steve_Grob: AABDEIR M6 ARABI.ED +98 416
>Sam: GORRSTW N2 STROW +45 288
#note Quackle wants a play like WAGS or WARS 8L. 
>Steve_Grob: ANPT O5 PANT +28 444
>Sam: EEEGLRR L11 .REE +15 303
#note REJIG E3 and BRAYER 13A are good options I didn't consider.
>Steve_Grob: ENOP 15L NOPE +27 471
#note I may have held. I wasn't sure of TREEN.
>Sam: EEGIILR O5 ....ILE +9 312
#note Just when I thought I'd played an endgame correctly...Quackle shows GITE 3L, which sets up LIGER L1. It's two points better than my sequence, which blocks FED and EF.
>Steve_Grob: DEFKNNV 11I K.... +18 489
#note Any play blocking my out is better. Dunno if he saw it. KNEED 13I is the best of the blocks.
>Sam: EGIR 13F REIG. +9 321
