>Quackle: ABGNPTU 8G BUG +12 12
#note This is the only game a took a picture of so i thought i'd give annotation a try. I don't record my racks so they'll be either partial leaves from memory or none at all, sorry :( I'd autopilot pub online for sure but thought that p > g for bingoing and bug is a little more defensive. I might have underestimated the ng synergy but this is 2nd behind pub by 0.3% in a sim. 
>New_Player_1: JOT 9F JOT +18 18
>Quackle: AFINPST 7F NAP +17 29
#note I saw that if i'd played pub I'd have fasting which put me on tilt immediately lol, can't resist the results orientation sometimes :). NAP is really close with exch F, 7F FA, FAN, and FAT. Played this to set up the additional s hook, but maybe underestimated AINPST, although pure fishing in this type of situation isnt really my style.
>New_Player_1: IVY F9 .IVY +19 37
>Quackle: ?FINRST J8 SNIFTeR +70 99
#note J2 FoRINTS, really bad miss here. Played SNIFTeR this way vs H10 to shape the board for defense both because i'm ahead and because i know my opponent knows more bingoes than me but i'm confident in my ability vs anyone on a closed board.

>New_Player_1: BDNY 13I B.NDY +26 166
>Quackle: EEIILNS 12J .IE +14 150
#note Debated between TIE and FIE J11, flipflopping on the sim. 
>New_Player_1: ARW 13C WAR +30 196
>Quackle: EEILNOS E1 OLEINES +70 220
#note I forgot about the (BENDY)S hook, but this placement wins over 3% more of the time anyway, i guess because it opens multiple spots vs just one that my opponent will almost certainly take?
>New_Player_1: CEFR 1D F.RCE +42 238
>Quackle: AEIMOTX 2H TOXEMIA +116 336
#note Weeeeee :) I thought there was a good chance he'd make a spot for this by playing at D1 but this was obviously the best case scenario barring him putting an A at 011 randomly :)
>New_Player_1: AKU 1K AUK +21 259
>Quackle: DDGHHIT 4D D.GHT +22 358
#note I thought i knew all the 5's but apparently not, HIGHT :\. M3 HID wins the sim, blocking TOXEMIAS plays, but this is 97% to win anyway - i considered it but didnt want to draw 3 more consonants since pretty much only nightmare scenarios will cause me to lose now.
>New_Player_1: A 11J .A +16 275
>Quackle: ADEIMOT 3M DIM +30 388
#note Wanted to block o line and thought DIE might allow some crazy 3x3 but it wins the sim. I remember the rack since i remember i blocked myself from DOMINATE - I might have played DIM anyway due to the 3x3 possibility - I'd already been tripled tripled on twice this tourney :(
>New_Player_1: EEINPRS N9 EREPSIN +83 358
#note As soon as he played this i internally facepalmed for missing the hook. He had PER(FORCE) available keeping SINE, and he needs a bingo plus more to come back here, but this is volatile enough that it's probably better, the sim agrees.
>Quackle: CEO 15L CO.E +27 415
#note Have to block L15 in case he drew the Z
>New_Player_1: AEHIORZ O3 .AZIER +54 412
#note He said the Q was in the bag in which case he missed MAHZOR, which is a word i wanted to play this tourney after randomly doing a zzyzyva quiz on all 7's, no probability order, and learning MAHZORS about 2 weeks ago!
>Quackle: ADEEOTU M6 TOEA +9 424
#note Had to block QI for 31 and go out in 2, missed AUTOED M6 and bled more spread though :( This play is even worse because i thought he'd be forced to play QI at E10 for the wrong reason, i didnt see the other QI spot for some reason and also didnt see DUEL B2 for myself, so if he played HO L7 first i'd have panicked for a second but i had 6 minutes on my clock and wouldve found DUEL
