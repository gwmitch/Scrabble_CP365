#note What to do here? 3M MU is a little nutty but it at least makes a line. Opening the triple lane with MUM isn't so great either, not to mention keeping TINE on a very poor board for a bingo leave without an S. Perhaps 3L MM was the play.
>Joe_W: EEINOPS 5B PEONIES +72 126
#note Bullet dodge
>Will: EIINOTU O3 .INUET +27 97
#note Nothing much better than this, surprisingly.

#note Lame A setup, there are tons still unseen and ANO is junk. B2 POOPING is better in every way including as a setup and for the lulz, as the kids say nowadays.

#note Oops, L10 GAVAGE gets all that junk off. 1A GO also sims pretty well - I guess GRAVE will actually bingo a decent amount here?

#note Just dumping the F and going for UPSTAGED/PUDGIEST is good, FUSTY is also probably good if I want to try to outscore by drawing the X instead of hitting a bingo. Very close to trying FUDGY* here.
