>Megan_O'Connell: GLMO 1H GL.OM +33 66
>Charles_Reinke: ?LOOQUY 8F QU.Y +16 103
#note OBLOQUY!  I'm guessing that one takes another few years to pop up on my rack.  Since I am very Q-averse, I took this chance to clear my rack of that dreaded tile.  I don't think I would ever do something like QUInOL.  Keeping the Q with the U (by doing something like F4 OOZY) is good because of the possibility of big plays at H4.

#note I was sure I was missing something, but there are no sevens on this rack.

#note Horrible leave, but this play puts me up by a bingo, and with a favorable draw I won't need to exchange.

>Charles_Reinke: EFIIRRU 1D FUR +25 350
#note Looked for K plays in the O Column.  Missed KEFIR.  This is bad for reasons soon to be apparent.  D1 FAIR looks better in hindsight.
>Megan_O'Connell: AEENPST 4A PENATES +80 333
#note Megan mentioned after the game that she wasn't sure enough of NEPETAS to pull the trigger.

>Megan_O'Connell: DDIO O4 .IDDO +33 366
>Charles_Reinke: AHIRTTV B4 .TH +29 409
#note Having drawn the last two T's, I don't need to rush to hit row 15.  That's good because the only play that makes it to the triple is TRAIT.  There is still an S that could burn me, but I don't know if Megan is aware that WON takes an S.
>Megan_O'Connell: BFU B10 FUB +29 395
>Charles_Reinke: AEILRTV 15D TRAVEL +38 447
#note I should have thought harder about the endgame.  TRAVE, then 5D LI.

>Charles_Reinke: I C2 .I. +4 451
#note ID is 5.  Somehow I counted it as 4 over the board.
>Charles_Reinke:  (CENNRSX) +32 483
#note The spread is deceptively large.  If Megan gets the X down, the final scores would be pretty close.
