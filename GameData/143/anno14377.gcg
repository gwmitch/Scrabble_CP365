I've been learning words.

#note There's always a freaky bingo I don't know in Collins.
>Nuala_O'Rourke: DEELPT 15F PELTED +34 144
#note Easy stuff.
>Winter: ?DIRRWW 12J DR.W +8 164
#note My big fuckup. I should have exchanged.

>Winter: ?EIIRUW 11I WIE. +21 185
#note And again here, but I kept trying to play through, vaguely hoping to draw a challenge. Which is stupid, because the words are weird to me, but surely not to her.
>Nuala_O'Rourke: FNU N10 FUN +23 192
#note The opposite of this game.
>Winter: ?IIJRRU -IIJRU +0 185
#note Had to give up the ghost on this crap and try to bingo before she does.
>Nuala_O'Rourke: AEMNOTU O4 OUTNAME +85 277
#note AARRGHH!!! This is the peril of the 5-point challenge. I was sure it was good, but when weighing 85 points vs 5, and not having a bingo on my rack, I dropped the 5 points.
>Winter: ?ABBIOR D9 RABBI +28 213
#note I gotta pull these tiles to bingo with, while she has already dropped two easies.
>Nuala_O'Rourke: ASZ N2 SAZ +35 312
#note AARRGHH!!!
>Winter: ?DEFORY 15N FY +29 242
#note Damn, I had a vague notion that FADY might be good, but I'm still just starting on my fours.
>Nuala_O'Rourke: AGHN M3 HANG +38 350
#note I really needed her not to hit this.
>Winter: ?DEIIOR C1 DIORI.Es +68 310
#note This would have been good enough, if not for HANG.
>Nuala_O'Rourke: GV 13C V.G +14 364
>Winter: EHJOSTY 1A YO.H +45 355
#note I see a possibility, that involves drawing the challenge.
>Nuala_O'Rourke: ?AEISUU L2 SAlE +38 402
#note FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! Worse, I still need to go over those fours over and over. I've done the Ls at least three times, and also words with a Z, but LAZO still didn't stick out. I thought I'd lose by one, so I had to challenge... EXCEPT that I'd forgotten the JE(A)T + S play combo I'd seen early. If I had not challenged, I would have won.
>Winter: EJST 10B JE.T +29 384
#note Holy shit--there was another combo that wins, but I don't know THANG, and I'm not sure I would have seen it even if I did.
