>Charles_Reinke: IKNNORS H7 RINK +16 16
#note MN vs WI 2013, round 9.  Maybe KIRN here to not give up the front hooks on RINK.
>Sue_Rhea: ?AEGSTW 9B SWEATi.G +67 67
>Charles_Reinke: DNNORSU 6H DURN +17 33
#note RUNDOWNS.  I guess I underestimated the potency of NRS, since C9 WOUND and 6G UDON are both better than this.
>Sue_Rhea: AOZ 8A ZOA +43 110
>Charles_Reinke: EEMNOSU 5I MEOU +22 55
#note The W continues to torment me; UNAWESOME.  Witty reference to the quality of my play goes here.
>Sue_Rhea: BDL E8 B.LD +14 124
>Charles_Reinke: EEHINOS 7C HI +22 77
#note Why not HE or HO in the same spot?   What am I doing?
>Sue_Rhea: HP B7 P..H +25 149
>Charles_Reinke: CEEENOS 4D EOCENES +78 155
#note It didn't even occur to me that EOCENE doesn't take an S.  That's what I get for recently reviewing my four-vowel sixes.  
>Sue_Rhea: GORY 5B GORY +28 177
>Charles_Reinke: ?AACFIL M3 FAsCIAL +82 237
>Sue_Rhea: ABDEOS -  +0 177
#note Challenged.
>Charles_Reinke: AAAEENT L7 ATE +11 248
#note Now that I'm up by a bingo, I'm going to close the board in paranoid fashion and prevent high-scoring 8L plays at the same time.  
>Sue_Rhea: ABDEOS A10 ABODES +35 212
>Charles_Reinke: AAEINVW H1 WAI. +21 269
#note VAW and VIEW on the N column were immediately ruled out for defense considerations, but the board isn't even that shut-down yet, so it's not worth the point sacrifice.
>Sue_Rhea: ANV B2 VAN. +16 228
>Charles_Reinke: AEIILNV F7 VI.AE +21 290
#note The other plays that score this much (N1 VIAL, D11 ALIVE, 13A DIVINE) open up too much.  I only seriously considered ALIVE since the amount of E's, R's, and T's in the bag mean that bingoing is actually fairly likely with the IN leave.

>Charles_Reinke: EEILNNX B13 EX +39 329
>Sue_Rhea: IO 10H .OI +12 274
>Charles_Reinke: DEIJLNN 11J DJIN +27 356
#note This play makes it nearly impossible to bingo.
>Sue_Rhea: TU 8L ..UT +12 286
>Charles_Reinke: EFLNRTT N7 T.FT +18 374
#note 12L FELT is a tempting 28 points, but this fits in with the "don't let her bingo" theme I had going.  -EST or -IEST bingos on column O are still possible, though, so N1 FRET might be better.  After that, her bingos will be harder to find.
>Sue_Rhea: IOR M11 .OIR +8 294

#note Conceding the bingo.
