#player2 Evil_Matthew Evil Matthew
>Matthew: AEEGJNR H4 JAEGER +44 44
#note We start with an interesting decision right at the start. Is it worth two points and the board position to keep the E? They're neck and neck in the sim.
>Evil_Matthew: CFILLNT 6D INFL.CT +22 22
#note Another close call. INFL(E)CT scores the best, but certain leaves (ILN) (ILNT) might be better. CLEFT and CLEF sim a bit better, but it's very close.
>Matthew: BBDENSY K1 BENDYS +37 81
#note This seems and sims best.
>Evil_Matthew: ?ILOSUY 10E lOUSILY +78 100
#note NOOOOOOOO ISOBUTYL. I didn't know vinously, but piously would have been an improvement to my choice.
>Matthew: ABDEHIR 1H BAR.ED +36 117
#note 28 point H played and 36 point triple plays keeping AH are better than this play.
>Evil_Matthew: AENOOOT 11I NOO +20 120
#note This is best
>Matthew: EEHILPS 5D HIE +26 143
#note This has the best equity and sets up the P, although the P setup can be taken by an A or C. This is still best though.
>Evil_Matthew: ACEEIOT 4C OCA +29 149
#note OCA? TOEA? COATEE? AC(HI)OTE is sexy. OCA sims best though.
>Matthew: AEKLOPS 12K KOP +28 171
#note This is a bit better than the other options available, which include KOP/NOOK for 26, OKA at 12J for 27, and SPLAKE/LOCA for 50(!).
>Evil_Matthew: EEGITWZ 13K EWE +36 185
#note I don't like the prospects of giving him an easy 40 point ZA spot. Perhaps I'm being a bit too paranoid? This sims behind WIZ 13L and WI(N)ZE 3I
>Matthew: AAEILRS 14E AERIALS +73 244
#note Best
>Evil_Matthew: DGINNTZ H13 Z.N +36 221
#note I did not realize the potency of DNNIG.
>Matthew: EGHITUX 15A EIGHT +41 285
#note TEUGH, knew it didn't see it.
>Evil_Matthew: DDGINTU 14M DUD +16 237
#note This kamikaze move sims 3 points behind DU(N)TING 3I
>Matthew: AAOPTUX 14A AX +38 323
#note Do I block the D? AX sims 4% behind updo.
>Evil_Matthew: FGIINOT O12 FI.O +36 273
#note That's why.
>Matthew: AIIOPTU 2C UTOPIA +18 341
#note I figure row 2 is the most potent line left on the board. Quackle concurs.
>Evil_Matthew: ?AAGINT 8A AlGINAT. +77 350
#note Not exactly sure how to decide which bingo to play. INdAGATE sims best.
>Matthew: IMMRRTV 1A VIM +28 369
#note Not sure why TROCAR is 5% better than VIM. maybe it blocks (S)OCA/SUQ? That's my only real guess.
>Evil_Matthew: LOQRSUV 13C SUQ +36 386
#note I missed SUQ/SOCA for two more points. I lost by two points!
>Matthew: EEMRRTW M1 .REW +16 385
>Evil_Matthew: ELNORTV L4 OE +23 409
#note REVOLT for the win.
>Matthew: EMRT A7 M.TER +7 392
#note I misadded and Matthew won by 2 points. I also didn't know ARMET.
>Matthew:  (LNRTV) +16 408
