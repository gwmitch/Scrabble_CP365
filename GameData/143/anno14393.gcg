>Peter: INOR 8G NORI +8 8
>Will: AEINOST K2 ATONIES +69 69
#note Not really sure what to think of NORI - it's probably slightly likelier than usual that Peter has an S so I went for K2 over K8, despite the increased power tile risk.
>Peter: IJRUY G7 I.JURY +25 33
>Will: ?ADDILU 6H DIv.DUAL +61 130
#note Really need to eliminate these careless blunders. They happen a lot when I'm looking for bingos for a while and focusing so hard that I lose track of other parts of the game. Nice to find the only bingo, but the other placement scores 5 more and is far superior defensively, both in the short term and the long term.

>Peter: EEENRST 11G .EENTERS +66 116
>Will: DFGHIVY L2 DIF +29 198
#note J2 FIG clearly better.
>Peter: X F9 .X +50 166
>Will: GHLORVY 3K ..VY +20 218
#note I think I even saw OVERLY here, no idea why I wouldn't have played it. At this point I've realized my DIVIDUAL error and am annoyed at myself.
>Peter: ?MOOPST F1 cOMPOST +66 232
>Will: CGHLORT 5C COH.G +22 240
#note This play I actually think I got right - blocking plays to the D from H1 is gonna save me a lot of points sometimes. Also thought about OCTYL.

>Peter: EO C11 O.E +12 271
>Will: EILNRTZ F12 .EZ +32 294
#note I preferred this to L10 LEZ for the points and defense - I figured this was my cue to start outscoring.
>Peter: AM 4D MA. +27 298
>Will: FILNRTU J1 IF +28 322
#note I liked IF better than 10B FLU to keep the U and get 7 extra points.
>Peter: AEIRSTU 14E A.URITES +69 367
#note I had to wince a little when this came down.

>Will: AGKNPQU L9 QU.AN. +30 385
#note Not best but the sequences are pretty complicated here
