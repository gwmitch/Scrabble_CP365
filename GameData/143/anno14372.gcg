#note Big mistake. I noticed BOGY a couple turns later and just felt off my game for the rest of this game -- that put me on tilt a bit.

#note I really hated making this play, but what else am I supposed to do? Well, E(XU)LT is available, and it's probably a better option. Really wish I'd played FEALTY.

#note I had one of the few racks where the correct play is on the right side, but unfortunately so did he.

>whatnoloan: ?AOOSSU K10 OA. +14 285
#note Looked at SOUK, ASKOI, and OAK. SOUK looked very poor at this point, as I need all the lanes I can get. It was just between OAK and ASKOI, and I couldn't figure out which one was better. Quackle suggests that OSU? and OSSU? are about the same, so I should take the points here.

#note Tricky! SURVEIL becomes SURVEILLED and SURVEILLING, but not this. Mike didn't bat an eye, and SURVEILLED was a faint, quickly dismissed idea at the back of my mind.
