>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: ADHN 8G HAND +16 16
#note MN vs WI 2013, round 14.
>Charles_Reinke: EHIORSU 9C HOURI +19 19
#note I feel like I lost my first game against Zbigniew due to over-fishing, so this game I resolve not to fall into the same trap.  That thinking affects a lot of my plays.  HOURI gives up too much on row 8 - DUO looks like a good fish in this situation.
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: INZ 10B ZIN +39 55
>Charles_Reinke: EGILSTX E8 L.GE +24 43
#note J8 DEX scores with the X, which is smart since it's not going to score anywhere else.  Or I can fish with XU.  This play is okay.
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: ?ABEERV K2 BEAVERs +80 135
>Charles_Reinke: GIOSTWX 8A WOG +28 71
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: INOY L1 YONI +32 167
>Charles_Reinke: IMSTTUX 10G MIXT +23 94
#note MIXT at L1 would have been so nice.
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: AAIRT 11H TIARA +23 190
>Charles_Reinke: DFFSSTU M3 STUFF +39 133
#note 12A DUFFS leaves open the S hook on TIARA, as well as leaving a better leave of ST.  The top-left area of the board is looking very unfriendly, which is not in my favor given that I am still down by a bingo after this play.
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: ACW J1 CAW +24 214
#note Underscored by two.
>Charles_Reinke: DDEISTU 12A STUDDIE +77 210
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: ?ADEENT 13G DENTAtE +75 289
#note Just as I catch up!
>Charles_Reinke: ABCJLOY A12 .OJA +33 243
#note Did not see the STUFF hook: 8M YOB. STUFFY - abounding in stuff.  
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: EM J6 ME. +24 313
#note Overscored by 1.
>Charles_Reinke: BCLNORY 14K BONY +25 268
#note YOB again.  Also, C plays starting at 12L, or 1F BRONC setting up my Y.  All this does is make him nervous that I'm setting up my non-existent S.  
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: AQT 15J QAT +21 334
#note He told me after the game that he had nowhere else to play the Q.
>Charles_Reinke: ACKLRSS 14A .ACKS +36 304
#note 7E KAS is a fantastic play, setting up my S and scoring at the same time.  With five E's, three I's, and three O's, the leave of CLRS would actually be very good.  This play telegraphs that I have the last S, meaning he will be very careful not to set anything up for me.  I don't see how I will win after this.
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: EV H13 .VE +18 352
>Charles_Reinke: ELLORRS 1H OR. +15 319
#note Setting up my S and hoping that he screws up.
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: EIP 2F PIE +13 365
>Charles_Reinke: EEGLLRS 1L .ELL +21 340
#note Zbigniew didn't really block, so I still have a chance.  I looked and looked for plays like 10L LEG to set up my S.  
>Zbigniew_Wieckowski: IILNORU 3D RUIN +12 377
>Charles_Reinke: EEGOPRS 4A PORES +26 366
#note If I had played LEG, I would have ELOPERS on this rack, but Zbigniew would have been able to block and win regardless.
