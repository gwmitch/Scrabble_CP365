>Matthew: AFNOOTW H6 WOOF +20 20
#note Of course this is best.
>Winter: ABBY G5 BABY +31 31
>Matthew: AEGNOTU I6 AGUE +34 54
#note A couple overlap plays are close. This, TEGUA, GUANO
>Winter: AJ 5E JA. +24 55
>Matthew: EHLNOPT 6B HELO +24 78
#note I couldn't remember whether or not HOLP was good. HELO is a bit down from HOLP and HOLPEN.
>Winter: DMOP C3 MOP.D +24 79
>Matthew: ACINNPT D1 CAIN +26 104
#note I didn't know whether not the C or P was a better tile. CAIN sims a bit down from the leaders.
>Winter: EEFLRST J8 REFLETS +83 162
#note Didn't know reflets.
>Matthew: AADINPT 12D PATINA.D +74 178
#note Easy enough choice here.
>Winter: ADEGS 1D .ADGES +30 192
#note I should assume now that he has another S.
>Matthew: CEILMRU 14F CLUM.IER +68 246
#note Another easy choice. Clumpier is needlessly risky.
>Winter: ITZ 11E ZIT +50 242
>Matthew: EELQSTW 8A WEST +35 281
#note WELTER is slightly better than WEST.
>Winter: INR H11 I.R.N +28 270
>Matthew: AEHLQTU 15L HEAL +44 325
#note HEAL is best.
>Winter: DTUY J3 DUTY +34 304
>Matthew: ?IIQTUV M11 QUI.. +28 353
#note My hear sunk when he chose that spot to play. This is best though.
>Winter: INOOR 3H IN.OOR +16 320
>Matthew: ?IKOTVX N10 KIT +30 383
#note Interesting position here. CP prefers VeX or KeX on the triple, a couple of exchanges, KI and XI in the same spot, and K(O)I for 14 all better than this. Not sure why KIT is so bad. ISE bingoes?
>Winter: GIV 13C VIG +31 351
>Matthew: ?ENOOVX L2 s.NOVOX +48 431
#note What's amazing here is that tons of endgames TIE after s(O)NOVOX. Anything that allows winter to play off of indoor and get a one point tile on the triple letter score ties. Anything that doesn't do that loses, while any 8 starting with a W wins. Quackle says s(O)NOVOX wins 41.67 percent of the time, but it's not terribly reliable since a lot of those wins are actually ties.
>Winter: ?EEERRS N1 RESERvE +70 421
#note I asked him if he wanted to try something like resteer. He said if he was going for a win he would have challenged sonovox.
>Winter:  (AEN) +6 427
