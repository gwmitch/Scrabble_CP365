#note Normally I would exchange for sure here, but Joel's play of SWIG and certain monster S-containing leave made me overthink this position a bit. If I exchange and Joel bingos with VUGGS I thought I might be in trouble, but I guess could just reopen the board playing from the V and probably get my own bingo down not too long afterwards. Should have exchanged.
