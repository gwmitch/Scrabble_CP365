>Mosaic: ADIOZ 8D DIAZO +34 34
>Dave_Koenig: DEELOUX 9F LOXED +38 38
#note I was torn between this, EAUX, EXUDED, and DELUXE for good reason:  They're not that far from each other in equity.  However, I missed DOUX 9F, which is significantly better than all of them.  It scores as much as this with a much better leave.
>Mosaic: AEGHINT 7H HEATING +76 110
#note GAHNITE 7F was 17 points more
>Dave_Koenig: EEEIMOU D3 MEOUE. +18 56
#note I like this much better than MEOU 6J, even though it scores 10 points more.  The value is not just in shedding the extra vowel, but in ensuring an open board when I am trailing.
>Mosaic: HOPW C2 WHOP +44 154
>Dave_Koenig: EEEIIIL -EEIIIL +0 56
#note I was torn between trading down to EL or just E, but given that two blanks and all the S's were out there, with the valuable HEATINGS# hook open, and that the remaining tiles already seemed slightly consonant heavy, I thought it made sense to toss 6.  The tile gods laughed at me and handed me four A's on the next draw.

#note I missed my high scoring play of CAPOEIRAS through PO, but this is actually not a bad alternative, as it's not quite as dangerous column A.
>Mosaic: FFIRS O1 RIFFS +54 244
>Dave_Koenig: NOOTTWY A11 TWONY +47 193
#note I had the awesome bingo TOYTOWN# here, which I did not know but will never forget now.  But why play a phony which I was very questionable about rather than TOWNY or NOWTY# in the same spot?  The best answer I can give is that I know John and Marsh very well and have a good sense of what I can push by them, and that I was still so far down I thought those extra 9 points would be very handy.  TWONIE# and TWOONIE are good, but neither is spelled with the Y.
>Mosaic: BGO A7 BOG +31 275
>Dave_Koenig: EIIMNOS E10 MOI +15 208
#note Not just trying to massage the rack, but also to create more bingo lanes.

>Dave_Koenig: AEEILNS O7 SEALINE +86 294
>Mosaic: BO 6I OB +22 346
>Dave_Koenig: CGLNTUY A1 CLUNG +34 328
#note CULTY on row 13 and CLINGY/GUILTY on row 12 all look good but close down lanes.  Keeping the Y is not ideal for bingos, but at least I keep more bingo lanes open.
>Mosaic: EIR M3 RE.I. +28 374
>Dave_Koenig: EEIJKTY D12 KYTE +36 364
#note It was a close call between this and KYE in the same spot, but in the end with a lot of consonants remaining, including two more T's, and the blank still to draw, it made sense to me to play the extra tile and score 4 more.

>Dave_Koenig: AES (challenge) +5 433
#note I could have made the blank S or X here.  But I said, "the blank is a zed."
