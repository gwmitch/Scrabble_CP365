#note VERJUICE??? But I should have found JAYVEE and JARVEY!!!
>Cecil_Muscat: CIRV 6F VRI.C +24 68
#note Dammit.
>Winter: AEEGOUV D8 .UGAE +26 53
>Winter: AEEGOUV --  -26 27
#note I need to stop playing this word.
>Cecil_Muscat: AAAAAA -AAAAAA +0 68
>Winter: AEEGOUV J9 UVAE +20 47
#note Finally, a balanced rack, BUT I SHOULD HAVE PLAYED VAG!!! BECAUSE...
>Cecil_Muscat: ?DDEILT 11G DeT.ILED +68 136
#note Yes, I should have played VAG, because my luck has been shit since Daventry, and whenever I start making progress, my opponents start dropping bingos. Fourth game in a row now like this.
>Winter: BEGIOTW 9C WOT +21 68
#note Opening board. Quackle hates it of course. Didn't look too hard across the LED, since this board is in danger of shutting down.
>Cecil_Muscat: AADI 12D AIDA +13 149
>Winter: ABEGIRT 10B BEGAT +35 103
#note All I need is for him to have one more bad rack, and I'm in it, but...
>Cecil_Muscat: HOZ 13C ZHO +37 186
#note No, it's me who will draw shit.
>Winter: AEEIRUU J2 AURI. +9 112
#note Of course. Try to open the board again. Quack likes A(D)IEU, which most certainly get me zinged with four esses and an X unseen.
>Cecil_Muscat: ABINORS M5 BARONI.S +62 248
#note Ridiculous.
>Winter: EEOSUWY 8L Y.WE +42 154
>Cecil_Muscat: DK 6L D.K +18 266
>Winter: EHIOSSU 14B HOI +29 183
#note I'm still in it, if I can bingo off that AHI, with just one ess left in the bag and two on my rack, but...
>Cecil_Muscat: ?AEGLMN 4D MANGLE.s +72 338
#note Only bullshit befalls me.
>Winter: EMOOSSU 15A MOOSE +49 232
#note Well, at least I managed to get 57 for this play, instead of 49.
>Cecil_Muscat: FLP E2 FL.P +18 356
>Winter: EIPRSTU L10 P.U +18 250
#note I finally get a bingo, but the board is close. Oh, wait... no it's not, except that it will be years before I would ever have studied TAURIC.
>Cecil_Muscat: QT 2I Q.T +12 368
>Winter: EEIORST F12 .SO +22 272
#note At this point I give up on a bingo, figuring anyhing I open will just get closed, and I go for points.
>Cecil_Muscat: AEFOR 1K AFORE +38 406
>Winter: EEGIRTT 2B GRI.T +22 294
#note Down to two minutes left, otherwise I would have seen the X and avoided this.
>Cecil_Muscat: EILNNSX 1C EX +36 442
>Winter: EENNT N8 .EN. +19 313
#note GENNET goes out, but, again, way beyond me.
