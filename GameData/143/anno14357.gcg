>Charles_Reinke: EMOSTTY J4 T.YO +15 114
#note It was between this, TOY in the same spot, or K9 DOTY.  Blowing up the rack with K7 MODESTY is also reasonable since the S is already fairly useless on this board.  Against a lower-rated player, blocking easy 50-point X plays is smart.

>Charles_Reinke: ADEMQST 13C QATS +37 151
>Melissa_Brown: ATX D10 TAX. +22 95
#note Melissa mentioned after the game that she had OVERTAX on this turn.  At this point she had both blanks on her rack.
>Charles_Reinke: ADDEEMM M2 MEM +28 179
#note I chose MEM over MED in the same spot to prevent easy E-hooks on OD.  
>Melissa_Brown: ??AEPSY 11I SPlAYEd +79 174
#note Scored as 77.  There are a few bingos that play at N1, but with two blanks, they're all tough to spot.  
>Charles_Reinke: ADDEJOU N10 J.U +26 205
#note Blocking the triple-triple was my priority.  07 JADED freaked me out because it gave up the possibility of high-scoring plays starting at N10.  N1 JEU is nice because it sets up O1 ODD for 57 next turn.  I would have played that had I seen it, but I didn't even look in that corner of the board.
>Melissa_Brown: IIL J11 .ILI +8 182
#note The first two I's of the game.
>Charles_Reinke: AADDEFO O8 FEO. +27 232
#note N1 FAD is fine here.  The spot it creates in the corner of the board is not easy to hit for a lot of points.  Taking advantage of JO can wait since there is only one O left in the bag.

#note My leave of ACELST will bingo with 15/21 of the tiles left in the pool, provided she doesn't block.

#note Melissa mentioned after the game that I blocked 11C HAZE, which would have changed the game completely.
