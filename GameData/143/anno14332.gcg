#note I sure know how to pick em.  Even so, I still had a bingo but Margaret blocked it with her own.   I completely missed AWFUL.

#note I thought I had a bingo in this rack.   But I was thinking of AOUDADS and ARDUOUS.  One day I'm going to be so good that I won't make plays like this.   I'm supposed to be cashing in the big S spot.

#note I was going to play TUB to set up an S-hook I don't even have until I realized that BUT is better because I have an A.  I'm using my noggin! :D
>Margaret: AEGR 14J GA.ER +47 248
>Tasha: ACCMRTV -CMV +0 127
#note I considered TRACT (yeah, I really did), but keeping CMV isn't worth it.  Instead of keeping CMV I should exchange them.  I'm still using my noggin! :D B10 VAC actually wins the sim, but that play is dumb.  What's the point of opening another lane if I'm just going to take it out next turn?  Also, my win percentage went down by 8 points with this rack.  I was 10% to win before but now I'm at less than 3%.

#note With the notable exception in endgame, I think I spent more time on this rack than any other.  I was looking for a play that cleaned up my rack and opened the board.  I didn't see CEIBA (sim winner), but I like my play better.  EAU scores 20 points, opens the board if I can draw the blank or S, cleans my rack up a little (I can dump the B next turn), and gives nothing back unless Margaret has the blank or S.

>Tasha: BCEHINO A12 INCH +33 293
#note I played EBON at first (I really wanted to get rid of the B)  and then I take my tiles back.  About thirty seconds later, I play ECHO and then I take my tiles back again.  About twenty seconds after that, I play INCH and hit my clock.  Margaret laughs.  To my surprise, INCH sims best.  I played INCH over ECHO because it's more defensive (no parallel plays) and every N in the world is still in the bag.

#note End game!  I had Margaret tracked at AJNNRVW.  And that's WRONG!  I took my sweet time looking for the best endgame sequence.  I started by looking for her highest scoring play.  I saw C2 RAJ.  I considered playing OOT to block, leaving VINA as outplays in two spots.  But then I realized that she doesn't have RAJ because AF is not a word.  So then I saw her best play as 5C J(U)N.  That's only 20 points, but I'll be annoying and block it with OOT anyway.  But then I took another look at the board because I'm determined not to jack up any more endgames.  I then noticed F12 (R)AJ.  That's 26 points.  Well, I guess I'll block that.  I considered COVIN leaving AOT, and that leaves two outs that I saw- L2 TAO and F1 NOTA - for a total of 31 points if I can play TAO.   Not too shabby, but let's see if there's something better.  Hey....If I play CATION instead, that leaves 2B VOE for 12.  32 points!  That's one better! I don't think I can do better than that.    I missed O6 VOX.  I did see H10 VOE, but that's only 6 points.  Did I mention that I mistracked?
>Margaret: AEJNRVW L2 WAVE +25 434
#note Margaret spent about nine minutes on this play.  And I'm thinking, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, hurry up and play JUN already."   She didn't lay any tiles on the board until about five minutes have passed.  To my extremely high annoyance, Margaret played JANE at first.  OMG SHE HAS AN E, NOT TWO Ns!!.  It took all I had not to throw the clock at the wall.  But I kept my cool.   While her clock was running, I did some calculations and realized that the endgames I thought of lose to JANE.    But then she took her tiles back and played WAVE. All the endgames I thought of win against WAVE.  Please play WAVE.   But she let WAVE sit for a while before hitting her clock.   I wish I had a camera.  My poker face must have been awesome.  
>Tasha: OV 2J VO. +17 416
#note Fortunately for me, I wasn't the only one that mistracked.  Margaret knew I had an O but couldn't figure out what my other letter was.  
>Tasha:  (JNR) +20 436
#note Over-the-board, I thought all my endgames lose to JANE and all win against WAVE.  However, Quackle says I'm wrong.  Ironically, the only endgame I saw that beats JANE is also the only endgame that loses to WAVE. COVIN leaving AOT beats JANE because of JOTA.   But COVIN loses to WAVE by 5.  I looked for an hour (switching plays around and trying new endgames) and there are no winning plays that I could see.  I'm not supposed to win this game unless Margaret does something Tasha-like.   After the game, I told Margaret I mistracked and that JANE would have won her the game.  She responded that she was "thinking too hard."  Yup, me too.
