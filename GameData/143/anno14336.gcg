#note I thought about THEREON J4, THEREON J1, and HEREUNTO 8D. THEREON J1 just seemed like a bad idea given his (A)I play. I wasn't sure whether HEREUNTO or THEREON would limit his bingo chances more. With an implicature of AEILNS, Quackle suggests that mine is the better choice.

#note Is BEEN or BEES better here? I want to keep the board open at this point, and it BEEN seems to accomplish that better than BEES. Another option is TUBAE, which I'm not a fan of because opening an easy scoring spot is a bad idea against this opponent.

#note There are some interesting options here, and I may have played this too quickly. JAILED 14H, JEE 6F and JO 9I are all worth considering. I can't see JAILED working much at all, but the other two do useful things. JO lets me bingo more than this does, and JEE actually bingos more than JIN does, while opening a lane which is often annoying for Mike to deal with in the long run. I like JEE here.

#note I wasn't sure about PICTURER, but my chances after LARD looked a lot better (read: still terrible) than after say LADER. I really think I just have to score here but if you think fishing could be worth it then pipe up.

#note Mike was flustered because he was so low on time, so he put this down hurriedly, stopped the clock and then wrote on the blank slip. His clock read 3 seconds. I really hate when people do this, as it's hard to make a ruling for it, though you should probably be penalized more than the amount of time it would take for you to declare the blank because of misconduct. We didn't bother with it because it was a close call and ten points wouldn't affect the outcome of the game. However, I think it would have been appropriate to get a director's ruling. Chris Wiegand was the emergency replacement director for Chris Lennon, and didn't know the rules, so it would probably have to be another director. The reason I should have called a director is that the penalty could be more severe than I thought, and maybe does affect the outcome of the game. From the rules, it seems that the best procedure would either be to have Mike redesignate the blank on his time or give him some kind of time penalty. Honestly, I don't find the latter entirely appropriate, as it's easier to designate the blank once the game is over and you have calmed down than when you are flustered by time pressure, as Mike was.
