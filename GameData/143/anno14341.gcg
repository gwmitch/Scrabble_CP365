#note This play sims best, but I would have been happy if I had made a slightly suboptimal play and not spent 3 minutes here.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AEOWY 9F WAY +28 76
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AADLOTT 6I ALTO +9 28
#note QAT sims a tiny bit better.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABDDITY 4A DIDY +32 60
#note I was pretty sure BIDDY would be the sim winner, but the board is so dead after that play. But still, maybe it's too much equity to give up?
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: FNO A1 FON. +24 168
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AABBDT 6B BAD +19 79
#note I was pretty annoyed to have 79 points after four turns, despite balanced racks. Just no good plays available.

#note Thanks for that draw, tile bag. I don't think I can spend a turn exchanging here.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEEELM 1L .AME +40 388
#note Counted as 41. And the sim says 11D EME gives me a 4% better chance. Logic, I guess, being that HADE will likely stay open. But I thought scoring with HAME and trying to draw an out play was my best chance.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: INNRRTU 13J TUNI. +20 411
#note Jeremy was under a minute, I had about 3 left. This looks like Jeremy's best play.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEELT 11C LED +16 404
#note I was angry after the recount lost me the game by 1, because I was certain that I missed a scoring play in this endgame. But it looks like there is nothing. This is the best I can do. Though if I do L10 EVEN, I force Jeremy to actually stop and pass up the high-scoring play WIVERN, since it loses to the out-in-3. Though he has several wins, I am forcing him to think about a longer endgame (5 turns as opposed to 3) with only 30 seconds on his clock. As it turns out, I think he had his mind set on WIVERN and was probably going to throw it down no matter what. But over the board, it's hard to say what is my best shot at throwing him off. I spent my dying minutes trying to find more points, which I was almost certain I was missing.
