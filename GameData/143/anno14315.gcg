>cesar: EEMNTTU 8G MUT +10 10
#note saw mute/unmeet/unmet and for some reason thought this would be better. i worry a bit about opening it up too much against rafi (muter/muted/etc) and TEEN is worse than TEN but thought it was worth a bit of a sacrifice; it almost never is, though. UNMET seemed to break up the potential of the rack too much but sims best. (-3.5)
>rafi: AEFISTZ J6 ZIT +38 38
#note Things are looking good with the dynamic opening rack of FAZIEST.
>cesar: AEEHNRT H8 .RETHANE +95 105
#note rafi said "you just scored 95 points from a U" after i laid this down kind of listlessly (this was the first game of the day and i had literally woken up 5 minutes before games started after tossing and turning for close to 5 hours, so i was actually semi hallucinating). still, that is pretty lucky ;)
>rafi: AEEFSUX I12 AXE +42 80
#note No need to be afraid of U's - AXE is better than XU.

#note BEESWAX for style points.
>cesar: EEILNOS 15A OLEIN. +21 162
#note i thought this was a really interesting situation here, one in which i'm never quite sure what the best thing to do is. of course i can't play EMO# . OMEN doesn't seem that good. ME probably means i won't play my bingo next turn if i draw one. there's also EROS/EROSE and i didn't want to burn my S. does my move make sense? especially after FE i'm not so sure, but OLEINE doesn't seem overly aggressive either. (-1.5)
>rafi: BCEGISU C12 CUB. +16 124
#note The board is getting closed in a hurry, but there's still two blanks unseen and lots of time to catch up.

#note Cesar: ok but i chickened out on gorgon. (-4) Rafi: I can't win BAT if I keep drawing this post-bingo feces. This was a pretty hard decision - I saw LIONIZE but I hate the position... it's way too easy for Cesar to score and close off the bottom of the board. I like how INIA doesn't give back as much, while still keeping the board open for comebacks. OI and ION sandwiched on column D also sim well.
>rafi: AEEIINO K3 INIA +19 233
#note This was a very tough position for me. I saw LIONIZE, but with tons of D's and R's unseen it gives back so much for Cesar, and also makes it easy to keep the board closed. It was pretty hard stomaching keeping EEO instead of AE, but positionally I think I have to take the risk. Quackle prefers LIONIZE.

#note oh i didn't see verdicts but what's better?
>rafi: DEEHOTY D1 HO.E +28 278
#note Looking pretty bleak no matter what I play. Quackle likes YE 2B best, maybe going for LOATHED or TOOTHED or something through the R. Seems like a pretty good option, as HOVE makes it easier to block/score than YE.
>cesar: LMOPRTU 1D .UMOR +30 389
#note MU(SKI)T is too cool for school. (-8)
>rafi: DEOTWYY B5 DOWE.Y +35 313
#note Cesar: nice  Rafi: If I want to have any chance of winning, it might make sense to play off fewer tiles with something like D(E)WY. It's hard for me to assess plays that have only a 1-2% chance to win.
>cesar: ILLNOPT L6 POLL +21 410
#note pontil; end it faster, leave matters less now. (-1)
>rafi: DDEITVY 8L .EVY +30 343
#note YID could draw AVIATED, but unless Cesar has an aneurism, nothing has much of a shot here. Realistically, I think I might have to play (E)DDY to go for (E)STIVATE (for 106!) which might go overlooked by Cesar.
>cesar: AAINNST 6G IN +21 431
#note no need for an aneurism... this is a bad move. podiatry/additory are possible ... ANY/NAY win it 100%. didn't see those possibilities and probably didn't realize i wasn't ahead by enough. (-5%)
