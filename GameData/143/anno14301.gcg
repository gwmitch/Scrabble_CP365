#note Nothing scores... I make this play thinking it takes an S, and George might think it doesn't take an S. Joke's on me. I could play TAV to keep it tight, but George seems to like tight boards. He also challenges a lot of my bingos, so open boards make more sense.
>George_Latis: EEOPRRS 4D REPRO.ES +78 90
#note That didn't work out.
>Matthew_Larocque: DFHNRSW E3 F.W +18 31
#note Missed F/W(A)SH for 37. I thought I might get lucky and draw two vowels for a quick bingo - except the s-hook I have in mind is phony :/ F(E)ND gets more turnover and the H helps the W to suck less.
>George_Latis: AK 3C KA. +22 112
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHLNRS 7H H.NDLERS +68 99
#note Lucky to get a bingo with one vowel on my rack.
>George_Latis: ?AIORTX M7 .XIlATOR +80 192
#note Things go downhill hard here. I cannot challenge this confidently - if it's good, my bingo will get blocked undoubtedly. George played it without too much thought, and it's unlike him to randomly make up words. I don't feel TOO bad about letting this go to make sure my bingo went down.

>George_Latis: ABILNOS 10C ALBINOS +73 265
#note Right. Now I hold because this puts me in a hard spot. He didn't s-hook his bingo, which meant he didn't know if it was a word. He was more confident in *VACANTS, and I was also leaning towards it being valid - meaning a vacant building or something. But I'm probably gonna need to bingo again if I let it go - and since his phony bingo does not take an S, this is going to be difficult. This needed to be challenged.

#note Or F(A)WNED.
>George_Latis: ABCN H1 BAC.N +29 294
>Matthew_Larocque: DINPQ 2G Q.ID +18 234
#note Didn't get this rack, but had to dump to Q regardless.
>George_Latis: IIUUUU -IIUUUU +0 294
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIMNNP 12A PI.MAN +26 260
#note Tracking - it helps. PI(T)MEN instead, but I should play PINE L11 to set something up.
>George_Latis: DEHMOST 13E METHODS +71 365
#note *Facepalm*
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIILNT G8 .I.E +8 268
#note Just reducing spread at this point, might as well just play (H)IE.
>George_Latis: ITY A12 .ITY +27 392
>Matthew_Larocque: EGILNOT B8 GO +8 276
#note Might fluke into drawing A + blank *shrugs* just playing O(W) is something I never even thought of. However, I noticed the possibility of (B)LINTZEs which is the only thing that could save me at this point.
>George_Latis: EU H13 .UE +18 410
#note George leaves the TWS open, surprisingly. Meaning he has the key letters?
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILNTZ E10 .E.. +16 292
#note Sweet, I drew the Z! If I can get the blank I might actually have a chance. Sim isn't  going for it, though.
>George_Latis: OO L7 .OO +16 426
#note Still not blocking the TWS. What do you have George?
>Matthew_Larocque: EILNTYZ 10M .Y. +13 305
#note Try one more time? Sim still wants me to take the points and turnover.
>George_Latis: EGO 7B EGO +10 436
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNTZ L11 ZA +37 342
#note Draw an A, George blocks. This is becoming a trend.

>Matthew_Larocque:  (?EUU) +6 357
#note I guess the lesson here is open boards are only good if you challenge off all the phony words? Haha. Yeah. I don't even need to blame not drawing enough blanks, I could turn around most of my losses with less choking.
