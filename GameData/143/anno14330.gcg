#note VIFDA# looks best here, but we're not in the Orkney and Shetland islands, we're in Murica.

#note i prefer this despite the 8 extra points of JARFUL.
>evans: OY B5 OY +28 178
>cesar: AEFIILR A5 FRAIL +36 213
#note prefer this to 2J FRAIL despite the worse leave because of points and it kills a powerful spot; still, maybe it's worth keeping the better leave if he's going to bingo next turn.
>evans: ?DEOPTT M4 sPOTTED +73 251
>cesar: AAEILSW N6 WAIL +34 247
#note AWA sims much better. it's a significantly better leave, and it gives up about as many points as WAIL does. (-9)
>evans: NNU O6 NUN +27 278
#note that coulda been worse i guess.
>cesar: AAAEEGS D1 AGEE +21 268
#note i'm surprised i played that; i'm usually more of a chicken. saw 2J AREAE and like it even less, mostly because i need more points, but it sims better. (-1.5)
>evans: BEHO 1A OBE.H +30 308
>cesar: AAQRSUU 10J QUA.S +47 315
#note playing the S is 13 more points and there's two more Ss out, I know I still need to get lucky to win this game.

#note nothing's even close here; will i get lucky?
>evans: OS N12 .OS +10 351
>cesar: AAEGNRZ H1 GAN.A +39 386
#note i think i just have to hope he misses. a many ply sim inferencing the S tells me F10 ZANDER, maybe so I can hope to bingo back. 2J GRAZER also looks good. if he bingos i'm likely screwed unless i can bingo back, so quackle doesn't like keeping the Z here. GANJA is about ~16.5% back on ZANDER by win% (41.8 vs 58.3) but I actually don't really understand why it's so much of a difference when looking at the details. I think it needs me to increase entropy/variance next turn.
