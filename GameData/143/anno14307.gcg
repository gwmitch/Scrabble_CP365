#note HRY(V)NA is very nice but I really liked my play of M(A)NY for the defensive aspect.

#note Wow, I can't believe it actually suggests GRILL. Sure, it scores well, but surely champ should notice that all the S and blanks are out. I just decided to chuck this whole rack back.

#note Well in examining here, this may be a the most important part of the game, and not strategically. I counted this as 27, and it was recorded as such. My opponent was under time pressure, and thus just accepted it. The game ends up being a tie game at the end, so barring any other missed points along the way, this one could have won me it.

#note This was a great find. I knew the Y hook was there, but didn't think he'd capitalise for so much.

#note Half a dozen plays win me the game here, including the play that I had made, if only I had scored that one play correctly. It was a club game, and it was late, so there was no recounting this time, so it will remain a tie regardless. The plays that win are PRIMI, TRIPOLI, LIMP, PRIM, IT L4 and LIROT.
