#note Considered a few plays here -- CHUG, GUL, LUG, GULCH. UGH is an interesting option, giving me a potential good Q spot. It looks like the HUN hooks are quite good, so blocking them with GUL/LUG is a good call, because she doesn't average very well, and often opens up good things for me. I don't think it's as good as Quackle claims against a great player, but probably still correct and certainly strong against Yukari.
