#note Commentary by Jackson.
>Bob_Bolender: OW G7 WO +20 20
>Joey_Krafchick: CDGINSU 9D DUNGS +31 71
#note DUGS and CUD are the other options. Joey wanted to play off more tiles rather than fewer, and figured that putting the D next to the DLS meant only a vowel could go there rather than a higher scoring tile. All of them are close.
>Bob_Bolender: AEFZ 8A FAZE +55 75
#note If he had an E FEAZE would have burned.

>Bob_Bolender: AGPR 5B GRAP. +16 174
>Joey_Krafchick: DEINQUY D3 QU.Y +32 199
#note QUEY looks a bit better. There's no Us left for AQUA (I don't think it's a big deal though). DEIN could hit on the 2 row or from the T/R, but 41 is a good score right now.
>Bob_Bolender: ANTY B2 TAN.Y +34 208

#note or HAKE.
>Bob_Bolender: ?BEELST 12A .ESTaBLE +70 278
>Joey_Krafchick: ADNOOOX H12 .XON +33 279
#note I think OXO is the play. Joey wanted lanes other than underneath BAILIE, and OXO creates lanes on the 11 and 14 rows, only blockable with stuff like EXON. I Like OXO cause it saves EXON if the spot stays open, or if he hooks an H he gets HEXAD. OXO or ONO making JO are decent, but he scores so much there so often. EXON is decent.

>Joey_Krafchick: ACDOPRV E11 P.RVO +18 319
#note I think Joey needs to score a bit more here, D(U)P looks good. ACORV is pretty balanced and could score decently, though you can't really parallel. PARVO is decent but doesn't score enough imo. Joey wanted to get the S.
>Bob_Bolender: AHI 3K AHI +25 331
>Joey_Krafchick: AACDMNO 2H MANO +15 334
#note he played this to set up hit COAT/DOAT. There is a D, G, and M in the bag, but Joey is down right now and needs the spot. MASCON is worth considering to try to run with points.
