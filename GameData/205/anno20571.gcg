>DDay: AGIKNST 8C SKATING +84 84
>Chris: BEMTTWX G6 TW.XT +27 27
#note I struggled between BETWIXT and TWIXT and decided to hold the E, with the decent MB blend.
>DDay: ADEEGIR C6 DI.AGREE +74 158
#note sure. 7 letter bingos are 1 in 7? So two in a row are 1 in 49 or higher with better letters played.
>Chris: ABEHMSV 11B B.AVE +20 47
#note SHM seemed a good blend leave even though it could give up something big at 12A-D
>DDay: ELW 12A WE.L +30 188
>Chris: HILMOST A12 .HOM +36 83
#note Saw HOMILIST but no go
>DDay: AN B11 ..AN +22 210
#note Noted BEANO possibility here for MO- word
>Chris: AEILSTU H8 .U +11 94
#note Here fishy, fishy
>DDay: INY 6G .INY +15 225
#note DD takes out some of the S hook carte blanche here
>Chris: AEILSST J8 SALTIES +74 168
#note B1 may have been better, but I was looking for T dynamism and the hope of a wasdted blocking turn
>DDay: DFI I13 FID +22 247
#note Kinda got my wish. Wish I could have capitalized more,
>Chris: CEEOOUV 15E COVE. +33 201
#note COOEED may have been better, but UV stinks and with Q out, if I get it I will need the vowels
>DDay: CJOU D3 JUCO +29 276
>Chris: EGNOOQU 11J .OQUE +28 229
#note Did not see GOON at K9. Only considered it at E1. Again, big risk with S, 2 T's and both blanks out. 
>DDay: ANRSY O7 YARNS +39 315
>Chris: EFGIINO M9 FE.ING +28 257
#note I was hoping to get down INFO at L12. I like playing tiles here to increase odds of drawing a blank or 2 which I see as my only real hope.
>DDay: MOO 3B MO.O +26 341
>Chris: EHIILOO 5H HOOLIE +30 287
#note HOMIE B1 is more dynamic, but again, one extra tile played.
>DDay: AALR 4K ALAR +16 357
>Chris: ?ADEIPU B1 PU.A +16 303
#note Champ Player like PUD at A2. That opening could be blocked with something like PTUI/UMP/DOT/OI. I figured DD did not have Z at ALAR in which case he had a 40% chance to draw it and maybe not be able to reach triple and would be in a quandary, and even if he did, I have a chance at picking up SPRINTED. Heck, maybe even SPRITZED if we are dreaming.If I leave Z in bag and he draws it, I could win with the bingo. If I draw Z, I am a favorite to get a Z word down idf he doesn't block that. Tough choices for him no matter what. In any event, this was one of thjose plays that gives a chance for a win when all game looked bleak. My heart was pounding when I made this play.
>DDay: ?EIPRZ A4 ZIpPER +99 456
#note I know DDay didn't have the B because he was fearing BITTERS. If he had the T or another E, he had PEPTIZER. If R, aPPRIZER for a million. In either case, tough to play if you don't know for sure. He took a very long time and played ZIPPER.  
>Chris: ?DDEINT 2E NIDaTED +64 367
#note I turned over my letters one at a time; N....T... now my heart is racing. 3 Rs out, if this is one of them, sPRINTED and a win. Duplicate D :-(. Missed the 3 D words.
