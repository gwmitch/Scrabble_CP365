#note I purposely passed up H(A)RDBOoT, also had some doubts. Considering I know his rack, I know that hardboot doesn't give him a bingo or even a high scoring play...sigh. (-10.1)

BOTH bingoes 53% of the time next turn.

#note Played too quick here...missed V(I)NYL in same spot. (-7.9)

V(I)NY at F11 is actually really cool. I have the last of the L's for VINYL and he at best will play through the Y, it's unlikely he bingoes with the Y.

#note I played this over AVION because the J was out. That's a segway to me losing and I'm not doing down that road where he scores 70 with the J at N10.

#note I had to take the X-bomb out. Only way he comes back is if he hits the X bomb for 52 and bingoes, so I was playing with fire not blocking anything in the bottom right this turn.

#note I chose this to block the longshot possibility of a Y bingo, but the 3 points only made it a 2.3% --> 1.6% that he bingoes next turn
