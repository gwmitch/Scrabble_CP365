>Cheryl_Melvin: ORTW H7 WORT +14 14
#note Cheyrl is another new opponent for me.
>Matthew_Larocque: CINNOVY I6 COY +20 20
#note I missed CONVOY, but this still limits her scoring for next turn.
>Cheryl_Melvin: GI 6I .IG +8 22
>Matthew_Larocque: BINNSVX J5 B.N +11 31
#note 11H SNIB sets up my X, but I doubt that works. Maybe I should just exchange this rack. Quackle seems pretty receptive to B(I)N, though.
>Cheryl_Melvin: EM K4 ME. +20 42
>Matthew_Larocque: AIMNSVX L2 VIM +28 59
#note Ugh, I played this quickly and missed MAVIN/S in the same spot. I was excited by the defensiveness of VIM. I think keeping the S is fine though with WORT dangling down below.
>Cheryl_Melvin: UUUU -UUUU +0 42
>Matthew_Larocque: AAFNOSX 2J FA.AS +38 97
>Cheryl_Melvin: EINORTT G8 TIER +16 58
>Cheryl_Melvin: EINORTT --  -16 42
#note Interesting.
>Matthew_Larocque: IIJNNOX 1H JOIN +40 137
#note JINNI?
>Cheryl_Melvin: EINORTT N2 .NOTTIER +60 102
#note Slightly unexpected.
>Matthew_Larocque: CIILNWX 8L IL.X +36 173
#note CL(E)W saves XI for O4. A moderate error.
>Cheryl_Melvin: EH O3 EH +20 122
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDINSW K8 SAWN +26 199
#note A wealth of options here - I thought *SAWNY was a word which was part of the reason I played SAWN (it's only spelled SAWNEY). 11H SAWN seems like it would be a better board-closing option.
>Cheryl_Melvin: EKSY 11E KEYS +30 152
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDINSV 12A VINCA +34 233
>Cheryl_Melvin: LOTU J9 LOUT +17 169
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEERS A7 DEpRA.ES +83 316
#note I once got away with *READVISE, but decided that playing it as a 3x3 would never work. RESHAVED is a little better I think.
>Cheryl_Melvin: DOT 10D TOD +22 191
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEIOU 2F UDO +15 331
#note I rejected 2D AUDIO, UDO still kills IFS and the U is not the friendliest letter for her to hook onto.
>Cheryl_Melvin: AEHZ B4 HAZE +39 230
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEILT C5 BALE +27 358
#note Stupid mistake. It's way easier for her to score from A1. I should play something there instead.
>Cheryl_Melvin: APPU A1 PUPA +33 263
#note 33 points for PUPA, for example.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIINTU G2 .UI +5 363
#note No bingos. Champ suggests 3C UNITE instead of fishing.
>Cheryl_Melvin: EGLO D4 LOGE +33 296
#note BALE was such a bad play.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEINRT 14A .INTEReD +70 433
#note Apparently I'm supposed to delay the bingo, but am I really 100% to bingo next turn if I put it off now? I don't think so.
>Cheryl_Melvin: AEFGIRR 15G FEAR +34 330
>Matthew_Larocque: EQ L7 Q. +11 444
#note See Quackle, the stupid Q was in the bag! Yeah sure, I could have drawn SQUIRTED, but I'd be relying on her to not block it.
>Cheryl_Melvin: GIR 1A .RIG +9 339
>Cheryl_Melvin:  (E) +2 341
