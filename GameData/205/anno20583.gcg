#note Common knowledge says I should keep a T or an X, but I wanted to exchange 7 here because I thought it was a little more likely to keep her on tilt.

#note Saw several bingos, but nothing better than the 72-point ALUMINA at D2. I couldn't find a single word that plays through rows 11/12/13 and ended one spot short of the TWS, opening up the volatility I need in this game. I decide to play short and knock out the spot for her to score easy points while holding the blanks to bingo next turn. Thoughts????

#note Lots of As unseen, so I thought about playing JEAN instead, but ACM seemed to work better at pulling plays from the J (JICAMA is what I had in mind)
