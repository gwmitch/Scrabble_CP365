>Matt_Canik: ADIJKNT F11 KANJI +38 56
#note KANJI, TAKIN, or KANJ(I)??? Man this was a tough turn. Q likes other placement of KANJI most by a little over a point.

>Matt_Canik: ADEHNOZ 1G HAZ.N +51 289
#note such a tough turn! The Z is REALLY good on this board. Is it worth cashing in now when I have HADE available at C3? Q says I made the right choice.
