#note Immediately I see WIZ and TWIRLY. WIZ so often creates a horrible board - let's do it!!

BIG oversight: QWERTY!!!!
>Jean_McArthur: MOO 9F MO.O +26 50
>Matt_Canik: ELPRSTY 10E PYES +51 66
#note ....51??

TRYPS# apparently is a word because collins
>Jean_McArthur: HMO 11C MHO +24 74
>Matt_Canik: EGLNRTT 12E LENT +10 76
#note If I had known TELT# I would have played that instead. 

Actually nvm POTE# is also a word I guess so that makes that play bad. I can also play ELT for 21 and hold another conso.

#note Apparently OLENT# is a word toooo!!!!!

#note what do I do what do I do I have no idea

I guess I'll play DI

#note LUDO# is another word I didn't know (I know it's TWL3+ though!!)

At this point I'm just closing the board down for the lols

#note please don't bingo to that L

#note phew ok

>Matt_Canik: BCDEIRU O5 BUI.D +8 224
#note last play doesn't imply an X, so maybe I can force her to make a weak play to block what she sees as a setup?
>Jean_McArthur: X 6N X. +25 224
#note PHEW
>Matt_Canik: ?ACCENR 5L CRA. +17 241
#note woohoo a blank!

>Matt_Canik: ?CDEENT 3J DE.ECT +24 265
#note Really pivotal decision here. With so many nice vowels and NRRST to couple with my N, I'm a lock to pull *some* kind of bingo. All those vowels make it way more likely to pull something ending in a vowel. Let's gooooo

A stupid sim has me at ~75% to bingo after this but I know I can't trust that number much
>Jean_McArthur: AE 4I EA +5 247
>Matt_Canik: ??EINOS N3 .O.. +13 278
#note if I had seen vEnISON, that's probably better than not bingoing. Otherwise I think it's safest to just not bingo and win by like 20 lol. Should probably keep the O for the ODA spot that she can't really touch. 

Thank you, quackle, for your suggestion of NOISE H1 holding ??. 
>Jean_McArthur: U M12 .U. +10 257
>Matt_Canik: ??EGINS J3 ..G +5 283
#note Again, don't want to bingo. Maybe hold the G for MIGG doen the road, maybe set up the S with MIGG now. But man we might have a sub-600 collins game so I want to play for that lols

#note Just to make sure I don't do anything dumb, I'll pass. Onus is on her to not let me bingo (and I get more time to look for 9s)
>Jean_McArthur: AEGINRT K13 A.. +6 277
#note NGATI# thx collins
