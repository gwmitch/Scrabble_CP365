>Matthew_Larocque: ?EHIOVY 8G HOY +18 18
#note IVY wins, by a lot more than I thought. I guess I was more keen to make hooks with a blank.
>Wayne_Clifford: ILTU 7D LITU +11 11
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEITV J7 nAIVETE +77 95
#note dEVIATE scores two more, but opens D hooks as well. I'll go for slightly better defense.
>Wayne_Clifford: AEOZ 8A ZOEA +45 56
>Matthew_Larocque: CFNOPSS K11 FON +26 121
#note Didn't see any reason to ditch an S, they look good for scoring. Q usually never agrees with S hoarding. F(LA)CONS is cool, I didn't know about it.
>Wayne_Clifford: EFT 9B EFT +24 80
>Matthew_Larocque: ACPSSSX E6 P.SS +27 148
#note Wasn't predicting another S. Luckily I have a good play that uses two of them. Quackle likes the 36 points for AXIS but that's pretty aggressive with the T hook. Admittedly the board isn't X friendly right now, but that can change.
>Wayne_Clifford: ABW I13 WAB +22 102
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEKOSX H14 KA +36 184
#note Good time to have the K.
>Wayne_Clifford: ADRT L8 DRAT +13 115
>Matthew_Larocque: CCEGOSX G13 COG +22 206
#note I played this pretty automatically as well. Want to keep things nice and closed. Now I know SECCO is a word, but I wouldn't play that here.
>Wayne_Clifford: IN F5 NI. +11 126
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEHRSX 4A CHEERS +32 238
#note This doesn't even show up on generate choices for whatever reason. A play like nit makes it appear that Wayne has either the other S or the second blank. CHEERS gets rid of the threat and ends the game quicker - and keeps the X which is pretty easy to score with. I'd never play HEXERS, cause easy points for Wayne are never good. 
>Wayne_Clifford: NRU 8L .URN +15 141
>Matthew_Larocque: DEMNRUX N6 MU.EX +36 274
#note He held, which caused me to have momentary doubt that I mixed up MIREX and LUREX.
>Wayne_Clifford: OPQ B1 QOP. +36 177
>Matthew_Larocque: DDNRUVY O2 RUDDY +19 293
#note If there's a cee left in the bag, then I probably don't play this. What are the chances that he bingos with a blank C at the end? I figured I'd need to be absurdly unlucky. Also, I folded on UNDY cause I get UNDE *UNDIE and UNDY confused. Oh, but UNDIES is valid. I was going to say, it ought to be.
>Wayne_Clifford: ILL O10 ILL +13 190
>Matthew_Larocque: ADELNVW 2J WANDE. +36 329
#note Points.
>Wayne_Clifford: AENO 1H AEON +19 209
>Matthew_Larocque: AGILV 13C VAGI. +22 351
>Matthew_Larocque: AGILV --  -22 329
#note A player in the lower division got away with this. It must be a fairly common phony. Hey - if there's one area where men know how to use their imagination... ;)
>Wayne_Clifford: EGI 2F GIE +10 219
>Matthew_Larocque: AGILV K4 VIGA +17 346
>Wayne_Clifford: EIJR 4I JI.ER +30 249
#note I wasn't expecting to help him when I played VIGA.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?MNORST O1 c..... +30 376
#note Take that, Wayne. I'm not sure if this is the best play, but there's something silly about just playing off the blank and nothing else.
>Wayne_Clifford: ABEIIOT 14K TIBIA +21 270
#note ABIOTIC appears to be a slightly better spread reducer.
>Matthew_Larocque: LMNORST 15L TONS +30 406
>Wayne_Clifford: EO I4 .OE +10 280
>Wayne_Clifford:  (LMR) +10 290
#note I drew both blanks and four esses... nothing much to see here.
