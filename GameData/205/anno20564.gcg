#note Ouch, LOOPIER turns into a 10-point play
>Jim_Burlant: ?CFORTY 11B FeROC.TY +80 94
>Matt_Canik: ABEEPRV J6 BRAVE +26 36
#note Quackle likes a few plays here, but they are all close. This is fine, PREVE(R)B for 30 is another option.
>Jim_Burlant: EEENSST H11 .EENS +18 112
#note Actual rack. TENSE would have been slightly better since it doesn't put the S in the triple line. K5 TEES also looks good.
>Matt_Canik: CEFLNPX K10 FLEX +33 69
#note I can't play F(I)X here. I need the F line to stay open with this deficit. 
>Jim_Burlant: DEJTT 12J J.TTED +32 144

>Matt_Canik: DLNNSTU L7 DUNT +12 107
#note UNL(E)D is the play here. Simulation was based on partial opponent rack "ES" because he played TEENS two turns ago. (-2.8)
>Jim_Burlant: EU J12 .EU +21 180
>Matt_Canik: AIKLNSU K3 KUNA +20 127
#note N10 KU(E) leads the way. Meep.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEW 3I WA.ED +34 214
>Matt_Canik: EIILQSY 10A QI +20 147
#note I've decided that the keeping the row 15 line is worth 6 points. Agree? 
>Jim_Burlant: AHIIOSS H1 SHA +32 246
#note It really feels like Jim is trying to help me get back into this game by stringing these esses in hot spots for me to bingo to.... Jim said after the game that he regretted this play. 
>Matt_Canik: EGILSWY 4C WISELY +46 193
#note Maybe this is why!
>Jim_Burlant: AGO 3B GOA +20 266
>Matt_Canik: ABEGIPU -ABGIPU +0 193
#note Pivotal play here: I didn't see BE(E)P, which allows me to fish for one of the two Ms for UMIA(Q). I don't need to sell out on a bingo just yet. 
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAHIMT E4 .HIM +18 284
>Matt_Canik: EELOOTT D6 OOT +10 203
#note Selling out to bingo here: maybe I can draw the blank after a bingo and bingo a second time?? We'll see, but things look bleak.

#note Jim, unsarcastically, to me: "What a nice balanced rack you have there". 

Me: *tries not to explode*

I didn't notice this play of ABRI, I certainly should have blocked it and lost almost 30 spread because of it. Oh well!
