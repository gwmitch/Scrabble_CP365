>Dan_Wachtell: DILMOOY 8D MOODILY +82 82
#note I saw ID, but Dan was OK with that.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEENTT 9G ETA +14 14
#note Whenever it seems like you had no way to win a game, just remember that you probably missed a bingo
>Dan_Wachtell: ?AEEFVX 10E VEX +26 108

>Dan_Wachtell: ?AAEFJO J6 JA. +29 137
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDOTVZ K5 BOD +24 62
#note I considered H7 V(IT)TA. I just can't see why it's a good play. Maybe I have to be patient and VITTA is right in that sense.
>Dan_Wachtell: ?AEFGNO 13A FrON.AGE +76 213
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIRTVZ L4 DITZ +55 117
#note Just to add to that feeling of not being able to win a game, you probably missed a 4 as well.

>Joshua_Sokol: HLMNPQR C12 Q.PH +18 232
#note Dan is always holding the S after PUTTI (we agreed on that) so I actually need to defend against huge scores here!
>Dan_Wachtell: EENORSU N7 NEUROSE. +60 349
>Joshua_Sokol: DELMNRR O6 DERM +33 265
#note I also considered L11 M(I)N(O)R. That may be right.

>Dan_Wachtell: ACEIINO B8 CONI +10 401
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEINRT M1 BITE +15 295
#note I felt stupid for thinking so long about how to steal this game away from Dan and then immediately playing BITE seeing as the only option was to open the 3x3. BRIE was better. Much better. Makes it more difficult for him.
>Dan_Wachtell: AEIILRW 2J WIL.ER +34 435
#note he wasn't 100% on WIRA(B)LE
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEGNRU 9D U. +6 301
#note I couldn't see a bingo, but it seemed like a better idea to fish this turn and bingo out. I missed GRANULE. It didn't come up when I was looking at my rack and I had to write 20 alphagrams down, and it didn't immediately come up when I wrote down AEGLNRU. So yeah.
