>Jackson_Smylie: AGNNRST 8D GRANT +16 16
#note Racks from each side are provided.
>Siddharth_Murali: EEEGVXY E4 VEXE. +30 30
>Jackson_Smylie: ?LNPSSY I8 SPY +18 34
#note J: LYN(X) looks good but I8 SYN sims best.
>Siddharth_Murali: DEEGLNY 6C DE.Y +23 53
#note S: I greatly preferred this over GYVED for 26 because of the improved leave  and bingo defense, given that he played short. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ?BLNSTV -BLTV +0 34
#note NEB looks a bit better
>Siddharth_Murali: EGILNOU 4C GU. +14 67
#note S: I think it's close between this and 7C OGEE, I'm continuing the trend so no OVULE.
>Jackson_Smylie: ??JNSTU 10B UNJuSTl. +70 104
#note J: (A)dJUNcTS is better, maybe JUS? UNJOINTS as well.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEILNOT 7I ELATION +69 136
>Jackson_Smylie: AEHIMOR O2 ROMAI.E +36 140
#note J: OHIA looks right here, just go forwards with the equity and outrun him right now. 
>Siddharth_Murali: ACEEIPT 2J PIECE. +32 168
#note S: Had OHIA come down I would have PATIENCE!
>Jackson_Smylie: EFHLOOS N6 H.OF +33 173
>Siddharth_Murali: ADELOTW D10 .OWLED +38 206
#note S: I didn't think of JOW during the game but I like that better, it's defensive towards his scoring options while remaining offensive to mine- JOWL and a bingo is a huge upside.
>Jackson_Smylie: AEELOSU 15D .OULA +18 191
>Siddharth_Murali: AAAGIOT 13A OTA.GIA +18 224
#note S: Huge miss of AGI(T)ATO for me!
>Jackson_Smylie: EEEMQRS A12 M.RE +27 218
#note J: QUESTER is a word I saw and didn't like for some reason...
>Siddharth_Murali: AEIINUV 1H VAU +22 246
#note S: Another huge miss of UNITIVE.
>Jackson_Smylie: EEIIOQS B9 Q.OI. +18 236
#note J: Quackle likes QUIET, I like QIS now, with a 20:7 c:v ratio
>Siddharth_Murali: ABCEIIN L7 .IBIAE +18 264
#note S: A third consecutive miss of C(E)IBA. I played this in disgust because of the vowel shortage- I simply couldn't see anything else, and CEIBA solves that problem.
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEIIST B9 .....ED +41 277
>Siddharth_Murali: BCLNNWZ 11J BL.WN +20 284
>Jackson_Smylie: EHIIRST M11 .HIT +25 302
>Siddharth_Murali: CDFKNOZ L1 F.CK +34 318
#note S: FECK looks way better than ZONK, which I also considered. However, much better is FON n13, which takes out the sting of WHITE and puts me in a favorable position in the endgame- Jackson is much less likely to have an out in two in two spots, and I'm leaving more spots for outscoring (e.g. ZEKS with an S draw).
>Jackson_Smylie: AEIRRST 15L REAR +26 328
>Siddharth_Murali: DNNORSZ K5 ZO. +24 342
#note Playing Jackson for the first time was a treat. Well played to him.
>Jackson_Smylie: IST F2 TIS +13 341
