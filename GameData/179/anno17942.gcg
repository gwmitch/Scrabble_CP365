>Trevor: ?DEOPTZ -DEOPT +0 0
>James: DDEELOT 8D DOLED +18 18
#note TODDLE, DOLED and DOTED all look about the same to me. EDDO 8F is suggested (For the better leave), which may have been worth considering. 
>Trevor: AGINNRY G7 Y.ARNING +68 68
#note YARNING scores 80. 
>James: BDEIKRT 11D BRI.K +22 40
#note Quackle suggests KIT/KID 7C, to open the board some more, which I think is definitely worth considering. It also suggests KIT over KID, which I find interesting, but I guess it's because the odds of drawing another D are low whilst drawing more Ts is higher (and BRED may make more bingos? not sure about that one, though) It also suggests KIND 11E, which makes some sense because I have BERT, an okay leave and I also set up the B at 10F. BRINK and REITBOK E3 are also in its consideration, and I just decided to play BRINK in this case. I may have played REITBOK in some other situation as well. 
>Trevor: ENRRSTU 14G .RUNTERS +72 140
#note YEARNING takes an S - RETURNS/TURNERS were 87. 
>James: CDDEETU H1 DEDUCTE. +97 137
>Trevor: AMPR 5H .RAMP +22 162
#note I wonder what Trevor's other letters were. These are pretty good tiles to work for a bingo with, 
>James: ?HIMNNU L7 INHUMaN. +76 213
#note As it is, he blocked MUNCHING/MUNCHKIN for 106. I was a little sad since I was thinking that maybe I could try to draw for BRINKMANSHIP or something! 
>Trevor: EFI 12C FIE +22 184
>James: AEHIIOS 6J HI +30 243
#note I chickened out on YEARNINGS (though I thought it good) - HOISE 15D 55 is the play. 
>Trevor: AGT 13B TAG +24 208
#note Right idea - open up more lanes to increase the chance of comebacks. 
>James: AEEINOS 4J NAOI +27 270
#note Nice leave, scores decently. NOISE 15D for 37 is also worth considering but the S has a lot more value after TAG. (well, it already did with YEARNINGS) 
>Trevor: EIILOPR A11 BASTE +29 237
>James: ?CEEFIS 1G E.IFiCES +66 336
#note Missed CaSEFIED 1A for 92! Oh well. 
>Trevor: OWW 3L WOW +30 267
#note More lanes! 
>James: AAQTUXZ 2N AX +30 366
#note I could have played TAX 14A but decided to start blocking some more dangerous lanes. I also kind of hoped for the outside shot at QUETZALS off the S. 
>Trevor: EILOOST B5 STOOLIE +65 332
>James: AGQTUVZ N10 QUAG. +35 401
#note Quackle likes QUAG A4 (blocking the A-column for parallel plays, especially since no Ss are left), then QUAGS and then SQUAT 5B, which is to block up the D and also limit damage on the O. I liked QUAGS though, because it also blocked up a bingo lane, and the Z has a good amount of value on the A-column if I can hit it. But it does represent more risk than QUAG A4. 
>Trevor: ELOOPRV A1 AJIVA +59 391
#note Never leaves me any peace! 
>James: EOOPTVZ C3 ZEP +33 434
#note ZEP, TO B1 24 and OOZE 7A all win. 
>Trevor: EELLORY 8J LO.ELY +27 418
#note Nice play, but LYE A7 puts more pressure on me. 
>James: OOTV 2E VOT. +11 445
#note Forgot about TO. 
>Trevor: ER I1 .RE +16 434
