>Charles_Reinke: ?CELNPQ -NPQ +0 0
#note 2014 Arden Cup, Round 3.  Any reasonable exchange is good here.
>Mason_Shambach: BLOWY 8H BLOWY +34 34
>Charles_Reinke: ?CEELNV J6 Vi.LENCE +72 72
>Mason_Shambach: AHRT 13I H.ART +24 58
>Charles_Reinke: DLNOOUU 12J .LOUD +24 96
#note Too bad that 12H UN(C)LOUD got blocked, but both UNCLOUD and CLOUD take the Y, so no change there.  If I had seen L3 UNDUL(Y), it would have gotten serious consideration.
>Mason_Shambach: IKTTY O8 KITTY +64 122
>Charles_Reinke: EFINOOU L4 UNIF. +22 118
#note Plays on row 9 like (L)OOF or O(L)EO are better.  I was seriously stumped by this rack.
>Mason_Shambach: IQ N9 QI +28 150
>Charles_Reinke: EEFIOOT 9C FOOTIE +18 136
#note It's not looking good here.  My hope is to draw some S's, but more likely I just draw tons of vowels.
>Mason_Shambach: OSTW 8A STOW +47 197
>Charles_Reinke: BEENNOU K2 BONE +18 154
#note Again, no real appealing options.  This play is good in that it doesn't close any existing lanes.
>Mason_Shambach: AIO F7 IO.A +6 203
>Charles_Reinke: DEEINRU D6 RE..UND +22 176
#note Perhaps a rare situation where fishing is the right play...7L (F)E sets up another easy lane and there are seven A's available for URANIDE.
>Mason_Shambach: EEEIPRS 14D PEERIES +83 286
#note Somehow this got scored as 72.  Not sure how that happened.
>Charles_Reinke: AEGIIMT 15A MAGI +29 205
>Mason_Shambach: DEL 15F LED +25 311
>Charles_Reinke: CDEGITZ 11B ZI.C +30 235
#note Missing ZI(N)G.  Again, not sure how that happened.
>Mason_Shambach: AGNU A4 GUAN. +8 319
#note Scored as 6.  Note to self: start counting opponent's plays.
>Charles_Reinke: ADEGPTX 14L TAX +26 261
#note Smokescreen!  The TAX(A) hook might bait him into not blocking column G, although, in all honesty, I didn't figure out beforehand what possible bingos I could draw into my awesome DEGP leave.
>Mason_Shambach: AM O14 AM +23 342
>Charles_Reinke: ADEEGPR G1 PREAGED +69 330
#note After this play, we both have the score at 330-329, so I think I have a chance.
>Mason_Shambach: AAINSSV 1G .IAS +18 360
>Charles_Reinke: ?EHJORR 4C JaRR.H +38 368
#note My only hope was for Mason to let me have 1C JOsE(P)H.
>Mason_Shambach: ANSV M2 VANS +20 380
>Mason_Shambach:  (EO) +4 384
#note Final score: 368-371.
