>Michael: AEGLORW 9E WEAR +30 48
>Josh: CEEIRTT C7 C.TTIER +26 53
#note TOPEE is a 5 I need to review. In any case this a good play even though it's phony
>Michael: ABLOY 10H BOYLA +23 71
#note Michael's word knowledge impressed me this game.
>Josh: BEIJOTZ 12A JE.Z +56 109
>Michael: ADEGILR A12 .ARL +33 104
#note But he missed GLADLIER and GRILLADE here. Maybe it's out of his studying range. He also misevaluated leaves. (J)AIL leaving DEGR is better than (J)ARL leaving DEGI in terms of leave value. 
>Josh: BIINOTU I3 BIOTIN +21 130
#note Oh wow, I didn't think INBUI(L)T was good. I should have played it anyway though, I'm kicking myself. I mean my other options were just so much poorer
>Michael: DEEGHIQ J2 QI +35 139
>Josh: DEEGRTU K3 GUDE +18 148
#note Maybe some one-tile play is better than this
>Michael: ADEEGHT L8 HE.DGATE +86 225
#note Here's where things get real. Michael announced that this is a word that I missed as a 3x3 and cost me more than 100 points. I immediately knew what the word was going to be. I'm quite happy that my annotated game taught Michael a word he retained. Great find!
>Josh: DENRSTU 15F DENTUR.S +77 225
#note Didn't know which one to play. I imagined Michael had the X but I don't think I could have done much about it. I didn't have any logical reason to believe he had it. I just felt like the worst was bound to happen. At least this way he had to have an A or an E to play his X.
>Michael: ?ADELSX 14I AX +52 277
#note There are two 8s with this rack. Michael saw one of them, FLAXSEED.
>Josh: CEHIIKU M3 HICKIE +37 262
>Michael: ?ADELMS N8 SLAmMED +78 355
#note SAMpLED was missed.
>Josh: FFNNRUV 13F RUFF +25 287
#note I can't really do anything at this point. I considered throwing in all 7 and playing something with (HES)S* if I drew into a bingo.
>Michael: ?ELNOOR O9 OLEO +15 370
#note Michael was afraid of (HES)S*
>Josh: AGNNNVY -AGNNNVY +0 287
#note I knew N2 VAN was probably the thing to play, or M13 VA(S), but I felt like the leaves were so bad that the knowledge of the pool I would get from exchanging all 7 and the crap that Michael would be left to draw outweighed the benefits of scoring.
>Michael: ?AENOSV M13 VA. +28 398
#note Convenient, I now knew what his entire rack was and how sick it was.
>Josh: EIIMORS 11K I. +10 297
#note The game is lost. I just wanted to mess with his spread so I scared him with a one-tile play.
>Michael: ?ENNOSV H4 ON +8 406
#note ha
>Josh: AEIMORS 6M .I +8 305
#note Now I hope he messes up and I draw an N.
>Michael: ?ENNSVY O4 YEN +17 423
#note Michael said that he wasn't sure enough of ENVoYS to play it.
>Josh: AEMNORS 14E OE +10 315
#note Low on time, trying to block the V spot I saw, ViS 14E. Silly silly. But I have MANR(OPE)S next turn! -10000000
>Michael: ?GNSV 11E GuVS +20 443
#note -5, keep the G instead for G(RUFF)/G(O)
>Josh: AMNRS N2 MA +13 328
#note Very very low on time, -6
>Michael: N F6 N... +8 451
>Michael:  (NRS) +6 457
#note This was a game to reflect on.
