>George: ACDENTT 8D CANTED +24 24
#note Tricky play here. To play for points or not? I'd probably play something like ACT, but Quackle proposes exchanging the T. It works in drawing a bingo for a lot of the letters, which makes a lot of sense. ENACTED, TACNODE, TRANCED, CANDENT, UNACTED, DESCANT, CHANTED, PANDECT (and their anagrams) yield playable letters that work more than 2/5 of the time, and if I play a word the chances of playing an 8 are good too. I thus can see the reasoning of exch T and it does make sense that it's probably the best play. 

(this is something I always forget - remembering that you don't always have to play on the first turn, even if your first play can net you 20 or more)
>James: EGIMNNO F2 MIGNON.E +69 69
#note Chickened out of OMENING, didn't see NONIMAGE. At least this doesn't take an S! 
>George: AAEIOQT 4D ZI. +26 50
>James: AEKNORT E1 KAT.ON +32 101
#note Interesting hand - you can play any small play with a K and hold onto better tiles for a bingo the next turn. I chose KATION because I felt comfortable enough going for bingoes with just ER, anyway. KATION does give more risk of George playing for 30+ next turn off the K, though. 
>George: AAEGOQT 1A BREA. +36 86
>James: EEFIRRS 7H FERRIES +71 172
#note Chickened out of BRIEFERS. I'm a wuss. I like placing it 7H over 9H because only the F can be played parallel for points. 
>George: AAAGOQT -AAAQT +0 86
>James: DEEOPQV K6 P.OVED +24 196
#note I like PROVED over QI. All Us are unplayed and I play five tiles, which increases my chances at getting such. I also get to draw more into a bag with a lot of good tiles left. It also is favored by Quackle, too. 
>George: AGST G1 GATS +29 115
>James: EIILNQS N5 QI. +14 210
#note I wasn't sure if GATS indicated that George had another S, but thought it more likely than that he just had a terrible hand and felt he needed to keep pace, particularly since he has played a good deal into the bag. I have decent letters of my own though, so I went for my own counter. 
>George: EHIRTXY H1 OH +33 148
>James: ?EIILNS 11D LIoNISE. +66 276
#note Quackle favors ISoLINE making SCANTED, which I expected it would. I liked LIONISED because it helped close down a lot of volatile lanes on the board, leaving the B, R and maybe the E as bingo lanes. The I does leave him scoring possibilities but I felt this worked out just fine for me. 

(this is only my reasoning because I'm ahead by 120+ points after this turn - in different circumstances I would consider ISOLINE or other moves, but I feel this kind of move is most likely to help preserve my lead)
>George: EINRTXY 12A CADI +24 172
>James: ?DEJNTT B10 JE.Ns +54 330
#note Almost anything wins at this point according to Quackle, but that assumes that I play perfectly from hereon. I can see the arguments for JEAN B10 (blocks the same spot, there's one S left out there) and JETTED I3 (best leave as a result and if he trip-trips, I am almost given to bingo back and still have the lead), or TAJ (also blocks the trip trip, leaves no S possibility, leave is great, but not much scoring). I chose JEANs just because I feel the pressure of coming back from a 150 point deficit is harder to deal with than a 100 point lead, particularly if there are no high-scoring bingo lanes left out there. 

The situation I may not play this play in is one where I need to win by some huge margin, in order to take a really large prirze. I'd rather take a guaranteed win that's smaller in margin rather than increase the risk of losing, even if my likelihood of winning is still really high. 
>George: ABERTXY H11 .XIAS +60 232
#note About the best play George could have hoped for - not a bingo, scores very highly and opens yet more lanes. 
>James: DIRTTUV 15C VIRTU. +10 340
#note VID O4 is consistend with keeping the pressure on, but I decided to limit the S and play off bad tiles, and as many tiles as possible. The faster I also empty out the bag, the lower chance George has of fishing for more bingos. 
>George: BELLRTY 10J W.EWEE +35 267
>James: ADHOOPT O8 HO.D +24 364
#note Mistake - I missed DOETH O8 here. 
>George: BLLORTY A12 .AUL +21 288
>James: AELOPTY 14H .PETALY +28 392
#note I missed all of REPLAY, RAPTLY and REALTY funnily enough. I just wanted to play APETALY and limit his fishing ability for the next turns. George also suggested APPROVEDLY through PROVED but that's actually not good! What a weird dictionary. 

At this point, I think almost anything wins - if George bingos, I just have to score okay and not phony and I will win.
