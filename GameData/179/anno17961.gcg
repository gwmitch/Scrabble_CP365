#note Wishing I had gotten to go second with this draw, for a shot at a nice play
>Wes_Y: CHLOT 7B CLOTH +24 24

>Wes_Y: BIOT A3 OBIT +22 46

#note riskiness pays off
>Wes_Y: EGLO 6F OGLE +17 63
>E_Tran: ?ALPQTY 5I PLY +20 143
#note Too defensive.  PLATY to set up a tricky S-hook is appealing.  APTLY scores the most.  Keeping the AT with the Q isn't too useful on this board.
>Wes_Y: FIR G3 FRI. +12 75
>E_Tran: ?ADEOQT J3 TO.D +20 163
#note F2 DOE sets up QAT.  ducks are so smart.
>Wes_Y: AR 9G AR +17 92
>E_Tran: ?AAEELQ H1 ALAE +23 186
#note Would've wanted an I.  Sim says ALEE because Q and A go together.
>Wes_Y: EIRT D1 .ITER +18 110
>E_Tran: ?EFQRUY E7 ..QUE +28 214
#note He's clearly close to a bingo, and TORQUE gives up more hooks
>Wes_Y: AENRSTV 1G T.VERNAS +62 172
>E_Tran: ?AFNRTY D11 FRY +23 237
#note FRY has the best defense, and bingoes the most next turn.
>Wes_Y: GIW 2M WIG +23 195
>E_Tran: ?ABNSTU J8 SUNBATh +80 317
#note Missing GUNBOATS!  considering phoneying with GUNBLAST though.  SUNBATH might draw a challenge, or he might be unsure of the hooks, so it's better than quackle indicates.
>Wes_Y: ADEJ 15G JADE +45 240
#note Nope

#note Blocking all the lanes.
>Wes_Y: EX 13L EX +39 289
>E_Tran: DEEHIIS F10 HE +32 387
#note There are some longshot bingo lines that aren't worth blocking.  Quack says HES or HEED in the same spot are better value.
