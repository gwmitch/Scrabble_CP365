>E_Tran: AEHIRRT 5E RATH +26 168
#note Before this play, I overdrew, turning over IJR.  Betsy throws back the J.  Without many bingo lines, I liked the points here with RATH.  WITCH/WATCH score as much though, and avoid being vowel heavy -- but quack still favours RATH.  5E RAH wins the sim though.  Makes sense.
>Betsy_C: ADIJORU 4B JUDO +26 134
>E_Tran: DEIIRRS 4H RIDER +21 189
#note Weird spot.  The aggressive fishes are (A)IR or R(A)I.  The middle fishes are L3 IRID or 4H RID.  Scoring 3 pts doesn't look appetizing against this opponent, so I reduce variance and take the pts with RIDER.  It actually wins a 4ply sim.

#note After Betsy's fish, I can't make HA(J)I anymore.  Strongly considered phoneying with SHIZAM (with NOSTRILS).  I went for the safe play, figuring she might challenge as she has nothing to lose.

#note Scores and takes out a bingo line.  Not worth fishing at this instance.

#note Considered SNIDEST/RIDERS or TINEiDS for defense, but it seemed unnecessary.  Quack says TINEIDS.

#note Took 5 minutes, to Betsy's chagrin.  This is only 2nd best, 3 pts behind ERGO N4.
