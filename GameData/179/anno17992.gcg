#note Welcome to a ridiculous beginning-of-game situation
>Josh: AEGIIMT -  +0 0
#note I coffeehoused that TWANGER was much more plausible after coming back from the challenge computer and Emanuel said that that was ridiculous. So I'm thinking maybe I'm crazy. So I think I need to play like he's going to play GREW or exch W or something next turn.

I finally decide to get Emanuel to believe TWANGER is a word, half thinking it's phony and half thinking it's good and that I'll get to play MITIGATE. And I pass. Yes, folks, you heard it! 

I can't make a play cause it will give him an 8, and I can't exchange and be relatively sure of bingoing next turn. Passing and letting Emanuel play TWANGER is better than exchanging I and letting him play TWANGER. And I think I'm going to challenge TWANGER anyways, which is wrong. I wanted to start the game with 4 passes too! 

But either way, this position is really really cool. I think that if Emanuel isn't going to play TWANGER, I should exchange I. If he is, I should pass, in which case he will exchange instead? I have no idea what he would do. In this particular scenario I played it out so that he would think I'm just letting him try another word that's invalid for the laughs rather than awaiting his T. I think I probably played this stupidly but it was so much fun!

>Josh: AEGIIMT -  +0 0
#note Now obviously I should just take the T this time since I thought TWANGER was good at first. But I feel like I don't want to let a phony go and he will very likelily not take the T away from me next turn. Bad challenging logic but this was really fun and suspenseful.

>Emanuel: ANOUV 4A VA.U +22 100
>Josh: DELOPQR A1 PRO.ED +36 112
#note I considered this and PLO(V)ER. I didn't consider exchanging my Q, which I should have, but it doesn't seem all too viable. PLO(V)ER is around as good as PRO(V)ED to me because despite scoring less, the D is a better tile than the L, especially given the Q on my rack (QAID/QADI/QUAD/QUID/QUOD).

>Emanuel: ?FGJKSZ 12B ZeKS +48 170
#note What would you play here? I would play JuGS instead although with FJ he can draw into F(U)JI. But with ZKF he can draw into many other things! 
>Josh: ILLNRRW H4 WILL.R +13 155
#note So it's either this or (Z)ILL for twice as many points. This gives back far less, keeps a better leave, goes for SSS and shapes the board in favor of bingos over scoring. I don't know what he's holding after his last play but I doubt it's bingo tiles. I felt like I needed to open multiple spots for SSS due to my slight deficit.

>Josh: CENNNST G10 .NN +3 200
#note I think I should just play (I)NCENT here, the other consideration I had, since CENTS isn't much better than NS with this pool, but now that I had an S I wanted to close down 7 lanes that didn't require one.

#note Saw the only two 8s available with this rack, CYSTEINE and ENCYSTED
>Emanuel: ARY A13 RAY +27 285
>Josh: ACDOSST A8 COAT +29 256
#note Should I drop the S at H4 this turn? ACDOST only bingos with EINR.
>Emanuel: AIUX 15G U.AI +4 289
>Josh: ADLOSSS H4 ......S +25 281
#note Ack! I chickened out of DOSSALS! I thought I was confused with DORSALS, ugh... K9 DOSSALS for sure. I didn't even realize he was setting his X up, I thought it was an H since I didn't check the pool... Terrible mistake.
>Emanuel: IX 14J XI +50 339
>Josh: ABDLOSS L11 BODS +24 305
#note I had no clue what to do here. This looks as good as anything I'd say. J8 SOBA ir J6 BOS seem like a slight improvement.

#note too much
>Josh: AALLSTT 3G ATLATLS +79 384
#note At laaaaatltltltlst...

TWILLERS* was something I was looking at all game thinking it was good. Emanuel couldn't challenge, naturally. This wins more than half the time if he doesn't challenge. He was low on time at this point and didn't have time to track properly, so I made the right play. Scored as 79.
>Emanuel: EEEHIPR L1 HE.PER +30 402
#note :(

A perfect endgame would have given Emanuel 9 more points.
>Josh: EOOU K3 .OO +14 398
#note I7 O(R)E to block I(R)E, which for some ridiculous reason neither of us saw.
