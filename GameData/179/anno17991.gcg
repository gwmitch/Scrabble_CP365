#note Put down HEATH, added the S to make SHEATH, took it back. Stupid. Now he knows I have an S. 9F or 7F SHH look good too. I didn't see them. I feel like I shouldn't play an S here even when it gives me a better leave since it gives Jason an S to play through, and if I do play it, obviously HEATHS is better than SHEATH because of SHEATHE.
>Jason: FIX K5 FIX +40 52
#note immediately annoyed for having taken my s off
>Josh: ACENOSS L4 SAC +23 50
#note I counted CANOES L1 as 30, then counted SAC as 23. I didn't think the 7 extra points were worth taking, but CANOES is actually 33. Still, I prefer this play as it gives Jason far less to work with and maximizes the value of my second S.  OCAS L3 and SOCA 11J look pretty good too, but I prefer my play I think.
>Jason: GIM M3 MIG +21 73
>Josh: ENOOPRS 11D OPERONS +80 130
>Jason: ?ADEFIL 12D FILED +45 118
#note Jason and I agree that this is a better play than any of the bingos he could have played. 
>Josh: EEGINRS 10H RE.INGES +70 200
#note lol blind to GESNERI(A). I need to work on looking everywhere. Not that I deserve it
>Jason: AEUZ M10 .AUZE +30 148
>Josh: AAAMNOT N13 AMA +29 229
#note (S)OMATA and ATAMAN(S) are much better. SOMATA is obviously the play. I missed both whilst under the impression that this was the equity-whoring play. 
>Jason: ?ILQRTU O3 QUILTeR. +101 249
#note punished
>Josh: ACLNOOT 7B COOLANT +63 292
#note I kind of knew this had an anagram but I would have guessed OCTONAL* over OCTANOL. H8 (A)C(ROD)ONT is an honorable mention.
>Jason: BKL 12L B.LK +36 285
>Josh: EEIIIRY 6E EYE +31 323
#note Hoping I can play through my IIIR leave next turn, because I need to keep the scoring pressure on. 
>Jason: EN O14 EN +17 302
>Josh: IIIIRUW -IIIIRUW +0 323
#note or not... Saw the vowel to consonant ratio and the blank and S in the pool and decided to throw everything in. It seems close with keeping R or IR, but I saw than there were more one-pointers lurking around that I didn't want to not be able to score with. Obviously keeping IR and R have better bingo percentages for next turn but bingoing is the last thing I want to need to count on on this board and at this point in the game. 
>Jason: BJO 5C JOB +34 336
>Josh: ADEEPTT 13A PATTED +33 356
#note No S nor blank drawn, so I have to block the most prominent (sorry the only) bingo lane; the C in COOLANT. I don't feel like the game is won here. I didn't know if PATED was valid and I knew Jason knew better than me so I couldn't risk it. I need to know PATED. It's a much better play than PATTED.
>Jason: ?ANRRR -RRR +0 336
#note Jason said he had too many R's here. What I was hoping for with PATTED is that he had the blank and couldn't really score with the P, which is what happened. Not his rack, just guessing
>Josh: EIIOTVW B10 VIT.E +32 388
#note Perfect draw for me I would say. 
>Jason: AY A13 .YA +29 365
>Josh: DIORRSW F10 W... +16 404
#note I think this was my rack. I think it's important to keep the S. I considered C13 (T)WO but that gave him the chance to bingo or fish for a bingo. No want.

I put GAUZED*/DAN down, then thought for a second. I remembered GAUZED* was phony, but tried to act like I just decided the play was silly, so that in the off chance Jason has the D, he would play it thinking I thought it was good... :) 

>Jason: W D4 W. +10 375
>Josh: DDIOORS E4 O...I +12 416
#note We now see the benefits of (W)ELD. Keeping OI was important.
>Jason: NU F3 UN +8 383
>Josh: DDIORRS 2A SORDID +32 448
#note I doubted DROID for a second due to the pressure. Whatever, this wins.
>Jason: ?EGINOR 1A EN +14 397
#note 3 9s end in S(AN), but Jason didn't see any that worked with the pool and stuff he saw COURTESAN, one of the 3. The others are TRICLOSAN and SALVARSAN. Cool. This is 19 off OGeE in the same spot
>Josh: RU C7 .UR +4 452
>Josh:  (GIOR?) +10 462
