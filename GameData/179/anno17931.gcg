>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>Jim_Burlant: EHIIPRT 7H PITHIER +68 68
#note This is what happens when you auto-pilot an opening rack bingo and rush the play.  This plays at 9F for 13 more points.  Sheesh!  (-10.7)
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: EMW 8M MEW +30 52
>Jim_Burlant: AINORTZ K6 T.ORAZIN +90 158
#note Phony.  Was  70/30 sure this was bogus.  I gave it better than a 50/50 shot at staying on the board.  This wasn't so much as held.  My best legitimate play is K7 HOATZIN for 38.  (+49.5)
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: BIN 9F BIN +23 75
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEGOS 14J GEODE +43 201
#note While I was pretty sure THORAZIN* was phony, I wasn't so sure this hook wasn't legit, so I figured I'd take the chance for 43 points.   THORAZINE* (certainly plausible -it's an anti-psychotic medication, and other medication names, like TACRINE, are acceptable) is also phony.  This is also significantly better than any of my legitimate options.  My best legitimate play is L9 EGAD 34.  93% to win.  (+7.1)
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: UX 15N XU +36 111
>Jim_Burlant: ACINRSW M11 WAN. +16 217
#note With only 3 I's and 7 A's unseen, I wanted to unload the A.  That's all well and good, and Q agrees that I should play the A and keep the I.  But that doesn't explain this feeble play.  These same tiles score 32 if I play them at L10. Note to self:  LOOK AT THE WHOLE BOARD, NITWIT!  (-14.7)
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: GJ 10J J.G +27 138
>Jim_Burlant: ?CCEIRS 15E CICERoS +104 321
#note Hey, why not?  My best legitimate plays are 7's on row 6:  CarICES, C(L)ERICS, CREtICS, CICERoS, and CIRCLES for 82.  (+28)
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: DER N10 RED +14 152
>Jim_Burlant: EEFOOOU 6M FOU +21 342
#note Yeah, the leave is crap, but I'm also leading an absurdly large margin.  Why prolong the game by exchanging?  This still scores 21 and unloads one of my O's and a U.  
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: ?ADELRS 6B DeALERS +69 221
>Jim_Burlant: AEELOOR 7B OLEO +14 356
#note Q says I should have played this on row 5 for 3 more points.  I'd rather make sure he doesn't have any bingo lanes.  I don't care if I give him 30 back at 8A.
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: HT D4 TH.. +14 235
>Jim_Burlant: AEIPRST 10A PIRATES +81 437
#note This is ridiculous!
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: ALLY 4D .ALLY +12 247
>Jim_Burlant: AIMNOUV A8 UM. +21 458
#note Certainly a good choice, but Q wants me to build another bingo rack and it has a clever suggestion for how I can do that:  VODOU B4 gets rid of the UV combo, and makes it impossible for him to hit the A column if he doesn't have an N, I already have M and N in my rack.  That said, there's nothing wrong with this, and I'm  not taking any chances on letting this one slip away, as badly as most of this tournament has gone.
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: ABEGKSY -AB +0 247
>Jim_Burlant: AINOOOV G2 VA.O. +9 467
#note Ok, Quackle's priority is different than mine was.  While the win was clinched 5 turns ago, I'd been having a rough tournament and really wanted to preserve as much spread as possible.  It's clear he's close to something and the problem with the obvious equity plays on row 3 (OVA, AVO, AVION) is that they give him an all too easy place to put down a 7.  I'd rather block and see if he can hit through/from the V.
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: A E10 .A +4 251
>Jim_Burlant: BFINOOT 12C BONITO +21 488
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  The 12D placement scores identically but doesn't give back big plays if he's got the Y - something I wasn't thinking about at the time.  
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: N 8A .N +6 257
>Jim_Burlant: ADEFGKY 3G .A +7 495
#note Blocking potential 8's through/from the V.
>Bruce_D'Ambrosio: AEISTUV C10 .U. +5 262

#note Annotation stops here  - nothing noteworthy happens as we move tiles to finish the game.  Final score recorded as 542 - 303.
