#note i told david that i was 100% sure he kept 3 consonants (actually i misspoke and should have said i was 100% sure he had no vowels in his leave). if he had another E, then WHEEP, otherwise the other vowels result in better plays.

#note he told me he actually kept two consonants and a blank ;)
>cesar: ADEEIMO E9 MOA +27 57
#note i was torn between MOA and MEAD here. i decided it was worth 7 points to not keep three vowels. quackle suggests this is the wrong choice; after i played i also thought i'd made the wrong choice. (-3)

#note wow i'm already in trouble here. i think that in these types of situations, quackle is wrong. for example, the obvious equity play here is G13 FEU, but that's just asking for a horrible closed board and i'm down 60. i spent a very long time on this play trying to do the right thing since it seemed like a key play, and in the end, i have no idea what's right. FEUING seemed better than FEUDING because it seems like it gives up slightly fewer points, but i don't even know if that's right. any ideas? fungi? i think if i had seen ENUF i would have played it. (-12 equity)

#note i should have played conk/nock instead even though there's three i's left, because ADIN is much better than ADNO. that's what i get for looking at the bag. (-1)

#note this was another tough move. i decided to just be aggressive. quackle has the really cool N14 WO but i think it's not necessary for that risk right now... i also considered B10 DAW or D12 WIFE (which wanion has got to be better than), didn't see DWINE 12B. (-4.5)

#note what can i do. i'm sure there's some magic move instead of feuing or wanion that i should have made. quackle likes my move best o_O actually it also likes 14L TORR, but that's wrong, because david can trivially close the only real bingo lane.
