>E_Tran: CENOPSW 8G COW +16 16
#note Wow.  WOP values 5 better than COW.  I figured the defense would be better with COW.  It's only slightly better, while eating at my bingo%.
>Maureen_M: ESTZ J6 ZEST +42 42
>E_Tran: ENPRSTY G6 EN.RYPTS +68 84
#note Spent about 2 minutes deciding if PRY was better than ENCRYPTS.  Probably a waste of time - should just make one and go with it.  PRY has the much higher stdev, so ENCRYPTS is right, against a lower rated player.
>Maureen_M: ETUX 13C TUXE. +24 66
>E_Tran: JMNOOQT F2 JOMON +36 120
>Maureen_M: EK E11 KE. +28 94
>E_Tran: EILQRST 14B QI +24 144
#note 14B QI or 12B QI?  Quack says the dangerous one only gives Maureen +4 pts, and +2 stdev pts.  I thought it'd be worse.  I hate giving up cheapie pts, but this is the best play
>Maureen_M: CDEGGO 15C COGGED +41 135
>E_Tran: ELNORST E3 LENO +21 165
#note Didn't see the -TIC spot until a few turns after.  Keeping an E here is essential, especially with an E shortage.  This move is bad.
>Maureen_M: IO F10 OI +20 155
>E_Tran: ALNRRST K5 LAR +19 184
#note Could use an E.

>Maureen_M: MOP D4 MOP +37 238
>E_Tran: AEIILRS N8 .AIRIES +24 320
#note Two blanks unseen.  This blocks the remaining bingo lines that don't begin with J.  Quack has listed 10J SHEILA, which is awesome.  FAIRIES still wins a sim, just ahead of SHEILA.  
>Maureen_M: ??AEIVW H1 WAIVEs +51 289
#note Maureen said she had to blanks here.
>E_Tran: BEHLNNR 2H .LB +11 331
#note Paranoid blocking, or take some points somewhere?  My choice: blocking.  Thought process: Maureen will screw up tough endgames.  If she has an easy bingo with the W or A, she'll find it and I will lose handily.
>Maureen_M: DIU M13 DUI +16 305
>E_Tran: EHNNRTU O13 NET +16 347
#note Easy words at O13 can hurt me.  There are enough A's and E's that I can balance on my draw.  Quack likes HUNT or THRU at J
>Maureen_M: ?AEILRY 1H .EARILY +20 325
>E_Tran: AAHNRTU J11 TAHR +15 362
#note YUAN first, duh.  I lacked the vision to see that after YUAN, a second outplay will be created.
