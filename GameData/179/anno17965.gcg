#note HORSIER, by a smidge.

#note Since Juraj missed this hook, I made the right choice.

#note Almost had BEAUTIFIES.  With his play, BEAUTIFIERS is almost there.  The best play here is KIF.  That's the hottest spot.  I actually almost talk myself into playing FAB 7C here, to block the top part of the board.  But, there are so many hotspots, I should take them, and worry about board shape for another move.

#note Phoney.  I did see FRABJOUS and JACOBUS, and sillily made this potentially costly phoney.

>Juraj_P: EIILNNU 4F .NILINE +16 375
#note This play blocks bingoes in the immediate future, but a play on 3 will easily open up a bingo line on 2.  Ideally, to block, I'd want to play down on L.
>E_Tran: DEO 3K ODE +13 251
>Juraj_P: DEEGLOU 5C GLO.E +18 393
#note Even with 4 A's left, if I had seen 2J GEODE, that would've come down.  I should try harder to block the bingo line here.  This move is pretty lame.

#note With 5 left, emptying the bag is usually frowned upon.  This time, it's 23 pts better than the next best play, TUT 1G.

>Juraj_P: BDESWXY 3B WEBS +24 458
#note Sim says no rush.  Dont worry about going out, just score lots of pts.  Like with N6 BOY, then KEX.
