>Amalan_Iyengar: AAEEERR 8H AREAE +12 12
>Kevin_Bowerman: AAIILSW I5 WAI. +8 8
>Amalan_Iyengar: DENORST 9C RODENTS +72 84
#note Scored as 71
>Kevin_Bowerman: AILLPSU 6F PIL.U +15 23
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEHIOOT 10E OHO +32 116
#note Maybe OHIA to block the triple? OHO beats OHIA in a sim tho. Scored as 31
>Kevin_Bowerman: ACEGLSW 8A CLAW +50 73
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAEIITZ 11C ZIT +32 148
#note AIT? AE? This seems fine. ZA(P)TI(EH) is cool
>Kevin_Bowerman: EEGGPQS C11 .EP +28 101
#note Maybe exchange?
>Amalan_Iyengar: AABEIIR A3 ARABI. +11 159
#note AERIA(L) definitely, ABA(C)I is a better fish.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEGGLQS -GGQ +0 101
#note GLEG was my other thought.
>Amalan_Iyengar: EEFIKOV 12A KI.F +42 201
#note KE(E)F maybe?
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEEFLOS A12 .EEF +33 134
>Amalan_Iyengar: DEEIOVX 5E VOX +39 240
>Kevin_Bowerman: ACIJLOS L3 CAJOL. +30 164
#note Maybe JAL(OP)? Scores the same. I didn't see JAL(OP), but I still like this, as I saw that it set up (CAJOLE)RIES with an ER draw.
>Amalan_Iyengar: BDEEEGI 11G BEIGE +21 261
#note BEEDI in the top left. Amal did not know it, however he did know BEED*
>Kevin_Bowerman: ILRSSUY L11 SURLY +33 197
#note I would have played RULY/CAJOLER most likely if he had not blocked (CAJOLE)RIES with BEIGE, as I would only need an E draw.
>Amalan_Iyengar: DEENRTU 13G DENTU.ER +74 335
>Amalan_Iyengar: DEENRTU --  -74 261
#note Amal saw RETU(R)NED right after this, and was unsure about UNDER(L)ET.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ADIMNSS 14J MI.DS +28 225
#note I thought this blocked all bingos. I am really bad.
>Amalan_Iyengar: DEENRTU 15D DENTURE +84 345
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEMNSTU 3L .UM +14 239
#note What to do here?

>Amalan_Iyengar: GNOOQRV -GOOQV +0 345
#note What to exchange? This looks ok to get turnover for the 2 unseen blanks. Maybe exchange down to the case R? The pool seems very strong
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEHINST 3A .STHENIA +74 313
#note I saw HE(M)ATINS, but wasn't 100% and thought it opened too much, and blocked my best lane (down to the S). This looks OK
>Amalan_Iyengar: EGNORTY H1 GR.Y +36 381
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?GINOTV C7 V.. +10 323
#note VO(M)ITiNG should win the game, but he most likely does not have the Q after GR(A)Y. Champ seems to like V(U)G most, but I thought that that blocked too many of my own bingos.
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?DENOOT D3 .O +10 391
#note Amal saw ODONaTE(S) and (M)OTiONED, but he cannot do basic math, and thought that a Kevin outbingo would mean his loss. He knows I didn't have the Q before V(AR). Any bingo means 100% win for him according to champ, the best of which is (G)OlDTONE.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?AGINOT 1A GlOATIN. +80 403
#note TAnGOIN(G) scores more. A bingo through the M would most likely win, but luckily I did not miss any. The only bingo in AIGMNOT? is ANTIsMOG
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?DENOQT N10 QuOD. +34 425
#note Correct
>Kevin_Bowerman: N 4L .N +4 407
#note (I)N(N) is one point more. Almost had this one but a select few plays ruined my chances (aka MILDS). Final recorded score 423-413
>Kevin_Bowerman:  (ENT) +6 413
