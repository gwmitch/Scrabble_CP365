#note or MOPY.  Given that I should prefer an open board, MOPY may be better.  I tend to revert to defense when I shouldn't.
>Bill_P: AENO F10 AEON +17 43
>E_Tran: DDEOORT D11 DO +13 41
#note Both DODO's seem crazy and give up easy pts.  9G DO makes sense though, to open up bingo lines for myself.  It's not worse defensively than my placement.
>Bill_P: NWY G7 W.NY +23 66
>E_Tran: DELORTU 6G TOLU +17 58
#note He scores; I block my own bingo.  Yup.
>Bill_P: ADE 13C DEA. +14 80
>E_Tran: DEFOPRR 14A FRORE +26 84
#note H1 FOREDO is the word I was trying to find.  Bill's last play suggests he's got a lot of 1pters.  I hate that 14B FOR/FORD give him easy access to the x3s.  7J PROF has merit, to keep aiming for my own bingo.  This play is kinda random, but sims ok.  Maybe Bill tries VALIDS, or chickens out on TOLUS?
>Bill_P: AEJN 5H JANE +35 115
>E_Tran: DEEILPT A12 DE.T +30 114
#note DEFI.  I should do a v-c count before this play.
>Bill_P: IV I3 VI.. +11 126
>E_Tran: EILNPUU 3I .ULPINE +24 138
#note 4K PIU!  does everything I want.  Instead I throw caution to the wind with this play.  I don't think it's horrible -- it's a good play, just not to my usual style.
>Bill_P: HO 4N OH +20 146
>E_Tran: BEGIRUZ 7J BURG +14 152
#note 7J BUG is winning by a hair.  I don't mind turnover here, and the Z is a vowelophile

>E_Tran: ACEEGOS B9 CAGE +12 294
#note I had marked down A(NO)A on my sheet, but hadn't thought of GE(NO)A.  I'm more happy with this play though.
>Bill_P: M J2 M. +10 233
>E_Tran: ?BEIOSS 1E BOSSIEs +79 373
#note This is bad defense, and SOUBISE was more, but I figured I would get a free turn out of this, as he would assume I mismarked the blank.  
>Bill_P: ?AGHIIR 2E AHI +33 266
#note And Bill doesn't even look at the blank slip that I slide over in his direction.
