>Bernard: AINV H5 VINA +14 14
#note A kitten just died etc etc
>Chris: DEEGIMO 5E OGI.E +18 18
#note This and VOGIE are pretty equivalent; this keeps the board more open though. I didn't know much about Bernard so I didn't have a preference either way
>Bernard: AHJ 4C HAJ +35 49
#note VOGIE would've made this even more points
>Chris: DEGGMRT 3B GEM +26 44
#note This scores the most and is good defensively; TEGG B6 is more dynamic though. I think I like this since it'll be somewhat hard to Bernard to score next turn, which should give me time to clean up my rack, especially with the open vowels for paralleling. 
>Bernard: CEFHNR 4I FRENCH +33 82
#note It's a bit unfortunate he was able to score 33 here. He said that it was an appropriate word to play while in Quebec, and I'd have to agree!
>Chris: DDGORTU 6B DRUG +21 65
#note Maybe I was on drugs and that's why I didn't score 300 this game? (This sims clearly best)
>Bernard: AFO 2A OAF +27 109
>Chris: DOOSSTU 7E SOU.D +21 86
#note I drew 2 s's so I'm super lucky! I didn't like what this did to the board but it felt forced and it's 2% up on anything else
>Bernard: UX 5K XU +38 147
#note The trap is really closing fast here and I feel kinda helpless :|
>Chris: IOQSTTT K3 T..T +11 97
#note Very clear exchange here, keeping IST or ST. No idea why I decided 11 points were so important here
>Bernard: ALLW 9F WALL +17 164
#note Erecting the berlin wall. This game I can't play GLASNOST to counteract it :(
>Chris: CNOOQST G4 Q. +11 108
#note I seem to like 11 point plays. This time it was right though.
>Bernard: AV M2 VA. +16 180
>Chris: CINOOST 10E COT +16 124
#note Wanted to fork the board but COOT > COT. The sim is liking just WO here too. This isn't a great play at all :(
>Bernard: Y A1 Y. +15 195
#note When he played this I started thinking about the validity of FRENCHY* and maybe trying it if I got a Y
>Chris: IINOPST D8 PISTON +28 152
#note I should probably fish again with PICOT or HIP N4 but I decided to go for points and the blanks cause I'd kind of had enough. This is 2% down from the best fishing plays (about 14% to win)
>Bernard: ?AEIOPT 10I OPIATEs +68 263
#note ANTIPOPE would be an interesting word to play in Quebec too maybe hehe. ANTIPOLE and ANTIPODE are also 74.
>Chris: ?AEINOY O8 NO.EY +33 185
#note Thought of COY E10 but figured that I'd better take the O line. The sim really likes COY over NOSEY despite the extra 8 points for NOSEY since it keeps the game more dynamic. I think it believes Bernard will block the 3x3 and normal triple bingoes less than he actually will though. I decided against hooking FRENCHY* but I think I should have in this game situation since I'm down so much even though it likely would've been challenged off
>Bernard: BDEI 11I BIDE +31 294
>Chris: ?AAEIIL H11 AALII +26 211
#note He commented 'misery, I truly mean that' after I played this and I could tell he did mean it, which I guess is some consolation lol
>Bernard: AKN 8A KNA. +30 324
>Chris: ?EEEISU N4 .UE +8 219
#note I guess the extra 4 points for VEE might be useful in the scenarios where I do come bak so I should probably play that
>Bernard: ERRTW 14F WR.TER +19 343
>Chris: ?EEIMSZ N12 MEZE +37 256
#note Time to give up (scrabble?) hehe
>Bernard: EEILNR 15A RELINE +26 369
>Chris: ?DIORSS 7K SoDS +25 281
#note ISOSPIn J6 is sick! SODS was scored as 26, so this game should be my lowest scoring game ever (officially it's tied atm with my game in 2009 vs Leesa Berahovich at 282)
>Bernard: B 9C B. +14 383
#note After looking at this I really don't know what I could've really done. The TEXT play, not continuing to fish by playing PISTON, and COT maybe contributed to the loss, but largely I just drew horribly i guess
>Bernard:  (IOR) +6 389
