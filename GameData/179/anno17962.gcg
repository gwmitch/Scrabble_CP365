#note Will Wayne think of TOLING at H1?  If he does, giving him TOKING isn't so bad.
>Wayne_C: AGILNOT O10 TO.ING +33 150
>E_Tran: ACDNOOP H4 COP +24 239
#note H3 COOP is fine.  A play will eventually go down at E5, minimizing that bingo line (that was my concern).  I don't like E3 COP because that line will stay open the whole game, which is undesirable.

#note Only bingo.  Took me a bit of time to convince myself of it, and also to play it.

>E_Tran: AEEFIUY 11K YE +16 431
#note Weird spot.  3 left in the bag, so I was hesitant to make one of the top two choices, 11K FEY or B13 FIE.  This is next: an L gets me LEAF up top for good points, or else preserving FIE B13, while blocking his spot for LEV/REV.
