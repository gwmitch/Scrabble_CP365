#note Baiting Betsy to make MIRIS.  Must be best.

>E_Tran: CEELRRS 8B RE....... +11 73
#note Being down, I like opening new bingo lines.  Sim says R(EX) = 60% bingo; RE(CREATES) = 52% bingo
>Betsy_C: ?BGIQRS 9M QI +42 146
>E_Tran: CEHLNRS N9 .NCHER +35 108
#note Looks best.  didn't consider CLEN(C)H, distant cousin to Evens.

>E_Tran: ?EEILNS 15I LIcENSE +83 191
#note I don't mind opening this hotspot -- good chance Betsy doesn't think of RELICENSE.
>Betsy_C: ?DGMNOS O6 MODS +33 197
#note Betsy: must add 3 new missed-bingos to my cardbox.
>E_Tran: AFOSUYY F10 FOY +32 223
#note Or at 7E, but taking this hotspot makes sense.
>Betsy_C: ?GHLNTZ C7 L.Z +23 220
>E_Tran: ADJNSUY 14F JUDAS +37 260
#note Took some time on this rack.  It looks best.  JUDAS 13B is worth thinking about though: If betsy underlaps, I get a JO(Y) play, and can hit the x3.
>Betsy_C: ?GHINTW N2 WITcH +51 271
>E_Tran: EIINPRY D4 PYRI. +26 286
#note PI(T)Y for balance.  Duh.

>E_Tran: AEGOPTU H1 .UTO +5 379
#note I take forever thinking of ways to block all bingoes.  2A is the biggest concern.  First play to come to mind is TEGUA C1, but then bingoes might still fit at 2E.  Quack suggests E1 TOGAE.  But then I'm still susceptible to bingos at 3H/4H.  This play scores like crap though.  What to do.
>Betsy_C: AADGOUV G4 GUAV. +16 332
>E_Tran: AAEEGNP E1 APNEA +28 407
#note Sim says E2 AGEE values best.  I was low on time.  This gets the job done: blocks any miracles, and aims to go out next turn.
>Betsy_C: ABDEGOO 13G BOG +28 360
>E_Tran: EGIT 2C GI. +6 413
#note No outs.  Low on time.  Thought she only had the C1 spot to go out.
