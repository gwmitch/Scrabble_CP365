#note Or DODGEM.  I hate V.  Quack agrees.  I also have a small chance at hitting hooks she won't think of (COM, MIS, OUT)

#note Oh wow.  I thought this was good.  confused with EULOGIAE.  I also accidentally coffeehoused Wendy here, saying I misspelled EUGENIE Bouchard's name.
>Wendy_M: BOY 8L .OBY +30 103
>E_Tran: GHIOPRS K9 HOP +31 195
#note K9 POH is 1 more, but leaves a juicy spot I'd rather avoid.  Simming best is M12 GHI, 5 better than HOP.  Unnecessary against this opponent, but I wonder if I'd have the balls to try it against another opponent in a semi-close game.  I also wonder if it's worth playing against anyone, given my 1-bingo lead.  M7 POH is also worth considering, to block off the FEE- hook, and the N-bingo line.

#note I believe the bag was consonant heavy, making this a better play.
>Wendy_M: ILNO M3 NOIL +15 138
>E_Tran: ABEIJSZ 7C JAB +28 239
#note 6 pt sacrifice, compared to the L2 spot.  Quackle will hate it, but it cleans up the B and 6 lines, locking up the topleft part of the board.  NOIL suggests Wendy kept 3 1-pointers.  Is this too defensive, given that there are still many juicy lines available?  Quack says Wendy's next turn, her bingo% is the same as if I played at L2.

>E_Tran: EIISTVZ L2 ZIT +30 269
#note Another sacrifice compared to (B)IZ.  This one is a lot more palpable.  Sim actually likes 14A VISIT.  In a close game or if behind, I would think about that harder.

#note Took too long trying to bingo at O1.  this is best, though I would want to avoid slotting the S on the x3 column.  It lets Wendy score well easily, while opening the board.
>Wendy_M: AOR H1 OAR. +12 215
>E_Tran: EFNNNRT J12 T.RN +6 382
#note I opt to block the X, rather than the unlikely chance Wendy bingoes.  12H FEN is fine.  or N(A)N, says the quack.

>E_Tran: EFNNSWX 15L WENS +39 421
#note HEX first.  I'm happier blocking this spot.
