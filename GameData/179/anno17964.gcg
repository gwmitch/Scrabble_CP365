#note Of course I don't redraw a new A/E or O.  I missed H4 TWIGS, which is beautiful, while waiting for a vowel for H1.
>Paul_S: AEILNOO 6D E.O.IONAL +65 180
#note TWIGS would block this!
>E_Tran: ?ILRUXY D8 .YLIX +34 151

#note And now that!  Mistakes are being capitalized on
>E_Tran: ?NRRTUU B12 TURN +20 171
#note Took a long time looking for bingos.  nada.  Given the score and my blank, I liked slotting the N at the #2 position.  Quack agrees.
