#note i've already lost this game with this rack. i wish i was worse so i could just exchange 7 and draw a blank/S. quackle likes V(A)W or WUZ but AVOW is close behind too. i guess VAW keeps it more tight or something. (-2)

#note exchanging keeping ANT is correct now. i guess BANV is a horrible leave. -4

#note -8 .. quackle thinks i should just play 13A VEE. yeah, i guess so. keeps the best leave and putting a V there isn't that big of a deal. CEE is not that good.

#note i wasn't terribly worried about her playing RIDDANCE, but playing 14B SEX to block it (and score a lot) is best by a long shot.

#note up 70 with a blank it seems probable for me to win. quackle says 94%. would i go on to lose this game in improbable fashion?

#note why am i not playing GIBE. IN is worse than quackle suggests, it has them basically tied.

#note oh look, i don't have a blank anymore. i overdrew and she turned it in. suddenly i'm going to lose this game. i don't know what this play was about. i should probably do GLEN L1, it is much better, or M12 LEG, but i'm screwed likely.
