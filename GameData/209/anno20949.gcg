>Charles_Reinke: EFIQRSV -FQV +0 0
#note Keeping EIRSV is better, which I suspected. Playing QI or FIVER is also also better.
>Doug_Lundquist: BIO 8F OBI +10 10
>Charles_Reinke: EIOPRSS 9G ESPOIRS +71 71
#note ESPOIRS+. New bingos are a lot easier than new fours.
>Doug_Lundquist: GNOSTUU 10A OUTSUNG +68 78
>Charles_Reinke: AEFLMOR B6 FORM.LAE +71 142
>Doug_Lundquist: NOO A6 ONO +22 100
>Charles_Reinke: AEGNNQV E9 Q.EAN +28 170
#note Done instead of Q(U)AG to save GN for the I in column K. I figure it's most likely that Doug will play to the TWS in column A.
>Doug_Lundquist: AGSZ A12 ZAGS +95 195
#note Oh well, under no cirumstances was I going to block that spot.
>Charles_Reinke: GLNRRRV K8 V.RL +14 184
#note G(R)RRL+ is clearly best, but I couldn't remember if it was with two R's or three. GRR+ being good and GRRR* being phony added to my confusion.
>Doug_Lundquist: INPY D12 PINY +36 231
>Charles_Reinke: ?CDGNRR -DGNR +0 184
#note GRR+ comes up again at 7H.
>Doug_Lundquist: BUY M6 BUY. +10 241
>Charles_Reinke: ?ACEORV N2 CRAVE +30 214
#note OVER(BUYS). This is okay though since I will still have a bingo lane  when Doug plays to the triple.
>Doug_Lundquist: CDEIIRT O6 DICTIER +89 330
>Charles_Reinke: ??AAHOT N10 HAO +31 245
#note This game went south quickly. I missed the bingos here; A(P)HOlATe, AuTOHA(R)p, and (IN)HAlATOr. None of them are worth playing. <-That's me rationalizing my missed bingos
>Doug_Lundquist: AHMW L4 WHAM +35 365
>Charles_Reinke: ??AADNT I6 ADA.TioN +68 313
#note I liked this choice because it sets up huge X and J hotspots which I will need at least one of to get back in the game.
>Doug_Lundquist: GINRU J2 UNRIG +19 384
>Charles_Reinke: DEEEEFK C3 KEEF +31 344
#note I figured I needed to keep H12 open for (hopefully) my J, thus, no DEKE there.
