>Joshua_Sokol: EILOUVY H8 LOVEY +30 30
#note TIL UY is a much better leave than IU, like, quite significantly. This still looks right.
>Ross_Brown: AGII 10H .IGIA +13 13
>Joshua_Sokol: AACGIOU 12D OUGI.A +20 50
#note Especially with this word in my arsenal. Unfortunately I could have won best chemistry word (one of the prizes this tournament) with an amazing 8A GUAIACO(L)!!! I had forgotten the word and will likely never have another shot at playing it. It would have been tight between GUAIACOL and Joel Horn's AZOTEMIC in the competition for best chemistry word! Amazing...
>Ross_Brown: DINOPT L6 PINT.DO +22 35
#note Afterwards Ross told me he doesn't think this was the right play, but he wanted to race to the blanks and esses cause he hadn't been drawing them.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEFLTX 9G F.X +42 92
#note This turn was tough, but in a good way, cause I knew I was in great shape either way. The two plays that are neck and neck here are 11B FALX for 48, and 9G F(O)X for 42. My thought process here was quite complex. It wasn't simply a question of score+leave, although that was indeed a factor here. I was trying to retain the most control of the board possible, while being able to respond to plays Ross would make that would possibly open things up in some way. FALX did a great job of closing down the bottom left, for a while at least. But F(O)X blocks both IN(G) lanes for good, and really strangles the whole left side of the board! Not many plays will come down through the O and U of OUGIYA, and that L at the centre square is bothersome to leave open, not only as a decent floater but also as a 7 lane coming down (_ES/ED bingos mostly). Finally, I also really liked the versatility of ACELT versus CET. ACELT can both bingo and score OK, as well as defend the board, better than the unpredictable CET. I can draw a lot of stuff that will mess CET up. I wanted to be able to respond to Ross's plays well. A tough decision ended up seeming very sure for me, and that is why I gave up the 6 extra points.
>Ross_Brown: EHRS 13I HERS +31 66
#note An eye-opening play by Ross. I like it!
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDEELT M1 CLEATED +83 175
#note Couldn't have asked for a better draw here.
>Ross_Brown: DEIMR 1H DERMI. +36 102
>Joshua_Sokol: BDESTUZ J12 S.Z +43 218
#note My whole game plan here was to just score too well for Ross to catch up. This play scored very well and also basically annihilated what HERS opened up. Later on I was worried about certain plays to the Z, but I would normally be able to respond to those if need be.
>Ross_Brown: JT E11 J.T +20 122
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEEQTU 14B TUBED +35 253
#note Another very interesting decision. It's rare that shedding the U when you have a Q is even close to a good idea, but it seemed alright here. Nothing scores this much, lots of letters to come that would let me get rid of my Q, especially the I for QI at 15A, and this takes out the best lane he has. Enough said.
>Ross_Brown: CEIN 15A CINE +30 152
>Joshua_Sokol: EHMOQUV N4 MEH +38 291
#note I really messed up here though! I tunneled when I saw this play. It scores so well and forces Ross to make difficult decisions whenever he doesn't have any easy ones, like a bingo down the triple. But K5 MOVE, and even HOVE in the same spot are better plays, for sure.
>Ross_Brown: ?GILNRT 2C RINGLeT +65 217
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BNOQUV 4H QUONd.. +54 345
#note In the same idea as earlier, just score and run away with it.
>Ross_Brown: AOPSY O6 SOAPY +39 256
>Joshua_Sokol: BEFIKRV N10 BRIEF +45 390
>Ross_Brown: AAW 1A AWA +20 276
>Joshua_Sokol: AIKORVW 3A WOK +34 424
#note Or 15F AVOW for 33. Might be better. I saw (W)AVIER next turn with a likely E draw and that was enough.
>Ross_Brown: NU 5J NU +10 286
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIRSV 15L VASA +44 468
#note I could fish here, or I could play WAIVER/WAVIER, or I could play VISA/VASA. I think I didn't make the right choice, as it's harder to threaten to go out next turn if I play 4 tiles rather than 5, and Ross could still hit WATERLOO or something! This was wrong, and I realized it right after I played.
>Ross_Brown: AEELORT 14H LA.E +21 307
#note A3 (W)ELTER. -13 for Ross in the endgame, but...
>Joshua_Sokol: EINOR F1 I.NORE +9 477
#note Ross kindly noted my missed 5 at 6F. Oops. Other than that everything fell neatly into my pocket this game. Nothing more to be said.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (EORT) +8 485
