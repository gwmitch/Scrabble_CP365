#note ISC game, taken from 6/6/15
>zaxu: AAGPQTU 6F QU.P +35 35
>Avery: BEGORST E5 BERG +30 60
#note Quackle likes BEGOT by about 5 points, but I didn't like the O at E8. BEG is close to BEGOT, and I guess it makes sense since I'm keeping an S, but with a leave of ORST, I didn't think I'd be drawing into anything that scores much, so keeping the S for a bingo seemed like a better idea.
>zaxu: AABEGIT 7G T.AGI +16 51
#note EQUIPAGE is cool. ABRI is the best reasonable option in my opinion.
>Avery: ACIOSTW 5G C.OWS +36 96
>zaxu: ABEGLRT 8K TERGA +23 74
#note The best plays require zaxu to know CHOWSE. I didn't know that one either.
>Avery: AAHIMNT 8A AHIN. +30 126
>zaxu: BIILLOU 6K LILO +10 84
#note 4J OIL wins the sim. There really isn't a good option here, so I might have exchanged.

>Avery: DEEENOS 11B ENDO.SEE +68 304
>zaxu: ?DEEIOU 12B DUO +19 277
#note DUE is one point better, but I think both DUE and DUO are similar, since EIO? keeps a variety of vowels, but EEI? is more synergetic in my opinion.
>Avery: AAEFNOZ M2 ZONA. +28 332
#note There's a lot of better options here on static, but I liked this since it set up my A in multiple ways. The static winner is 4A ZOON, but the leave was so unpalatable that I couldn't bring myself to play it. 12I FAZE is second, and I somehow didn't see that. B8 FAZED is next, and that's decent in my opinion, but not optimal. AZO/AZON are fine options also, and since I'm keeping an F, it might be worth considering. With an X and a P unseen, I think it's good since there aren't many options to hit 11K (and I'm keeping one of the good tiles for it), but I also think it's a bit less useful than what ZONAL accomplishes. I stand by this still very strongly, but I want some opinions on what other people think is worth playing here.
>zaxu: ?EEIJUV 2J JEE. +36 313
#note I figured based on this play, he either didn't know JEEZE or was setting it up, though the latter was unlikely since I don't see why he wouldn't just play the 74 point play.
>Avery: ?AAEEFN 1L FANE +57 389
#note If he doesn't know JEEZE, I figured taking out the more obvious hook (AZONAL vs. JEEZE) and preserving column N so I can hit it later, considering I'm keeping an E and a blank.
>zaxu: ?ILOUVV 4A VI.L +22 335
#note B8 HIVED and N8 GUV are close to each other, but I think I'd play VULVA.
>Avery: ?AEINTY 14H ANYTImE +88 477
#note ANYTIME is valued at 90.0, NE is valued at 86.2. I figured I could draw one of the three unseen E's and hit it later. 88 points is too much to pass up right now, and AINTY? won't always draw a bingo (though it usually will).
>zaxu: ?DEOUVX 15L DOXy +54 389
>Avery: EEKNOPS N1 .ENE +54 531
#note This was not a planned out in two, but I figured the points are going to be the best endgame. It actually isn't, and NE is one point better. If he plays GUV or EVE, 12I SPOKEN is my out and it scores better.
>zaxu: EUV N8 .UV +15 404
#note His best choice is I9 EVE to not give me an out. The optimal endgame following EVE would be 13D SPIK, which I feel like I should know, but it looks completely unfamiliar. I would have played KOS, which is second.
