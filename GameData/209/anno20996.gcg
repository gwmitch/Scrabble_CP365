>Matt_Canik: CEIILNZ 5D ZINC. +32 66
#note After a play like RYE, maybe it's best to play REZ and force her to have a bingo starting in an S or through a W, or else open a TWS for me. But I wanted to bait the challenge on new words. I need to stop doing that!!!

>Matt_Canik: ?AEFIIL K2 LIEF +37 103
#note Prefer this to the bingo FILIAtE 9A - without a play through the Z it's really tough for her to do anything. FI(Z) was also there, but this scored better. Q likes FI(Z) by about a point.

#note I guess it's ok to bingo here for 62. I didn't notice EqUALED on the rack, and DEvALUE gave up places for her to re-open the board, which I wasn't too keen on. Still, I should probably just bingo.

#note PODESTA for 74 or this? This is certainly greedy and I should probably be content with a bingo without opening the 3x3 line, but I reall wanted to play two -HEAD bingos in two turns.

>Matt_Canik: AAEIUY G4 A.E +12 438
#note I missed a letter here, but I wanted to set up Y(ER) for a bunch. I already have BUNNY though, so that's sort of silly.

#note I have no idea what I played this turn but I scored 32 so maybe I collins-slipped and played NY or maybe made a play down the F row. I dunno.
