#note Almost spelled it right. Was happy to be very confident this was phony.
>Joshua_Sokol: ??ADNOU H2 NODUlAr +66 66
#note H3 AgrOUND looks best here. I just wanted to play something that blocked SRADDHA. Also, I looked for a while for words that slotted an E or something but saw none. RONDEAU slots the X, DUODENA slots the L, but nothing seemed better for slotting purposes (I would want to slot an E or an I), so NODUlAr it was. Hard to go through all the options here, it's better to just play something that works.
>Jason_Li: AADDHRS G1 DAH +22 22
#note 2B DARSHA(N) is the non-fishy play. I also prefer G7 HAD to this. It is another point. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EIJOPRS 6F JO.E +26 92
#note I wanted to get rid of my J here without giving Jason a very good lane, and JOLE was the only thing that accomplished that. Perhaps I should instead hold onto my J and play F2 PO.

#note Is there anything to be said about playing F6 (J)OTA here? (J)O for 19 actually bingos with 31 out of the 60 remaining tiles in the pool and takes out a lot of the easiest 7 lane to hit. I much much prefer POO's board control though. It's hard to defend fishing here, even though it is over a 1/2 shot. What would you play? Maybe controlling this board will be too difficult? I liked my chances though.

#note Seems E8 GU(R)GLET is the play. I did not know the word. This worked out though, blocking all of the spots for Jason's bingos. Dumb luck.

>Joshua_Sokol: EGGKPRU 8L .KEG +27 308
#note I want to score and take out the S now. Hopefully I can avoid him getting a bingo for one more turn.

#note ONE SPOT OVER!!!!!!!!!! This should have cost me dearly, but very luckily, the play Jason was supposed to have here didn't appear. I am setting up my case A, but as you will see, the A needing to be in second-to-last position is very weak compared to it being in third-to-last position.
>Jason_Li: CEIILRT 14A TIC +21 395
#note the X was in the bag! Ridiculous...
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEINNT O3 ACTIN. +25 411
#note I was very fortunate to have enough time to solve this endgame. I couldn't see any play that fit and scored with LEVA, but CENTAI is there. I didn't remember that six. That is tied with this play in the endgame. At first I thought I was going to tie with Jason by playing SCENTING or SCANTING, but I had misscored his play of (N)IXE by 3 points! That would have been a disaster...
