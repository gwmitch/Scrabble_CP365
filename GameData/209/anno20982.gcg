#note I wasn't sure between VANDA and VANDAL. VANDA wins a sim by a point and a half?

#note So many vowels unseen and his fish exasterbates that problem. I like this over (A)GONE. 
>Eric_Cahanin: OST I9 S.OT +28 379
#note He almost definitely has another S, probably another T also. 
>Matt_Canik: AEGLNOT H12 ALOE +18 376
#note With the unseen pool, I think ALOE is better than anything here. ALOE forces him to bingo through a vowel. With AAEIIIIU unseen in just 15 unseen tiles, I think that's a great thing to do (even though his last play telegraphs some extra consonants). 

Thoughts? I stand by this play, but I could be convinced that there's something better and I'd really like to hear what you have to say.

#note Wait.... did he really have THAT rack with THIS unseen pool, drawing into THAT?
