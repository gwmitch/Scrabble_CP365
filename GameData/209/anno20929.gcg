>Joel_Horn: INTT 8G TINT +8 8
#note Context: if I win this game and if I lose this game, I play Jason in the finals. If I win this game by enough to overcome Jason's spread, I could still win the tournament if I lose against Jason. In that sense I should sort of be playing for spread here.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFINNTX 9H FEINT +19 19
#note I play this almost immediately, since it sets up my X quite nicely. If Joel hits J10 next turn, I'm likely to have something for 30+ at 8L. The standard play here seems to be H8 (I)NFIX. 7F NIXE is also alright. I prefer this, since it has all of the aspects of a good setup.
>Joel_Horn: AANUV L4 AVAUN. +20 28
>Joshua_Sokol: CENQUUX 10J XU +53 72
#note interesting draw. A good one for sure.
>Joel_Horn: EHI 5J HI.E +20 48
>Joshua_Sokol: CEKMNQU 8L .ECK +30 102
#note This turn, I considered M2 QUE(E)N for 32, keeping the interesting MCK combo and opening up easy points through the Q, but getting rid of a clunky tile as well. Then I considered (N)ECK, keeping the Q in my arsenal with the U, possibly getting the chance to play QU(E)EN again next turn, although that is unlikely. I liked keeping the Q and blocking off part of the board well. But the benefits of QU(E)EN might have been underestimated, such as stopping Joel from scoring down lane N with different racks than those that would score after QUEEN. Given that particular factor it seems QUEEN is a risk, but perhaps one worth taking.
>Joel_Horn: HP 7K H.P +18 66
#note Joel took a while here, I started to smell a blank.
>Joshua_Sokol: MNQRRUU 6H RUM +24 126
>Joel_Horn: OY 4I YO +13 79
#note again taking a while to make a fishing-type play for few points. The blank seems to be on Joel's rack almost for certain now, maybe even two of them.
>Joshua_Sokol: AFLNQRU M1 QUAL. +30 156
#note I considered 3 plays here, M1 QUAL(E), M1 QUAR(E) and 04 QUAR(K). I figured since Joel likely had a bingo-ey rack that tended toward inflexible (this is a range I had put him on, correct me if I could be wrong), setting up QAT or QIS was perhaps beneficial to me. So I took the extra points. Again, unsure of this play. FNR seemed better than FLN, and it is.
>Joel_Horn: ?ACIILR N8 .RItICAL +76 155
#note It took Joel a while, but he finally found his only bingo.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFIMNOR 15J REFI.M +45 201
#note Too bad FERMION didn't play! Here I just went for points, and slightly favored turnover, since SSSS? being unseen at this stage of the game made it stronger to play more tiles. Normally SS? are gone midgame. ENOR isn't good on this board, so no need to keep the better bingo leave. Joel didn't know this word, but didn't challenge.
>Joel_Horn: IS 1M .IS +36 191
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEENOO N4 ADO +21 222
#note There are three plays that make sense here. O6 OA(K)ED to leave as few vowels as possible, N4 ADO (my play) to score well and leave something passable, and 14J ODE, to leave something more flexible. With a few different options, I just chose the one that scored the best.

>Joel_Horn: NZ 10M Z.N +12 249
#note Joel really didn't like making this play, understandably. I wonder what else he had.

#note Whew! There it is. 
>Joel_Horn: ?ADEGIR C4 REGAIn.D +60 333
#note Joel couldn't find his higher scoring options here, but it's kind of a lost game regardless. Maybe he has to play 11A REDIA. I doubt he can win after that anyway though.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEGIOOS 11A BO.IES +30 390
#note -2 to /8 BI(T)E or 8A OB(I).
>Joel_Horn: DDELLTY 8A DE.TY +30 363
#note but Joel had no time left, so -1! (B)ELLY is a point better.
