>Charles_Reinke: AAIRRTU D9 TIARA +16 50
#note My highest-scoring option. This play also encourages Maureen to play at C13 for easy points and open up a TWS. But RU is not a good leave; H6 TI(M)ARAU looks to be best.
>Maureen_Kennerk: Q 6F Q. +31 96
>Charles_Reinke: EGHIORU E3 HUG +24 74
>Maureen_Kennerk: CGL 10B CL..G +18 114
>Charles_Reinke: EFIOORU C7 FOU. +16 90
#note C13 FOU is the most obvious choice at first glance, and I spent a long time thinking about it. In the end, I decided I didn't want Maureen to score 18 points on row 15 while leaving a closed board.
>Maureen_Kennerk: ESX 9G SEX +37 151
#note Scored as 29. The X must not have gotten doubled.
>Charles_Reinke: ?EGIORR 13C f.IRGOER +72 162
#note Perhaps 14A GORsIER just so I get a shot at a TWS.
>Maureen_Kennerk: DEO 12H DOE +15 166
>Charles_Reinke: ELNPTVW H12 ..WN +24 186
#note H8 (ME)LT(DO)WN. I was halfway there, but really, I stand almost a 0% chance of seeing a play like that. Other plays are better too.
>Maureen_Kennerk: INO 10I ION +14 180
>Charles_Reinke: BELOPTV 11J VET +23 209
#note Getting fancy to set up my O.
>Maureen_Kennerk: ?EEOSSU B2 OUtSEES +73 253
>Charles_Reinke: BDELMOP A1 ELM +21 230
#note M10 POMBE+), unless I can find BE(HAVIORS). Here I was too attached to my O. There's also not any good way for Maureen to use the A1 TWS, so using it shouldn't be a priority for me.
>Maureen_Kennerk: DEILT 14J TILED +26 279
>Charles_Reinke: BDIOPPU M10 BOPP.D +33 263
#note Keep in mind that, in reality, I'm eight points closer than the score indicates because of the earlier scoring error. Also, after this play, my score jumps from 230 to 266 despite the score for the play being recorded correctly as 33. Time to enroll in remedial math classes.

#note I have to block Maureen's 8L KI(N)D. If I want to make things interesting, I can play 8L RU(N)E saving 15K TI(D)AL for 29 and out. If she failed to block with (D)AK and played somewhere else, I would win, then lose in a recount if we did one.
