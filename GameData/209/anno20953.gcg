#note This is already shaping up to be another closed board. This play doesn't actually open it up that much, though, since AECIUM doesn't take an S and the letters IUM aren't particularly good for eights. It's probably better to leave the A and R in FARTED open and play F4 EMU.

#note Sort of sets up two triples? Nothing is very good here.

#note Missed the three best plays: 13I PERTLY/PELTRY and 15A PLYERS. That's strange because I spent a long time here looking for good plays like that. This play sucks since it doesn't do anything for the board and doesn't keep an extremely high-value leave like ERST or EPRST.

#note Almost missed this. That would have been a disaster.

#note The Q is bad on this board. There is nowhere to play QI or other short Q dumps and only one U unseen. I missed H1 Z(O)STER but the chances of me getting Q-stuck after that are way too high. I also didn't want to enter a complicated endgame where both of us are trying to dodge the Q, which means no exchange. I think this play is good because it bocks the most dangerous TWS.

#note Bad mistake again. M3 ZEBU is an almost guaranteed win but I missed the word. My thought here was that I retained 1C LEZ, which is more likely to stay open now that Nedd has an easier TWS to hit.

#note Nedd played me extremely tight all three games. Hopefully I learn how to better deal with that playstyle before the next time I play him.
