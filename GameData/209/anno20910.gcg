#note I made this play only because Jason Li taught me that the S is just another tile, not something to hold onto for dear life. It's the only thing that scores, reduces Wayne's scoring and board-opening opportunities, and retains an acceptable leave. The other play I could make is 11G IODIDS for 22, but that U is really unpalatable, and I just blow the board wide open for Wayne without much of a guarantee in terms of being able to hit back if he bingos. The other option besides ODI(O)US/IOD(O)US or IODIDS is simply to exchange, but there's no reason to do that. I can't retain anything very good and I'm just giving up points I could score and make my lead even bigger. This is an insightful position on when to shed your S.

#note I could exchange here too. But HAVEN opened the bottom of the board for good, so it's not the worst thing to play this. It's not the best thing either, and I hesitated for a while, but the only other sensible option is to play N2 YA for 23. The problem is that I cannot respond to anything Wayne does after YA. Much of my strategy in this part of the game was to be able to respond to Wayne's plays in the best way possible. Leaving myself with OIDIA for next turn is not the way to do that. I don't want to play this at 9D because Wayne doesn't necessarily have one-pointers here, and he could hit me hard on the triple word score.
>Wayne_Barclay: EHIMRU 5B HUMERI +24 121
#note A lucky, lucky break. I don't know what Wayne kept here, but unless it was another I, 3C RHEUM, and even 2J HUM(O)R seem like better plays, just given how much they score.

#note An extremely good draw for me to AY.
>Wayne_Barclay: EILSTZ 15F ZESTIL. +57 178
#note Really not even close to the worst that can happen.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADILRRS 14G RAIL +16 250
#note I missed a good play here in 9E LIDAR. I was not familiar with the word. I chose this to take out easy scoring at J14, although 9F LIAR is also a good option.

#note Or do I exchange?
>Wayne_Barclay: ?CEENOR B2 REC.OsEN +78 270
#note Wayne said he didn't play this quickly (he was running quite low on time) cause he didn't think it hit the double word.
>Joshua_Sokol: DELNRST 8A L.NDER +27 288
#note I'm in trouble here. The other blank is out and I'm no longer in the lead. I have to hope I draw the blank and/or that Wayne screws up.
