#note Kept ARE instead of joining the bandwagon exchange 5 here because I wanted to add flexiblity. The sim even likes it better on 3ply, on a turn in which the sim wouldn't be unreliable, so there's that- no static values for me. R and S are probably the only two bingo consonants i'd keep AE with- V, Z, X, are the others- not that I'd keep V on an exchange though.

#note Clearly the middle ground between fishing and scoring. Q likes F(E) for 5, that's crazy. Keep in mind I don't want to do that against a significantly lower player. I also played FUME for defensive purposes- it makes my S very valuable on this board and other tiles less valuable.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEHM 11J AHEM +22 55
>Quackle: AIIOPRS 10L POI +15 40
#note Same reasoning as last turn- The S is now worth a ton, and other tiles are worth almost nothing.

#note I felt this was forced, and usually, it was forced. But I missed PEAK, which is pretty damn clever. This is second. (-1.8%)

#note Nothing else worth considering.

#note This looks decent. Cuts his bingo% and score more than any other play, which is still something I want against someone I can outplay. ARIARY opens the board, and is probably the only overall better play, maybe it opens enough to the point where I should not worry about cutting score.

>Quackle: ABGIIRR H4 BARI. +17 143
#note Missed BRIARY. This might be better anyways. Tough call. This just leaves so much breathing room on the board while BRIARY does open things, but less. BRIARY ditches the R, which is probably the 3rd most useful bingo tile behind the S and E. This scores 5 less. Sounds about dead even, and sims about dead evenly.

#note Saw LAZING/RAZING, but I felt this was the best path towards winning the game. Q concurs. This isn't really too hard of a turn either.

#note Not much error this game, pretty well played. I seemed to get very discouraged at the immediate bagging early on, but I didn't let it bog me down, and found a way to win. Plenty of these type of games are bound to come up anyways. This was a game without very many complex positions that was still fairly interesting.
