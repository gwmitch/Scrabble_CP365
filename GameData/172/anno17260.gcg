#note Happy to find this, although there are five bingos available that put the Y at 8L and score 78.

#note Saw the play of XI for 36 at C9 but my focus was on closing down the board, not creating more hot spots. Quackle says this is wrong, but not by much.
>Josh_Kopczak: GO J10 GO +20 192
>Steve_Grob: AEIIKLO C9 KI +24 302
#note Did I say I was in favor of closing the board down? That was last turn. Same play at G13 scores an extra point and is less dangerous. Quackle also likes14D ALOIN or ELOIN and all four plays rate about the same.
>Josh_Kopczak: BILN B10 BLIN +23 215
>Steve_Grob: ACEILOV A6 LAEVO +30 332
#note Second best to the cute interior play of VAI(R) at C12 for 27 while holding the O-hook for later.
>Josh_Kopczak: AEU I7 U.EA +10 225
>Steve_Grob: CEGIIOR B2 CORGI +24 356
#note That interior spot is now open for the C and COI(R).
>Josh_Kopczak: ENNO C3 NEON +20 245
>Steve_Grob: DEEILRS D2 RED +19 375
#note The thinking here was to set up my I, as there's only one other one out there, and to limit what the blank could be used for there, if Josh had it. I probably don't make this play if the score is closer. Q plays D5 DE. A quick 2-play sim is showing my play to be superior, but has two other plays above it: D1 LIED for 23, or 14D ELD for 19. This is like choosing what necklace Kate Upton should be wearing, however. It doesn't really matter.
>Josh_Kopczak: EF 14F FE. +29 274
#note The reason for playing ELD or DE(N) on row 14 last turn now becomes apparent.
>Steve_Grob: AEIJLQS A12 QI +44 419
>Josh_Kopczak: AEINRTT 9C ..NE +20 294
>Steve_Grob: AEJLRRS 2D .AJ +26 445
#note Taking out the highest scoring bingo lane. Incorrect, according to Q's c-player. It likes 13G R(A)J.
>Josh_Kopczak: TU F2 .UT +10 304
#note About now I'm wishing I had played JARLS last turn, and given Josh only one chance at bingoing.

>Steve_Grob: EGLRRST H3 GRE. +9 454
#note I saw the possibility of (T)HEMATIc bingo possibility, and decided to block, but missed the unblockable seven.
