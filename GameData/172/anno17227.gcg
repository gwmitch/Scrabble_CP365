#note Wasn't sure between this and HARM. Quackle gives basically the same valuation for both.

#note Interesting, I instantly played this, not considering either play of FON, but they're both decent lays. FON C13 seems better because I can play KRONE or an NKER word on col J next turn. FON's strengths are in better scoring for me and worse scoring for Chris next turn, where KRONEN's strength is in its extra 10 points.

#note With the blank in hand, I felt keeping some lanes open and going for a bingo was strong. Also thought about OF and MA. FORAM is also an option, I suppose. I think this approach might be totally off what I actually want to do here though. If I just play OF I can keep things tight and will tend to just win by outscoring with my strong scoring potential and balanced rack. FORMULA is much more entropic, opening up hooks, keeping lanes and only keeping two tiles, leaving more to chance, especially with IIIIIUUW out. I can definitely bingo sometimes with OF too. Think this was a mistake.

#note Missed a good spot for ILIA -- E12 seems worth it for sure here.
