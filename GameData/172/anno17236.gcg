>Winter: EJU 8G JEU +20 20
>Jeremy: BDHIRST 9H THIRD +24 24
#note I7 DUB by 9.5 pts
>Winter: ADEI 8L IDEA +22 42
>Jeremy: BFORRSY 7L FORB +27 51
>Winter: AIV 10F VIA +17 59
>Jeremy: GINRSSY 11H SYING +22 73
#note SYE# SYED# SYEING#. SYING*.  sigh.  the top play is M6 Y(OD)S.  I little disappointed I blocked my own SYRING(E)S with FORB last turn.
>Winter: EW 10J WE +30 89
>Jeremy: DEINORS O7 ..NDEIROS +89 162
>Jeremy: DEINORS --  -89 73
#note 12K DO is the play here.  I forgot DEBONAIR is the bingo in BANDEIRO*.  BANDEIRA#+ is good of course.  INDORSE bingo #1 won't play.
>Winter: AF 9N FA +16 105
>Jeremy: DEINORS 12K DO +17 90
>Winter: ACS 13K SAC +20 125
>Jeremy: DEINRSW L11 ...D +6 96
#note WINDERS REWINDS blocked.  Turn #2 with a natural unplayable 7 on board.  H7 W(ETAS)# sims best, but I really like GOAD. It's hard to block.
>Winter: ??BUUVY 15J BUsY +14 139
#note I can't remember what Winter said his rack was on this turn, but if it was the rack I entered, this is actually the correct play if he knows I am holding EINRS. It also telegraphs Winter is holding the other blank.
>Jeremy: EEINRSW I11 .EW +13 109
#note WEINERS NEWSIER WEINERS, cock blocked.  Turn #3.
>Winter: ?ETV 14F VETs +23 162
#note The strategy here must have been bafflement to throw me off my game. scored as 21.
>Jeremy: CEIINRS M6 C.. +6 115
#note SERICIN IRENICS SIRENIC#. 4th bingo rack blocked. Quackle suggests E11 ICIER.  I forgot all about the E(VETs)# hook.  COD is to open the ECOD# hook.  INIERS isn't so bad to fish with, but it's 10 points back of ICIER.
>Winter: EIPZ 5J PIZE +37 199
#note scored as 36.
>Jeremy: EIINORS 6E IRONIES +69 184
>Winter: UX 5E XU +38 237
>Jeremy: EMOORRT 15G MO +22 206
#note TROOZ makes sense, but I figured if I left the H and L columns Winter will have to open to get points.
>Winter: AHILNTT N11 PEON +18 255
>Winter: AHILNTT --  -18 237
#note get that SAC O' ---- off the board
>Jeremy: EKMORRT N11 MOKE +30 236
#note L3 MOZ# wins the sim by a few pts. here.
>Winter: OP O11 OP +18 255
>Jeremy: AILORRT L3 RI. +24 260
#note 14L (D)O(E)R sims best for the leave, but leaves mean nothing if the board isn't going to be open.
>Winter: IL O14 LI +8 263
>Jeremy: AHLORTT 3J HO.AL +16 276
#note Not wanting to give up a TWS to Winter here, and in case of blockage, be able to open in H column.  Quack likes 4H THOL(I)#.  My play here is pretty bad, especially with more Ts unseen.  H1 ATTORN maybe?
>Winter: EGN 2M NEG +14 277
>Jeremy: AAARRTT 1K TAATA +33 309
>Jeremy: GOQRRTT (challenge) +5 314
#note Simming out many plies, TAATA# wins 67%, not bad, but you could be in trouble if you draw the Q. 1L RATA# is 76%, better Q insurance keeping AT, and leaving one playable spot to drop QAT.
>Winter: ES N1 ...ES +21 298
>Jeremy: GOQRRTT 4F GOT +9 323
#note Quackle says 4I TO here can win 52.78% of the time. Maybe it forces an endgame that makes it impossible for both sides to go out?  GOT flat out loses, and every other move pretty much sucks.
>Winter: EN J5 ..N +5 303
>Jeremy: ELQRRT G3 L. +3 326
#note the game isn't winnable any more.  H1 TELT# nets 10 points more if the endgame is played right.
>Winter: AELNNU 2I NU +11 314
>Jeremy: EQRRT 1H RE +8 334
#note E14 ER/E(VETs) is 2 pts better.
>Winter: AELN 4N .N +3 317
>Jeremy: QRT G13 R.. +6 340
#note Apparently this is my only play.
>Winter: AEL F12 LA.E +14 331
#note scored as 12
>Winter:  (QT) +22 353
#note Score recorded as 340-348. 20 turns at 17.4 points per turn for Winter. 19 turns of 17.9 points per turn for me.  These are not expert Collins numbers. I did not recount.  Normally I would have, but I felt a little exhausted after this.  Winter's tiles played per turn: 2.47  Mine: 2.83  Winter played 47 tiles, I played 51.
