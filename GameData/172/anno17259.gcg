#note MACHO or MACHO in the same spot for 31, or (S)OCMAN at 15J FOR 39. Q likes them all about the same.

>Steve_Grob: ADHOSTU N6 HAD +33 293
#note Quackle points out the nifty HOAT(ZIN) extension, but likes HOD or HAD. I chose the latter due to the tile pool.

#note Setting up a bingo line.
>Steve_Grob: DIRRSTY 13A YIRRS +27 346
#note While I make plenty of other errors, I don't think I make very many strategical errors. This may me one, although Q likes DIRTS in the same spot. Trying to understand that would take more time than I have available, and I may never understand it. My thinking was to go for points and try to outscore her, even if she did bingo. DRYS here, probably better.
>Dorcas_Alexander: ?EJNORU A7 JOURNE.s +104 362
#note Other than a triple-triple, this is about the worst that could happen.
>Steve_Grob: ADHIMTW 2D HAW +27 373
#note Q takes out the hot spot for the unseen X, playing DIM at H1. I chose this over MATH at L9 (never seeing the same play at D8 for 4 more points), setting up my T, overlooking the G and K hooks. To take advantage of the spot, Dorcas would have to empty the bag, but this is another strategical error.
>Dorcas_Alexander: AFRT 1A FRAT +32 394
#note The F also plays at 1E making FART the right thing to do.
>Steve_Grob: DGIIKMT H1 DIM +22 395
#note I managed to make the right play despite serious time trouble. (I finished the game w 5 seconds on my clock).
>Dorcas_Alexander: ABETVX 12J .BEX +26 420
>Steve_Grob: GIKT L2 K... +8 403
#note Time trouble bites me here. Thinking was to block TAV, but overlooked VAT. 2J KIT scores 21 and does both, even tho it doesn't win.
