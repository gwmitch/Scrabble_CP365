>Michael: AGMU 8G GAUM +14 14
#note Since I couldn't focus while playing Collins versus Emanuel I decided to stimulate my mind by playing Michael at the same time.
>Josh: GIKOTVW 9F VOW +19 19
#note well since I missed MIKVAH recently I was bound to miss MIKVOT at some point I guess. VO(M)IT is also probably a better play than this, especially since there is a slight possibility this was a XU setup (he took a while to play this) and since it's possible he doesn't know VOMITO.
>Michael: FLOT 10H LOFT +21 35
>Josh: FGIKRT -FGIK +0 19
#note I forgot my last consonant. With no I in play I decided not to keep one.
>Michael: GU F9 .UG +9 44
>Josh: EJORRST -JR +0 19
#note I wasn't aware of how ridiculously strong EORRST was. I have a whopping 80%+ bingo percentage after exchanging the J and I wouldn't miss any of the 7s I draw into, compared to a more mediocre 65% chance after my choice of exchange. I didn't like playing JO(G) both because of the possible rack trouble next turn with a non-vowel draw and because my opponents always seem to have an O after I play something like JO(G).
>Michael: BCDDLOT J6 DO. +10 54
#note whaddyaknow, hell-O!
>Josh: EINORST 12F STONIER +74 93
#note I did manage to hit something, fortunately. I preferred this because it gives him no floaters and restricts one of the quadrants on this very open board.
>Michael: LU 11D LU. +8 62
#note Michael breaks the chain that STONIER set upon the bottom left quadrant and sets up yet another S hook.
>Josh: AEGHNNX 11K HEX +40 133
#note whereas I hope he hasn't hit what he anticipated
>Michael: CDI H12 .DIC +21 83
#note hooray for me
>Josh: AGINNTW C5 WANTING +69 202
#note Huge HOORAY
>Michael: AEIKMST B1 MISTAKE +119 202
#note So many bad puns to make about this
>Josh: EEFQSVY A7 FEY +33 235
#note felt this reduced Michael's score more than D4 FEY, which scores one more point
>Michael: ?ACDERS K2 DAnCERS +81 283
#note Among known words missed, D1 CRADlES, and among words that are way too low-prob for Michael's sake, 15H CARDCASE.
>Josh: ?AEEQSV 2A Q. +11 246
#note I didn't have to do this. I had D4 VEES for 34. also this placement may reduce his scoring options but G14 Q(I) doesn't yield any plays such as A(Q)UA for 59 that steal the game away. This placement was chosen because the I at 14H could be useful for me, but looking over this turn again I am confident that D4 VEES is more likely to win games for me.
>Michael: ABNORY D1 BARONY +44 327
#note I hope this play didn't cause me to overvalue VEES in my analysis of last turn...
>Josh: ?AEERSV 15H .REVASsE +89 335
#note I somehow missed (C)lEAVERS. I think I was too focused on the preendgame against Emanuel, cause that game was very close. I hope he would challenge this.
>Michael: EOPR L1 PORE +25 352
>Josh: AHJ J1 HAJ +31 366
#note I'm convinced this was the right play even though I don't remember what my leave was.
>Michael: EILNOPR O8 LEPORIN. +83 435
>Josh: BEEIINZ 14L ZEI. +41 407
>Michael: EIL M3 LEI +30 465
#note Michael had me note that he should have held his E here somehow. I don't blame him, he was very fixated on making sure I couldn't bingo out on him.
>Josh: ABEINOT 1D .OBETA. +42 449
#note And it's a good thing he was! This rack forms the word NIOBATE, that would have played at N2. 

Quackle cannot find my best endgame play here, but it's a good thing I could. Those robots and their dumb questions... 
"BOBETAH forms an unacceptable word; make play anyway?" 
Yes. 
"If committed, should BOBETAH be challenged off the board?"
That's a stupid question, ducky!
>Michael: ADITU A2 .UAD +28 493
#note D9 TU(L)ADI uses all of Michael's tiles. It's worth noting that had Michael kept his E last turn, he would have been in the position to play a killer E(Q)UID this turn. But alas, some things just slip away...
>Josh: IN M9 NI. +11 460
#note 2D (A)NI and 2F IN score more than 11, but I must've been too content with having created "the offspring of a male bobcat and a female cheetah" to care.
>Josh:  (IT) +4 464
