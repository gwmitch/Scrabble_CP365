#note The only way to get the Y on a DLS is 8H TONEY, but the leave is so inferior that YOU is well worth the 12-point sacrifice.

#note I knew BUGGIER would rank higher statically, but I rejected it since the placement of the E at 12I must drastically increase Quackle's average score next turn. Quackle much prefers I7 BUG and 7E GIB over BUGGER, but I prefer BUGGER to unload both G's and to go for more turnover for the remaining blanks.

>Mack: CINSUWX 11E WINC. +29 193
#note I considered this and 14H TUX, but opted to play WINCE in order to set up my X and to unload the W. There is a reasonable chance Quackle will obstruct my setup, but in the worst case scenario I still have TUX next turn. After TUX, on the other hand, if Quackle blocks WINCE I could be left with very little to do. Quackle concurs, and WINCE sims just over 3% better than TUX.
>Quackle: ?EOPQTU 12A QUOTE +53 246
>Mack: HIJRSUX 10F XI +52 245
#note Normally I would always keep an I over a U, but I feel the JU combo is superior to JI, especially considering the abundance of I's remaining in the pool. Also, XI retains 14F JUT for next turn, as well as possibilities for plays like C9 JUROR if I draw another specific tile. IJRSH does not accomplish nearly as much on this board as UJRSH; another benefit of keeping the U instead of the I is the presence of the Q on A12.
>Quackle: ??FPRUV C9 FaV.R +28 274
#note Very dubious choice by Quackle here. In my opinion, this is by no means enough points to use one of the blanks for, and I would definitely play C11 POUF here.

#note This scores equally with L1 DISRATE, but I will need another bingo to win so want to keep the board as volatile as possible. STRIATED maintains two bingo lanes, whereas after DISRATE there will be little hope for bingoing again after Quackle plays down the L or M columns.
>Quackle: AADELTV K1 DELTA +34 459
>Mack: EEINOOS 7I ...E +6 404
#note At this point, my only hope is to fish off one tile and draw a bingo in two spots. The tile to fish off is clearly a vowel; fishing off the I yields no sevens with the remaining pool; an O yields only EOSINES; an E fish yields only ISOTONE/TOONIES. If I simultaneously fish off an O and open a lane with a play like 9K BO, Quackle will just block it with M7 VITAE or something similar and I will lose as EOSINES does not play under STRIATED. If I fish off an E, however, a draw of a T will result in an unblockable bingo since TOONIES plays at 15J. The highest scoring E fish that opens a new lane is 7I BARE; if I draw the T, the game will be a 489-489 tie after Quackle plays 1K DIVES/DIVAS/DEVAS. Though Quackle can block the row 15 lane, it is not worth it since TOONIES at M1 scores only five points less than at 15J. Although the fish of 2J PEE blocks Quackle's 1K plays, it allows L4 AVES which will win by 3 for Quackle after I bingo out. All other fishes lose after the same sequence that occurred in the game. BARE never wins, but at least it gives me a 1/8=12.5% shot at a tie; as it turned out this game, BARE paid off.
