>Jim_Burlant: ?BHIIJU -BIJU +0 0
#note Right tiles, wrong play.  I know BIJOU is good, I know its two back hooks.  And, just as it took me years to finally stop missing JIAO and RIOJA, I still generally find BIJOU with only slightly more frequency than Rush Limbaugh espouses left-wing politics.  To show you how much trouble I have finding BIJOU no matter how often I revisit the 5-letter J words, my scoresheet read "exch BIJU" and it never occurred to me at the time that BIJ(O)U dumped those very letters.   I only realized this FOUR TURNS LATER!
>Ed_Gowash: ALTZ D8 .ALTZ +34 60
#note And what's he doing with this if I find BIJOU on the prevoius turn?
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEHII 11C E.HICIAn +74 74
#note The only playable  bingos are this word here or at G1.  What's riskier?  An E in the 2x2 in 7th position for 67?  Or giving up a juicy S hook for 74 at K11?  With both choices giving potentially huge comebacks, I felt I needed to take the points.   Quackle agrees - this is my best choice.  For reference, E8 OHIA for 25  and 10B HILI for 15 sim 6 and 3 points better than G1 ETHICIAN for 67.
>Ed_Gowash: IT 12D .IT +19 79
>Jim_Burlant: AEENRUY 12I YEAN +20 94
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Couldn't think of YUAN in the same location.  
>Ed_Gowash: ES K11 S.E +32 111
>Jim_Burlant: AELNRUX 7F XU +22 116
>Ed_Gowash: GI G11 .IG +21 132
>Jim_Burlant: ABEILNR I11 ..E +7 123
#note Reasonable play; the sim indicates that the top choices are a matter of style preference:  WALTZER, EN(WOUND), or RE(WOUND) are at the top of the sim - this is not quite 3 points down on ENWOUND and it wins within 1-1/2% of ENWOUND.  
>Ed_Gowash: AEILMRT 6G MALTIER +66 198
>Jim_Burlant: ABEILNR 10D .AB +28 151
#note No bingoes play.  This or 5J ALB are best; I'd make this play again.  18% to win.
>Ed_Gowash: BO 5K BO +18 216
>Jim_Burlant: EILNORS C2 NEROLIS +76 227
#note Now THAT's lucky - fishing an S on a two-tile pick.  This is definitely my best bingo - the other bingo options (14A NEROLIS or M4 LORINERS) give up too much either in board position or score.    Back in the game, at 42%.
>Ed_Gowash: EFLT 4L FELT +28 244
>Jim_Burlant: CDEEIKO O4 .ICKED +39 266
#note Best.  Other options worth consideration are also 4C REDOCK , O4 TOKED, and 2A CONKED.
>Ed_Gowash: AMR H13 ARM +19 263
>Jim_Burlant: AEOOQSW N8 WOO +16 282
#note Since the EOOSW leave with QAT J4  seemed really hideous (especially if I drew a U), I thought my best bet was to unload WOO, leave myself a reasonably balanced combo and take away the easy 7's since I haven't seen this opponent show much proficiency in finding 8's.  Q says I should prioritize getting rid of the Q with J4 QAT.  QAT only nominally wins the sim (51.54% winning chances, this wins 50.88 and sims 0.8 points down as the runner up).  I'd make this play again.
>Ed_Gowash: GIN D8 .....ING +23 286
>Jim_Burlant: AEJNOQS 13C Q. +22 304
#note I saw the spot open up and auto-piloted the Q dump, since  my only options for unloading the Q if this spot disappeared were 11-point Q dumps at 7B and H10.  Quackle says I should take the points with D1 JONES or JANE.  I can see the logic to that - turnover with the blank unseen, not to mention the 50 scoreboard points.  And if I score well, I may have enough margin to get away with dumping the Q for 11 if it comes to that.  That said, this decision worked out.
>Ed_Gowash: EORU 15A ROU.E +18 304
>Jim_Burlant: AEJNOPS D1 JANE +46 350
#note I may have gotten it wrong last time, but this one's on target.  It's either this or JONES.  Keeping the S paid big dividends for me, as you'll see in a second.
>Ed_Gowash: EFRS N8 ...FERS +26 330
>Jim_Burlant: AOPSTUV 1D .AUPS +42 392
#note Or JOUST in the same location - the play is clearly to extend the J to the triple.
>Ed_Gowash: DOY B3 YOD +19 349
>Jim_Burlant: AEHOTTV A1 THETA +43 435
#note Looking at that pool, I don't have to worry about defending bingoes from A8.  So, take the points.
>Ed_Gowash: ?DGIPRV 8A mI...... +33 382
#note UNWISDOM is WAY past any probability range I have studied, and I didn't know that this was phony.  I saw how many points I was going to be getting from his rack and didn't want to take the chance on costing myself more spread.  
>Jim_Burlant: NOV H3 NOV. +8 443
#note Outside of missing a 5-letter J word on my first time that I almost always miss, I'm otherwise happy with how I played this one; no glaring mistakes beyond that.
>Jim_Burlant:  (DGPRV) +24 467
