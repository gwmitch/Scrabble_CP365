#note Ugh.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGILNS F1 LINAGES +75 171
#note Best.  Played here to keep the board open.  Always best to take the hardest fit first when needing a comeback.

#note It's always salt in the wound to lose to someone who makes a word knowledge mistake like this.  Maybe Kenji's "play a phony and lose" idea has merit.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEEORR O8 .vERDOER +80 262
#note Wow, what a draw.  This game is crazy.
>Richard_Senzel: GHINR 13M RH. +12 281
>Ryan_Fischer: IOSSTUU -OUU +0 262
#note I'm keeping both Ses, keys to the board now (save the Os, yeah).
>Richard_Senzel: JR 10J J.R +26 307
>Ryan_Fischer: INOSSTT G4 SOT +15 277
#note I should've put STOTINKI -> STOTIN(S) together.  But no.  I guess no one to blame but me now.  Made a great comeback and blew it.  Not that those two words are part of the same, but they're similar.  A bit out of my range, still, though.  I didn't play SOT low 'cause that would kill my S advantage.  So, up top.  TOST is one more point.
>Richard_Senzel: FN 2E F.N +8 315
>Ryan_Fischer: EINSTUY N10 YE +28 305
#note I saw EU(TAX)Y.  Get rid of the U for -8 points.  Or just play YE for a subpar leave.  Tough decision.  When in doubt take the points.
>Richard_Senzel: EG J12 .EG +11 326
#note I initially thumbed my nose at this move, not thinking much of it.  I have the Ses.  What, does he think it takes an S?  I didn't think he was setting up an -ING lane, which was more plausible.  I didn't give it the respect it deserved, thinking my lane would win out.
>Ryan_Fischer: DINSTUW N1 WUD +21 326
#note Better to play for 19.  This was a goof.  Careless.
>Richard_Senzel: FLO 1L FO.L +42 368
>Ryan_Fischer: AINOSTU N6 OU. +5 331
>Richard_Senzel: BEEINRZ 14C BREEZIN. +72 440
#note If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.  Second power tile bingo played on me.  It's definitely not as hilariously painful as the next two that happen.
>Ryan_Fischer: AIINSTW I2 ANTI... +15 346
#note Okay, I don't really get to be that mad, missing STOTINS, but still, it hurts losing to someone who gets a lucky 100 point bingo early and plays a phony 4 as egregious as ICER*.  INTI(MAS) is the best play here.
