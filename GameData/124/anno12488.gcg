>Christian_O.B: ?AEOORZ L1 ZERO +56 79
>Albert_Martono: EGINOSS 2G SOIGN.ES +76 130
#note Albert only have bingo 2F GENOISES 65, G8 LOGINESS or G8 LIGNOSES for 61. However his best play 1I GINZOES for 51 points leave S. I was about to call hold but his confidence play made me sure he play legal word.......T.T
>Christian_O.B: ??ANOTT 1B TOTANus +72 151
#note I know I can play better bingo here but that was the first that come to my head, since I have to use the triple to avoid Albert made another high play... owever I missed another high scoring spot!!!! Best one 1C MONTANT for 78 points.
>Albert_Martono: AEJS 1L .EAS +43 173
#note He told me after game that if I didn't block he will play JA there. But 43 points still, quite painful....
>Christian_O.B: AHINORW 9H HOW +27 178
#note Quackle agree this one is best, but what I got next.....
>Albert_Martono: EJQUU D1 .UQUE +28 201
#note Quite dumping move, quite painful.....
>Christian_O.B: AAIINRR F8 .AIR +9 187
#note Unduplicating all.... Quackle suggest E4 RAIA for 14 leave IRN
>Albert_Martono: BEJN E10 BENJ +34 235
>Christian_O.B: ADINRSY 8K YAIRD +47 234
#note 12C INNYARDS for 87!!!! Don't know INNYARDS. 5A SYNEDRIA was good and reachable vocabulary... Just a simple SARDINE+Y... Need to study 7 letters stem move often!!!!
>Albert_Martono: AAEIPTV E4 PAV +24 259
#note He told missed ADAPTIVE after game
>Christian_O.B: AEGIMNS B1 .EGMINAS +76 310
#note M8 IMAGINES for 78!!!! Completely didn't realize it. Adding more silly thing, I know SEAMING+R = GERMAINS, and spotted it in N6. and also know GERMAINES is legal. But what the heck I din't see 11D playthrough ER GERMAINES for 74. The most fatal mistake was, TEGMINA WAS LIKE SOIGNEE, IT DOESN'T TAKE S HOOK... TEAMINGS was the only bingo I can play in that spot
>Albert_Martono: ADEEIMT A5 MEDIATE +95 354
#note Well done, SOIGNEES* countered by TOTANUS, TEGMINAS* countered with MEDIATE!!!!!!
>Christian_O.B: DLNRTTY B11 TYND +18 328
>Albert_Martono: EINOOUV 10J OVINE +19 373
#note This is getting more and more funny.... Albert told that he want to play EUOI in C12 for 20 but flloating I, R, and D was very very condusive for bingo... So he block OVINE, to wipe out all floater, NOBODY NOTICED TYND TAKE E BACK HOOK (TYNDE).
>Christian_O.B: DEFILRT G10 DEIL +15 343
#note If I know TYNDE I wouldn't need to think hard how to maximize my winning chance and set-up my F play, knowing Albert didn't have right tile to use that spot effectively, and if he use, he will open floater with (99%) flexible letter in H15 setting me up for 8-letters counter bingo
>Albert_Martono: GHOU K10 .UG +14 387
#note Albert decided to leave it open after 6 minutes thinking, and set-up for his H. He told me he can block with JOL/OH but will result disastrous if I hold E
>Christian_O.B: AEFLRTT H12 FART +44 387
#note Successfull set-up, but only gave me 27.5% winning chance, compared to 45% with DELFT/TYNED for 48 points in previous move
>Albert_Martono: BHIOPRU C7 BOP +25 412
#note Albert got very crucial situation now... The main problem was, NONE of us know that miscalculating already happened here. Albert ZEAS worth 43 points, yet it counted 40. Both of us recorded 40, I'm too lazy to recount his ZEAS because I was stressed enough after Julius saw our board and shout "SOIGNEES* gak ada itu, pernah masang gw dolo", and the fact I hold 2 blank but cannot made excellent play and now he was catching...

Within his 2 last minutes Albert decided to play BOP, leave HUI+R for HUI in M7 or K13. Both are good score. He didn't know and noticed LORETTE, (In fact, I realized I can finish in one move just a few seconds before he play BOP. I even told to Julius "Kalah ini gw kayaknya... Tile dy medium semua gw tile 1 1 semua gak bisa abis lagi...."

Albert best play 15D BRUIT for 10 points, block LORETTE, and leave HOP for massive finishing in 7C or 13K, second best move, L12 OUPH because it worth 32 points
>Christian_O.B: EELORT 15C LORET.E +8 395
>Christian_O.B:  (challenge) +5 400
#note With Albert underscored 3 points, his score was only 409 in both scoresheet, and both of us, know it will be a tied game. So Albert have to make a hardest decision to challenge or not. Resulting: He challenge and valid word, he lost, He challenge and invalid word, he win the game. He also have choice to leave it unchallengeresulting draw game. Albert chose to challenge
>Christian_O.B:  (HUIR) +14 414
#note Albert refused to recount, his score remained 409....
