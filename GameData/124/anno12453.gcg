#note I thought I was making a mistake when I left the QI threat alone, but Champ finds that playing something like GALL isn't really worth it.  Hard to believe.

#note 10I PI(N)ERY 34.  That spot keeps getting missed.  Oops.  PERKY is 4th.  Q seems to like YE keeping EIKPR.  Meh.  I admit the leave isn't great, but I like scoring as much as I can to keep the pressure on.

#note Hard decision here.  Play the bingo?  I mean, it's possible he could have something to bingo out, and then I lose.  But there are three Is, three Os unseen, so I don't think I have too much to worry about.
