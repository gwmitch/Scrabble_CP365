#note I'm guessing he had AELORS with another tile. Maybe AELOQRS.

#note Interesting play. I thought about H(E)AT, but making yourself impotent on the following turn is not good. Also, I didn't mind this because after an exchange one he is more likely to bingo than use the scoring spot around the W.

#note Some interesting options here. I looked at PARAMO, NOMA and MOMI. Also PRAAM, which I didn't think of. MOMI definitely looks worse than PRAAM. PARAMO is pretty easy to make openings off of, so no. NOMA closes off the bottom of the board fairly well, while PRAAM doesn't do long-term closing as well. But this is definitely confirmation bias. What do you think I should play?

#note Have to block column A while preventing an H2 setup from ruining my day. Plays like DEV and COVED are close to being good but not quite.
