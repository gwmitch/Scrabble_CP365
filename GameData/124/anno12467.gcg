>Dan: AHKW H7 HAWK +28 28
>Rafi: BCEGJOZ 10F ZE. +36 36
#note COZ is much better. I was thinking about what would happen if the Z is overlapped (I have the G for a nice counterplay) but if HAWK is overlapped I have drek. JOG is also better - I can draw an O for COZ, and if the J is overlapped I can play JOB.
>Dan: ALMO 11D LOAM +27 55
>Rafi: BCEGIJO I6 JIBE +31 67
#note It was between this and BOGIE. BOGIE sets up a potential J spot if I draw an A, but against an opponent who is more comfortable on an open board, I prefer JIBE.
>Dan: DIIR 12B IRID +17 72
>Rafi: ?CEGNOU B10 CU.NG +28 95
#note Only one 8 with these tiles.
>Dan: AHW G6 HAW +25 97
>Rafi: ?EIIORV 5A IVORIEs +77 172
>Dan: EERSTUX J9 EX +31 128
#note Dan mentioned later that he was one off ULEXITES here!
>Rafi: AEIINOR K7 NORIA +26 198
#note Thought about RENVOI, but Dan's exclamation to his neighbor made it clear he was leaving bingo prone stuff. I opted to block the best bingo lane, figuring that he was unlikely to have a scoring play through the I. I guess a blank triple triple is possible though...
>Dan: EERRSTU 14B .ESTURER +61 189
>Rafi: DEFFINT A1 TIFF.NED +221 419
#note My highest scoring play ever!
>Dan: OOTY J3 TOYO +20 209
>Rafi: AAALNPT K2 TAPA +28 447
#note Ooh, ATAP/PSHAW. 
>Dan: EOP L2 OPE +27 236
>Rafi: AELMNNU 1L MAUN +38 485
>Dan: IQS J12 QIS +26 262
>Rafi: DELNOTU E1 OUTL.NED +59 544
#note I came dangerously close to missing this.
>Dan: EGO H12 OG.E +18 280
>Rafi: ?ADLRSV 8K .VALS +36 580
>Dan: ACEEGIS L10 SICE +24 304
#note Dan said the B was in the bag. I was hoping for BOOGIE/COBIA to come down! Funnily, he missed LEGACIES/ELEGIACS... must have not been even looking for a bingo.
>Rafi: ?DLNRTY N1 .NRuLY +32 612
#note UNDULY also blocks the outplays, and leaves me with TR(OPE). (A)DeNYL is pretty sick. Sad that ARDENTLY was blocked, but I still think this is my high club game.
>Dan: ABEG D7 BAG +15 319
>Rafi: DT M7 T.D +7 619
#note I overscored IVORIES by 2, so I recorded my score as 623. Oops!
>Rafi:  (E) +2 621
