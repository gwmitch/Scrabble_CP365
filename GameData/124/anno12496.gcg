#note the trouble with not studying is that you forget your 5s, like COXED. wasn't sure enough. (-4.5)

#note it feels like this is a big mistake. i think most good players would play MACACO here, or maybe something like CADE/DACE 10B. (-6) it's basically a game-losing play because it condemns me to having to keep fishing. of course, i'd play MACACO if i saw it.

#note see? now i have to keep fishing while he draws the blanks and Ss. turnover theory is dumb, but maybe not here.

#note his chances of having an S are too high for me to do 12B CAB, plus TOES is not that good anyway. what a shitty situation, just because i didn't know MACACO.

>cesar: ILOOOST B7 OLIO +17 168
#note so i am rewarded with this garbage instead of OOLITES if i'd seen the right play. another fairly low equity point loss play to lose the game. this is why losing 10 points equity in a game is still a lot when you're trying to break 2000. LOOIE opens it up more for me, plus knowing that he has the S it's definitely better, at least win% wise. quackle has them pretty close anyway.

#note quackle likes exchanging AEI better. i guess i do still have another lane but he'll probably block.

#note lol
>cesar: AEIQSTY B1 QAT +26 206
#note quackle likes B1 QIS better than B1 QAT, for synergy probably. i guess QY do count as two consonants! i'm drawing so crappy that of course i'm gonna draw the U, so i liked this play. (-1)
>lester: DIJ E2 DJI. +12 340
#note of course he's gonna block it
>cesar: EGISTUY 9J .UG +7 213
#note equity keeping GS and then a miracle bingo? nope. also i have like 10 seconds left. i shouldn't have tried to watch the second half of El Clasico while playing this game. F12 GABY is pretty cool, though. (-11)
