#note Ugh... I really didn't like this word. But I just didn't have the confidence. I was making poor decisions like this all weekend!
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEHNRWX E5 REX.NE +41 136
#note Decided to go for broke here.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: IQ D4 QI +25 144
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEHINSW 11E SWIN. +46 182
#note Didn't like SWINGE. Can't tempt fate twice. But I wish I had seen NEWISH or NEWSIE. Two misses.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ?ADENOP 13B DAPsONE. +72 216
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEEEHU A1 A.EE +18 200
#note I never know when too many E's is too many. Apparently AGUE is better.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: BEVY C7 BEVY +31 247
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEHTUZ B6 ZA +35 235
#note This does really poorly in the sim. I am giving too much back. The trick is to bank the Z for something better. Play 14F HUT with my A in hand.

#note Pretty inexplicable. I didn't pass up HUH; I just didn't see it. Yikes!!

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ELMNTU 7H L.MENTUm +62 334
#note I had a tough time with this position. 12A MENU was very appealing, but I really felt my odds of bingoing were super lower after I burn the case E. Is it now or never on the bingo? I realised that LOMENTUM was unappealing for obvious reasons, but decided to go for broke. The sim prefers MENU by a good 5 points. So I dunno. I guess I undervalued keeping the blank here.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ADIRRST 2I RITARDS +72 348
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CLORSTU 15A CLOUTS +33 367
#note Once again, I choose to cash my big tiles rather than bide my time. I can keep the S and hope I still have a play here later, or I can cash it now. This time it's a significant difference in the sim. 12A TOLU by 10. Wow.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: BOU O6 U.BO +15 363
#note Whew. No J!
