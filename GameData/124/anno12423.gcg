>Rafi: ?AEENOR J3 ARENOsE +65 65
>Orry: OQRTU 5F ROQU.T +30 44
#note This play confused the hell out of me... apparently Orry hadn't thought of the C hook and was focused on the chance to extend with PA.
>Rafi: AAAIISU -AAAIIU +0 65
#note Normally I'd keep the A, but turnover here is important with both C's unseen.
>Orry: AMNY 3I M.YAN +26 70
>Rafi: AAEOPST 2K ATOP +21 86
#note Great opportunity for PAROQUET here, but I completely missed it.

>Rafi: AAEINST 4A TAENIAS +70 156
>Orry: AEEL A1 ELA.E +15 166
>Rafi: BEGGMWY O1 GYM +37 193
#note GYBE is a good alternative. I liked saving the E for big parallel plays under MAYAN or over TAENIAS, but after GYBE I'm still likely to draw a vowel and have big parallel opportunities. One benefit of GYM is that it doesn't open a lane for Orry, who either left 3 vowels or bingo tiles.
>Orry: EIOU 2A .OUIE +12 178
>Rafi: BEGNNWZ 4L WEB +31 224
>Orry: ACIIL 6B ILIAC +26 204
#note Potentially dodged a bullet here - ICE/CROQUET is worth 46.
>Rafi: AEGNNWZ F8 .EZ +35 259
#note Tough call between FEZ and WRANG. I think FEZ is better because it keeps the board pretty closed, while WRANG leaves a wide open S hook. A play off the G in WRANG could be troublesome, making it hard to prevent bingoes.
>Orry: B 1D B....... +21 225
>Rafi: AGJNNUW I7 W.ANG +26 285
#note Now WRANG is the only real option.
>Orry: PTU 10C PUT. +15 240
>Rafi: CIJNSUV 12G JUS +21 306
#note I think this is a pretty good play if I put Orry on an S. Otherwise JUN overlapping PUTZ is a good alternative.
>Orry: EKO C10 .OKE +20 260
>Rafi: CFHINOV D12 INCH +40 346
>Orry: DDEIS 15A DIS.ED +33 293
>Rafi: DFIOSTV A13 VI. +7 353
#note Right idea, but (very) poorly executed. VIS/SPOKE does the trick, and gives me a decent scoring spot if Orry bingoes elsewhere. I also leave open the X spot, which really only benefits me because if Orry takes it he only has a 6 tile rack and can't bingo.
>Orry: ?DELRVX G1 .X +9 302
>Rafi: DDFOSTV 7B SOFT +20 373
#note I spent almost all my remaining time drying to figure out how to block BOREHOLE (or BEHOLDER) without setting up another bingo. As it turns out, there really isn't anything I can do to block it without setting up something else. However, I completely missed CHORTLER down below, which is easily blockable and gives me a 75% shot to win instead of 50%.
>Orry: EEHLORR 12C ..R +7 309
#note Heads up play by Orry, realizing he can D stick me if I'm not careful.
>Rafi: ?DDV 11I .uV +12 385
#note VI(D) setting up another D spot is best.
