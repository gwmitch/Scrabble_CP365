>Matthew_Larocque: AJNOSWY H4 JOWAN +46 46
#note I intentionally played this knowing it was no good, which is probably a bad habit. But I've played it several times and nobody has challenged it off.
>Wayne_Clifford: EFI G7 FIE +22 22
>Matthew_Larocque: BIISSTY 9D BIT.S +23 69
#note I disliked pretty much all the choices here, so I opted to phony again.... he didn't even hold *JOWAN so I didn't expect him to challenge.
>Wayne_Clifford: IZ 6H .IZ +35 57
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIOSTY I3 YO +18 87
#note Yes, it's true..... I played the phony and forgot that AJOWANS is a valid word. Shameful.
>Wayne_Clifford: EOT J2 TOE +20 77
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIPSTT 8A PITA +26 113
>Wayne_Clifford: CEHOORS E4 CHOOS.ER +109 186
#note Ouch...
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDILST -  +0 113
#note It's a lot of points, and CHOOSY seemed like it might not have comparitive/superlative forms, that's why I challenged. Unfortunately this really puts me behind.
>Wayne_Clifford: VY B8 .VY +17 203
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDILST 7G ..TAL +23 136
#note T(R)ICLADS. Didn't know it. Nor A10 ALCIDS 41. I have very low chances to win with this play.
>Wayne_Clifford: AM F5 AM +25 228
>Matthew_Larocque: CDIILNS 3I ..NIC +20 156
#note Don't like K1 LIDS. My S isn't very useful on this board I suppose, but still, I need to hang some letters out in the open.
>Wayne_Clifford: ADEG 8J GAED +22 250
>Matthew_Larocque: ADDILRS L2 D.D +10 166
#note Never even thought of (WIZ)ARD. Wayne probably had a bingo here based on his next couple moves, though.
>Wayne_Clifford: U A7 U. +4 254
#note He thought really long here.
>Matthew_Larocque: AILNRSS L7 S.RIAL +21 187
#note Third phony, kind of breaks up my rack but something needs to happen fast and that means I need to get lucky.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?AENORT 13H TREAsON +70 324
#note Welp.
>Matthew_Larocque: EENRRSU O7 ENURERS +81 268
>Matthew_Larocque: EENRRSU --  -81 187
#note Alas, I finally get red exed. ENSURER is the valid word but it does not play.
>Wayne_Clifford: EM 14I EM +22 346
>Matthew_Larocque: EENRRSU 15G ENSURER +82 269
#note Wayne gives me an opening, not realizing I had a valid bingo. I wasn't postive on it myself but seemed like a reasonable bet.
>Wayne_Clifford: AQT -  +0 346
#note Phew. This gave me the momentum I needed to try and mount a comeback.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGKLUV O8 KLUGEs +39 308
#note I didn't have very much time to figure this out. He's certain to block this next turn, it's the most dangerous bingo line and the easiest to use. My letters are clunky and almost all my plays have clunky leaves. 39 points isn't a lot for the blank, but it is a lot on a board with almost nowhere to score. However, K(A)GU is a little bit harder for him to deal with, and ELV? could possibly bingo. I don't really trust my word knowledge in these situations though. K11 KE(A) scores well and keeps the blank to score with next turn. The good thing about KLUGEs is I have a decent shot if I draw an X bomb.

Both sim and champ say that N11 GU(N)K is best
>Wayne_Clifford: AQ C6 QA. +13 359
>Matthew_Larocque: BIIIOTV 11H TIBI. +14 322
#note Other options include 9K B(R)OI(L) and exchange 7. I do really need the X, so maybe exchange 7?
>Wayne_Clifford: EF M8 .EF +16 375
>Matthew_Larocque: IOVX 5K VOX +32 354
#note Guess I skipped writing down my letters here since this was going to be a pretty close finish. I have to imagine this was best.
>Wayne_Clifford: AH 14F HA +15 390
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEINOP A10 OPINED +35 389
#note Damn lucky draw right here. This should have won me the game.
>Wayne_Clifford: GLNRUW 6M UN +13 403
#note URN obviously.
>Matthew_Larocque: E 2J .E. +6 395
>Matthew_Larocque:  (GLRW) +16 411
#note I let my clock run over, so needless to say I felt pretty deflated after. Simply one of the worst ways to lose, because there's no excuse for it happening. I chose to track and write down racks and as a result I chalked up a loss instead of a win.
