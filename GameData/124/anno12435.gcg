>Dave_Koenig: AEEINOS 8H OE +4 4
#note Quackle prefers exchanging AEO by about 3 points over this.
>Mosaic: EX 9H EX +36 36
>Dave_Koenig: ?ACEINS G7 ArSENIC +76 80
#note This and the next four turns were easy choices, provided you can find the plays.  Quackle agrees with all of my choices.

>Dave_Koenig: AFLNRUV D10 FLAV.R +26 297
#note This is the first time since turn 1 that static evaluation did not prefer my play, but I don't like its alternatives.  Sure enough, Championship Player agrees with my choice.  None of the plays here have leaves that are all that great, and with a blank still out, several openings for bingos, and the big scoring lane on the A column, turnover is at a premium.
>Mosaic: AMTT E3 MATT +24 320
>Dave_Koenig: EEENNUZ C6 NEEZE +30 327
#note Again Championship Player overrules static evaluation and agrees with my choice.  Not only is turnover valuable, but creating the 8A-D opening is helpful to offset the A column opening.
>Mosaic: ?JLORST B1 JOSTLeR +79 399
>Dave_Koenig: BBFKNQU A6 FUNK +41 368
#note The best play is FUNKBBQ for 169.  But seriously, this is best.  If I get lucky enough to draw AI, I will have two 60+ point plays with the Q.  Also, better to score four more and keep BB than keep BF.
>Mosaic: AE J6 AE +11 410
>Dave_Koenig: BBDOOQY 3J Q.O.D +15 383
#note No choice, this is the only place for the Q.  But the lady slows me down too much, and I have no chance to win now.
