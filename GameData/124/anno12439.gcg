#note 8A AGOUTI is preferred here.  It scores marginally better and turns over more tiles.

#note Ok, here's where my game goes wrong.  Quackle prefers K10 GOA, which balances the leave as well as does not provide my opponent (who for all I know does have the S) with an extra spot to score in.  This was a bad play.

>Daniel_C.: ?AILNRT 12C RATLINs +69 359
#note And here's the turn where I managed to lose the game, despite having all the resources I need to win it.  I saw three places where I could bingo 12C RATLINS, 8A FLATIRON, and just about anything down from D9.  Of the 3 plays, only 12C RATLINS manages to block two of the lanes- the other two plays leave two places open where my opponent could bingo back.  I figure (correctly, it turns out) that if my opponent can bingo back, I will probably lose the game since there are exactly 7 tiles left in the bag at this point.  Leaving the lane through the F open seemed to me like the least likely spot for my opponent to bingo.  The question is - what would you do here, and why?  If you bingo, which bingo do you pick?  If you intentionally don't bingo, what do you play instead?
