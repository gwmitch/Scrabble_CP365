>Rafi: COW 8G COW +16 16
>Noah: AALRRUV J4 ARVAL +25 25
>Rafi: DEEINOT 6D DENOTI.E +64 80
>Noah: ?ABEIRU D6 .AUBRIEs +72 97
#note I think AUBRIEt(A) is better to block the line 5 scoring spot, a spot which I neglected in my analysis.
>Rafi: AFY 5E FAY +35 115
>Noah: AAEFIMU 10B FE.IA +18 115
#note I think this is fine. Maybe UREMIA? Don't really like ARF.
>Rafi: EORSTUV 7C V.U +16 131
#note Rafi's actual rack. Can you find the best play?
>Noah: AEILMOU B10 .OLIUM +22 137
#note Missed MI(A)OU, which looks fine.
>Rafi: EGIORST 11F GORIEST +69 200

>Rafi: AALM A12 ALMA +42 268
>Noah: ?AEGINP 1H .APErING +86 278
#note Thought about PANGEnIC*. Rafi thought it was good :(.
>Rafi: QS L9 Q..S +26 294
>Noah: BEGLNOT 2F GL.BE +24 302
#note I didn't see (E)BON C10, which is pretty. This is probably fine though. EGLT isn't my favorite leave here.
>Rafi: HIRT M7 THIR +28 322
>Noah: EKNOTTZ N1 .EKTON +24 326
#note Should I play TWEET or WEET so as not to open as much for Rafi? I didn't think so. While this is risky, ZONK is also a bad proposition, because, as is evinced by this rack, those tiles don't do much here. I think this is fine.
>Rafi: DDENORS O5 NODDERS +81 403
>Noah: DEEHTXZ -  +0 326
#note Wanted to win. Wasn't sure of NODDERS. Maybe should've cared about spread, but whatever.
>Rafi: IIJNOST F9 J.. +11 414
>Noah: DEEHTXZ M12 HEX +31 357
#note This seems right...I don't really trust Quackle's choices.
>Rafi: IINOST 14M .I +18 432
>Noah: DETZ K3 T.E.D +25 382
#note ED K1 looks fine.
>Rafi: INOST 8M .I. +7 439
#note This may be the wrong order of plays, whatever.
