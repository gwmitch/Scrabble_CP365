#note Rahn said if I thought really hard I could figure out what his 7th tile had to be.  I'm not good at those kind of deductions, though.  Could've been a number of things, if you ask me.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGINOTX C10 .XON +37 310
#note 2L GOX 31.  I was debating between ILEX and EXON and didn't even see this superior play.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEEGHIT 15L .HID +30 340
#note ECHED is good -- I wasn't sure.  Champ's choice, too, but still leaving that P and G open.  Nowt much I can do, though.  I need the points, but in hindsight EGGED or IGGED are so much better.  CHID is way off.

>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEGKT -  +0 340
#note Figured I had to challenge. Thought it was only one L.  Oh well.  Was playing catch-up the whole game, couldn't quite do it.  Perhaps if I play IGGED I pull it out.
>Rahn_McKeown: EINOOTU D10 .O +13 421
#note He says he was fishing for EQUATION or QUOTIENT.  I saw that there was a U out, and this may be possible, but I was a bit demoralized to stop it.  That is now 4 power tile bingos, three through a tile on the board.  Crazy tournament.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEGKT 14E EKE +37 377
#note GET at 2L is the obviously play to stop it.  I was a bit greedy too early.
