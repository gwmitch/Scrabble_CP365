>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EEGRUV 8D VERGE +26 26
#note About to get my worst game of the tournament out of the way! Watch in horror as I bleed like 300 equity this game. GUV sims noticeably better. Hrm... thought the points were worth it.
>Jason_Broersma: BEIMT E3 BETIM. +20 20
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?DIIUWZ 6D W.Z +35 61
>Jason_Broersma: FNNRU 4A FUNN.R +26 46
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ADIIMU I8 DUI +16 77
#note Sigh... hope this is just first game jitters. I'm usually decent at finding bingos. But I talked myself out of BASIDIUM and got flat-out careless not spending enough time on the E. Very, very weak.
>Jason_Broersma: EFIV J10 FIVE +31 77
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ??AHIMT H1 TAcHIsM. +95 172
#note With two blanks and many tempting lines, I could only spend so much time on the F. But I saw MISFAITH and convinced myself it was no good. HALFTIME should have been obvious, though. And HIMATION was findable. Blargh!
>Jason_Broersma: ALSW A4 .LAWS +33 110
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAANOOT F4 .A.O. +20 192
>Jason_Broersma: ILOPRST 13E POITR.LS +62 172
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AKNOOOT 12D KOTO +24 216
#note Always paranoid of the X after my opp draws 7. But Q says to just go for the equity play HOOKA.
>Jason_Broersma: AHJ B8 HAJ +34 206
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AENOPSU 1F AU.OPENS +61 277

>Jason_Broersma: GLORY N10 GLORY +34 259
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEGLNTY M1 .EDGY +20 327
#note Decided to go on the defensive and pass up the big plays on row 14. I saw GLEY, but missed TYNED, which outruns most bingos.
>Jason_Broersma: ACENOR 14A CANOER +30 289
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DELNORT 15F RONDLET +81 408
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DELNORT --  -81 327
#note All I have to do is drop a play at 15B like TORN or something to kill all the scoring lanes. Instead, I get mixed up on a high-prob rack and throw 30% of a win down the drain.

#note ELOPED
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe:  (EII) +6 386
#note What an absolutely horrible effort by me! Three massive blunders in one game.
