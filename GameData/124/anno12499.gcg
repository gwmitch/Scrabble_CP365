>Matt: DDEEINR 8G DE +6 6
#note Missed a bingo my first turn of the tournament: NEDDIER#.  I only knew NEDDY as a noun in TWL, not an adjective in CSW.
>Ezekiel: IKRY 9F YIRK +23 23
>Matt: ADEINRS J3 RANDIES +74 80
#note I create a juicy spot at J2, but I felt like pushing my luck into drawing a B.
>Ezekiel: ACELM 10D CLAME +27 50
>Ezekiel: AEHT (challenge) +5 55
#note Remembered MACLE and wasn't positive on CLAME#, so I threw 5 points at the challenge.  
>Matt: BLNORUW 2J BLOWN +49 129
#note Luckbox.
>Ezekiel: AEHT 3L HEAT +31 86
#note This plays up top (as HAET) for 49.  
>Matt: ANORRRU D7 RAN.OUR +20 149
>Ezekiel: ?AGIOQT C3 DOGMATE +84 170
>Ezekiel: ?AGIOQT --  -84 86
#note Thought it had a chance at being good (probably thinking of DOGATE#), but since he blocked my bingo it was an easy challenge decision.
>Matt: ?CNOORV 4D CORdOV.N +76 225
#note I thought I was so clever finding this, but I have an even better play: CONVeNOR 2x2 for 98.  CNNOORV? just didn't look fruitful at the time.
>Ezekiel: ADEGMOT 1L DOAT +39 125
#note M(NA) can be tricky to see; DOME etc. score 47 here.
>Matt: AEEIPQT 12B EQ.IP +16 241
#note Didn't want to give him easy points back on the triple, but since he has the G still, throwing a P in the triple lane with PIQUE isn't so threatening.  
>Ezekiel: ?AEGMSS 14A MESSAGe +86 211
#note ASS? is a helluva draw there.  
>Matt: ADEITTX 15A AX +48 289
#note Scored as 51 because I can't add.
>Ezekiel: FGINU 15G FUNGI +31 242
>Matt: DEINOTT O3 .INTED +24 313
#note Yeah TOITED is the play, I chickened out of it.  Didn't think to look from 8J to the triple, ENDITE I would be sure of at least for 3 more.
>Ezekiel: ALZ H1 LAZ. +39 281
>Matt: HIOOOTY 8A HOY. +30 343
#note Yeah, that's fair, chickening out of a word and keeping the O, then drawing the last 2.  At this score, I need to keep the pressure on him by maintaining a bingo lead.
>Ezekiel: EITUV F2 VI.TUE +19 300
>Matt: EIJLOOT 7B JO. +26 369
>Ezekiel: AEIPSTU L9 TAUPIES +81 381
>Ezekiel: AEIPSTU --  -81 300
#note I catch a break here in that I now have perfect knowledge of the pool, but...
>Matt: EFILORT 13G TREFOIL +80 449
#note ...I realize that taking my bingo will allow him to bingo out and stick me with BEEGIW.  He has TAUPIES# in two places on the board, and the only block is 14K OFTER, which I didn't spot.  I finally decide to take the bingo, since that was a sure win. 
>Ezekiel: AEIPSTU N7 TAUPIES +81 381
>Ezekiel:  (BEEGIW) +24 405
#note Final score recorded as 457-405: forgot the 5 point challenge of CORDOVAN earlier.
