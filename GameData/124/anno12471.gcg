>Eric_Tran: AFOOT 8H AFOOT +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGOUU -AEGOUU +0 0
#note Not the start I was hoping for.
>Eric_Tran: EEN 9H NEE +14 32
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIMORU 10E OURIE +16 16
>Eric_Tran: AEIW L8 .AWIE +16 48
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKLMNX 11C KEX +46 62
#note I should have played MINX, it's much more defensive.
>Eric_Tran: EMORV 12D MOVER +40 88
#note Ouch.
>Matthew_Larocque: EILLMNS 13G MELL +19 81
#note M(I)L seemed like a big point sacrifice and it's also blatantly obvious what I'm doing.
>Eric_Tran: AFO K10 OAF +26 114
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINRSS 14A RESINES +73 154
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINRSS --  -73 81
#note Ugh, I can't believe this. I've gone through SEINERS/SERINES/SEREINS many times. I hated throwing an S right in the triple lane, and SERINES 14B sets up a scary hook with (RES)T/H. I constantly misread RESINED and forget the root word is RESIN, so that's pretty much why I brain farted here. M9 SEREINS is the play, obviously.
>Eric_Tran: IINTTU M9 INTUIT +32 146
#note Awesome play.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINRSS N4 SEINERS +73 154
#note Unfortunately I didn't know what INTUIT meant, and since he knows my rack, I was wondering if he'd knowingly set me up here. So I had to take the less lucrative spot.
>Eric_Tran: DSTUY 15K DUSTY +37 183
#note Getting punished for that one stupid mistake.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACGGLU 5J GLAC. +16 170
#note I didn't know GULAG, but I could have played GLUG(S)? I don't know what my logic was here.
>Eric_Tran: IJNO J2 JIN.O +31 214
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEGIUY 2J .UICY +34 204
>Eric_Tran: HO O7 OH +32 246
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGHNZ 14D GAZE +39 243
#note 14B AGNiZE is the runaway play, GAZE ranks way down.
>Eric_Tran: ARV C13 VAR +27 273
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADHLN 4J .AH +24 267
#note Wow, (C)LA(C)H for 31.
>Eric_Tran: IIRR -IIRR +0 273
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADLNT 6E TANkL.AD +70 337
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADLNT --  -70 267
#note I didn't feel like losing my turn here would be too costly, so I gave it a shot. Eric wasn't having any of it.
>Eric_Tran: GT 6I G.T +7 280
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADLNT 15E LA +15 282
#note Now, here's where get totally oblivious to the key to victory. I don't even take note of the bingo lane as I'm fishing away. Sim says open up with DA(K). I'm slightly behind so I'm not sure how good my chances are of outscoring him.
>Eric_Tran: W 11J W... +7 287
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADDNOT 1N OD +14 296
#note Again sim also likes opening with DO(R).
>Eric_Tran: B O14 B. +7 294
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADINNT N13 TA. +18 314
#note At this point I was feeling pretty good, still completely unaware of the bingo lane that existed. So I'm trying to drag my way to the end without opening the board. Ugh.
>Eric_Tran: Q 3I Q. +21 315
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DINNPR 6N .N +8 322
#note Not sure I get the results here. Surely emptying the bag is a mistake? Why should I play (L)IN for 3 points?
>Eric_Tran: ?DEEIRS 7B rESIDER +63 378
#note Oh shite, of course ANI takes an R! What the hell......
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DINPPR C3 PeRP.ND +26 348
#note I look for a bingo until I'm -40 into overtime. Eric said he saw PRoPIN(E)D for the win. I didn't know it. But..... I DO KNOW uNRIPP(E)D! Seriously. That is so disapointing. I mean I didn't really deserve to win anyways.... but there's a perfectly good bingo that I know sitting in front of me to take the win, and I miss it. 

Oh, and rESIDER takes a P hook FFS!
>Eric_Tran: B -  +0 378
#note Eric challenges, small consolation. With the timer it's still a net gain of -14 points.
>Matthew_Larocque: I 6C .I +6 354
>Matthew_Larocque:  (B) +6 360
#note 378-320.
