#note YES JD I SAW DEBRIDE. i think people think i'm still a stee. a couple more tournaments like this though and i will be. quackle likes AXE better, but not a chance in this tournament! actually, i don't really like it anyway. is it really (-4) better?

#note maybe tetany? tenty to not allow overlap on top? close enough anyway.
>doug: ANY N8 NAY +30 223
>cesar: AABQSTT 14J BAT +24 189
#note between BAT and QATS here. i figured if i couldn't salvage the Q this turn that i would at least have QATS next turn.
>doug: GILOSS O10 SIGLOS +33 256
>cesar: AHNQSTW O3 HAW +23 212
#note argh now i can't do QATS and burn the last S. however, this is a very big mistake! 3M HEW is clearly the play here, even if it looks like there's many ways he can screw that up for me. finally, why don't i just do -HQW and cross my fingers?  even though HEW is good on paper and quackle, i think it's not going to work against doug. however, HAW O3 is probably ridiculous. (-10)
>doug: EIR H7 ..IRE +14 270
#note cool play
>cesar: ?DENQST 13C DE +23 235
#note quackle does recognize the subtleties of this position. i was worried QI would win by a landslide but DE does win it.
>doug: ADT G9 TAD +13 283
>cesar: ?INNQST 10B QuINT.. +37 272
#note ok, another interesting play here. if i play QINTAR and he goes through the N, i'm gonna lose. with QuINTAR, i am scoring enough that if he blocks i can hopefully draw an E and go at I6 for more points. unfortunately, that's all post analysis. for some bizarre reason that i don't understand, my brain was completely closed off to considering QINTAR as a play. that's probably the worst type of mistake because i have no idea how to fix it. (-6.5)
>doug: CGIL E7 CLI.G +16 299
>cesar: ELNOSUU 8A LUNU.E +21 293
#note it is seriously absolutely hilarious that i drew two Us after playing Q?INTAR. ULU is worth thinking about for a second before i realize how easy it is to block.
>doug: EJ B6 JE. +26 325
>cesar: EKMORRS I6 R..ES +33 326
#note i guess i have to hope i draw the P? 6I MO is the only play that gives me a 12.5% chance to win. don't see why.

#note it did occur to me while trying to fall asleep after this nightmarish tournament that doug had missed ATROPIN, but it didn't matter anyway
