#note Tough call to pass up J11 WEND, but at this score I'm happy with SPEND. Did not spot ADOWN, which is worth considering.

#note After a well-played game, I bleed over a hundred equity on the final turn. I guess I should have smelled a rat after the strange ID play, but I figured he was just defeated. So no, it didn't occur to me that he was setting up a 9-letter bingo and I did not spot it. This was a pretty crucial error, it turned out. If I had blocked this, I would have had a comfortable cushion against Jackson in the KotH. Plus Shan overtook my high play word (played this game) and won the Scrabble brand wristwatch that I really wanted. Plus I got to endure a dozen people asking me why I didn't block and I got to explain that it didn't seem so obvious over the board. But I guess I deserved it! Wasn't upset at all at this mistake; mostly just awed by Shan's ingenuity.
