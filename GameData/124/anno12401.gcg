>Amalan_Iyengar: AEPPRTY 8G PREPAY +34 34
#note Quackle prefers YAPPER and PAPERY to this, but even though I didn't know either, I think that I should not have taken the risk of the -ing hook
>Hannah_Liebermann: ACELOTU J5 OUT.LACE +66 66
>Amalan_Iyengar: AANORST 11I O.A +10 44
#note OSTRA(C)A is best, followed by OCA
>Hannah_Liebermann: EMW K3 MEW +26 92
>Amalan_Iyengar: ADNRSTT L1 DRAT +22 66
#note I wasn't 100 percent sure about OUTPLACED so, I went withthe safer option
>Hannah_Liebermann: AH J2 HA +18 110
>Amalan_Iyengar: AANSSTV 1D SAVANTS +89 155
>Hannah_Liebermann: AI 7L AI +8 118
>Amalan_Iyengar: DELRRSX 3I L...R +16 171
#note I got mixed up between LAMAR and RAMAL, but R(E)X 12I 21 DELRS is the best play
>Hannah_Liebermann: EIM 1L .IME +21 139
>Amalan_Iyengar: DEINRSX 12E INDEX.RS +95 266
#note After simming, INDEXERS 12G and INDEXERS 12E seem to be simming out close, and after 500 sims, 12G won by about 2 points. I don't really agree with this, because 12E seems to close the board much more efficiently than the alternative, although it sort of shuts down the N lane.
>Hannah_Liebermann: BEEFIIU -  +0 139
#note Challenge
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?EFGGIR 13K FIG +22 288
#note Fl(A)GGIER and FRIGGEd are the two bignoes, but after that, F(A)G 10I was the best, although I did not notice that line for another few turns
>Hannah_Liebermann: IQ 11E QI +46 185
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?EGGRRV -VGGR +0 288
#note After simming 2ply, 10F REV and f10 G(IN) are the best plays, but I simply don't like having that imbalance that both of those plays lead to, even with the blank. Perhaps it is just my playing style, but I find that I do not play as well as many other people with too many consonants.
>Hannah_Liebermann: AJLNOUU 10F JO +51 236
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?BEINNR 14E BINNERs +68 356
#note Wasn't sure about BONNIER, and at this point, I am fairly certain that she won't challenge a phoney, and if she does, I'll still be close to a bingo.
>Hannah_Liebermann: EEL 15G EEL +19 255
>Amalan_Iyengar: CEEGVYZ 15B GYVE +19 375
#note G(A)ZE 10I, again, is the best play, but like I said, i didn't see that place until later. I need to look over the board more efficiently, looking at ALL possible openings, not just the obvious one.
>Hannah_Liebermann: HU 2N UH +23 278
>Amalan_Iyengar: CEFKTTZ 10I F.ZE +45 420
#note I finally saw the lane, and I wasn't hapy with the leave, but i figured that the points that I got was too much to pass up. the next highest simming play is over 20 less.
>Hannah_Liebermann: ?AEOTUW N5 OUTWAgE +64 342
#note My confidence in top bingos is very low, something I urgently need to address before my next tournament, and I also did a terrible job of shutting down that lane.
>Amalan_Iyengar: CIKRTTU O11 TRUCK +38 458
#note She pointed to this play afterwards and said that just the bingoes that I played were not what killed her, and that it was the short, high scoring words that did it. Bingo dependency is something I have consciously been working to reduce over the past few months
>Hannah_Liebermann: DIILNOO O8 OD +27 369
>Amalan_Iyengar: DIINOTT 7C DITTO +14 472
#note I messed up somewhere recording the racks. I was briefly considering ADITTION, and seeing if she wouldn't notice. DITTOIN(G) is the play here, and my play is just bad. the bag is out, so there's no point fishing, which quackel suggests as one of its top plays here. DITTO is bad for a number of reasons, the first of which being that it opens a huge binggo lane, and although it won't really matter in this game, it could easily lose me some games against higher rated people that I would have otherwise won,
>Hannah_Liebermann: BEILNOS C3 BLON.IES +74 443
>Hannah_Liebermann: BEILNOS --  -74 369
#note The bag is out, so I just challenge, and I'm fairly sure it's no good.
>Amalan_Iyengar: INO 15L OIN. +9 481
>Hannah_Liebermann: BEILNOS -  +0 369
#note The game is over, and I missed a G somewhere, and the recorder score was 499-373, actual score was 499-369.
