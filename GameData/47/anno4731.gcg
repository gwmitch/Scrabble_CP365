#note i spent about 5 minutes trying to figure out how to block his bingo. i fail. there is no way to block it. the best move, knowing his rack, is JERRY to block the highest scoring spot. (-18)

#note i thought he was making it up and i was mad at myself for "blocking" the bingo. (-58) lost challenge
>brian: GHLOU 12C GHOUL. +26 136
#note then he does this crap. i absolutely hated it, and should have just steam-challenged, but my bingo was still playable.

#note missed 6B PA. it doesn't seem to me like MAP should be THAT much better than MAG, but obviously the ING leave. i just thought this board wasn't good for bingos and the P is a better scoring tile. quackle's kibitzer likely has him opening wide next turn so we should take that into account.

#note L10 TENPIN seems a bit absurd especially after his last move, but what do i know about defense? (-0.3)

#note go ahead, laugh. 14J POTENT is good because it gives me a comeback if he has a bingo but i could not see myself doing that. but it seems like there are no other good alternatives. anyone? (-7)
>brian: IOT M3 O.IT +12 349
#note another reason potent is good is that the triple triple spot would have a T and there were 3 unseen.
>cesar: EINNOPT 14J PE.TI +26 363
#note potent is still the best play. (-12.5)
