#note quackle likes keeping ELNS here; I don't. To me, the L and N are anti-synergistic. Plus, with more vowels than consonants on the board, I don't want to draw three consonants to ELNS.
>Chris: IIX D3 IXI. +22 77
>Mike: ?AEENSU J3 UNEASEs +65 89
#note The best play here is pretty darn cool. Or not. (Answer next panel.)
>Chris: AIQUY 4H YA.QUI +44 121
#note UnAWES(OM)E would've been really nice. And totally not self-descriptive.
>Mike: LNPRTTZ 5C Z.T +28 117
#note ZIP is a few points better. Since I'm probably exchanging next turn anyway unless I get some useful vowels, I may as well maximize score.
>Chris: DOP H1 DOP. +30 151
>Mike: LNNPRTV -LNNPV +0 117
#note I guess it's worth playing through with PRINT M2. It's simming a few points better than the trade.
>Chris: RY 6I Y.R +11 162
>Mike: ?AGGNRT M2 TR.AGiNG +72 189
#note The only bingo.

>Chris: OW 2F WO. +29 251
#note Hey, that was my spot!
>Mike: EIMOOTW 8M .OW +18 244
#note Tacking the E on seems just barely worth it. I guess I wanted to give him something else to think about, given that he was running a little short on time (as is his M.O.).
>Chris: IJN 9C JIN +24 275
>Mike: EFIMOTT 10B MOT +25 269
#note FOMITE K8 is simming best, but it almost feels too panicky to me. At this score, it's not really time to worry yet. All of these mistakes thus far have been 2-5 pointers, but in a close game like this, they all matter.
>Chris: DEV 4B V..ED +19 294
>Mike: AEFITTU 11D TUFA +20 289
#note MUFTI B10 wins the sim, but it again seems too panicky; it essentially turns the game into a race for the last S, which Chris could very easily already have (though I'm not inferring it at this point). Then again, I guess this does too, but to a lesser extent. Opinions?
>Chris: CPR G10 C.RP +11 305
>Mike: AEEFIIT N1 FIE +18 307
#note Okay, now we can infer the S. Given that, this sims best. Plays on row 14 (CARPI) are just suicidal.

#note (Originally misscored as 31; corrected in the recount.)
>Mike: AEIILNO 9M .IE +11 345
#note Trying to block WHELK and leave ALOIN 15A. Q says I should be taking ALOIN first, for reasons that will be explained. This is ten back, but there are no wins. Chris was short on time, so I was basically hoping to force a mistake.
>Chris: EHKLRV 5L H.RK +16 391
#note EH 15A is best, but anything reasonable wins.
>Mike: AILNO 15A ALOIN +28 373
#note Too many little mistakes here and there; any one of them different could affect the flow of the game--for better or worse.My play this game wasn't bad, but it was certainly unawesome.
