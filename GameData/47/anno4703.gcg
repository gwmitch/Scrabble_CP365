#note I considered O8 COLOGNE for 8 more points, but thought it too risky with a blank unseen. Surprisingly, this play doesn't even make Q's top picks. O8 COLOG and N10 CONTO for 24 are its top picks.

#note I had a .01% level of uncertainty about UTS/OZALIDS, so took the sure thing. K10 SUET, G3 TUBA worth 2 more. Good game, Scott!
