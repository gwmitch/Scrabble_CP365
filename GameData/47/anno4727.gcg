#note I really like this opening.

#note Damn vertical opening. I shouldn't have traded.

>Evans_Clinchy: AGHIINU 10E AHI.G +22 94
#note I figured INU was a pretty solid leave -- with that open G, I have a pretty good shot at bingoing to the triple soon. The sim likes it, but it likes AHI G8 a little bit better. Probably should just have played AHI.

#note The only bingo. Brad held for a loooooong time but correctly let it go.

>Evans_Clinchy: DDEIOOU K10 UDO. +10 175
#note DOUCE is okay, but it takes no hooks, so it restricts the board a little bit. I need to win by 227! Actually, this doesn't open things much better, come to think of it. Not sure what I was thinking here.

#note Almost convinced myself AXONICS or ANOXICS was good. That would have been silly. Neither one is.

#note This is really interesting. I'm up 51, and ALNICOS or somesuch bingo would give me a 127-point lead. I'd still be 100 points away from winning the tournament, but if I open the board with an A here and get lucky to draw another bingo, then maybe I have a shot. Or I can be defensive, sticking a C in the middle of the board, and making it impossible for Brad to slot a bingo there and stage a comeback. I really wanted the win and the juicy second-place cash, so I opted for defense here. I don't think I had a chance of winning by 227. After Brad figured what I was doing, he realized he'd won the tournament. I tried to congratulate him, but certain people across the table who shall remain nameless yelled at us to stop talking.

#note I have no clue. I guess I'm sort of autopiloting my way through the rest of this game.

#note I didn't want to open the board, so I did this. Terrible leave, but it doesn't really matter.

#note Or I can play MALIC or UMIAC, taking out that triple immediately. I decided that could wait, since it didn't look like Brad had the right tiles to use that spot anyway.

#note Best is dropping the T at 12M, blocking his K. This keeps a nice outplay though.
