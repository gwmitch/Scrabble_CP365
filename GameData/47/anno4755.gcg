>Dean: ARW I5 WRA. +10 10
>Mike: EEENTUY 6G EE.Y +15 31
#note WEENY wins the sim, setting up another T hook. In retrospect, I agree.
>Dean: UUU -UUU +0 10
>Mike: EENNRTU -ENU +0 31
#note UNWRAP is best; ENTER is a perfectly servicable leave. Dean's probably drawing pretty strong here, though, so it may be too open.

>Dean: AFORS L1 FORA.S +30 94
>Mike: AINOTVZ 2J ZO. +32 166
#note This wins the sim, inferring an S on Dean's rack (which I'll do for the next two plays as well).

#note DUCT in the same spot is better.
>Dean: ILQU 2B QU.IL +32 245
>Mike: CDEPRST 1E PERT +24 320
#note Fishing with OD/INTRUDED wins handily, which isn't surprising with so many vowels to draw. Felt like I needed defense more than offense, though.
>Dean: ?ADEHOX C8 HEXApOD +94 339
#note Or not. Suddenly this game's a tossup.
>Mike: CDGISUV 15A DISC +48 368
>Dean: AELO 3G OLEA +17 356
>Mike: FGINOUV B9 FON +27 395
#note The sim has FUNGO, FUGIO, and FUNGI at E11 best. I can live with them being about 10 equity better, but not 30% win percentage. All of those plays empty the bag, and I'm at the mercy of whatever Dean has drawn.
>Dean: AEEISTY L11 AY +12 368
#note Dean's exact rack. PYE appears to offer the best winning chances.
>Mike: AEGILUV G8 ..GULA +8 403
#note There are several wins here, with PLAGUE 12C being best. This is a little more stylish, though. The key, of course, is to block both NOISETTE/TEOSINTE and INTES(TA)TE, which Dean said he would have seen--if he'd realized he could afford to go over by a couple of minutes to do so.
>Dean: EEINSTT -  +0 368
#note Dean challenges, because he's not 100% and because he has no win after it.
>Mike: EIV 12E VI.E +8 411
#note Dropping eight equity, but it winds up irrelevant. Well fought on both sides.
>Mike:  (EEINSTT) +14 425
