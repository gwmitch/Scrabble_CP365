#note LOCK in the same spot (the sim winner) is an interesting gambit. Not sure I'd play it, but it's interesting.
>Larry: EIMNOU I2 MEOUIN. +12 12
>Mike: DEFILNR 4F INF.LDER +82 112
#note Yet another bingo from recent study. Man, this "learning words" business is coming in handy.
>Larry: ADQ F2 QA.D +34 46

>Larry: EPRW 8K .WERP +42 88
>Mike: AEGILNY N8 .ELAYING +78 284
#note Okay, this is starting to get ridiculous. (YEALINGS 11D is probably safer.)
>Larry: AAH H1 HAA. +36 124
>Mike: AINOSTU O13 TAO +22 306
#note Bonus points to anyone who finds the best play here. (Answer next move.)
>Larry: FGO M11 FOG +32 156
#note S(Q)U(AM)ATION would've been sweet, wouldn't it? Missed bingo count at 1.
>Mike: ABBINSU M2 BA.B +16 322
#note BABU at 3L is the star here.
>Larry: ATX N1 TAX +37 193
>Mike: EINOSTU O1 ONE +30 352
#note Quackle is crackle here; there's no reason to fish with OUD 5D when up 130. The best defense here is more offense.
>Larry: ?AEENRW 11D RENEWAl. +70 263
#note Why not WEANERs 10A for the volatility (and the points)?
>Mike: AIISTUY F10 U.ITY +18 370
#note YAUTIA 3A? Really? I guess the Y there isn't too dangerous, but isn't wide-open the last thing we want this board to be?
>Larry: EHIT H11 .HITE +45 308
>Mike: ADEISUV D9 VA.IED +20 390
#note Time to shut things down. I don't care how it sims.
>Larry: IV 5D VI. +14 322
>Mike: ?EJORSU 12L J.. +26 416
#note Well, that was unexpected.
>Larry: OZ 10B ZO. +32 354
>Mike: ?EEORSU N5 OE +8 424
#note Probably more effective at C13. (Misscored as 9.)
>Larry: DMU 14B MU.D. +24 378
>Mike: ?ELRSSU D3 LU. +12 436
#note Just wanted to end matters. SEL 6M is best.
>Larry: LNRST C13 R.N +10 388
#note ONSET 6K is three better.
>Mike: ?ERSS 6A pRESS +15 451
#note Sometimes the bag lets you make this game look easy. (Final score recorded as 458-388.)
