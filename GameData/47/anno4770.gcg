#note I wanted to play through the N, to block all the lines. There's only one: jULIENNE. I know the word, of course, but how am I supposed to find it? Going through all the letters in the written-down EEILNNU? (which I did) won't help, because my brain just skips right past the J as impossible. I guess if I set up the -ENNE ending, I'll find it. (I had IN-, EN-, and -LINE set up.) As I've resigned myself to this, I say under my breath, "I hope you don't have it."

#note "I have it," Dave says. Drat! It's a good thing I have a win over Dave, otherwise I'd be pretty inconsolable after this. As it is, I'm only mildly ticked.
