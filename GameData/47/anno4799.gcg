#note BEKNOT is a little better.

>Joey: ABDENNT N2 BANDE. +22 40
#note I considered ANTED, but I hated what it did to the board, and wasn't crazy about saving BN.
>Robin: EINOSSU J5 OU.S +16 82
>Joey: CDIINST 5E DICTI.NS +94 134
#note I wasn't too pleased to have DISTINCT blocked at first, but this worked out just as well.

>Robin: EJOOPTT --  -44 238
#note I thought she would have played this at A4.  In any event, this ought to be a momentum shifter.
>Joey: INNRUYY H13 .RY +21 324
#note Your guess is as good as mine why I didn't play YIN 7C.  I must have envisioned ODE still being on the board, which doesn't take the N hook.
>Robin: EJOOPTT 4D JO +22 260
>Joey: AINNNUY 14H .UNNY +10 334
#note Now I really screw up.  I should have played NAY 7A for more points, and for blocking the A column just in case she suddenly remembers the hook...
>Robin: ?EIOPTT A3 POTTIEs +87 347
#note ...which she does.  DOPS.

>Robin: ?AERTUV 2G R.VET +10 423
#note Oh well.  At least she didn't bingo out with VERATRUM.
