#note i was really pissed about this play the whole game. i kept looking for something through the N and had settled on LEAPING or PEALING but then at the last second saw the F and decided to try and fish and open the board. this play is so bad and so against what ive been taught. ugh. i kept looking at it later in the game and just got more and more pissed.
>Chris_Canik: ENQR 4H Q.ERN +48 71
#note he said he had an A here, so even if i do LEAPING or PEALING he scores big with the Q in that spot. it made me feel slightly better but not much.

>Max_Karten: EIMOOTT --  -85 115
#note took too long to try and decide what sounded most plausible with these letters. if i threw it down right away as soon as my turn started i doubt he challenges. he took about 2 minutes to hold, only time ive ever drawn my tiles during a hold, i thought that would help convince him not to challenge. i could tell he had the letters to bingo through one of the letters on the bottom while he was holding too. he finally said that OOTT put this out of my range and chall'd. this is why no one knows what my range is, and no one should know what yours is either.

#note i thought this was a brilliant play, this is one thing that puts chris above most other people in our div is that his strategy is elevated well above his word knowledge

>Chris_Canik: AEFR 1K FA.ER +24 390
#note could have sworn this wasnt good. instachall. pissedoffness exponetially compounded. feelings of inadequacy and that i dont deserve to win this tournament overwhelming.

#note not letting him win by playing two fake words in his last three turns like our first game helped me deal with this. going out with a phony also helped me deal with this. if only just a little. probably the worst loss ive ever had out of my 12 tournament game losses.
