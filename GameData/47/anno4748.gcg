#note this game took a long time to start because of the incident between aaron and cheryl allen-munley the game before had a lengthy director's call and recount. he was visibly not happy with had happened and i figured it would adversely affect his play, but this game goes pretty smoothly from the onset so im not sure how much that contributed.
