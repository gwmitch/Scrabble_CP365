#note Setting up the trap.

>Matt_Canik: EEFHNOY L9 HONEY +27 41
#note Thought about something at 6N, but didn't like leaving the Y and didn't like EYE or YE. 
>John_Dalton: EE -EE +0 30
>Matt_Canik: ADEEFIP 9G APED +35 76
#note Still had EF/ETUI after this incase I NEEDED points next turn. This still kept the trap open, too.

>Matt_Canik: EEFILVW M12 FEW +33 109
#note Saw WHID and for some reason convinced myself that it was only CHID.
>John_Dalton: ?AEIRSU F9 RESIdUA +68 98
#note Enh. He had better stuff but oh well. 
>Matt_Canik: EGILTTV 15A VEGIT.L +36 145
#note I thought it wasn't good, but for some reason I wanted to play it anyway. GL(A)IVE scores the same and doesn't have the risk of being challenged. Oh well. 
>John_Dalton: AY 6N YA +26 124
>Matt_Canik: AGIILRT K10 LIRA +26 171
#note Didn't even consider GIRT/GIRL in the same spot. 
>John_Dalton: AGJU 5K JUGA +30 154
>Matt_Canik: ABGIILT 12C TIB.AL +18 189
#note Lots of mediocre options, but nothing outstanding (except maybe BAILI(E)). I like my play, but that's just my opinion. 
>John_Dalton: CMO 6H MOC +29 183

#note Nice fish. 
>Matt_Canik: DMNOPRT N9 PORT +23 259
#note Didn't see (WE)PT. This isn't bad, though.

#note No question. 
>John_Dalton: AKOS 8A SOAK. +42 302
>Matt_Canik: CEMNNRX C7 M.X +23 321
#note This is huge. MAX to leave one in the bag or EXAM to empty it? or EX to try and block a lane and score? (at this point, he's 1.5 minutes overtime). I go with MAX because I don't want to empty the bag... I'm an idiot. 
>John_Dalton: I 9C .I +15 317
>Matt_Canik: CELNNOR 3B COL.ER +20 341
#note I saw INBREED 2H and INBREED(S) A1, but nothing blocked both. GG, I'm 0-1 and somewhat pissed. He ended up losing 4 points on overtime, but
