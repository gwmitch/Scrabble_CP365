>Jeff: BOP 8G BOP +14 14
#note Jeff showed up a few minutes late back from lunch, and started this game with about 13 minutes left on his clock. "We'll still finish ten minutes before everyone else," he said as he sat down. (He was wrong, but we didn't finish much later than anyone else, either.)
>Mike: ILLMRRU -LLRU +0 0
#note MULL 7H sims best, but I don't feel like fighting through this. If I was going to, I prefer RILL 9H.
>Jeff: EIKN 9F KINE +22 36
>Mike: ?DEEIMR 10E MItERED +83 83
#note Right idea, but EpIDERM 10D is six more.
>Jeff: AETT 11D TATE +28 64
>Mike: ?DFIITW 12C FID +24 107
>Jeff: EIL 13A LIE +16 80
>Mike: ?DIORTW 14B TWO +25 132
#note Since I have the blank, there's no reason to panic and block the triple; DOW 11J wins the sim.
>Jeff: EILRSTU 15D RULIEST +77 157
>Mike: ?DIJORR 11J DOR +17 149
#note Or DORR.
>Jeff: EIPQU M11 EQUIP +37 194
>Mike: ?AIJNRV H12 JIV. +22 171
>Jeff: GHW 13F WH.G +17 211
>Mike: ?AANRRY 15M .RY +24 195
>Jeff: EF 14L F.E +16 227
>Mike: ?AAGNRT A6 ARGeNTA. +77 272
>Jeff: CELNO B2 CLONE +22 249
>Mike: AADINOS C3 ODA +17 289
#note Didn't see OPERA I7, which wins the sim by a couple of percentage points.
>Jeff: ABSY D3 BAYS +37 286
>Mike: AINSTUX B9 XU +23 312
#note I'll infer an S (based on that last play) until proven otherwise.
>Jeff: EU 6D .UE +5 291
>Mike: AINOSTZ J6 ZAS +40 352
#note ZA 7H or ZONAE F2 are about 1% ahead. I prefer to score and take out lines, though. (Is Quackle really that bad defensively, or am I too paranoid?)
>Jeff: EO 14H .OE +16 307
>Mike: CGHINOT 5F HIC +13 365
#note I can't stomach Q's top two choices, NIGHT G2 or CHIGOE F1. Way too open for this score, methinks. I could live with OCHONE H5, though, if I'd seen it.
>Jeff: ENO H3 ON.E +7 314
>Mike: AAGNOTV 9K AVA +11 376
#note i couldn't remember whether DORE took an S. If it does, VAT K5 (the winner according to CP) loses to MARLINS. I didn't want to take the chance, so I sacrificed some spread here. 
>Jeff: AILMNRS K5 LAM +25 339
#note NORMALS 3G is best.
>Mike: GNOT L4 TOG +23 399
#note Duh. Just go out with TONG/NONCE.
>Jeff: INRS 3G R.SIN +7 346
#note RINS 2F is six better. Played well enough to survive, but this one was sloppy. (Minus 10 on time; final score 399-338.)
>Jeff:  (N) +2 348
