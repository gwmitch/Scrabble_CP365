>Quackle: AGILORR 9B GLORIA +31 31
>Geoff: AAEEIOT D8 ..OEAE +30 88
#note Heh, was going to play (Z)OAEAE# there anyway. I'll spell it however I damn well please, thank you...
>Quackle: EFIIMQR E11 FERMI +34 65
>Geoff: AADIITT F13 AIT +16 104
#note Quackle agrees with AIT - just not much else useful to do here. Please don't bash me with a nonbingo 3x3, Mr. Duck, sir.
>Quackle: AEGIIQR 10A QI +18 83
>Geoff: ADIILTU A10 .UID +15 119
#note Didn't know the star play here, T(IT)ULI#. QUID sims about -8. Figured I might as well leave nicely, since I wasn't going to accomplish much else here...didn't think of DALI# 10F leaving UIT, giving me a shot at a Q play next turn. I did see the #-only 2-letter extension to QUID, but that doesn't scare me too much at this point...but you never know...
>Quackle: AEGHIRU 10F GAU +23 106
>Geoff: AFILOTW 15D W..TOL +39 158
#note Finally took out that spot...
>Quackle: AEHIIOR 7H OHIA +22 128
>Geoff: AEFIRYY 8K AYRIE +38 196
#note Not quite right here. Chose AYRIE# over AREFY# in a slight overreaction against the IY leave (AREFY# is better defensively)...but didn't think of REIFY leaving AY for some reason.
>Quackle: EHILNRT N8 .NHERIT +36 164
>Geoff: DDFKLVY 12L FY.D +26 222
#note Dangit, blanked on FYKED# or DYKED at 11K.
>Quackle: ?DEJLNU I7 ..LD +15 179
>Geoff: BDEKLRV 13C B...KED +42 264
#note BERAKED, while sort of cute, isn't best either: M11 B(Y)KED# 48, or second best, the 2x2 KR(AA)LED for 48. Played through this midgame rather quickly and punted some equity, as we see.
>Quackle: ?AEEJNU 14J JAUN. +28 207
>Geoff: CLNRTVV -CLNVV +0 264
#note Saw 5 E's out and kept RT, not a bad idea, but I agree with the sim that just keeping R is maybe a bit better here with both blanks unseen.
>Quackle: ?CEEPTW 12H WET +22 229
>Geoff: NNRSSTU L4 NUTS. +24 288
#note 15L RUST or 15K TRUSS. They score more, and NUTSY opens up the board and an X spot, neither of which I should be doing right now. Too much rack grooming.
>Quackle: ?CEELPV M1 CLEEP +24 253
>Geoff: CENPRSX K2 SPEC +33 321
#note Took a while on this one. SPEC might look a little weird, but it does some good things: scores best, kills the 1 row, keeps the X for COX 1M next turn if available, if opp bingos to the S on row 2 there's a decent chance of having a strong X play in reply. SPEC wins a short sim on equity, but CEP/NEP# in the same spot or M10 CRY do as well in win pct.
>Quackle: ?AGOOVV 2H GOV. +16 269
>Geoff: NNNORSX I1 N.X +18 339
#note Here we go...couldn't bring myself to play COX and pray that Quack didn't bingo on row 1 and leave me with a rack full of consonants. The points were enough that I should have, though NOX# was second best and not that far back (74% vs 68%, about 5 points of equity, nothing else close).
>Quackle: ?AAEOSV H1 A.AVE +54 323
#note No bingo, whew...but this is almost as bad...
>Geoff: NNORRST 14A ST +19 358
#note Well, okay, I think, certainly awkward but I am still ahead, first thing I see is DOST O12 for 30 taking opp's easiest spot, that's 46 ahead...oh wait - QUIDam# for 42. Gulp. I'd thought of QUIDAM# when I played QUID early in the game, but both M's were gone; didn't figure it likely to come up. I can't see a win letting opp play QUIDam#. QUIDS/ST# blocks it, though if opp has an out for 26 I lose right away. I can't see one, but surely with two blanks I might well be missing it. If opp doesn't have out in one, it's DOSt O12, then my RONE# K11, then his other blank to go out. Which I thought still would end as a loss for me.
>Quackle: ??OS M10 Sa.O.s +24 347
#note Whoa - his best play lost by 1! Can't claim credit for that; I played the ST# block I had to play, but figured I just had to be missing my opp's win...not too many CSW games are bingoless on both sides, eh?
