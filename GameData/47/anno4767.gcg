>Mike: AEORRTW 8H ARROW +24 24
>Rebecca: EIOO J6 OO.IE +9 9
>Mike: EELPRST M2 PELTERS +79 103
#note Wasn't sure of SPELTER. Given that that's good, PETRELS is probably safer, though it's still best to take the points.
>Rebecca: AGOT K10 TOGA +12 21
>Mike: ADEEITV 14E DEVIATE +71 174
>Rebecca: EKMOS 15A SMOKE +51 72
>Mike: EILORTT A8 TRIOLET. +77 251
#note Yes, I know, I'm a luckbox. Seriously, three bingo-bango-bongos in nine games? Just...wow.
>Rebecca: WZ H13 W.Z +45 117
>Mike: BCLNQRU 3K QU.RN +14 265
#note BURQA H4 or CLoQUE 6H win the sim. This is way too much gamble at this score.
>Rebecca: ?BCEMSU G5 CUMBErS +78 195
#note Apparently Rebecca didn't see SPELTERS either.
>Mike: BCEGILN O1 BI.G +27 292
#note Good in search engines, good in the Windage Report, not good in Scrabble. (BENIGN is best of the legitimate plays.)
>Rebecca: EH N6 HE +28 223
>Mike: CEGLNOO O7 COLOGNE +88 380
#note Now this is just getting silly.
>Rebecca: AY N10 YA +29 252
>Mike: ADDIIIX M11 DID +15 395
#note Didn't even look at the Q. QAID is clearly best.
>Rebecca: AAA -AAA +0 252
>Mike: AFIIIUX F6 XU +54 449
>Rebecca: AELN I3 LEAN +7 259
>Mike: AAFIIIJ -AFIII +0 449
#note "Finally got a vad rack, eh?" says Rebecca. (I should probably fight through with JIAO C12 or TAJ 14A.)
>Rebecca: ADEN H1 DEAN +23 282
>Mike: AIJPRTV 2E JIV. +16 465
#note PRIVATE in this line? Now you're just being silly, Quackle. I mean, yeah, the pool's not bingoish, but why take the chance? There's no way JIVE is 30 points worse.
>Rebecca: FFI E2 .IFF +34 316
>Mike: AANPRST K3 .AT +24 489
#note Not sure what SMOKER 15A (Quackle's choice) is fishing for.
>Rebecca: ?AIINUY 4B UNI.Y +22 338
#note YAnQUI E7, three better.
>Mike: AHNPRS E7 HARPS +28 517
>Rebecca: ?AI F10 AIr +13 351
#note ImA(M), four better. Didn't matter, the way I was drawing.
>Rebecca:  (N) +2 353
