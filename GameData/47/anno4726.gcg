>Evans_Clinchy: AFNNOUV 8G FUN +12 12
#note Options are FANON, NOVA, trading and this. I considered FANON first and thought really hard about it, but I was just really worried that keeping UV would ruin the game for me. ANOV can work out for me with a good draw.

#note Awesome play, Seth. Not just points and leave, but also setting up a big spot for later, which might help him come back in this game.

#note Quackle's choice is BIJOU 10K. I hate it. Scoring 16 and giving him a triple can't possibly be a good idea, regardless of leave. I opted for this play because it restricts his ability to bingo up top (got a Y, Seth?) and scores points. I'm not terribly concerned about the leave. Turns out I blocked his later future CIVISMS for 96. Lucky me.
>Seth_Lipkin: CGISSTV K11 G.T. +16 278
#note Makes sense. All his other big scoring plays block the SILEX spot that he's saving for later. GOTHS is also an option, but that also might restrict his future plays. He needs to leave a lot of stuff open to make a comeback here.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ABIITU 4K BI +16 397
#note I'm playing for spread here, since I have a chance to win the tournament. This play leaves lanes open and scores better than anything (well, except TIBIAs for 36, but I don't want to burn this blank yet).

#note Really happy I played OH earlier.
