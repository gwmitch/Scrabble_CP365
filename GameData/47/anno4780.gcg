>Dan_Stock: HM 8H HM +14 14
>Jason: CNOTTVY 9G TOY +27 27
#note Debated between this and COY. Duck says I chose wrong. (-4)
>Dan_Stock: IQ 10F QI +33 47
#note Punished for the mistake. I probably prevented an exchange.
>Jason: CDINRTV 11E DINT +24 51
#note I'm still not sure if I like it, but it sims best.
>Dan_Stock: DEEGHS 12A HEDGES +45 92
>Jason: CFGLRRV -FGLRV +0 51
#note Not a good time to have seven consonants.
>Dan_Stock: EIV A12 .IVE +30 122
>Jason: ACDIKLR H11 .RACK +36 87
#note I like TRACK to TRICK because of the three I's gone as opposed to no A's. Duck disagrees. (-2)
>Dan_Stock: EORUY 14A .OYEUR +28 150
>Jason: ADFILRU C10 FU.D. +26 113
#note OMG, FID(D)L(Y) is good! I considered it and thought "no way he'll let that go." But this isn't a bad substitute; they sim neck-and-neck.
>Dan_Stock: JR 13G J.R +19 169
>Jason: ABEILRW D4 BRAWLIE +81 194
#note DOPS. WIRABLE doubles the B, but I wasn't sure. I hate the ABEFILR, ABEHILR and ABEILRW combos. WIRABLE, but no WIREABLE* (BEWAILER). FIREABLE but no FIRABLE* (it's FRIABLE). But of course HIREABLE and HIRABLE are good. I love our dictionary. But I should've remembered it was just BEWAILER and trusted WIRABLE. (-3)
>Dan_Stock: EGO E5 EGO +20 189
>Jason: BNNNOSW F6 OWN +23 217
#note Tough call. Duck likes BOW, but I thought NNNS would lead to an ensuing exchange more than BNNS. I'd play this again.
>Dan_Stock: ?EIRSTZ 14H .oZIEST +75 264
>Dan_Stock: ?EIRSTZ --  -75 189
#note Nearly didn't notice. I'd added his score, started looking for counterplays off it, then something in my head told me to re-count the play. That's when I noticed.
>Jason: BENNRSS G3 BRENS +27 244
#note Wow, consonants already becoming scarce. Dan commented in the recount/post-mortem that he was surprised I made an opening play here, but I don't know what else I was supposed to do. Neither does Quackle, except for maybe BENS in this spot.
>Dan_Stock: ?EIRSTZ 3G .lITZERS +88 277
#note Just genius. Although staticly it's not far behind ZITS/(JAR)S, which I figured would be his play, so I didn't help him *that* much.
>Jason: AAENPST K3 .AP +28 272
>Dan_Stock: IIIIUU -IIIIUU +0 277
>Jason: ADENSTV L5 ADVENTS +66 338
>Dan_Stock: AAFL J12 ALFA +26 303
>Jason: AEIINPT 2L PAIN +22 360
#note Always fun reaching into a bag with 12 vowels and 8 consonants unseen. Probably my first real mistake of the game ... stopping bingos through the S probably isn't that important, esp. setting up XI or XU for a bunch. And turnover is bad here, though I wanted one of ?X. PI(l)E leads sim. (-18)
>Dan_Stock: AEG H1 GA.E +18 321
>Jason: AEIIOTU 1M EAU +21 381
#note Ah, there are those vowels I couldn't find at the beginning of the game. Normally a great spot to exchange (maybe even seven so I can know his rack), but now I have to block the X spot I created ... and at the right time. Dan drew the X after GALE.
>Dan_Stock: LL 8L .LL +3 324
>Jason: IIMOOOT N8 .OOT +6 387
#note Like the Chris Williams loss at Can-Am, I would've liked to go through all 36 possible racks to see what he had to the G and what he had through the L/hooking to ELL (like NEUsTIC). I had no time, knew I was dumping lots of equity. But it turned out OK, mainly because Dan had nothing anywhere. Meanwhile, I saved the MOI for MOI(L) or MO at J8.
>Dan_Stock: ?CENOTX O4 COXEs +57 381
#note aXONE at O11 is six better.
>Jason: IIIMOU 8A MOI. +18 405
#note MO at N5 is two better.
>Dan_Stock: NT 5D ..T. +11 392
#note Best.
>Jason: IIU J2 I. +4 409
>Dan_Stock: N 5K ..N +5 397
#note Dan wanted to try (PE)N(ADVENTS), but thought better of it. Not often you win thanks to a phony two.
>Dan_Stock:  (IU) +4 401
