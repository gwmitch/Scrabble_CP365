#note This looks like a "dummy rack", but no, it's what I drew post-bingo. This game suddenly became more complicated.

#note My hand was a total I-magnet this game. In addition to the five I threw back, I played 7/9. I've played near-perfect to this point, but as things get complicated, Quackle and I start to disagree. Duck prefers (H)IE, 10E. (-4)

#note Bad misses. SLIVERER/SILVERER is somewhat excusable, but RELI(E)VES isn't. (-49)

>Mason_Shambach: AO O7 A.O +4 319
#note The choice between this and ODA will prove significant.
>Jason: DEILQRS -LQ +0 291
#note And, as you might guess, the later whereabouts of the Q would prove significant. (-4, to SLIER at 14J)
>Mason_Shambach: ORU K6 .URO +4 323
>Jason: ADEIKRS 5I KA +18 309
#note Duck prefers DIKE(R). I considered a play like DAIKE(R) or DARKE(R) but passed on it.
>Mason_Shambach: S L10 ...S +21 344
>Jason: BDEINRS 4J NIB +14 323
#note N(AG) instead is harder to block and hits with a lot of the unseen pool. Really the only play ... gotta learn to see stuff like that. (-14)
>Mason_Shambach: ATT 3K TAT +12 356
#note In hindsight, just playing off the T with T(I) probably works better. Reduces the chances of getting Q stuck (both in terms of drawing it and keeping the AT as Q insurance) and reduces my counterplays. I figure I'm at least 60% to win now ... the chances of Mason drawing the Q here, which he did.
>Jason: ?DELRSZ L2 L.. +5 328
#note Reduces my chances of drawing the Q, while making Mason waste a turn blocking my S setup. Feel like this has to be best, despite the equity it loses.
>Mason_Shambach: GO M1 GO. +6 362
>Jason: ?DEIRSZ 1M .ID +15 343
#note Short on time here. Had better options. R(EX) allows me to play (E)D at K13 next turn and set up unblockable 46-point plays. (-13)
>Mason_Shambach: EILNQT 2L ..NE +15 377
#note Best.
>Jason: ?ERSZ O7 ...ZE +15 358
#note Mason thought I might be Z-stuck, or at least need to burn the blank to play it. He was disappointed that he didn't block it, but it's unblockable. Because of that, R(EX) is still better, by seven.
>Mason_Shambach: ILQT B7 L... +10 387
>Jason: ?RS 11D R. +12 370
#note Finally I get it right. I almost played (DE)aRS just to take the sure win by one since I was short of time (we both were), but then I reminded myself ?RS was going to dink and dunk better than IT.
>Mason_Shambach: IQT 10E .I +7 394
#note IT, 13F, is four better.
>Jason: ?S G7 ...e. +15 385

>Jason: S J10 ....S +10 395
#note Whew. Fortunate the bingo miss didn't cost me.
