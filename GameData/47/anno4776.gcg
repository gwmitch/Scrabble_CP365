>Bing: AAAINSY 4H .AYAN +20 20
>Nigel: ILOQRTT K3 Q.T +24 100
>Bing: ACILLST L1 CLI.AL +24 44
#note Very happy to find this play: scores well, opens the board, decent leave. Quackle likes fishing an L.
>Nigel: DIILORT 1H IODI. +24 124
>Bing: EEERSTT 11B TEETERS +75 119
#note Back in the game. I'm glad I didn't chicken out on MOUSINGS.
>Nigel: ABLRSTW 10C BRAW +38 162
>Bing: AEIPRTU C8 UP..AT +26 145
#note I considered PAREU for 6 fewer points. YUP J4 doesn't look so bad either.
>Nigel: BCEELST 8A CL.B +33 195
>Bing: EIMNRSV 8G M.NIVERS +64 209
#note Obviously, VERMINS* would have no chance of staying.
>Nigel: AEEEGST 12C .GEE +27 222
>Bing: HHIJLNU 2F HUNH +25 234
#note JUN scores more, but the double H leave is too unwieldy.
>Nigel: ?AESTUZ B2 qUETZA. +70 292
>Bing: ?AGIIJL 5E JIA. +22 256
#note The best way to dump the J and keep reasonable bingo chances.
>Nigel: AKOOOSX M6 OK.A +16 308
#note Another Nigel setup. Nice play!
>Bing: ?EGIILO N5 EGI. +23 279
#note OKRA took out my only bingos, but at least I had a relatively easy choice here to block the hotspot.
>Nigel: NOORSWX O1 SWORN +29 337
>Bing: ?AILOOT N1 OOT +20 299
#note Fairly egregious miss of VIOLATOr, though I'm pretty sure I was slated to lose anyway.
