>Matt_Canik: AABELLN 8D BANAL +20 20
#note Okay, if you can find the bingo then you deserve it. BANAL is the best word that isn't a random bingo. 
>David_Whitley: OPW 9G WOP +26 26
>Matt_Canik: AEHLOOP 7E POH +31 51
#note Saw hoopla 10B and this, decided this was better (which quackle agrees with). I looked for -HOLE words but not (LO)OPHOLE for 51.
>David_Whitley: IU I9 .IU +5 31
#note He played this on me both times we played very early in the game... maybe he wants me to stick an S at the end?
>Matt_Canik: EILOQUV E6 O..QUE +34 85
#note Yes. I usually don't find things like this, I felt like I was playing well but this is the first 'correct' play all game. 
>David_Whitley: ?AFINRS 12A INFAReS +88 119
#note Best bingo by 18 poings.
>Matt_Canik: CEIILNV A11 C.VIL +30 115
#note Missed VI(N)IC B10 and didn't know INCIVIL. I like this anyway though. 
>David_Whitley: EX F5 EX.. +52 171
>Matt_Canik: ?EFINOO C11 O.F +18 133
#note When it comes to bingoing, I really don't like Fs. Not as bad as Ys and Ws, but I'm not overly fond of them. I didn't bingo but figured I would soon because of the blank. Quackle says this is 2nd to (V)OE 13A but I personally like this better. 
>David_Whitley: ERT 6E ..TER +22 193
>Matt_Canik: ?AEIINO 7I EpINAOI +61 194
#note I sacrificed the 3 points to try and make it harder to hit that DLSxTWS. Is this right?
>David_Whitley: ITZ O6 Z.TI +39 232
#note He didn't have a play with the Z where I played the I or in the other spot. Oh well. 
>Matt_Canik: EGLNRSU N9 LUNGERS +72 266
#note I blanked here and couldn't remember AEGLNRSU. I was really worried about an -IE(S)T or just -E(S)T 3x3 but I wouldn't pass up the only bingo I saw. Oh well, it doesn't end up hurting too badly. 
>David_Whitley: AEY 15L EA.Y +24 256
#note AYE M12 scored more, but he was worried about words ending in -SS.
>Matt_Canik: ADDEKMW 5H WAKED +34 300
#note I like this over DAWK in the same spot, Quackle does too. 
>David_Whitley: EMOTY 4K MOTEY +38 294
>Matt_Canik: DEHMNOT 3L HEM +31 331
#note For some reason I talked myself into thinking that it was only HOMEY/HOMIE. This sims below all the words hitting the TWS ending in Y, but 11% behind HOM(Y). Ouch. 
>David_Whitley: AD 6M AD. +26 320
>Matt_Canik: DGNORST O1 ROS. +30 361
#note Decided to go for points. Didn't see DR(U)GS 10C.
>David_Whitley: BDLNU 13I BUNDL. +24 344
>Matt_Canik: ADEGNST 10H G.D +13 374
#note STANGED didn't play, and I was left with a tough decision here. with 3 unseen Is, 2 Rs, an O and 2 Es, I figured my chances of bingoing after this were really high. I didn't NEED it, but this was the penultimate round and I needed not only a win, but also all the spread I could get. 
>David_Whitley: EEITV 14G EVITE +20 364
#note He saw through my fish, but couldn't block both lanes. This was his best attempt. 
>Matt_Canik: ACENOST 2F OCTANES +71 445
#note Whoops. Ancestor. Game's over anyway. 
>David_Whitley: AGIIJRR K11 JA.. +22 386
>Matt_Canik: T I13 ..T +5 450
#note Oops again. TOFF. Oh well. After stephen lost by 6, I only needed to beat him by 4 in the final round because I picked up enough points here. 
>Matt_Canik:  (GIIRR) +12 462
