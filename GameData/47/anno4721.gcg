>Lila_Crotty: ABHIT H11 HABIT +41 71
>Matt_Canik: CEMRSTW 10B MEWS +31 109
#note I don't like the hook, but I'm not especially worried about it- already 2 unseen esses. I missed CWMS in the same spot, but that word is too weird to see for me. 
>Lila_Crotty: AGISY A6 YAGIS +37 108
#note D'oh.
>Matt_Canik: CEENORT 14B NEOTER.C +74 183
#note Yeah, I'm not gonna punish myself for not knowing/seeing (T)RECENTO. This is 2nd anyway, but I dont like 15A.
>Lila_Crotty: OVX 15A VOX +50 158
#note See previous comment. 
>Matt_Canik: ACILLRW I3 CRAWL. +18 201
#note I kinda messed this up. I didn't see WA(D) 9C until about 3 seconds after hitting the clock. I was just kinda going for turnover and I didn't see anything else that scored more than about 23. 
>Lila_Crotty: BO 9C BO. +29 187
#note D'oh again.
>Matt_Canik: DEFILMN B2 FILMED +38 239
#note Quackle says FL(EX), I say take the 10 points and extra turnover with 2 unseen blanks. You be the judge. 
>Lila_Crotty: ILO A1 OIL +16 203
>Matt_Canik: ADEFKNU 4H F.ANK +32 271
#note I saw FRANKED, but decided that a. I'm not 100% it's good and b. I like frank better anyway. 
>Lila_Crotty: IIT K3 I.TI +8 211
>Matt_Canik: DEHNSTU L6 SHUNTED +76 347
#note Here is a little more defensive. Watch this next play, it's crazy. 
>Lila_Crotty: ??DEINU 12C UNDE..Ile. +70 281
#note I was kinda shocked to see this come down, then I started laughing. I didn't even think to hold, this word makes too much sense to be challenged. Stupid dictionary.... (Yes, it's a phoney.)
>Matt_Canik: EEIOORU 3E UREI. +13 360
#note Don't like any options here, I like this better than oorie D1 just cuz I won't throw open a lane for no reason. 
>Lila_Crotty: AOP M7 APO +20 301
>Matt_Canik: EGGNOOV N7 GOGO +24 384
#note Blocks all bingoes she has and scores... cleans up the rack a little, too. 
>Lila_Crotty: AEEIRRT O10 RETEAR +23 324
