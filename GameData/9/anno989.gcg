#note In my last two games I had drawn absolute consonant drek against Jan and Winter including lots of duplicate N's and T's.  Unfortunately, some of the emotions from those games were still carrying over when I saw how this game started.
>Scott: AEEIKLM 12G .EALIKE +29 94
#note Scott chickened out of BEAMLIKE, which would have likely won him a free turn.
>Dave: ENRSTVW K11 V.EW +20 47
#note I wasn't too happy to burn my E here, but this is actually a good move, given my alternatives.  I didn't see SWEVEN, but my play sims pretty close to it.
>Scott: GMRY M11 G.RMY +22 116
>Dave: FINORST 15E FORINTS +91 138
>Scott: DDIY D8 .IDDY +24 140
#note Very strange draw for me here, but given how blocked up the board is, it's not necessarily bad.

>Dave: DILTTUZ 6G .ULT +8 197
#note I was proud of this play, and sure enough it is one of Quackle's highest simming moves.  My rack is just not working with this board, and I couldn't find a single play to use the Z.  This makes the rack a lot more palatable, and sets up a nice spot for DITZ, when there aren't that many more I's out there.
>Scott: ?AGINOO 9G .OGONIAl +63 260
#note Scott could have scored more by playing OOGONIA K1 (a bit better is POGONIA, but he wasn't sure of it), but it's understandable why he didn't.  My last play probably suggested to him that I was close to a bingo, and his play seems to make bingos much less likely in response.  Turns out I would have had ZOWIE 2J in response.
>Dave: DEISTWZ 8J DITZES +71 268
#note But he definitely wasn't expecting that in response!
>Scott: ALOSV E4 VALO.S +30 290
>Dave: ?AMNTUW 15M .AW +27 295
>Scott: AGU 10A GAU. +27 317
#note He keeps finding creative ways to milk this board for points.
>Dave: ?EEMNTU 15A EME +30 325
#note I looked for a while and started to get into time trouble, but I failed to find either of the MUTENESS/TENESMUS bingo pair.
>Scott: EEPRU 4B PRE.UE +22 339
#note Here I took an even longer think and got myself down to just a minute or two for the rest of the game, maybe less than that.  I wanted to fish off one for a bingo, but I knew he might hit me with something like FIND/PREVUED too.  I considered NU H5 to block the spot, but I eventually realized my bingo draw was so strong by fishing the L that I needed to do it.  It turns out that every letter I can draw gives me a bingo.
>Dave: ?LNORTU 7E .L. +5 330
#note But it would have been better to play it at 10J for one more point.
>Scott: DFIIN N3 INFID.. +12 351
#note A beautiful play.  He simultaneously blocks the O1 and 3G bingo lines.  It might have won the game for him if he hadn't gotten a bad last tile draw.  At this point I was very close to going overtime and almost panicked in time pressure.  I saw he had only one out, and any decent out in two which blocked it should win.  But in my rush I couldn't think clearly, and it almost took me too long to find something.  He even told me after the game that from my body language he thought I was going to blow it.
>Dave: ?HNORTU B2 TO.H +18 348
#note Not best, but good enough.  Threatens both a 20 point out at H1-H4 and a 15 point out at A6-A10.
>Scott: AAE C3 E.A +15 366
#note AE/TOPHE would have scored one more point, but it's still not enough.
>Dave: ?NRU H1 RUNs +20 368
#note I think I had about six seconds left on my clock at the end.  Scott had probably a minute or two.
>Dave:  (A) +2 370
#note Whew!  What a great game!
