#note Blech. The word CISTERNAE looked familiar but I also remembered there being no nines with four other anagrams. Coming up with NECTARIES/CREATINES/ITERANCES/CENTIARES I thought this should be phony. Well, this was the wrong memory.

>Noah: EFILOSX 5E OX +31 212
#note Wasn't sure what to do here. I considered FOXES 3J, FOX 5J, OX 5E and XI 5J. I liked keeping a strong leave and also not setting up the scores FOXES did, so I decided against that. FOX also set up some higher scores, though not as well. OX was somewhat safe in terms of scoring spots, though still left line 3 open. XI is interesting to set up plays for me on row 3, but that return didn't seem worth it as it sacrifices in other ways. According to a sim, FOX doesn't give up much equity compared to OX -- the scoring spots it opens aren't strong enough to. Also, plays on row 3 help to open the board for me, which seems good here. Interesting rack.

#note Blah...held this for awhile. Wasn't sure about UPChARGE when I played it, and its acceptance by a strong player who's studied all the words a few times made me lean toward thinking it was good.

>Orry: DHOOS 3I HOODS +37 280
>Noah: AEEHLPS H11 SHAPE +44 273
#note I considered AH 2I, SHAPE H11 and ALEPH 15E. Taking out the good scoring spot on column H seemed like a good idea, and so did turning over tiles, as a blank, especially here, would give whoever got it a big advantage. When comparing SHAPE and ALEPH, I wasn't sure. SHAPE makes openings that are easier to close than ALEPH does, and doesn't keep the very useful S, but also scores quite a bit more. It's a tough decision. I might choose ALEPH if I did it over.

>Noah: EILLNUZ 13G L.ZULINE +106 379
>Noah: EILLNUZ --  -106 273
#note Wasn't sure of this word, though I didn't like it, and it seemed desperate enough to try. Ignoring what I did, what would you play here? It's an interesting decision. LAZULI seems pretty cool, scoring well and helping me out if I draw the blank. In fact, it might've been the better decision here. LAZULI and LAZULINE both do the same thing: they polarize the game. The former polarizes toward who draws the blank, and the latter polarizes based on the validity of LAZULINE. However, since LAZULI still gives pretty good winning chances, and I was less than sure of LAZULINE, it may have been fine just to play that. I don't like plays like ZIN here compared to LAZULI at all. DUELLI might be good as well, turning over for the blank like LAZULI does, though it doesn't score as many points unfortunately, it also doesn't make it as easy for the opponent to score.

>Noah: EILLNUZ B10 ZIN +34 307
#note Thought about SOZINE as well here, which could be correct. I'm not sure. It does reach more for the blank, but scores a bit less. Hm. ELLU isn't my favorite leave to keep either, though the E might help a fair bit with this pool.
