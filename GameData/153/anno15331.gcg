#note tricky play, if I'm angling for an open board I can just play GIRLIE at 10D which I don't mind. the top-simming play is pretty fascinating - REI at 10F which bingoes a lot but doesn't give him many points in return. REI is probably a better version of my play.

>JD: CEEGORT L3 CO.GE +16 90
#note I was really kicking myself after the game for not playing COGENT, but it's not really any better of a play because of how many points I give up. CONGEE actually sims best, which makes some sense.
>Amit_Chakrabarti: EENY 8L EYEN +34 101
>JD: ENRSTWW 11J STREWN +28 118
#note pretty even between wren and blowing through the rack, I like turnover given the board shape

#note loved keeping the SH
>Amit_Chakrabarti: EIIPT 15H PITIE. +30 152
>JD: AEHOSUX 14I XU +24 168
#note quackle significantly prefers GOX, I was hoping to save that spot for my SH, but I guess it is a lot more points.
>Amit_Chakrabarti: HI 3K I.H +16 168
>JD: AAEHOSY L10 O.A +15 183
#note counterintuitive but it sims best!
>Amit_Chakrabarti: EMNOQTT -EMN +0 168
>JD: AAEHSTY G5 YA +16 199
#note with only one R, a safe enough play. He's signaling a blank with his last couple of plays, I think, but if he does hit row 4 I can take row 2 myself.
>Amit_Chakrabarti: ?ADORST 4B cOSTARD +74 242
>JD: AEHMQST 9C QATS +37 236
#note at least I'm back in the game
>Amit_Chakrabarti: ?DLMU C3 M.ULD +20 262
#note he already had the blank, really wanted to play through the A but couldn't

#note phew
>Amit_Chakrabarti: OOT E9 .OOT +22 284
>JD: EHLNNSV H1 VEN. +24 308
#note even game, I'm opening a new lane but I really need the points and I keep the SH to score
>Amit_Chakrabarti: ?AAIKLT 2J KA +18 302
>JD: DFHILNS N6 FL.D +16 324
#note really tough decision since the score is even and there are two lanes (the V as well) but this seemed to take out quite a few of the bingoes and give me a shot at outrunning him by playing on row 13. came up with this play under heavy time pressure, quackle seems to agree. phew!
>Amit_Chakrabarti: ?AILNOT 13B NOs +20 322
#note his best is TOLD or LOTS or LINS but it's a narrow 6 point loss for him.
>JD: EEHINS N1 HISN +23 347
#note shine by 2 points blocking his best out
>Amit_Chakrabarti: AILT -  +0 322
#note desperation challenge

#note one of the most interesting games of the tournament for me, many were on this morning
