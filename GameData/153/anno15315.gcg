#note seems like WIT 13b might give him the best chance of getting back in it, this leaves the S open though
>JD: ??EFISY 3B FEiS.IlY +84 252
#note this is definitely an error, I should play to block the 2x2. got fixated on finding the nonexistent 2x2 but dayflies/mayflies looks best.
>Peter: ADEIRST 5D RA.DIEST +86 177
#note the end result of not playing dayflies
>JD: BDEHOOY E9 HOO. +43 295
#note didn't occur to me to tack on the -ED, cuts his bingo percentage from 5% to 3% but I'm up enough that it's fine
>Peter: IIRRUWZ B3 .RIZ +36 213
#note yuck
>JD: ABDEQVY H11 Q.AY +16 311
#note quay basically kills off his bingo hopes for good
>Peter: EGIMRUW F11 W.G +16 229
#note keeping a decent shot at row 2
>JD: BDEFIMV D2 F.B.ED +22 333
#note midrib is the play I was looking for. fibred* could've been costly. Now I like MIB to take out the last reasonable lane on row 2.
>Peter: EIMNORU 14J .OU +3 232
#note fishing a U (dual) has a shot at bingoing next turn, this may give up too many points

>JD: EIINORU O6 URINE +17 440
#note no reason not to empty the bag at this point, but I can also just play LOUIE at 11J
>Peter: ACEILOP 5M COP +15 292
#note he ran out of time but OP at N7 to set up ILEAC looks best
