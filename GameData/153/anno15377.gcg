>Reid: DDEEENV 11G VE.DED +20 52
#note VENDED (31.16%) is #3. DOVENED (32.87%) and DOVEN (31.47%) at 12H are #1 and #2 respectively.

#note #1 play.
>Jason: ACHM K2 CHAM +32 166
>Reid: ADIILOR H11 .LA.D +29 192
#note ELAND (46.11%) is #5. ODA (50.66%) at 15F, DIOL (48.10%) at M7, and ILIAD (46.87%) at M1 are #1-3 respectively. I was going for points here and was uneasy about keeping II in my rack.
>Jason: ALOV M2 OVAL +22 188
>Reid: EIILOOR 8L .LIO +12 204
#note OLIO (44.26%) is #4. OI (48.23%) at N1, LOOIE (46.32%) at N5, and OILIER (45.98%) at I1 are #1-3 respectively.
>Jason: EO J11 .OE +13 201
>Reid: EFIOPRT 2K .O.F +18 222
#note COOF (54.43%) is #5. OF (57.59%) and IF (56.57%) at N1 are #1 and #2. OF (56.37%) at G7 is #3. 
>Jason: GNOST 15A TONGS +39 240
#note With this play, the game was beginning to look like one of those games where scoring was going to outweigh balancing.
>Reid: EINPRTT 12D P.T +10 232
#note PUT (40.84%) is #3. PET (43.99%) at K10 and TUP (41.88%) are the top 2. 
>Jason: EM 14A EM +18 258
#note I interpreted this play as an attempt to tighten the board. 
>Reid: AAEINRT F12 .A. +12 244
#note TAJ (38.7%) is #2. The obvious AY (39.02%) at 76 is #1. AAH (37.26%) at 3I is #3. I was fishing because the board was so close and all this game needed was a knockout punch.
>Jason: EX 1N EX +32 290
#note Jason has now slowly built the lead.
>Reid: AEIINRT 6D RATI. +7 251
#note I really needed a bngo here. According to Quackle 5-min championsihp player, exchanging the I (17.35%) is #1 and exchanging both II (15.65%) is #3. INPUT (15.75%) at 12B is #2. I finally broke down and attempted to open the board, create some tile turnover in order to grab the last blank. RATIO is #50 based on valuations from all choices.
>Jason: BI 5E BI +18 308
#note With the lead, Jason is now just blocking up the board.
>Reid: EEINNRU F3 UN..E +5 256
#note Here I'm trying to create some bingo lanes and play an extra tile for turnover to get the last blank. UNITE (6.78%) is #3. URINE (7.04%) is #2 but just blocks up the board. INURBANE (8.24%) at E1  is merely an improvement on my strategy, but a little too aggressive for my taste. It's #1.
>Jason: GTU 2F GUT +19 327
#note Jason continues blocking.
>Reid: ?EEHINR O5 HER.INEs +60 316
#note HEROINES (20.58%) is #10. COINHERE (31.25%) at O7 is #1. Thats a great play only if I get the S, so the simulations say my odds are great. ETH (26.17%) is #2 at H1 and IN (25.67%) at 1H is #3. 
>Jason: AIPT N11 PITA +17 344
>Reid: CEFIRWW M12 WIFE +34 350
#note Alas no S. WIFE is the #2 choice and has no chance of winning. CRAW at 14L and ETIC at H1 are #1 and #3. WIFE is the highest scoring play of the 15 suggested by 5-min championship player. If Jason gets one of the W or the R, I can with this game.
>Jason: IKRRSU 1H IRK +27 371
#note I was expecting RUSK here, but Jason missed it.
>Reid: CRW 6N W. +13 363
#note #1 play.
>Jason: RSU 15J SUR. +5 376
>Jason:  (CR) +8 384
#note No missed bingos. 13 of 14 plays are in the top 10. 12 of 14 plays are in the top 5. I think this game came down to who had the last S. Overall, I give myself an A this game.
