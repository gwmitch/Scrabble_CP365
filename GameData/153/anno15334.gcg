#note in retrospect, there might be a lot to infer about carl's rack from this play. not playing AVO or OVA at B12 or D12 suggests that he might have an S (hence not playing at 12D) or maybe a glut all consonants as the rest of his leave (hence no AVO at B12). yet he could've just played VINO, which also suggests that he kept an A. what rack can I come up with out of AANOSV that makes sense? he took a long time on this move, so were I kenji or elise I bet I could home in on a pretty narrow range of potential leaves.
>JD: AABBENQ 4D ABBA +18 207
#note likely my weirdest play of the entire tournament. I liked this play because it blocks so much of the board simultaneously, even though I may struggle to play the Q next turn as a result. sorry quackle, can't bring myself to play ABBA at 12D. the only reasonable alternative suggested is BABE at 2G, but his last play suggests another A on his rack to me. Maybe just playing BABE at the same spot is in order (over ABBE because of QAT possibilities with a draw of a T) but it seemed wrong to make such a defensive play and then give him the easiest lane on the board at 2A.

#note I saw this play as playing QUERN to block and saving FW for A6, but quackle loves keeping NQSU here trying to draw for a vowel and hit row 13. I think it's hard for me to stay in control of this board without playing QUERN now but I can buy that I tend to be up by more points on average after FEW.

#note playing one of the esses almost certainly signals the other, hence why I almost played FIG at 2M to conceal, but I didn't want to get killed by ZA. The F is a nice tile on this board, if he opens at H1 I can just play the F at 2M.

#note beautiful play
>JD: ?EEFSTY 5E YE +28 373
#note do I play at N14 to interfere with his lane? there's not a whole lot he can hit but there wound up being a few words (cingular/lingular) that fit there...but putting an E at 15 may make it easier for him to hit a 9! I think I'm fine with my play, and it may help me get spread.
