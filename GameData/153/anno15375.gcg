#note Quak likes WIT 12D better.  I see some merit there, but I still think QI won't fit anywhere next turn.  So adios Q...

#note OK, I'll take this happily...the rack is starting to get fixed.

#note Should have trusted my gut on DOBbINS 15B.  Not only is it 31 more, but it gives much less back.  COWBINDS and WOODBINS are also better than BEDOUINS.  I probably wouldn't have been so damn cautious if I weren't about to go up 130+, but that still don't make it right

#note And how quickly 130 becomes 60.  Anyway, I like VIZIR here, but Quak sim prefers VISE H12.

#note too conservative again.  it does shut down many good bingo lines, but so does HALF 11J, and HALF score a lot more
