#note GLUM/CORONAL looked pretty good but I didn't like the board position much - I figured Joe would often overlap CORONA giving me nowhere to bingo. However, many of my bingos will contain an E (GLUME) and I didn't realize that GLUM took an S. While MUG gives back the least to my opponent, LNRS isn't that great. LUM overlapping CORONA might be better... GNRS is more bingo prone than LNRS.

#note Going for the blanks while keeping the board closed. VI(V)E is even better for defense (stopping -TION bingos) but it scores less and doesn't reach for the blanks. I'm pretty sure I can withstand a bingo after SCRIEVE since I'm leaving only 7 in the bag... I'll be first to act in the endgame with a small lead. Not sure if this is best but I don't see any alternative other than VIVE.

#note This is a really annoying position... SCOOP was a nice play by Joe. I realized that I couldn't empty the bag here because there are bingos through the Z and hooking SCOOP. But the question is, do I block, score, or create a setup? I can't play PI/ID because there are a million bingos off the D. Thought about MIx to force a bingo through the Z, but that still loses more than I would like. Here's what I saw: RIM puts me up 67. If Joe bingoes hooking SCOOP (for 80) then I should be able to survive with a minimum of SCRIEVED/DIVe for 28 (and hopefully DIVA, DIVAN or DIVER for more). Quackle shows me that ZIT might be a better option... 12+31 minimum for MIDIs - 4 for tiles left = +39. 17+28 (for DIVe) - 8 for tiles left = +37 which at this score is cutting it close... a 7 point out-play ties after a bingo hooking SCOOP. ZIT also blocks the Z bingoes... LAZURITE/TOUZLING score 82 (didn't spot these). Another intriguing option is MI, which scores an extra point and gives back way more bingos but for 75 instead of 80. With ZITIs ready to go, I think MI wins more often than RIM?. This position is a head-scratcher for sure... TEACHHHHHH
