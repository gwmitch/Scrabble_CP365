#note mashy is really not my usual early-game style, not sure what possessed me to play it here. yom looks fine. I do not like letting my opponents get to the first bingo, and especially not without having a bingo-ready rack to reply with.

#note it was on this move that it became clear that the rest of this game was not going to go very well. probably should just exchange all of them as quackle suggests in preparation for being down 100+ after he hits 8A, rather than gumming up my lanes.

>JD: ADOOOOR -OOOO +0 143
#note ador would've been a decent beginning to a leave, hence why ajuga sucked. meanwhile, hoodoo is kind of awesome on this play. should've looked for it. with two blanks unseen I should really keep AR and not ADR.
>Mike_Frentz: ?ENNORT L6 TONNERs +73 308
#note nonrioter damn. in this particular universe mike plays rotenone through the O I give him with HOODOO, but there's still no question that's the play.
>JD: ?ADILRU H11 .LIAD +21 164
#note finding hoodoo would've been helpful, now I have no lanes at all. maybe pilau at 2k for the dumb 3x3 lane is worth a shot.

#note putting the f there seemed more prone to miraculous 100 point bingos

#note at least two of my losses on day 2 were the result of fuzzy play early in the game. not to say the results would've been different for sure, but I made choices that left me in desperate situations as opposed to having small opportunities.
