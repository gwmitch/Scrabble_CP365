#note if I won all 3 on the last day, I would finish in the money. Just fishing off the O at G8 sims a little better because some of my non-go racks drawing an A or an E can go down as 8s.

#note it seems to be a consistent hole in my game that I misevaluate what to do with the Q. SHINED is bad news for me because of how clunky my rack is, but I think quackle is right in saying that I should keep the Q and play JEED to block for now rather than giving him a free shot at all those lanes.

#note I saw jennet, which sims best in a void, but didn't want to create that easy S hook. JENNET sims best by ~2 with random racks for Erickson (when he has a 32% shot of having an S) but ~7 points worse if I specify an S in his rack. In reality, since he's played 9 tiles since resetting his rack after bingoing, and the S is much more likely to be retained, I think the odds of him having an S are more like 50%, which makes it a dead heat. in any case I would rather force him to make a more difficult play than just hooking the S and scoring 50.

#note should maybe take the 9 points for BEN at 6M but I figured the E would make me much more flexible down the road, and he may now have to sacrifice to block the I on row 2.

#note lavatory is pretty sick (didn't see it at the time) but there's no way I can let him have this hook

#note drawing the A for 8A is a big deal...but I let holding onto the A become a priority for this turn when really my priority should be to flip over as many tiles as possible in hunt of that blank. even if he already has it, increased turnover reduces the time he has to create a lane for himself. AERO also allows for more random bingos such as 8s that go through the O and hook SIM. a substantial mistake.
>Erickson_Smith: ?BHILLW 2E ..LL +8 287
#note I'm lucky to draw the blank on suboptimal turnover
>JD: ?ABIRTU A4 BIoTA +49 358
#note low on time, wasn't scared of row 1, wanted to seal the deal. if he bingoes I'm probably not going to win anyway. analysis now shows I block PRESHOW and he has nothing on row 1, but I lose to WHOOPIES, WHOOPERS, PERILOUS and SWOOPIER, as well as ENOPHILES. However, he has some other potential high scoring plays (extensions on the right side to OD) such that I don't think it's worth me trying to block on the bottom, and if I play AIRBUS he may still be able to outrun me...short of it is I think my play is fine, especially under time pressure.

#note optimal endgame involves blocking RUSE with FRUMP and leaving OH, but he was very low on time so I made my play quickly.
