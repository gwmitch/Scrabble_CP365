>Inthara: AAAOY -OYAAA +0 0
#note Rack is unknown obviously.
>Reid: EGILNTW H4 WELTING +80 80
#note #1 play is WELTING or WINGLET. Strangely, Inthara held on the play.
>Inthara: OY 10H .OY +15 15
>Reid: AAELMWZ 6H .AZE +33 113
#note MAZE (82.15%), WAME (81.29%), and MAW (81.06%) at 11I are 1-3. LAZE (80.23%) is #14. Nothing special about keeping the M, this is just a careless and lazy play. I agree with Quackle.

>Inthara: AAEE -AAEE +0 231
#note Obviously, rack is unknown.
>Reid: ?ADINNR 15D mAND.RIN +58 347
#note MANDARIN (97.49%) is #3. RAINBAND (98.10%) at 15C is #1 and INLANDER (97.52%) at O6 is #2. I had considered INLANDER but didn't see any difference between the plays.
>Inthara: AEHMR B10 HA.MER +38 269
>Reid: EEEEIOO -EEEIOO +0 347
#note My play is #3 (83.42%). Keeping the O (83.42%) is #2, and dumping everything (87.20%) is #3.
>Inthara: IOP N12 POI +27 296
>Reid: AEIOPSS -  +0 347
#note SOAP (92.53%) at A8, POSIES (91.23%) at A5, and PSOAE (89.08%) at A6 are the top 3. I challenged BICEP because it had been invalid before 2006 and I had forgotten that it had been added in the new dictionary.
>Inthara: ?EIJLRS A4 JaILERS +118 414
>Reid: AEIOPSS 4A .O +9 356
#note According to Quackle 5-min championship player, AWA (33.33%) at 4G, LA (2.78%) at 7A, and AL (0%) at O7 are the top 3. I was creating a second bingo lane. I was hoping to draw a T. JO is #2 based on valuations from all choices.
>Inthara: EIOOT O6 OO.ITE +6 420
#note Inthara blocks one bingo lane. 
>Reid: AEEIPSS A13 APE +29 385
#note I had mistracked here and assumed Inthara had AAEU. EASE at C4 and PEISE and PEASE at C3 are the top 3 respectively according to 5-min championship player. APE is #5 based on valuations from all choices. 
>Inthara: AEU C4 EAU +13 433
>Inthara:  (EISS) +8 441
#note The score was officially recorded as 375. I had added wrong after playing KUNE. No missed bingos this game. 11 of my 14 plays are in the top 5. Challenging BICEP is the only glaring mistake this game. I failed to properly track. Overall, I give myself a B for this game.
