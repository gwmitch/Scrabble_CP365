>JD: ABINNRT 9C RIB.AN +25 97
#note damnit, I always forget whether it's RABBIN* or RIBBAN. he held for a minute but lucky he didn't challenge.

>JD: DENNPRU 1A U.END +27 151
#note burned a lot of time on this move before seeing upend, quackle slightly prefers UN at A1 but I like taking the points on what should become an increasingly closed board
>Greg_Heidler: CEEGIIX 11D EXIGEIC +92 216
>Greg_Heidler: CEEGIIX --  -92 124
#note he went for the bag pretty quickly after this play...
>JD: AIJNPRT 4A J.AN +38 189
#note with my knowledge of his rack I should now play HIJRA at 10B to block EXEC for 49.
>Greg_Heidler: CEEGIIX J7 I.EX +27 151
#note hmm
>JD: EIOOPRT 11B OPE +23 212
#note OPE looks unplayable normally due to the comebacks, but given that his rack must have CEGI in it, none of which fit, it becomes worth playing.

>JD: AIOOORT 12B TOO +36 248
#note phew it worked
>Greg_Heidler: CEGO 12H GEC.O +28 214
>JD: AAINORW K4 WAIN +16 264
#note not 100% sure that my 7th tile was an A. he was fast-playing me pretty heavily at this point. figured I'd try to make a move that tried to interfere with some of the easier bingo lanes as opposed to creating more but it does give a lot of points back.
>Greg_Heidler: AEFOV L1 FOVEA +42 256
>JD: ?AAENOR 3D AmARONE +60 324
#note I'm not shocked that playing AFORE or FORA sim a little better than AMARONE (the only bingo) but under time pressure it seemed better to start getting through tiles.
>Greg_Heidler: FRW H1 FR.W +42 298
>JD: IILLOSU 1L .ILO +21 345
#note I'm no longer up enough that I can just worry about shutting down bingo lanes, but LOUIS at M8 sims very close anyway
>Greg_Heidler: ADI 2H .ADI. +19 317
>JD: ILSSTUY 6J S.LTY +44 389
#note lusty blocks the S hook on GECKO for good but SILTY scores so much (and blocks N1 and O1) that it had to be worth it
>Greg_Heidler: GI H11 I.G +5 322
>JD: GHISTUU G8 ..U +3 392
#note creative lane setup, but from the tiles left he must have either the Q or the Z (no bingo), and I'm fine if I draw the Q...so, TAU it is to block his Q spot
>Greg_Heidler: AELQRSS E1 .A.S +16 338
#note hard to know what to do as him, he was trying to block the cheap Z spot.
>JD: GHISTUZ F2 H. +26 418
#note oops, completely whiffed on the Z spot for 42...low on time
>Greg_Heidler: ELQRS 13F LE. +5 343
>JD: GISTUZ N1 .UTZ +26 444
#note zin!
