>Reid: ??EIIPX H4 PIXIE +34 34
#note #1 play. I was a little irritated to get both blanks to start, but things could always be worse. I wracked my brain for a bingo, so I'm glad I didn't miss one.
>Mack: AERTY G5 TEARY +29 29
#note Nice play.
>Reid: ??EIIIM I7 MI +18 52
#note So I'm rewarded for playing 2 I my getting 3 more I. MI is #1.
>Mack: EELLT 4H .ELLET +16 45
>Reid: ??AEIIQ N2 QIs +30 82
#note While exotic, it's certainly a bingo of which I'm aware. Another huge mistake this tournament. SILIQUAE (81.11%) at K2 is #1. QAT (75.37%) is #2. QIs (73.85%) is #3.
>Mack: FUZ I1 FUZ. +26 71
>Reid: ?ABEISW 9I BAWbIES +75 157
#note According to Quackle 5-min championship player, BAWTIE (83.47%) at 5D is #1. BIKEWAYS (82.99%) at 9A is #2, and BEWAILS (81.57%) is #3. I saw SWABBIE but wanted to maximize the B and unintentionally played the phoney BAWBIES. BAWDIES (#3, 81.57%) and BAWTIES (#5, 81.51%) accomplish the same thing. I got lucky that Mack only held on this play.
>Mack: OOW 10J WOO +33 104
>Reid: ABEEGOU 1G BE.OG +33 190
#note BEFOG (79.64%) is #2. EGO (79.80%) and AGO (79.46%) at 11J are #1 and #3 respectively.
>Mack: NOPR 11K PORN +30 134
>Reid: AAAEMRU 8M AMA +27 217
#note AMU (84.76%) is #1. My play (83.84%) is #2. AURAS (82.77%) is #3 at O5.
>Mack: H J1 .H +26 160
>Reid: AADEIRU O1 AID +26 243
#note AID (87.13%) is #2. DAUTIE (88.16%) is #1 at 5D. AI (85.54%) is #3.
>Mack: EILNOST 12E ENTOILS +67 227
>Reid: AEIJNRU F10 JU. +26 269
#note #1 play.
>Mack: UV J12 .UV +14 241
>Reid: AAEGINR N8 ..A.ING +24 293
#note Yet another game where I miss two bingos. ANERGIA (94.78%) at 2A. MEANING is #11 based on valuations from all choices. I was pretty sure that LUV was a setup, but I couldn't do much about it.
>Mack: FO O11 OF +25 266
>Reid: ADENRRT H12 .RRA +12 305
#note My goal was to block the S hook on LUV. This was not a bad idea. Mack later told me he had a bingo ready to go. According to Quackle 5-min championship player, DRONER (75.96%) and ADORER (72.18%) at H10 are #1 and #3. ORAD (72.70%) is #2.  ORRA is #22 based on valuations of all choices.
>Mack: ACHS 15L CASH +47 313
>Reid: DDEEGNT 13C GED +13 318
#note GED (35.23%) is #2. GENT (35.6%) is#1 at 13L. TENTIE (35.07%) is #3 at 5D. I never noticed the FUZE hook, and while TENTIE leaves a DD and no vowels, its enticing for the score and positioning.
>Mack: LU 11D UL. +14 327
>Reid: DEKNNTT 13L KE.T +22 340
#note Exchanging everything (35.87%), keeping the E (33.40%), and keeping the N (31.75%) are the top 3 choices. I hadn't even thought to exchange this turn. KENT is #2 based on valuations from all choices.
>Mack: DEOORV 2B OVERDO +32 359
>Reid: DENNRTT D1 T.NTED +16 356
#note TENTED is #11. DENT, TENTER, and TENNER are the top 3. Quackle gives no chance of winning. I had hoped to get the A or an S or both. Playing DENT allows the out at F7 of RAIMENT. This results in spread that is 4 points smaller.
>Mack: ACNSY B11 CYANS +26 385
>Reid: NR B1 N.R +3 359
#note NOR is #2 based on valuations from all choices. ERN is #1 at D13.
>Reid:  (EI) +4 363
#note This game was officially scored as 360. I missed two bingos and unintentionally played a phoney. 9 of my 14 plays were in the top 3. Overall, I give myself a D this game. While I had some vowel problems early and vowel scarcity late, missing the bingos loses this game. SILIQUAE was a tough one, but missing ANERGIA is just sad.
