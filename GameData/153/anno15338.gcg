#note I did not see 5G QUEEN here. Insta-played this. I'm not sure which is better. They have similar equities, but QUEEN keeps the board more closed, both by resulting in fewer bingo lanes and making it harder to open the left side of the board. The question is, do I want to play a closed board? Is this a match where I should be trying to get spread? It would help to know Jackie's play style.

#note I played this game pretty quickly, and indeed played the whole tourney too quickly. This time, I missed another good contender, M2 HOGGET. OOH sims better because blocking rows 4 and 6 decreases Jackie's average score a lot. FA could give a lot of information in some cases, but I don't know anything about Jackie's play style and don't know what find of racks he would play that with.
