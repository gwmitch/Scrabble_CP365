>Reid: AIMNNPW H7 PAWN +18 18
#note PAWN (51.31%) is #7. IMPAWN in 6 different positions is better with 8H (56.87%) at #1. I made a bit of a mistake here. I got so focused the leave I forgot about maximising the score.
>Roland: EN I8 NE +11 11
>Reid: IIMNNPU J5 MUNI +11 29
#note MUNI (50.56%) is #5. UNPIN (54.09%) at J5 and 10D (52.42%) are #1 and #2. MINI (52.06%) is #3 at J7. I don't like MINI because of the U in the leave, but UNPIN at J5 is good. I agree with Quackle here.
>Roland: AEHILNS 6B INHALES +74 85
#note INHALES at 11B is worth more, but perhaps Roland is avoiding the dangerous I below a triple letter while the Q is still out. This play is incorrectly scored as 73.
>Reid: CIINNOP K2 CONI +20 49
#note CONI (26.82%) is #8. PION at 5B (29.86%) and PION at K3 (28.83%) are the top 2. NIP (28.25%) at K4 is #3. The CIN leave must be pretty strong. I do like the #1 choice for points. While it blocks things up (which I don't like), there are still plenty of S hooks.
>Roland: AFK 5E KAF +39 124
>Reid: EIINPXZ 10F ZI. +32 81
#note ZIN (23.03%) is #2.ZINE (23.15%) is #1. IONIZE (22.93%) at 3J is #3. IONIZE is just silly defensively. While there are plenty of E still left, I don't like parting with my E that easily. I think my play is best here.
>Roland: AVY 4K .AVY +20 144
>Reid: EINPRTX L3 P.X +28 109
#note #1 play.
>Roland: ?GORTUY C6 .UGaTORY +74 218
>Reid: EEIINRT 8C .IE +5 114
#note GIE (4.7%) is#11. TIGER (5.66%) at 8A, NEE (5.44%) at I8, and REV (5.1%) at M2 are the top 3. I have to agree with Quackle here, TIGER's scoring is too great to pass up and it opens up the board. INE is still a great leave. I played too conservatively here.
>Roland: OV 8A VO... +27 245
#note Nice play. TIGER looks even better now.
>Reid: BEEINRT M2 RE. +22 136
#note REV (2.12%) is #10. ZINEB (3.76%) at 10F is #1. BEN (3.25%) and BET (2.81%) at B13 are #2 and #3 respectively. I agree with Quackle here. ZINEB scores more and has a better leave. I didn't want to part with my R, but there are still plenty in the bag.
>Roland: DEFO 4C FEOD +27 272
#note FEOD at D11 scores more but Roland's choice is better defensively.
>Reid: ABEINOT 12A BA.ITONE +78 214
#note #1 play.
>Roland: BJS B11 J.BS +42 314
>Reid: EGLOOST 3B GOO +20 234
#note #1 play.
>Roland: DET N1 TED. +27 341
>Roland: DET --  -27 314
#note Roland is use to Collins and he seems genuinely surprised when I challenge the play.
>Reid: DEELRST 11B ..LE +28 262
#note #1 play.
>Roland: AAAAC -AAAAC +0 314
#note Obviously I only know the number of tiles exchanged.
>Reid: DELORST K7 OLDSTER +72 334
#note My play is #2 (52.97%). OLDSTER at 13G is #1 (54.92%)
>Roland: EEHI 13I HI.EE +24 338
>Reid: ?AEGLMR M7 GLEAMi.R +63 397
#note GLEAMIER (83.5%) is #2. MEAGRELY (83.87%) is #1 at M8. GLEAMERS (82.73%) is #3.
>Roland: DEIRSTU 14E REDUITS +80 418
>Roland: DEIRSTU --  -80 338
#note DUG (45.50%) at B1 is apparently Roland's best play here. Roland is still having trouble separating Collins from TWL
>Reid: ADQTTUW 2D TAW +17 414
#note This turn was a bit silly. I panicked and mistakenly thought that D2 was a bingo hook, so I tried to block DUSTIER. TAW (79.25%) is #15. QUAD (98.07%) at 14G, TWAT (97%) at N9, and STAW (91.83%) at 10K are the top 3 plays. I had considered QUAD, but again, I thought I was blocking Roland's bingo.
>Roland: DEIRSTU 8M .ID +12 350
#note TOPE (2.78%) at 3J is Quackles top choice here. This seems to assume that I wont blockt he 14 lane. Roland is trying to create another lane.
>Reid: ACDIQTU 14E ACQUIT +34 448
#note #1 play. It has been incorrectly scored as 33.
>Roland: AERRSTU 1E TARE +19 369
#note TARRES is the #1 play here at 1E.
>Reid: D 10M .D +7 455
#note #1 play of 4 possible.
>Reid:  (RSU) +6 461
#note No missed bingos. 13/15 plays in the top 10. 10/15 plays in the top 5. I profited from Roland's dictionary confusion. TAW was a silly play. Overall, I give myself a B+ this game.
