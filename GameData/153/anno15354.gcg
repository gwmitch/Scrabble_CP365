>JD: AEINNOU -INOU +0 0
#note I encouraged Scott to come to CO, at which point he proceeded to beat me as he always does. quackle suggests playing through with union, which is probably right.
>Scott_Garner: BDEEM 8H EMBED +24 24
>JD: AEEHNNS 9H HAEN +24 24
#note sigh, for some reason I convinced myself that EMBED might be phony and stopped looking for bingos. henbanes! not that hard.
>Scott_Garner: ?ADEORV K7 R..OVAtED +74 98
#note entertainingly, my hold on embed led to him spending 6 minutes looking for double-double 9s. I had forgotten how slow scott plays.

#note tricky position, I'm already down a bunch and my lanes are very limited. I liked keeping the P to create hooks on row 7 but I could also do that with the F. FAVE, OFAY and FEY all jumped to the top - fave and ofay both do a better job of opening the board, but OFAY lets him play at 9M and kill all the S hook on the board. FAVE is pretty wacky but it does clear my rack up quite well.

#note ulva way better for not giving back so many cheap points. silly me.
>Scott_Garner: AEEINRT O3 E.ATERIN +74 273
>JD: ?EILPRV 7F LIP +14 207
#note a regular play like PRIVET at 5H seems to give me an insufficent shot at getting back into the game.

>JD: AANNOQY 5E Q. +22 304
#note noway at L2 is a major improvement, allowing me to draw into a better Q play or just get QAT at 5K
>Scott_Garner: EF F10 FE +28 321
>JD: AAHNNOY D11 AHOY +35 339
#note my last correct play of the game, unfortunately
>Scott_Garner: CRSTU C9 CURST +36 357
>JD: AAENNTX 10B X. +25 364
#note with the bag looking uglier and uglier, figured I'd take the quick points and keep the vowels. in retrospect I think WANED to take out JOT at 5K would've been a nice idea, no hurry with the X.
>Scott_Garner: JO 5K JO. +25 382
>JD: AAEMNNT N9 MAN +15 379
#note under huge time pressure already, a play like ASHEN scoring a little bit and holding the M looks much better. but quackle's favorite of NA at G3 might be optimal - forcing scott to come up with a response and not a lot of ways to block. given his actual letters if he doesn't have GNU or GUL or something I think he just has to ignore and make a play like TI. tough to find this play under time pressure, sure would've helped.
>Scott_Garner: GGI G2 IGG +10 392
>JD: AELNNTU H1 UN +8 387
#note the best play here is a tie, requiring a nigel richards-level effort...INLET at 2H increases how much I get for GUAN and also leaves UNAU, requiring scott to play DIRT at J1. We were both desperately low on time, but this play was just beyond me.
>Scott_Garner: DIIRT F1 ID +15 407
#note one of the three winning paths for here, too bad this is so easy for him to play
>JD: AELNT N2 TA. +12 399
#note wheels have fallen off, AWOL at L3 is a 2 point loss.
>Scott_Garner: IRT N6 TI +14 421
