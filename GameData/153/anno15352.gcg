>Dave: ABDEIL 8D BAILED +24 24
>Reid: ILNOOTT D8 .LOTTI +16 16
>Reid: ILNOOTT --  -16 0
#note OTTO (40.91%) at 9D, LOTTO (40.71%) at 9C, and TO (40.47%) at 9F are #1-3 according to 5-min championship player. I meant to play BLOTTO (#5, 39.73%) but I grabbed the wrong tile from my rack and hit the clock. We didn't even go to the challenge table.
>Dave: NNUY D8 .UNNY +20 44
>Reid: ILNOOTT E11 OOT +15 15
#note #1 play.
>Dave: AHOR 7E HOAR +20 64
>Reid: ILNORTW F10 WON +23 38
#note WON (29.78%) is #3. LOW (31.76%) at F10 is #1 and NOW (30.16%) at F12 is #2. I considered NOW, but didn't want the risk. Apparently the TIRN leave is better than the TIRL leave.
>Dave: AGIV 6B VIGA +22 86
>Reid: CEGILRT 6G GIRT +14 52
#note GIRT (25.96%) is #12. GILT (28.02%) and GIRL (27.15%) are #1 and #3 respectively. GEL (27.50%) at 9H is #2. In retrospect, it was probably not a good idea to play defensively when I was behind.
>Dave: DEEH 5E HEED +46 132
#note Great play even though it wasn't a setup.
>Reid: CEKLNSU J2 KNEL. +19 71
#note According to Quackle 5-min championship player, LUCKIE (18.41) at C2 is #1 and is a word I had forgotten. KUNE (18.36%) and CUKE (17.07%) at F2 are #2 and #3 respectively. KNELT is #26 based on valuations from all choices. I really didn't want to use my E, although there were plenty of E left. I like KUNE best.
>Dave: Q C5 Q. +11 143
>Reid: ?COSTUZ 5J .UTZ +26 97
#note #1 play.
>Dave: BERS 2J .ERBS +22 165
>Reid: ?CEIOPS 10F .ICOPiES +70 167
#note #1 play. I considered HOSPICE (36.75%) at 14C but didn't want to give up the easy triples.
>Dave: AAEIRSV K8 AV.ARIES +70 235
>Reid: CEFMNTU 15F FUMET. +33 200
#note #1 play.
>Dave: EOO M2 .OO.E +32 267
>Reid: CDIJNNT 13I DJ.NNI +32 232
#note DJINNI (11.13%) is #2. ACTIN (11.24%) is #1 at 8K and DJINN (10.83%) is #3. ACTIN opens up a bingo lane, but I really wanted to get the J out of my rack.
>Dave: IX N6 XI +50 317
>Reid: CFLMRTY O7 FLY +32 264
#note #1 play.
>Dave: AGP F2 PAG. +13 330
#note Nice play to block off the 3 lane.
>Reid: CILMRTU 2B CLUM. +22 286
#note CLUMP (12.37%) is #3. TRUMP (13%) at 2B is #2, and ILIUM (15.30%) at N11 is #1. 
>Dave: ?RSW L4 S.RaW +45 375
#note A power move that grabs all the remaining tiles in the bag. I had been hoping to get the tiles for VARIATED at B6.
>Reid: ADEIORT 14J O. +16 302
#note According to Quackle 5-min championship player. ODE, ODA, and ADO at 14M are the trop 3. JOT is #18 based on valuations from all choices. 
>Dave: AAEEIT 12K .IATA +20 395
>Reid: ADEIRT 14M TED +17 319
#note #1 play.
>Dave: EE H10 .EE +6 401
>Dave:  (AIR) +6 407
#note No missed bingos. 9 of 13 plays in the top 5. 6 #1 plays. I did have a careless mistake on my first turn. Overall, I give myself a B+ this game.
