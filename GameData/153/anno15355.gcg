#note it cuts into my own bingo percentage a bit, but I read his last play as a bingo leave with an -IN in it, and I figured it would be much less effective if I blocked the -ING ending.

#note kind of a gamble given that he likely has a good rack, could also play NEATH at 13G to blow up the rack...or I could do a defensive fish like playing AND at H10. not sure.

#note could just play pouf, but figured it made sense to do something more proactive that cuts down on his bingo percentages. I like quackle's suggestion of DUI at 13B, the lane on row 14 is definitely easiest for him to hit.
