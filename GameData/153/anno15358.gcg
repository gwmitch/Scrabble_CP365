>Rob_Robinsky: BEHKLOT 8G HOLK +22 22
#note thanks to rob for providing his racks in this exciting round 30 matchup. kwak might prefer bloke here
>JD: ?ADLMOO 7C LOrDOMA +75 75
>Rob_Robinsky: BCEEPRT 6D BEEP +28 50
>JD: EIRRRRV -IRRRV +0 75
#note I considered VERIER, the best of the non-exchange options, but it seemed too crippling in the long run even though it does block row 8.
>Rob_Robinsky: CFIMRTX 8B FIX +43 93
>JD: EEEGIPR 6I PERIGEE +69 144
>Rob_Robinsky: CEEMRTW O4 ME.TER +33 126
#note he mentioned after that he was unsure of creme
>JD: ?BDLNOU M2 BLUD.eON +74 218
#note this seemed like the most conducive to long-term defense of the bingos
>Rob_Robinsky: CEGIIJW D3 ICE... +34 160
#note hoping to draw into a big J play with all the Ns and As left
>JD: DIIIOTU L8 DUI +13 231
#note the leave sucks but DUI seemed to do things that were more positive for the board than exchanging. quackle's favorite by a long way is OUTBID at 2J which I discarded because it creates such a good lane for rob to work with. ultimately, DUI doesn't really drop his bingo percentage relative to OUTBID, which makes sense, and the points are probably too good to pass up.
>Rob_Robinsky: AGIJNOW K9 JAWING +46 206
#note in this case I just so happen to block a 65 point play.
>JD: EGIIORT 13I GE.II +16 247
#note keeping the E would be great here with only 3 remaining. that said, I considered the best simming play in a vacuum, OI at N2, but that play is heavily dependent on having the N on row 13 stay open. Sure, I can hope to draw an N, but if I put in an inference that results in the bottom-right being blocked (a very safe assumptiong with any fish, I think) OI performs much worse. The only play I see that performs decently is ROTI at J10, which scores a couple extra. I would rather not turn my lead into an opportunity to fish, but rather try to close the board and progress from here.
>Rob_Robinsky: HNORTVW 12J W.TH +34 240
>JD: AAEORRT 5I ORA +18 265
#note should probably just play ROAD with all four esses unseen, since ORA sets up SORA.
>Rob_Robinsky: IINORRV 3C V.RION +20 260
>JD: AAEFORT H1 FA.O +24 289
>Rob_Robinsky: AAINRTT E5 T..TIAN +42 302
#note nice
>JD: ACERSTT 10A TEAC.RTS +64 353
#note I laid down transect and then switched it to this. I think transect may be significantly better - TEACARTS allows for responses like TOQUES or bingoing on row 12. but then again, points are points, and he could easilly score his way back into the game, so maby I shouldn't be thinking about disaster scenarios and should just take the points here.
>Rob_Robinsky: AADLORU A10 .ORULA +21 323
#note hard to say what to do here, maybe CAULD hoping to draw an S? quackle's favorite on a sim is CAUDAL at D10 but it's hard to imagine how he can win from there.
>JD: ENNSUVY 2G N.VY +20 373
#note not a whole lot of time to think through this pre-endgame but had 4 minutes. once I saw NAVY it was obvious it was best - blocking QI and retaining the U in case the Q is in the bag. quackle thinks NAVY is a 100% win.
>Rob_Robinsky: ADEQSSY N2 YA +26 349
#note it's really not easy to find, but his best play by 15 points is actually GEDS at 14K preventing my evil setup play of GENU. still, this saves a nice play for him.
>JD: AENSUZ 12A .AZES +35 408
#note unfortunately, my endgame was centered around playing ZAS/WITHS*, and when I suddenly realized with 15 seconds left that that wouldn't work I had to scramble to find a play. the best sequence is the cheeky GENU at 14K creating a setup of GENUA - ZA - ZAS that's not worth it for him to block (he should just play DAISES as he does)
>Rob_Robinsky: DEQSS 10J D..SES +34 383
>JD: NU 14M NU +10 418
#note out of time for the two-turner.
