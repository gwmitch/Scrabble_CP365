#note cbb: no guarantee he's got much after QUIZ so makes sense to keep it tight while I work towards a bingoier# rack.
>Noah: ?AENRSS L9 cASERNS +78 145
#note hARNESS and fARNESS are other plays to consider. I didn't think of the former and for some reason wasn't sure of the latter. (Why wouldn't it be good?) It's probably better to play one of those and not expose the S. Meh.

#note cbb: UDON at 13B is a much better play.

#note cbb: I don't think I noticed the 13K spot yet, as I was happy to open this area of the board. The plays seem fairly comperable here, perhaps a slight nod to a play down south.
>Noah: ?EEINNR K5 REIN +20 212
#note Playing a bingo didn't seem worth it here.

#note cbb: missed NOOSED in the same spot, which has the slight benefit of keeping the A for a Hail Mary at at 7N.
>Noah: AILNRST 7J ..T +6 331
#note This was a tough play. It looked like (HI)T, (T)A(HI)NI and LAIN N8 were the plays to consider. Worth noting is that I just saw Conrad turn over GMP and I threw back the M. TAHINI completely shuts down everything for now, but keeps all consonants on the other hand, which is too bad. This could disadvantage me if Conrad makes a play like D(ADO). LAIN is like TAHINI, but it still leaves a bit open, notably column L, while blocking only column N. Column L seems more dangerous than column N to me, so HIT seems like a fine choice over LAIN, keeping a leave that is more conducive to blocking and setting up my case S. The main plays to consider are TAHINI/HIT. I'm not sure which play is better here. Both run into rare disaster scenarios. HIT might run into a few more but they are still rare and it's definitely the spread play. Seems fine.
>Conrad_BB: AEGNOPP H14 O. +5 263
#note cbb: I was very confused that he was fishing after he had begun to lay down a 4 tile play at N8, before pulling back and dropping the T. Perhaps his rack isn't as strong as it might have been had he not started to block, or he's not giving me credit for a rack dude to my overdraw. So wit all this info, I decdied that going for GENIPAP in case he misses his fish or has to play at G1 was the best course of action. But perhaps I should forgo my own fis and opt for the strongest leave possible and hope for a 3x3 response after his bingo...? 
>Noah: AEILNRS M1 NAILERS +74 405
#note Yeah, he could play PROLONGE or something, but it's almost never going to happen. 
>Conrad_BB: AEGNPPT 2J PAG.N +28 291
#note PET(N)AP or PANGE(N) but it's pretty moot at this point.
>Noah: FIILMOT 1G FILO +25 430
#note Probably LIMO is better since it only makes one E hook.
>Conrad_BB: EEEGMPT 3I PEG +17 308
#note cbb: Making it harder for him to block a potential spread-salvaging bingo.
>Noah: CIIMTUV 4M .UV +10 440
#note Thought about this and REV, and decided on this because fishing would expose his whole rack. 
>Conrad_BB: DEELMOT 7G E. +3 311
#note cbb: Dunno, maybe he will spaz - he's under a couple minutes at this point.
>Noah: CEIIMRT F3 RECIT +12 452
#note Missed CITER. MITR(E) and TRIC(E) are all a little better.
>Conrad_BB: DELMOTT 8A MOTTLE +35 346
#note cbb: well that wasn't very nice or fun. start out the 0-4 morning that killed my Nationals, as I went 2-1, 3-0, 3-1, or 4-0 in every other session the entire tournament.
