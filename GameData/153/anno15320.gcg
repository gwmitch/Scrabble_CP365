#note I was feeling really good after winning my last game with 3 minutes on my clock. quackle likes MI barely, think I like my pick though
>Orry: EEGNSTT 10E GETS +19 19
#note orry said he would've played GEST this turn if he was positive it was a word.

#note deliberated between this and AXE at 12D, eventually the temptation to unload the U proved too great. I can also draw APEX if he miraculously can't hit the X.
>Orry: ELLOORU O1 ROU. +33 153
#note in this case I gave him an easy play where he would've had a tough choice to make.

#note walkover for 95!
>Jesse: DHHNORU 3B HUH +23 227
#note with 3 esses unseen and a play like ELL there was no way I could convince myself to put an H at 2J. but the board may be open enough anyway that I should just take the points. Inferring an S still leads to HUH/HUNH at 2J winning the sim. could also play HUNH at 3A.

#note he's passing up some good points to play defense here.
>Jesse: DEEFNNR 2A FEN +24 278
#note it occurred to me to play DEN to set up EF/ED/FEH for next turn, but that's unlikely to be a sequence that wins me the game

#note the pool was very consonant-heavy, this was a nice way to dump another. quackle loves it.

#note huzzah!

#note the unseen tile pool was ACDDPRST when he fished last turn, so I put the thought of him being able to bingo out of my head entirely. instead I was trying to decide if BYLIVE# was ours or not (nope, and nor is BLIVE# more obviously). Once I decided not to try it I saw a nice endgame sequence where I could say LIVRE for the left or DRIVEL, if I played BY first, so I figured I would do that to maximize spread...and then I saw that BY played at 3L for more points...
>Orry: ACDPRST K7 P.STCARD +91 451
#note brilliant fish by orry, what an ending!
>Orry:  (EILRV) +16 467
