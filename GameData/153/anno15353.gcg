#note icemen is pretty awesome, CEINR is not worth a 12 point sacrifice over ER.

#note almost played lust, which I definitely prefer now as an intermediate option. In retrospect, I would rather get myself into a situation where I can rely on skill to get me back in the game rather than whether I hit my fish or not.

>Lester_Schonbrun: EINRRTT D10 R..T +7 160
#note as so often happens, I'm now consigned to a path of fishing as opposed to being able to score my way back into the game. REMET gives me a nice new lane to hit (playing through the R)

#note I correctly realized that with the dearth of vowels available, it would pay to hold onto AE. I felt good about this play at the time, but using quackle now it looks like VOGUER at 5E might be superior. this is a tricky pre-endgame because drawing the blank seems crucial, but the Q could be crippling. I figured that he might not have the Z eiher given his challenge since he could then just have taken cheap points on row 8. VOGUER accomplishes effectively the same as exchanging, only turning over one tile less and still keeping a bunch of vowels (and the A for the Q, critically), so I can see why it's better.

#note I saw MAiZE for 61 which must be wrong given Q issues. quackle likes TAME at B3 which looks wrong to me even though it does have all the 90 point capabilities - I think it exposes me to the Q too much and it makes the next play easy for him. but it's possible that I just don't have any better alternatives. ME at 14I is not a bad try as a setup play, but I need to score to catch up. MEZE at O7 disposes of the Z so I have tempo to handle the Q if it shows up.
