>JD: EINOTTV 8G VETO +14 14
#note well, part of why I had trouble sleeping was anticipation for the nigel matchup that I knew was inevitable in round 9. every time playing him is a privilege in my book.
>Nigel_Richards: BHRTY J6 BR.THY +28 28
>JD: IIINNTT K3 INTI +12 26
>Nigel_Richards: ?AEEINV L6 NAIVEtE +75 103
>JD: IIMNRST 11C MINISTR. +76 102
>Nigel_Richards: ADNOOW C7 WOOD.AN +36 139
#note classic nigel play throwing the board open
>JD: CEILNOP H1 PLIOCEN. +89 191
#note looking good so far...
>Nigel_Richards: EHO 10F HOE +31 170
>JD: GILPQRR 8A PR.G +27 218
>Nigel_Richards: AEEEGRS 1H .EERAGES +86 256
#note damnit nigel
>JD: ILLMOQR J3 QI +24 242
#note with all four Us unseen this would be a nice time to play through with MOLL at M10. but I did like the off chance of drawing into SLALOMER, which is probably not a good enough reason to make this play.
>Nigel_Richards: FIKU B12 KUFI +30 286
#note interesting gamble
>JD: BLLLMOR 15A L.MB +33 275
#note should definitely add the O, LIMBO gives me a nice new lane and an extra shot at the blank
>Nigel_Richards: ?ADEJSS E2 JuDASES +86 372
#note well after that last play it's academic anyway
>JD: AAELLOR M11 OLLA +11 286
#note with all of the blanks and esses gone I am in huge trouble here. LIMBO would've helped.
>Nigel_Richards: FIX N12 FIX +52 424
>JD: AADEGRZ M3 GAZED +47 333
#note throwing in the towel, quackle likes GAZAR at B4 for the increased bingo percentage (and maybe a shot at LIMBERED) but I don't think nigel ever lets me bingo if he has a bad rack.
>Nigel_Richards: NU N10 UN... +19 443
>JD: AACRUWY N4 WAR +33 366
#note it seemed like it was time to go on the defensive given that last play. quackle seems to agree.
>Nigel_Richards: ADEORTU O7 URATE +20 463
>JD: ACEOTUY E13 COY +20 386
#note 8 worse than COYED. didn't do too much wrong this game, gotta wait until prague to get another shot at the wizard
>Nigel_Richards: DO A12 OD +16 479
#note what a shock, a perfect endgame from nigel
>Nigel_Richards:  (AETU) +8 487
