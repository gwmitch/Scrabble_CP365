#note Actual rack, as Jason was frustrated that he could not play DRAISINE#.
>Noah: AEFSTTZ 7C FAZE +41 71
#note I thought about this, FEAZ(ED), FAZ(ED) and FAZES. Didn't really like FAZES as keeping the S seemed really strong. I played this because it seemed like the points were worth it and maybe because I didn't like the scoring spot FAZ(ED) opened? Actually, thinking about it now, maybe it's a bad idea to open up the column E scoring spot, because he could fish well there. Column F isn't a bad place to fish either, but plays there (e.g. EH) don't score as much as Column E plays (e.g. FA(ZED)). FAZ(ED) also keeps a much better leave. Right now I'm sort of thinking I should've done FAZED. I think I may have overestimated the importance of the spot it opened.

#note This rack was pretty interesting! I thought about W(A)X F10, (T)OWER H11, nEXT(DO)OR 5D and OXTER J1. I dismissed TOWER and OXTER for their mediocre leaves compared to EORT?. I decided against nEXTDOOR because of the poor W keep and very good chance of bingoing next turn after WAX to make up for lost points. One play I didn't consider is (A)X H8. According to a sim it bingos a little more than WAX does while also reducing the opponent's score slightly. They appear to be very close plays.

>Jason_Keller: AEILNST 2E INS.LATE +62 227
>Noah: ADEEGRV 1L DEVA +35 291
#note Here I considered GA(ZED) and DEVA. I played DEVA because it scored more and the DEERV leave didn't seem inspiring on this board. It just doesn't play anywhere very good for scoring or for bingos. This also blocks the row 1 scoring spot. Another option here is EAVED 1K, which scores more than DEVA. That could be a better choice, though slotting ED might be a bit worse than slotting VA.

>Noah: ?AAEGLR E5 GA... +32 323
#note Also looked at LAyERAG(E), but it seemed like I would have a good chance at getting a bingo next turn. Also LAyERAGE opens a 3x3, which I didn't think of at the time but is probably a small factor.
