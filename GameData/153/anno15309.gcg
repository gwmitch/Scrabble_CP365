#note I was playing terrifyingly slow and needed to make a quick move. quackle doesn't think that this play leads to me bingoing more than after OSE 11J, but I think that's wrong...still should just take the cheap points though

#note not 100% sure this was my rack but I don't think I had the J yet. this is less terrible than it seemed after the fact because INSHRINE is not that easy to block. I could just give her the bingo and play something like WEIR at N12 instead. but if I don't think she'll see the bingo this time I give her cheap points!

#note trying to maintain joe for next turn as insurance, but can just go ahead and play jawbone and she'll never beat me by bingoing out
