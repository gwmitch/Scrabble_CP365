#note Bunch of plays sim close. I leaned towards this one for the shot at SUBVIRAL.

#note I can't quite remember why I didn't like the plays at J4 (ISM, SOM) or why I wanted to play here instead. In any case, the best play is on this part of the board: EBON. For some reason I completely missed it.

#note The sim prefers VEXIL, which also blocks all the bingos and takes out the V as well, but increases my score next turn a lot, since I'm likely hooking the S and blocking row 15 with a 4-5 letter word. Yup, VEXIL looks good.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BCHNOSS --  -35 338
#note Man, I know perfectly well that CHON doesn't take an S. I plunked it down and then realized I can block the V if my word is five letters long, so I drop the S and hit the clock. It just completely didn't occur to me that I was making a phony. What an awful time for a brain fart like that!

#note I'm out of time. I spotted ENERGETIC, but didn't have time to see if a play like SNOB gave any eights back.

#note I'm glad CHONS didn't cost me, because that would have been a real shame.
