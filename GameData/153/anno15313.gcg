#note MT: Jesse has 3:03 left to start this game. I wasn't sure whether to try and fast-play him or not.
>Jesse_Day: EIJLNTZ F6 JE.N +27 27
#note JD: this is the game where I showed up with 3 minutes on my clock after standing around outside for half an hour looking for a taxi... after the game I reconstructed what I thought were my racks, not sure they are all right. 3:03 to start

#note JD: I was doing a good job of getting plays down instantly, so I probably had about 2 minutes left at this point.

#note MT: Threw this down and didn't stop to look for the 2x2 for two more pts.

#note MT: Jesse had a full 30 seconds to find the best spot for this tile. How the hell did he play so fast?
>Jesse_Day:  (DGU) +10 451
#note MT: Not much to say about this game. I should have focused on playing my game rather than playing the clock. A well-deserved loss.
