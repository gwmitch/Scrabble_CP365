#note I'm usually inclined to play more open when I have a blank but quackle prefers FREMD to FIND - I guess because FIND creates the A hook. However best by far is the awesome FJORD!

>JD: ?CGLLRR M1 GR.LL +6 75
#note this is kinda volatile given his last play which looks like a fish, but I still like it with the blank in hand.
>Steven_Alexander: ?BCEOSU 10B BUnCOES +87 157
#note augh something looked wrong about this and I never would've accepted BUNKOES but I let this one go! He had BUCKOES here for the same number of points which is a word I don't think I knew. I have a very interesting move on my hands if I do challenge this off - since I have ACEEIR? my best bingoes of DECIARES or DECIARE give him OBSCURER or BOUCHEES for mega-points respectively, so quackle comes up with NAE at F9 for my best move! Also, not challenging is not so terrible here - after DECIARES I still have a reasonable shot at winning, so I should only challenge if I was really sure that it was no good.

#note this is a really lame play. especially with their being so many consonants unseen, why wouldn't I play TOT or TET?
>Steven_Alexander: AX 9L .X.A +41 259
>JD: AELOSTT K10 TO +10 224
#note yuck, I would've bingoed with 2 out of 3 2-tile draws had I played TOT.
>Steven_Alexander: IPRV 12I VIP.R +15 274
#note he's still not really blocking my lanes...
>JD: AEILMST 2J MA +17 241
#note I really needed some kind of new lane so he wouldn't just block column B, and I thought this might be a good enough distraction. Again, with the chronic vowel shortage quackle likes TAMAL at A11 - potentially allowing my rack to get filled in nicely, and maybe catching me up without needing to bingo.

#note as usual, I was a bit low on time by this juncture. In retrospect I think this is significantly worse than either of two options - LAWED or QI. LAWED scores more and gives me one more shot at the U, without which I will lose. There is no real advantage to leaving 1 in the bag because he will almost certainly still out-in-two. On the other hand, QI this turn leaves 3 in the bag, making it harder for him to go out-in-two, and saves a 40 point play for next turn. All in all I think I agree with quackle that LAWED is probably my best shot.
>Steven_Alexander: ABEHNOT 4D BATHE +32 349
#note I'm lucky he didn't have the R this turn for BERTHA. Quackle says he only wins 2/8 endgames and that only BEANO wins more (3/8). However BEANO looks wrong since it only wins if the E, S or U are in the bag - probably the three least likely letters to be there.
>JD: ELQRSUY F12 SUQ +39 382
#note the other SUQ loses! I had to draw the U to win.
