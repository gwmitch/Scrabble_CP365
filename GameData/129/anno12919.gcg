#note wow, cool and volatile play! chris said he did this to make the board as volatile as possible.
>JD: AEEEHVY 11E AYE +42 164
#note no point in sacrificing points to defend one of the triples, but quackle points out HEY at B13 setting up a potential massive play at A12. the sims is very even.
>Chris_Tallman: AAQ 12A AQ.A +28 137
>JD: EEHIIOV 3J OVI.E +8 172
#note VIE at N1 wins the sim since it sets up HIVE/HOVE for next turn. given how open the board already is opening that spot is not a huge deal. crazy that I don't have anything better!

#note oh no, I was totally convinced OVINE didn't take the S! but it does!!!
>Chris_Tallman: GIJ D2 JIG +33 250
>JD: ENRSTUV 15C .VENTS +39 304
#note I figured the S wasn't worth that much because I didn't know OVINES. Even so there are two more left. the alternative is playing REV at C3 for 28 which sims a couple of points better.
>Chris_Tallman: IPU 14E PIU +17 267
#note creates a new lane for him
>JD: ADIRRUW H1 WAUR +32 336
>Chris_Tallman: EKN C3 KEN +38 305
>JD: ADDIIRT 13F ARID +15 351
#note I was trying to interfere with this lane as effectively as possible to prevent him from bingoing. However, given the great pool quackle almost seems to suggest that I'm better off trying to draw into a bingo of my own - ARID is the most effective defensively but still lets him bingo 33% of the time (versus 40% after TRIAD, the sim winner) but playing TRIAD ups my points-per-turn average by 11 next turn, presumably by giving me extra shots at the esses and the blank. Remember that I probably wouldn't have tried OVINES, though.
>Chris_Tallman: EHN N2 H.N +14 319
#note I believe that chris also thought that OVINE didn't take an S and wanted to create a new lane.
>JD: ?DEIIRT N6 InDITER +65 416
#note from looking at the pool the worst case scenario is him having STOWING/STEWING at O4, so I figured I had to block. I wasn't 100% on TIDIERS and I didn't see EDITRIX, both of which outrun STOWING. But actually, my play of INDITER at N6, in spite of being my lowest scoring bingo, wins for all 720 draws while EDITRIX and TIDIERS only win 719/720 because of the worst case scenario: Chris drawing FESSING at O1 for 104, which never occurred to me because I didn't know OVINES. In reality FESSING might be more like a .5% chance since EGINS or EINSS are reasonable leaves after HEN. So I inadvertently made the best play.
>Chris_Tallman: GINOSTW 1L GOWN +40 359
#note I believe that I also failed to identify the only bingo Chris could have after INDITER (again, a 1/720 chance): EGOISTS at 14I. Fortunately, I would still win by 2. In this case I successfully blocked STOWING!
>JD: EFS 8L FE.S +36 452
#note well played to chris. he can play. hope we see him at more tournaments.
