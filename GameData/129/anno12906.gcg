#note kind of a non-intuitive move, but it seemed like a good waiting move on a closed board.

>JD: CDEEIIR G2 ICED +21 60
#note Peter tends to play a pretty open board, so I'm not sure if I need to gamble so much to open a lane. that said, after EPIC all he has to do is play at E9 and I no longer have any lanes at all.

#note it's already not looking very good, but I might as well blow up the rack for 30 points with IRATE or AERIE and see what happens.

#note quackle suggests DEFI at 2D. Sure, why not.
>Peter_Armstrong: ERVY 11K EV.RY +22 350
#note pretty effective defensive move

#note I probably have a chance until he draws the Z here.

#note I could've tried to fish or something, but it seemed pointless. UNWEARY would probably have been a better way to do the same thing.
>Peter_Armstrong: EEEHLST O10 E.ELET +30 469
#note He should play SH first by 3 points - after I block EYELET with GYP I can't actually go out with DW.
