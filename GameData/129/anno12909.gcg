>Eric_Tran: DOU 8F UDO +8 8
#note I think Eric put down DUO at 8H, stared at it for a while and then played UDO at 8F.
>JD: ?CEJKNP E5 PECK +33 33
#note this is an awesome move that really shows the importance of lateral thinking in scrabble! this is not at all the right play.
>Eric_Tran: EO 9G OE +9 17
#note last move I should definitely play JUN at F7!!! it's very defensive and sets me up for lots and lots of points and keeps a very flexible leave!
>JD: ?AEIJNT 6B JAN. +27 60
>Eric_Tran: AILSV 4A VAILS +37 54
>JD: ?AEIPTT C6 .PATITEs +76 136
#note I had forgotten that APATETIC was good. 
>Eric_Tran: GGM 10B M.GG +14 68
>JD: GLLMOSZ 12B L.Z +24 160
#note especially with his last play I liked blocking the E.
>Eric_Tran: AAW 8A AW. +18 86
>JD: GHLMNOS 3B HM +27 187
>Eric_Tran: CEEINRT 5E .RENTICE +74 160
>JD: AGLNNOS 2B SALON +31 218
#note this felt like a really tough play at the time, and I did manage to make my best move that wasn't a bingo...but I totally whiffed on LOANINGS!
>Eric_Tran: EHNO 1E HONE +28 188
>JD: DEGNRRT M1 TREND +26 244
#note I was initially surprised by how bad TREND does on a sim, but now that I look at it the Ns are almost all gone and there are a profusion of As, Es and Is that would go beautifully with my leave of NRT are DREG. In addition, DREG leaves two nice lanes open for me to work with.
>Eric_Tran: EUY B10 .U.EY +23 211
>JD: ABGIRRT A13 BAR +24 268
#note again, with just 1 N unseen IRRT is a better leave than GIRT.
>Eric_Tran: FI 6I IF +28 239
>JD: ABEGIRT 1J BIT.ER +27 295
>Eric_Tran: LO 7A LO. +20 259
>JD: AEEGIOT 2I GATO. +18 313
#note I am glad quackle likes this. it is non-intuitive but it keeps the board tight, scores and with so few vowels left EEI is a reasonable leave.
>Eric_Tran: QSU F10 SUQ +25 284
#note I think he put down the other SUQ and then passed it up.
>JD: EEFIIIO -EIIIO +0 313
#note I thought the F might come in handy but quackle strongly disagrees. I cut my bingo percentage in half by keeping the F, and it combines poorly with the other clunkers in the pool (V W X Y)
>Eric_Tran: WY 3L Y.W +15 299
#note this move is very bad news for me.
>JD: DDEFOUX 7H DEF +25 338
>Eric_Tran: ?AEIORV G4 R.V +6 305
>JD: ADIIOUX 4M .OD +11 349
>Eric_Tran: ?AENORS 11E O.tEARNS +84 389
#note it felt like I had gotten really unlucky at the time, but in retrospect I don't think that's the case at all...in spite of me keeping the board tight eric had all the time in the world to groom a bingo.
>JD: AEIIIUX 12H XI +36 385

>Eric_Tran:  (AEIIU) +10 407
