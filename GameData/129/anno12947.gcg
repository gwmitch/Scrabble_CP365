#note Keeping vowels was important here - ACIDY is not the right play for that reason. I was already low on time from bingo hunting for so long. 2A CAW looks great to keep an I and the vowelly Y.

#note KVELLING or fishes for KVELLING, maybing dumping an S with JOBS/DIF, would have been impossible for me to deal with here!
