#note This seemed like the best of a bad bunch, though sim likes L(U)V. I'd rather play off 4 letters instead of 2.
>Murray_Weber: AGGQU F6 QU.GGA +41 53
#note Cool find!
>Matthew_Larocque: BBEELTX 11E B.BEL +18 35
#note Wasn't too fond of this either, but I didn't know BLEB. It does give me a good X set-up though with (H)EX as a backup.

#note I didn't even think of (EX)TRA, that's a lot of points. Still, I think I have a pretty high chance to bingo next turn.
>Murray_Weber: GIJ 5I JIG +32 131
>Matthew_Larocque: AAINRTT J4 A.T +13 142
#note But, I  draw duplicates. I miss (EX)TRA again. I attempt fishing once more.
>Murray_Weber: HO B2 H.O +27 158
>Matthew_Larocque: AINOORT 13E OOT +15 157
#note More duplicates. I STILL miss (EX)TRA. Now the sim prefers giving up on the rack instead of fishing.
>Murray_Weber: DFI 13A DIF +26 184
>Matthew_Larocque: ACINOPR 14F PAC +29 186
#note There's a lot of neat plays here that I didn't see or didn't know. CIPO(LI)N/PICO(LI)N, (EX)OCARP and (EX)ONIC. I should have just played PANIC in this spot.
>Murray_Weber: EENRTU 15A TENURE +26 210
#note Well I sure got lucky there....

"I'll keep the S."

#note MO(LI)N(E). MID(LI)N(E) is also a word.
>Murray_Weber: AESY L3 EASY +26 236
#note "If only it was always this easy!"

>Matthew_Larocque: DIINRTV 9H DINT +14 224
#note I should have known better than to give him the TWS. I essentially lost the game here. Sim likes M1 VID, 3K N(E)VI. I was pretty sure NEVI didn't take an S, but not 100%. It's hard for me to play anything here without giving him even more back.

>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIRVW I13 VAW +21 245
#note Gotta dump these things and keep the board open. VIEW 3G is another option. V(I)EWIER scores great but I don't think it'll be enough when I'm still almost down a bingo.
>Murray_Weber: ?EFORRS O7 R.FORgES +60 367
#note That's not good news. I held but I was pretty sure it was valid. Murray offered some reassurance by mentioning he thought they used the term in Lord of the Rings. Plus, he had too many other bingos to chose from.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINPRS 2D PANIERS +76 321
#note Really, what do I have to lose by trying this?
>Murray_Weber: CELLNST H1 C.LL +21 388
#note He doesn't really like it, but decides he has to let me have it. Actually, even if he challenges and loses, I still can't win - I lose by 8. But it's a phony so moot point.
>Matthew_Larocque: DIMO M1 MODI +22 343
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ENST) +8 351
#note Ugh. If only I "dint" make that play.
