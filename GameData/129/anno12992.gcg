#note Right spot, wrong word.  BOLA or MILO there.
>Zev: AZ K11 ZA +45 158
>Jason: ILORTTY 11A OILY +31 144
#note I'm not sure of my last tile, but if it was a T, then I should've went with TORY same spot.

#note Went for points.  Considered VAW M3 but was afraid the board would die.

#note I played this turn too quickly, wiped I13 is a big miss.  I was too focused getting rid of my u.

#note Tough call here, I was short of time and chose to fish the wrong tile.  Quackle says fishing off the u gives a higher chance of winning.  Drawing either a T and E would win because Zev cannot block both elytron and rottenly/elytrons.
>Zev: EEIIOTT 15A .OIT +5 411
#note As it  happens he had all those tiles anyways.  He just has to block linuron here.
