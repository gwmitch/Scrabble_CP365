>Quinn: ANOQRRT H8 TRANQ +48 48
#note Optimal.
>Matt: ?ABNOSY 13B BArYONS +89 89
>Quinn: ABORTTY 12C TOBY +34 82
#note  Optimal. BAT(B)OY was also available.
>Matt: COW 14A COW +30 119
>Quinn: AGIIORT I10 TAI +18 100
#note  Ugh, didn't see TAWA#. That's turrible* (turrical?). The best play was GIO anyway, which I dismissed with some nonsense argument. Hopefully I took a long swig of something caffeinated at this point. -8
>Matt: AILR 15B RAIL +17 136
>Quinn: AGILOPR E10 GA.. +20 120
#note Chickened on both GO(BY) and GLO(BY)#. Poor. -7
>Matt: GLNOU G6 GLUON +16 152
>Quinn: EILOPRU F2 POILU +20 140
#note Optimal. (YO)U is co-best for Quackle, but I'm not sure about a one-tile fish on this board, and it's not worth exchanging U.
>Matt: ?AEILOR I2 cALORIE +61 213
>Quinn: EEGIJRU 5B JURE. +24 164
#note Trying to open the board, which Quackle is apathetic about. I'm OK with this play. -4
>Matt: EIPV D1 VIPE. +28 241
>Quinn: DEEGIIV 5I .GIVE +18 182
#note Um, B2 GID(J)EE#. -4
>Matt: DKU C2 KUD. +35 276
>Quinn: CDEHIIN J2 HI +27 209
#note Optimal, I guess. Keeps trading places with CHI(V)IED L2, which I don't like much.
>Matt: AWX G1 WAX +42 318
>Quinn: CDEEINN J12 NED +20 229
#note Quackle is super-pessimistic about my chances now, and Bogowin wants me to just shoot for the moon with NIDE. I don't think so. There's also E(V)INCE to score a bit and open a second lane. NED weakly tries to split the difference. I'm pretty much going to putter around weakly for a few turns, not that it matters much. -6
>Matt: ET H1 ET +30 348
>Quinn: CEEEINS L4 E.E +12 241
#note Why not 6M EE? -5
>Matt: EFO K13 FOE +14 362
>Quinn: CEEIMNS 14F ME +26 267
#note Wow, CNEMIS# is available. New one on me, though I might have mistily seen CNEMIDES# once as the anagram of ENDEMICS. Bogo again wants me to open with MINE/MIEN/MICE, though. -10 vs. CNEMIS.
>Matt: ADEIMST L9 DIASTEM +93 455
#note Well.
>Quinn: CEFINSS 10L .F +5 272
#note I can't win now, obviously. CP doesn't generate this play, and many-ply claims that I never bingo. But +A, +O and +T all draw into multiple bingos that are costly to block -- this is yet another case where I can't trust the equity figure I'm given, and won't consider it. As it turns out Matt makes no attempt to block, but I'm not sure what his rack was.
>Matt: ADZ K9 ADZ +58 513
#note Now now!
>Quinn: CEINSST N8 INSECTS +82 354
#note Optimal. Equity vs. Quackle: -49. I was pretty happy to get out of that set of games with a 2-2 split.
>Quinn:  (HNORR) +16 370
