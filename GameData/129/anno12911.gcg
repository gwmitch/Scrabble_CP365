>moh: AEKLNOO 8G KOLO +16 16
#note 8E OAKEN18 is good, too. I strongly prefer the AEN leave of KOLO over the LO leave of OAKEN, and that's why I chose KOLO.
>carl: AEIRSUV G8 .IVA +12 12
#note I prefer to get ride of the U, especially early when bingos go down most easily. I8 (L)UV 7 leaves the very powerful AEIRS leave; that leave will yield an early bingo very often. I7 U(L)VA 12 has a similarly strong leave (EIRS). 9E VIA uses the same tiles you played for a couple more points, and also avoids opening a 3W spot.
>moh: AACEENT H11 ACETA +32 48
#note I was ready to play CATENAE, but you blocked my only spot. The only other bingos from this rack are (C)ETACEAN and CA(T)ENATE. My ACETA is the best available play by far.
>carl: ?EIRRSU 12G S.URRIEs +80 92
#note 2x2s available were K5 pURISER and fRISEUR, each for 83. All of the bingos from12G are similar: SCURVIER, SCURFIER, SCURRILE, SCURRIED, etc. Your S(C)URRIEs was solid.
>moh: EINSTUU -UU +0 48
#note It's really close here. I7 U(L)U 5 is probably best. Those are the tiles I exchanged, so I guess it's better to score something. 
>carl: ACETUVZ 14F ZE.A +33 125
#note The best play here is M9 CUV(E)E 26. The other decent options are plays like K10 CU(R)VET 22 or even J10 VE(R)TU. What do all the good plays have in common? They ALL get rid of that VU combo, which is just toxic. If you keep it, you're going to pay for it with limited opportunities. And remember, you're going to score well with the Z whether you use it now or not, so there's no hurry. It's more important to keep a balanced rack since thre are multiple spots where the Z can score (14F, 14J, J6, and J10 are all easy to hit next play.
>moh: AEILNST K4 NAILSET +73 121
#note Tons of options. NAILSET, TENAILS, and ENTAILS all tie for top score.
>carl: CEHMTUV J3 METH +34 159
#note L3 VUM 24 leaves a very enticing CEHT leave. Those tiles all work well together. M8 HUMV(E)E 30 is another solid option. Also N10 MU(S)TH 30, although that play unnecessarily opens the O column and keeps the CV combo.
>moh: GLNOOXY M8 OXYG.N +50 171
#note OXYGEN is clearly best based solely on score.
>carl: CFGIUUV L2 VUG +22 181
#note L2 FUGU 27 is the star play here. Your play is among the top three plays though.
>moh: DELORST N2 OLDSTER +72 243
#note The only bingo.
>carl: CFISUUY 15G F.Y +19 200
#note Huge miss: O8 CUIF 42.
>moh: ?EIIPRW O7 REP +26 269
#note O6 IRE 22 is a little better than my REP since I kept the unappealing WII.
>carl: ACIMSUU O1 AMI +21 221
#note I'm not trying to be hard on you, but you have to learn to groom these ugly racks better. This is your second play in a row where you kept UU, and that's after multiple plays earlier where you kept VU. These leaves are just not going to lead to strong scoring on later turns. There ARE plays that score well and get rid of some of the drek. Options include J11 U(R)US 22, 14K MUSIC 36,  J10 AURIS 29, and 14K MUSCA 36. All of these plays get rid of at least one U, and they all score well.
>moh: ?BEIITW H6 BI. +5 274
#note My play here was really bad. The board was closed, so I just threw some tiles out. That's terrible. No matter what the scenario is, my goal should be to find the best play, and here I didn't even try. J8 (O)Bi 15 is probably best.
>carl: CEEJSUU 3H CU. +8 229
#note J10 EC(R)US 31 is best. I1 JEU 16 is intresting, too.
>moh: ?EFIOTW H1 FI.O +30 304
#note Either FOCI or FICO, and nothing else is even close.
>carl: EEHJOSU 6F JO. +28 257
#note 14K JOSH 46!
>moh: ?EINRTW J8 .W +10 314
#note I considered J8 (O)WE 17, but decided to keep the E since I'm so close to a bingo. OWE is probably better than my OW.
>carl: EEEHLSU 1H .EEL +7 264
#note 14M SUE 24, or USE in the same spot. 10J E(T)H(Y)L is interesting, too. Also, why FEEL over FUEL? lesson from this game: U's ARE BAD! Don't keep them without a good reason, like having a Q.
>moh: ?EGINRT 15G ...ING +15 329
#note As I mentioned in the game, I was planning on GENTRI(F)Y. FAYING scores best, and it seems fine to me.
>carl: DEHNOSU 7E HO +14 278
#note HO is fine, but you don't have any of the hooks in your leave (MHO, RHO, THO, OHO, etc.). You probably just need to open the bingo lane and hope to draw one. UDO in the same spot is another option. I'm going to have to play over to it fairly often, and then you should have several bingo lanes along row 8.
>moh: ?ADERTT 2B TETRAD.c +72 401
#note I should have just hooked THO with one of the many 7s I had (TREATED, DETRACT, RATTLED, etc.), but I sort of fell in love with the coolness of how TETRADIC fit with ECU. All the bingos win more than 99.6% of the time, so it's sort of academic at this point.
>carl: DENNSUW 1A WUD +26 304
#note WUD is fine, but it essentially concedes the game. If you wanted to leave a remote chance of winning (>3%), you could play 14M SUN and hope for an unblockable bingo to go out next play. You keep the WHO hook, plus you have columns B and C. It's a longshot, but it's your only shot. If you're trying to maximize spread and not worry about winning, WUD is fine. The best play to maximize spread is 1A NUDE 26.
>moh: AAEIIOQ 8D QI +26 427
#note QI is obvious. It's the only spot for the Q.
>carl: BDENNRS 3A DEB +27 331
#note When the bag is empty, generally you prefer plays that give you an opportunity to go out in two plays. E7 (HI)NDS 18 does this, and over the sequence of the endgame it improves your spread since you go out next play instead of letting me have the extra play and get points off of your rack. Your NNRS leaves allowed me to know you couldn't possibly go out, even if I opened up something, since those tiles don't make any fives or sixes.
>moh: AAEINOP 9A NAOI +16 443
#note My play ties two others for best endgame sequence. The key to to ensure I go out in two and score fairly well on both plays. NAOI scores well, and I then go out with either A7 PA(N)E or E2 (R)APE on my next play. 
>carl: NNRS 14F ....S +20 351
#note ZETAS is best.
>moh: AEP A7 PA.E +18 461
#note PANE (or PEAN) is best.
>moh:  (NNR) +6 467
