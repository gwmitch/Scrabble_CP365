#note I was going to try AXELATE* for a second. AXE is better at D9.

#note I played this thinking ELFS* was good.
>New_Player_2: ABEILOV M13 ALB +17 227
#note Extremely weird play. I guess he was trying to block the triple? In any case, if Jason was right, and these were his tiles, he had O(B)VIABLE.

>New_Player_2: EGILNOV 4D L.VING +22 249
#note Quackle really likes GO/OX here, but there would theoretically be nowhere to go afterward, and he should actually block lines 9 and 10 with VIG C9 or something.
