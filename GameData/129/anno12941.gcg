>E_Tran: AADSTUV 8G VATU +14 14
#note I like keeping my S.  It's better defensively, and VATU sets up my S nicely on column K.  Even without these considerations, I like to try to bingo early, so I prefer keeping my S
>Curran_E: OW G8 .OW +10 10
#note Curran played this pretty quickly.  Strangely also didn't make 9H WO.  I put him on a bingoey leave.
>E_Tran: AACDSUX 7J XU +18 32
#note Ugh.  Missed C(O)XA.  Since I put him on a good leave, I didn't want to make 7I AX to set up a juicy bingo line.
>Curran_E: AGG F9 GAG +17 27
#note Again, played rather quickly
>E_Tran: AACDELS E7 SCALADE +86 118
#note Miracle draw for me.
>Curran_E: ?EHOSTT 6A HOtTEST +74 101
>E_Tran: FGIJOTU B2 OUTJ.G +28 146
#note I was pretty sure OUTJOG was phoney, but didn't think Curran would challenge.  I like that it blocks the juicy x3 lane.  GIFT, JO, and TOFU are other options at D11.
>Curran_E: MV 3A V.M +16 117
>E_Tran: DFINNQR D11 FIN +27 173
#note Wasn't sure on ESCALADED (turns out it even takes an R).  Obviously with a junk leave, I don't want to open the board.
>Curran_E: NOT H10 NOT +11 128
>E_Tran: DDNQRRR -DNQRR +0 173
#note A lot of vowels left; maybe DNR.  A long 3ply sim says DR.
>Curran_E: EINZ F2 ZINE. +34 162
#note Curran put down ZEIN first, then switched to this.  I was afraid he was setting up an A
>E_Tran: BDEEIRU 12H .UBERIDE +74 247
#note Again, not sure on ESCALADED.  If I saw 14B BEEDI, I might have tried it.  Instead, given his threatening play, I thought phoneying here with a bingo was necessary.  It opens up a lot of lanes, so he's more likely to let it stay.
>Curran_E: IQ 11M QI +25 187
>E_Tran: BILNRRS O8 RINS.R +30 277
#note Didn't know BIRSE.  Don't like how RINSER opens up a new bingo line at 14, But really didn't like just RINSE.  I think it's close.  Give the vowelly pooly, I think I'd rather take RINSE.
>Curran_E: ADRY A6 .ARDY +39 226
>E_Tran: ABEEHLM 1D BLAME +51 328
#note So Curran forgot about the AZINES hook.
>Curran_E: OY C12 YO +23 249
>E_Tran: EEEHILN 13H ENILE +21 349
#note Unnecessary phoney.  But he might put an S on it.
>Curran_E: AO 2E A.O +18 267
>E_Tran: EHILOPR N9 LO.. +13 362
#note Not many bingo lines left.  Seemed like a good time to shut down the easiest one.
