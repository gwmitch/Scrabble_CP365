#note the pretty lane that I create that he probably won't see has to be worth something, but taking the points for TOENAIL double-double looks best.

#note leavening is pretty badass if I can find it, as well as being the best play by a couple of points.

#note A couple of other plays that bingo more next turn might sim better, but only by a little bit. I like taking the points.

#note huge play!

#note I gotta wonder if this move didn't cost him the game. I believe he actually had a double-double on column K on this turn, but he didn't think to look there until the next turn...
>JD: ADIPTTU 12A PU.T +18 354
#note nerve-racking endgame! I had to work out how to block his huge bingo of SHIFTER while also successfully outrunning the double-double he had with HORNETS. PUNT, PUNDIT and PANDIT all successfully do so.
