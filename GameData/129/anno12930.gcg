>Matthew_Larocque: ELNNOST -LN +0 0
#note Or just exchange N, which sims a little better. playing NO or ON would have been better with his next rack, though.
>Richard_Charach: KNOWY 8D WONKY +38 38
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINOST F2 ENATIO.S +62 62
#note I was hoping he didn't know the V hook. I really need to study, didn't know SONATINE.
>Richard_Charach: DGIMO 3B DOMI.G +24 62
#note I held, thinking DOMED was an adjective.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFILOSU E7 L.OFA +20 82
#note This play gave me a lot of trouble - I didn't know FA(M)ULI, AI(M)FUL, (T)UFOLI, or even (W)OFUL (without the E). I saw FILA/FILO 2A and though it gave him easy points. FA(M)OUS would have been a lot better. Q ranks my play way down.
>Richard_Charach: IQ 2A QI +28 90
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ILSSUX 4C XU +35 117
>Richard_Charach: HOO D10 OHO +22 112
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILRSS 7H AIRLeSS +63 180
#note I spent an INSANE amount of time here. So bad. There HAD to be something through the T for a 2x2. There's nothing. The highest scoring plays are (T)ISSuLAR and (T)RySAILS for 64.
>Richard_Charach: AENRV 5F .AVERN +18 130
#note Now I know he doesn't know the V hook, so I will probably get a challenge out of him if play it.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEITV 1D DAVIT +45 225
>Richard_Charach: BEP -  +0 130
>Matthew_Larocque: BCEEISU M3 CUBE. +18 243
#note Probably better to play CUBES for 34.
>Richard_Charach: BEP L6 B.EP +12 142
>Matthew_Larocque: EILOSUZ 2H OUZEL +36 279
>Richard_Charach: ANY N4 NAY. +37 179
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDEGIS O1 CIGS +28 307
#note Eh, this didn't feel right, but the S doesn't do much on this board either. Still, ACID EGAD ACED or AGED score well without using up my S. Too focused on UNS and I just had a duh moment.
>Richard_Charach: AELO C11 ALOE +16 195
>Matthew_Larocque: ADDEPTU 3I PAD +30 337
#note I missed the bingo UPDATED, although PAD ranks the same in terms of winning percentage. If I had seen the bingo I would have more than likely threw it down without a second thought, however.
>Richard_Charach: EEW 1K WEE +17 212
>Matthew_Larocque: DEINRTU K9 UNTRIED +70 407
#note I was about to play R(E)TINUED, then switched to this. I'm not really sure what's worse defensively. This gives him a chance to 3x3, so it's probably worse even though 14B plays give him an almost guaranteed huge score next turn.
>Richard_Charach: EEJRR 14J J.ERER +58 270
>Matthew_Larocque: EIMNTTT -  +0 407
#note Ugh. Terrible challenge. I was sure JEERER was no good from having tried it before myself. This was quite the blunder and I only got away with it because of my huge lead. Perfect example of not challenging when you really don't need to.
>Richard_Charach: ?AFGHIR 11H FAR.HInG +64 334
#note His best play is GARFIsH for 75.
>Richard_Charach:  (EIMNTTT) +18 352
#note After UNTRIED I was winning by 195, and then I managed to only win by 45 (- 10 timer). Beyond terrible.
