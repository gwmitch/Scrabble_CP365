#note I figured that none of his bingoes could be worth that much, whereas a play like LIEN might give him a huge bingo on row 1. as it turns out there's only one rack in the entire bag that do give him a win - if he has EEFOST?, in which case he still has to find LOVEFEST! so LIEN ends up being completely safe. That said LIN accomplishes the same thing because it takes out the biggest threat - EVOLUTES 3x3.
