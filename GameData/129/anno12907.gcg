#note I'm surprised that DEF is so much better - I guess when he has the F he scores a lot.

#note I was kind of hoping this would draw a challenge.
>Winter: BY 15A BY +34 208
>JD: AEEIIUV J9 EAU +10 271
#note I really wanted to shut down as many lanes as I could, and playing something like CIVIE or CAVIE that set up an S hook was unappealing. This is probably too weak of a play though.
>Winter: AEELNSU 14F NU.LEASE +64 272
>JD: AEIINVZ 13J AZINE +47 318
#note augh he blocked avianize! there's a major shortage of vowels in the pool so quackle likes ZIN just as much as AZINE. It may also be a little more defensive since it'll be harder for him to hit the NUCLEASES hook.
>Winter: EGKLSU O8 KUGELS +51 323
>JD: AEIRRTV K9 RAT +18 336
#note this is a really hard play. quackle suggests a few different plays like INVAR at 5K, RIVE at 11L or VERIST at L10. I have a hard time choosing between these plays. The V is pretty bad on a closed board like this. Ultimately INVAR jumps out ahead on he sim because it holds onto the case E and T and scores decently.
>Winter: HOW 15M WHO +33 356
#note he has howl for 7 more
>JD: EIMRSVX K5 EX +31 367
#note I was low on time so I threw this down as fast as I could. I can see MIFFY at B11 being better as quackle suggests.
>Winter: AL 12L LA +17 373
#note I was worried about him making this play, but I also knew it would guarantee him a bad rack.
>JD: IMNRSUV 10M VU. +9 376
#note the moment of truth...again, I was low on time so I figured I would put this down and try to work from there, with MA/MU in reserve at the worst. The best sequence quackle can come up with is a 10 point win to me - VIDS at M1 to threaten VUM, then UNPEGGED after he blocks with AIR.
>Winter: ?IIORRR 1C wORRI. +6 379
#note winter had 10 minutes left and ended up using all of them. As I waited I saw that he had wORRIT leaving AIR at 2L as his best out. Then I realized I could play AIMS at 2L to block, leaving me with an apparent 1 point win pre-recount. Then I spotted his winning play...
>JD: IMNRS 2L .IMS +15 391
#note fortunately for me he missed it. It looks to me like he wins if he plays AIR first at L2. I don't have a good block for WORRIT and my best play of NIMS winds up losing by a point.
>Winter: IR 9C RI.. +7 386
#note instead I survived for a 1-point win in the last game before lunch. Phew!
>Winter:  (NR) +4 390
