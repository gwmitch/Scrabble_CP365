#note Hmm well that's unfortunate. 
>Judy_Rommann: AY F9 YA +17 21
>Matthew_Larocque: EELOORS J2 ROSEOLE +66 76
>Matthew_Larocque: EELOORS --  -66 10
#note I knew this wasn't a word, and I knew I shouldn't have played it. But I did. And I scored zero.
>Judy_Rommann: AEEIPRT E4 PEATIER +78 99
>Matthew_Larocque: EELOORS D3 LOO +16 26
#note Sure, I guess I need a wide open board. D1 OLEO makes it so.

>Matthew_Larocque: ABEIORS 3G AEROBI.S +62 228
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEIORS --  -62 166
#note Because I thought she needed another free turn. I think I picked the wrong opponent to try stupid phonies on. No wait, stupid phonies are always wrong. Especially when there's actual bingos available.
>Judy_Rommann: UUW -UUW +0 222
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEIORS D10 BIO +17 183
#note This is definitely not one of my better games. Although I think the final between me and her was the worst one of all.
>Judy_Rommann: ?EINORT 13B OEsTRIN +69 291

>Judy_Rommann: AL 5J .LA. +12 303
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGHHKL N2 FLAK +37 294
#note LAKH! I've never once played that word I don't think, so I'm not surprised I forgot it.
>Judy_Rommann: EGV L1 VEG +15 318
>Matthew_Larocque: CGHHIUW B11 CH.W +24 318
#note Sim doesn't like this too much, but I'm stuck with dreck no matter what. I don't see why I should play UH I2, she'll score big time if she has a D. I see how it sets up WHA but cmon that's not staying open.
>Judy_Rommann: IOQU 2F QUOI. +34 352
>Matthew_Larocque: BEGHIUX H1 B.UGH +39 357
>Judy_Rommann: AZ O1 ZA +38 390
#note Ouch, she's not making it easy to catch up. She announced 37 here. This is extremely significant.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIPRX H13 .IX +30 387
#note Sim says F13 (R)EX wins 100% but she's not going to let me play E(X)PIRE. I would assume the simulation doesn't really help here. It also doesn't even like my play that much. Champ doesn't even list (N)IX as an option.
>Judy_Rommann: ADDFRT 3G T.F. +24 414
#note If she blocks my (E)PEE with DRA(M) and saves T(U)F(A) for next turn, she'll win the game.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEPR 14L .PEE +26 413
#note This will win if I see my best outplay.... which isn't likely given the state of my timer.
>Judy_Rommann: ADDR 14G D.D +8 422
#note Since I'm going to miss my best out, she'll win the game if she plays RA(J).
>Matthew_Larocque: ER 3A RE.. +4 417
#note I can go overtime and still win the game by playing R(O)E. But as far as I knew I was definitely going to lose if I did go over.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AR) +4 421
#note There you have it, I missed almost every bingo and still salavaged a tie.... and I HAD a winning outplay! We both agreed not to recount - I didn't even notice her error until afterwards. Truly preposterous.
