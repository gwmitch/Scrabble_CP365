#note This game was sealed if I'd seen SWIVELL(ED). Instead, this play was my downfall. I didn't even see SWIVEL, cause if I had, SWIVELLED was one small step away.

#note Speedy likes ROE too, but if I'd gone elsewhere I had O(B)TAINER next turn. In hindsight blocking there wasn't the best play.

#note I didn't check or think I was emptying the bag here, and it turns out that there was an O on the ground the whole time, which cost me almost 70 spread.
