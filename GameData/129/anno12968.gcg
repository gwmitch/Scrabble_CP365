#note one playable bingo here. not sure why I played off OY in this spot. I guess to maximize the number of lines open.

>scott: AABEOOY M12 YEA +27 197
#note I liked this because it cuts off his ability to use the bottom right corner (unless he has the K)
>opponent: GGLORTU 6B GOR +19 224
#note looks best
>scott: AABOOPP 4L ABO +20 217
#note Hoping to set up my O with only two unseen
>opponent: AGLMTTU 9A GLUT +13 237
#note GAMBE/GORM, UMBEL/GORM, MUTT or GUT in the same spot are slightly better options
>scott: ADHOPPR 3L POH +37 254
>opponent: AACMRTT A7 TA. +12 249
#note best is LACTAM B9 or CRAM(BE), this isn't that far behind though
>scott: ADDPRVZ 11H PADR. +16 270
#note I'm sure Nigel would try PADI here to try to hit ZIN, but the pool is consonant heavy as it is. Quackle likes PR(EYE)D, which is pretty cute.
>opponent: AACEMRT H11 .ACER +30 279
#note this or CRAMBE/GORM look best. I think just playing AM off somewhere is a good option too considering how junky the pool is
>scott: DDEOUVZ F8 .OZED +35 305
#note Not sure how I missed OUZO. Thankfully this isn't THAT far behind, and gives me some protection if I get the Q.
>opponent: AGMNTTU E11 MAT +21 300
#note Quackle likes GUT/GRIFT here. 
>scott: ADIIUVX 5D DUI +17 322
#note Quackle likes DIVA more, but I'm not going to give up my A. The whole point is that there is only one left, and I can possibly score really well the next turn with pretty ugly tiles.

>opponent: GILNQRT 15A GIN. +27 375
#note this is actually the best move, probably because it devends against JINK/JERK etc.
>scott: EIMORVV A1 MOV.E +30 396
#note VOX first, this is 12 valuation points behind. VOX wins by 22 with optimal play (it leaves the nice LEVIER/MATE), this wins by 10.
