#note Oops, missed ENDOW, WEDEL/N.
>Huguette_Settle: EX I6 EX +39 39
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEENOP J2 PAEON +23 45
>Huguette_Settle: AGJR -  +0 39
#note *shrugs* Ok sure, I'll take another turn! (challenged)
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEKRY G7 KAE +34 79
#note I flip-flopped between this or KAY or EERY/AERY K2. I think I should have taken the 40 for KAY, although with her next play the K2 plays block what she had.
>Huguette_Settle: AGJR 3I J.GRA +42 81
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFRUYY L1 FU.Y +28 107
#note The problem with keeping a Y is that two of them stink!
>Huguette_Settle: IRZ 1L .RIZ +48 129
#note Yipes
>Matthew_Larocque: AEERRUY 4D RAYE. +18 125
#note As meh as this looks, there's really not much going on here.
>Huguette_Settle: ?INORTT I6 ..TORTINg +70 199
#note Wicked!
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEORRU 11G OU.DARER +68 193
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEORRU --  -68 125
#note What can I say..... uh, if I knew DRAY was a verb that might have stopped me from playing a stupid phony. Also did not know UREDO or ORDURE.
>Huguette_Settle: BEIV C2 VIBE +30 229
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEORRU E4 .URORA +12 137
#note Pretty bad. There's better scoring plays here.
>Huguette_Settle: MW G3 M.W +16 245
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEHIIL H12 HI +20 157
#note Two bingos - a flashy 8 through the V, and a 7 that I know but is easy to miss due to the weird arrangement. Hilariously, in the sim 2A HI(V)ED is right behind the 8 letter bingo. I know things are bleak but that takes guts.
>Huguette_Settle: BDEGINU D9 BUNGIED +80 325
>Huguette_Settle: BDEGINU --  -80 245
#note This surprised me since Huguette's spelling is pretty sharp (whereas I have crappy spelling). BUNGEED is phony too, however.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CDEILO D7 mELODIC +76 233
#note Yeah... a little less stylish then bingos such as CLOnID(IN)E or iDIOLEC(T), but it gets the job done. It also sets up an A hook, but it's not like I actually knew that >_>
>Huguette_Settle: BDEGINU F2 BU. +18 263
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIMOQT 11B QA.I +28 261
>Huguette_Settle: DEGINS K5 ED +18 281
#note I think she showed me an S, because I wrote it down on my scoresheet.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHMNOT G12 AH +25 286
#note 14B NEATH. Granted she has an S, but it's possible she didn't know this word. Also, HOM(ER) but I decided to ignore A8 for the remainder of the game.
>Huguette_Settle: EGINS 11I .INGE +12 293
#note Ruh roh
>Matthew_Larocque: DEMNOPT N11 DEPOT +24 310
#note I'm really running out of time here and this is the best block I could come up with. MOP(ER) does better in the sim, but should I really leave that wide open?
>Huguette_Settle: EOST 15L TO.E +15 308
>Matthew_Larocque: LLMNSTV 12M L.V +12 322
#note This draw was painful. I should probably just chuck this and hope to grab one of the other esses.
>Huguette_Settle: NS N1 .NS +20 328
>Matthew_Larocque: FGLMNST C10 G.M +13 335
#note Now I'm just screwed. No matter what I play in this spot, it sets her up. Sim and champ both say 12C G(I)N. What about F(LA)M(E)? I missed that in the game. I should keep the M though and try to get a vowel to play (EL)M.
>Huguette_Settle: AS 13B SA. +24 352
#note She announced 17 here, it seemed a little off. We were both running out of time so it got pretty nerve wracking.
>Matthew_Larocque: FLNNSTT 9I .FT +6 341
#note I didn't write this down, but I probably still didn't have the E, in which case I'd have FLNNSTT. What I should have done here is block (QADI)S with N(AH). This makes the game way closer.
>Huguette_Settle: ACIIOSU B13 .AC +10 362
>Matthew_Larocque: ELNNST 15A S.ENT +24 365
#note I didn't know FEIST was a word, and it's a tricky fit to boot, but it scores 28 points and Huguette can't go out very fast either. I was down to the final seconds and I whipped this down. ENS 6A sets up an out, and she might not even know OSI(ER) to block it. 
>Huguette_Settle: IIOSU F10 IS +19 381
>Matthew_Larocque: LN 14M L. +4 369
>Huguette_Settle: IOU 14F OI +10 391
>Matthew_Larocque: N 5B N. +2 371
>Matthew_Larocque:  (U) +2 373
#note Painful way to end that.... I still ended up going over so 363 was my score. If I block (QADI)S I save a little bit of spread, but it's tough to know if I could win here, she'd have to screw up pretty badly.
