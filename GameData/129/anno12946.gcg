#note Reverse reverse hook bait (aka hook bait)
>Matthew: CEFOOSY 12A FO.Y +46 215
>Will: ADEEIOT 13K AIDE +25 182
#note IODATE does fork the board and leave ED. I wasn't quite ready to throw caution to the wind.
>Matthew: BCEOOSU 6B CUBES +32 247
#note Matthew did not want to risk SIGMOIDS being challenged, and there were no more esses to worry about.
>Will: DEEINOT 15A DONEE +39 221
#note Well, I need these points. Figured this would be a tough challenge - should have done DENOTE, though.

#note Reaching into the bag, maybe trading scoring plays and then blank bingoing?
>Matthew: AELNRRT 15K TALER +24 271
>Will: AAEFGMO 15H FA +32 271
#note OF for 3 more points, AAEGM and OMEGA are too similar prioritize one over the other.
>Matthew: ?BNRRRT 7J BRRR +19 290
>Will: AEEGMOQ M3 GOME. +16 287
#note Stumped by this situation. GOMER threatens L1 Q plays with a good enough draw. Various sims prefer OMEGA by a decent margin, but they don't hate this either. 
>Matthew: ?IKNOTT 4L T.OK +26 316
#note CP likes KOTO slightly better than TOOK, but those are the top two plays by a good amount. I imagine letting that spot stay might let me go out in two using giant Q bombs.
>Will: AAEHNQU O1 QUA.E +54 341
>Matthew: ??INOT O7 pOINTs +23 339
#note Matthew must try SIGMOIDS to win, and he does.
