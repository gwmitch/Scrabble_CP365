#note This opens up three extensions - OUT PRE and MIS. 
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIQRTZ E7 Q.IRT +28 28
#note Wasn't sure if adding -ED was valid. Also thought about QU(I)Z, but thought I could make better use of the Z.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: VVWW -VVWW +0 20
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDENUZ 9C CA.D +17 45
#note I saw other plays that scored better, but I liked the defense and hoped he'd give me something good for my Z. Q says just play ZE(I)N for 29.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: HLOT C9 .LOTH +20 40
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHNTUZ B11 HUED +28 73
#note Heartbroken that I was so close to HERTZ. If I play ZED here and he plays underneath it, I'm left with nothing to work with. HENT is pretty dangerous for the S-hook. TENDU at least opens both of them up, if I could remember that word.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EJ 12A J..E +38 78
#note Well, that didn't work out.
>Matthew_Larocque: IMNTVYZ 9H IVY +15 88
#note 7H instead to throw my M on it for easy points?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EOP 8J OPE +11 89
>Matthew_Larocque: DMNRTUZ 7J TURD +19 107
#note Was iffy, but sim likes it. If he's going to bingo I want the TWS.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AW A14 AW +18 107
>Matthew_Larocque: BMNORYZ 9L BY +16 123
#note I'm still lost. I blanked on (TOY)O. Sim also says MY > BY, probably because I might draw BRONZE(D).
>Siri_Tillekeratne: KU M9 .UK +10 117
>Matthew_Larocque: MNNOORZ 11J ZON. +34 157
#note Finally getting around to playing that Z I saved.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AMX 12I MAX +32 149

>Siri_Tillekeratne: III -III +0 149
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEELN M2 ANELE. +14 208
#note I know I shouldn't be opening, but I don't have an S and I can't block ZAG.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?EFIINT 14D FINITEs +74 223
#note I held for awhile. I was actually leaning towards this being a phony, but decided I'd be in too much trouble if I lost my turn.
>Matthew_Larocque: DIIORSS 15H ID +18 226
#note It was tougher to accept just because I didn't have much of a counterplay here. QUIRT makes the esses a little more valuable, otherwise I'd have just played DIS for 23.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AW 11E .AW +6 229
#note He surely had the blank, or else he'd have played these letters for 22.
>Matthew_Larocque: EINORSS 6B SONSIER +76 302
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AEO D3 AEO. +8 237
#note When he played this I never even thought about the P hook.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEFLOT L1 ALEF +30 332
#note LOAFE(R). This scores more points and really cuts down his bingo possibilities.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?AGOPSS 2B SaPSAGO +79 316
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINOTV H1 V.TE +24 356
#note I didn't know the bingo, but I have to leave it regardless. I didn't see the alternate GONI(A).
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ACEEINR 1A CAN +18 334
>Matthew_Larocque: GINOR 3C G.IN +20 376
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EEIR 15C RE +9 343

#note RO(UP).
>Matthew_Larocque:  (EI) +4 390
#note The QUIRT hook really bailed me out here. Having noticed that Siri got both the blanks here, I checked how many games out of 37 I was double blanked. 14 in total, and I won 8.5! That's some crazy luck. Especially the tie, since I COULD have won, and yet I SHOULD have lost from playing so badly. But I'll get to that when I get to that.
