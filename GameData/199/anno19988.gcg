#note A lot of misses here. A lot of words I didn't know, but shouldn't have missed ANNOUNCE or TONNEAU. I vaguely remember thinking about ANNOUNCE, but thought it didn't play. I must have been in stupid mode, thinking I needed an open C to play it.
>Randall_Thomas: IIOTTU 11C TUITIO. +14 28
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEHNR C7 HEAR.ENs +80 85
#note I saw HERNiAE at first, but kept looking. tHREA(T)EN also scores 80.
>Randall_Thomas: ILORZ D4 ZORIL +38 66

#note AESU > AEOS?
>Randall_Thomas: DH 10H D.H +18 102
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGIOOS B12 .OA +18 171
#note You'd think there was something better here, but sim arrives at the same conclusion. I thought about (DO)GIES for the points, but (K)OA 18 seemed like enough to keep the S for later. 
>Randall_Thomas: FOR A13 FRO +26 128
>Matthew_Larocque: EGIIIOS H10 ..GIES +30 201
#note I'll take 30 points, then exchange next turn if I really have to.
>Randall_Thomas: ESTV G1 VETS +29 157
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIIMOR 1G .IREO +24 225
#note Good because it sets up a word using MI next turn.
>Randall_Thomas: MTX 13G M.XT +24 181
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIIMOP 2J MI +22 247
#note IMPI? I'm never sure what's worse, 3 vowels or 4 vowels + a consonant.
>Randall_Thomas: CDER L2 CRED +21 202
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIIOPU K4 PIU +20 267
#note Randall must be crying for vowels right about now.
>Randall_Thomas: JS 6J J.S +34 236
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEIIOY 12J ICY +18 285
#note IDIOCY!
>Randall_Thomas: V 6D ..V +14 250
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEINO 15G A.IDE +6 291
#note Was starting to get nervous about leaving this S open. Quackle wants to fish. Not sure why I didn't play AIDE(S) instead or something.
>Randall_Thomas: QS E10 Q.S +20 270
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEELNO M1 NEED +28 319
#note Supposedly wins 98% of the time. The bag is pretty ugly.
>Randall_Thomas: AP I1 .AP +17 287
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABLOTY 1M .AY +18 337
#note Simulation likes TO(PED) 4I. Not sure what that leads to.
>Randall_Thomas: AF B9 FA +16 303
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BGLOOT 14K BLOT +16 353
#note Figured this would be better than BLOG to score more next turn.
>Randall_Thomas: AALLNT M6 TALL +17 320
>Matthew_Larocque: ?GO 15M nOG +12 365
#note Oblivious to what he just opened for me.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AN) +4 369
#note Randall had serious vowel trouble which suffocated his racks all game (he told me about it after).
