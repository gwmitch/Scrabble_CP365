#note I of course draw the i back. I'm perhaps overvaluing AINORT here again instead of playing RIOJA or JOIN. Thoughts?

#note I was really happy I found this play. Quackle informs me, however, that I have missed an awesome play for 102 points...can you find it?

#note 06 COENDURING 42 is nice and does several things better than my play: it scores more and it closes off most of that portion of the board.

>Jesse_Matthews: AAEELNN J2 ALANE +17 271
#note The duck absolutely hates my choice. I'm not a fan of leaving the TWS line open or the double-double open if it's avoidable. I opt to take both out in the same turn while scoring a little less. If he does bingo, I want it to be in such a way that I can score back easily and/or he doesn't score much for it.
>Suresh_Chinnaiyah: AEEW 8K WA.EE +36 263
#note This is unacceptable on my part. I know Suresh is a very good player and as such I just automatically assume this is a Collins word. I'm told later by Cecilia Le that it's only WOWEE#. Not challenge is a costly mistake on my part.

#note Right spot, wrong word. DOEK# gets 10 more in the same area.
>Suresh_Chinnaiyah: ?EIORTU O1 ETOURdI. +74 364
>Jesse_Matthews: GKLMOQX 11E Q. +22 354
#note With both Ys still out and three As available, I'm not particularly keen on making any play at C4 or C5 that puts my O beside the TWS. This is also likely to be the last turn that I am guaranteed to be able to play my Q, so dumping it now seems right.
