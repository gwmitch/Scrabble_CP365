#note Quackle's suggestions of I7 FLEE and FLOE and 9E FOE are all unnecessarily volatile for my liking. The play it does suggest over mine that I like, however, is J6 FOUET# for 18.

#note Preferred suggestions are 1G QAT 12 (no way) and exchanging Q or HQ. I realize I'm behind by a fair bit, but I don't think exchanging is better than 37 points...

#note An exchange is much better on this turn. I'm overly concerned with countering any worst case scenario plays involving ABOITEAUX or ABOITEAUS that shut down most of the board. No need for this type of panic so early.

#note A1 INTERWEB# is just friggin' cool. Not sure how I didn't know it, but I didn't. The L8 placement of ENTWINED is much better for points than mine, but doesn't offer the board volatility that I feel is needed for any long shot comeback win. A1 INTERWEB# is the best play, but after that I prefer my placement of ENTWINED for less points and more volatility.

#note My play didn't even make it onto Quackle's list of suggestions and simmed highest once I put it in there. My chances of winning are fairly low unless I can find a way to clear out as much of the bag as possible. He is consonant heavy so my long shot is to go out in two and catch him with enough points to win. However, I had a 100% winning play in the same spot that also didn't make it onto Quackle's list. GNASH scores two more and leaves ET on my rack, and pretty much guarantees an out next turn.

#note Fortunately for me, he is very low on time and blocks the easier of my two out plays.
