>Wayne_Clifford: EIMRTX 8H REMIXT +46 46
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABEHTU K5 HAB.TUEs +98 98
#note Haha, BUTTHEAD. After a disappointing first half, I needed a game where I hogged all of the power tiles. Like this one.
>Wayne_Clifford: AAFV L2 FAVA +25 71
>Matthew_Larocque: AINOQRT 10J Q.IN +33 131
#note Hard to choose between the plethora of Q plays -  I misguidedly played this to set up the T hook for more points next turn. QUINT has got to be one of the most dangerous words to put in this location. I missed the 48 point QAN(A)T in my fixation on the U.
>Wayne_Clifford: GLMO 7F GLOM +20 91
>Matthew_Larocque: AAORSTT N10 TAROT +30 161
#note Even the simulation rejects QUINT plays because of how stupidly easy it is to play almost anything to hook it. (B)OAT sets up my S in a less dangerous way. Wayne must have thought I was nuts. 
>Wayne_Clifford: IPRST O6 TRIPS +36 127
#note I'm going to assume that he had neither an A or an E, and was forced to use the S. I'm going to conclude that I got ridiculously lucky.
>Matthew_Larocque: AISSSWZ 15L WISS +39 200
#note Difficult to chose between this and WIZ for 52. There's a slight chance that Wayne could challenge WISS, so I factored that into my decision. Normally I'm okay with hoarding esses, so of course I immediately regretted not saving them after commiting to WISS. I simulated both these plays head-to-head on 4-ply for 5000+ iterations. WIZ only wins about 0.5% more than WISS, and has 2 more points of valuation. So playing WISS with a slight chance for an extra turn is fine.
>Wayne_Clifford: IILU F6 I.LU +7 134
>Matthew_Larocque: AENNNSZ 6J Z. +31 231
#note Played this too fast, ZEN(A)NA is such a good play. It scores 50 and gets rid of my extra ens. This is just.... le suck.
>Wayne_Clifford: GI 2L .IG +14 148
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENNNS E9 NENE +10 241
#note Now I'm stuck with a turn like this when I could have bypassed it completely. EN(s)NA(R)E gets the nod, which I did not see.
>Wayne_Clifford: BNU D10 NUB +22 170
>Matthew_Larocque: ACINPSY I10 SPICY +31 272
#note Using the S here is unnecessary - many plays score well without using it, such as 1M PAY which I cannot explain how I missed. 12k features sCARY sPIRY and PIsCARY. I didn't know those last two.
>Wayne_Clifford: AEK 1M KAE +30 200
#note See, I should have played PAY.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACLNOR 3K C.ROL +32 304
#note NEED MOAR WORD KNOWLEDGES.
>Wayne_Clifford: EH M12 EH +22 222
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEINO C5 AEOnIAN +64 368
#note VOWEL BINGO. 
>Wayne_Clifford: DIO 8A DI.O +15 237
>Matthew_Larocque: DEELORY B2 REDLY +49 417
#note *PURPLELY, *ORANGELY (YEARLONG). Wayne seemed like he was close to challenging, but he opted to take his points in return.
>Wayne_Clifford: ADFO A1 FADO +36 273
>Matthew_Larocque: EEJOORV 14C OVERJO. +22 439
#note I'm not at all 100% that this is even a word. Wayne bites this time, probably because it would help his spread a lot if this is phony.
>Wayne_Clifford: ADEGNTU -  +0 273
#note Thanks, word judge.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEW 15A WEE +20 459
#note Plays for 23, as Wayne noted after.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ADEGNTU) +18 477
#note I wouldn't call this a well played game, mostly just letters I couldn't possibly lose with.
