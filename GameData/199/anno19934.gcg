>Jesse_Matthews: FINOSTZ 8G FIZ +30 30
#note Saw ZOIST#, stuck with this.

>Azu_Ogbogu: LR K8 ..RL +22 40
>Jesse_Matthews: AEINOPR G4 PINA.ORE +65 146
#note It took a long time to just play PINAFORE and get over leaving that S wide open, but PINAFORE is in fact the only bingo playable here!
>Azu_Ogbogu: MNU F9 MUN +17 57
>Jesse_Matthews: HILNOOT H11 THIOL +39 185
#note THOLI# in the same spot is slightly better.

>Azu_Ogbogu: BW 7F W.B +12 143
>Jesse_Matthews: ?EELNNO 13C NONEL.tE +66 277
#note Totally got tunnel vision with the blank here. Saw NONELITE right away, and then couldn't see anything else. LONENESS at O1 is among the better scoring plays.
>Azu_Ogbogu: DGI 10I GI.D +30 173
>Jesse_Matthews: AEEILTU 7L LATU +17 294
#note Quackle hates my play because of the dreadful leave. However, I enjoy how this blocks up any easy S bingos, and I don't mind exchanging next turn if need be.
>Azu_Ogbogu: ?CDEEIS 15H .ICEnSED +80 253
>Jesse_Matthews: EEEIIWY 12C IWI +26 320
#note H1 YEWEN# 41 is a nice Collins 5 that I did not know. My play sims second best.
>Azu_Ogbogu: ADIQ M11 QAID. +30 283
>Jesse_Matthews: ADEEEYY 14M .YE +27 347
#note YEDE 14K for 26 is better for balance.

>Jesse_Matthews: ADEERVY 4G .EAVEY +36 383
>Jesse_Matthews: DEOORRT (challenge) +5 388
#note Nicely cleans up my rack. I'll take the nickel too!
>Azu_Ogbogu: EFMU 5K FUME +33 341
>Jesse_Matthews: DEOORRT 2C REDROOT +64 452
#note Quackle doesn't like bingoing, likely because he could have a huge bingo play after mine to go out and win the game. There's no particular inference to be made after his play, so I just decide to go for it.
