>Avery: EGRRSUX H7 REX +20 20
#note This game weas played 12/17/2014, and I was simultaneously studying for final exams. I probably made a bunch of errors.

Yep, I did. Totally missed XERUS, but this isn't too far off. XU keeping two R's seemed unpalatable.
>dongately: DEGLNOU I2 LOUNGED +67 67
>Avery: DGQRRSU 3G QU.D +24 44
#note I suck at these positions. Is burning the S really worth it? GRRS seems better than DGRR.

#note luckbox
>dongately: AEIILOS 6E OI +10 95
>Avery: AFHMMOY 4K HAMMY +47 177
#note Is HM - 4  better than FO + 4? Seemes like HM won't get me anywhere on this board, but FO won't necessarily either. I say take the points.
>dongately: ABEIILS N2 IA.B +16 111
#note I think I would have played LIMBI here.
>Avery: ABFOORS 3L BO. +23 200
#note oh, O1 OFAY. This is fourth. Wasn't even thinking about things like AA and OI.
>dongately: ?EILSST E5 ..LEcISTS +66 177
#note nice
>Avery: AEFIORS 12C OF. +12 212
#note Not sure what in the world I was doing, but O1 is better.
>dongately: ?CEPTWZ C11 C.Z +28 205
#note ZEP 13A?
>Avery: ACEINRS O4 .INCE +34 246
#note I noticed Joel Sherman was observing my game, so I thought hard about this turn. I don't like D12 FA, and besides that, this is a clear winner.
>dongately: ?AEIPTW N8 WIrETAP +77 282
>Avery: AANRSVY 14A NAY +30 276
#note Is it worth it to burn the S for 15 more when I can possibly draw into a bingo? ARSV seems like it will bingo often enough to take the risk. And if he plays on the left side of the board, I feel like something like VASA will be more beneficial.
>dongately: AAEHNOP 15A AH +26 308
#note PHONE or OPAH - this is about 10 points off
>Avery: ADDORSV 8A DROV. +39 315
>dongately: AEELNOP O12 ELAN +24 332
#note M9 PENAL or PANEL. This play is about 10 down again.
>Avery: AADEEIS 6M AI. +16 331
#note 13A ADZES is sick. This seems just about as good as anything, and static likes it.
>dongately: EEFOPRT M13 POT +25 357
#note I immediately noticed FORETOP when I typed this rack in, and I think I would play that.
>Avery: ADEESTT J8 ESTATED +69 400
#note Totally blanked on LEUD, but wanted to play an OWL3 word.
>dongately: EEFGIRW K11 WIFE +40 397
>Avery: AIKNNUV L10 VAN +24 424
#note To my surprise, a lot of plays win 100%.

I think my version of Quackle has the numbers and letters for notation on different axes, so I'm not going to type out all the winning plays. I'll say that mine is third, and I didn't see it due to time pressure.

>Avery: IKNU B6 KI.N +18 442
#note Joel pointed out KIF at 4J or D10. Whatever the board says. 11H UNAWAKE is cool.
