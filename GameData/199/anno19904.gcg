>Randall_Thomas: HOO G6 OHO +23 23
>Matthew_Larocque: AHIJKNU F4 HAJ +55 103
#note HAKU is cool, but it's probably better to just take the extra 9 points for HAJ - I doubt I will make good use of the J hanging on to it.
>Randall_Thomas: AEIRS I3 RAISE +38 61
#note Randall might have another S, but I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't. He seems to generally take points rather than fish around, at least it seems that way in the games we have played.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABIKLNU E3 AUK +31 134
#note I had intended to write down how long I took on each play for these tournaments, but between tracking and racks, it was a lot of writing. I did write down 18:54 here - the first two turns didn't take long, but it took me awhile to see AUK for some reason. KIBLA(H) is 40 points which I missed, but AUK makes it pretty hard for him to score points. Close call.
>Randall_Thomas: TTUU J7 TUTU +13 74
>Matthew_Larocque: BIIILNO F8 BLINI +14 148
#note I'd rather go for turnover with a rack like this, because there's no good leaves that really justify playing short. It also takes out a semi-easily hookable two. 
>Randall_Thomas: MNOO E10 MOON +22 96
>Matthew_Larocque: CEILOOR G10 COLE +20 168
#note Maybe ZAIRE is too many points to give up, and HAET takes the S anyways so there's already danger on that side.
>Randall_Thomas: DENV D1 VEND +40 136
>Matthew_Larocque: DINOOQR D12 NODI +22 190
#note I ate up a huge amount of time on this turn - which would be a huge problem for me later. I'm trying to remember my logic for not playing the Q. Part of it was killing this hotspot before he got to use it, and the open U made me feel better about keeping the Q for another turn. Sim prefers ROOD as the non-Q play, but either way I'm opening a second 3x3 lane. Obviously I put too much thought into a turn where dumping the Q should be the automatic play. This wins about 7.5% less often than QUOIN/QUOD after 2000 sims 4-ply.

#note Didn't even see PROSIER, although I might have been unsure of playing it. I do know PROSY, but I might have confused it with similar words that don't compare. Missed some better plays here still - (VEND)OR is a good fish, (ZA)IRE still available for 28. In fact, playing off OR anywhere is probably better, but nothing really comes close to the bingo. Huge 20% chunk of win percent gone.
>Randall_Thomas: IIII -IIII +0 198
>Matthew_Larocque: IILORSX K4 SIX +35 265
#note Quackle's sim disagrees with me and thinks I should just play XIS H13 for 39. I like that SIX partially obscures the open R. A lot of bingos start with S as well, giving him a TWS bingo. However, if he hooks onto COLE, it won't score as much and chances are that I will be able to counter-play him pretty hard. Hilariously, H13 XI is the sim's second choice. There's still another S and two blanks, a little more risky than Quackle seems to think. Granted it's hard to block if he cannot use it.....
>Randall_Thomas: FIST 15C ..SFIT +33 231
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGILOR L8 GO.IER +18 283
#note I opted to play off a bunch of letters here and close the board. If Randall doesn't have the blanks yet, it would nice to grab one or both. Sim agrees, but also likes (Y)OGA. Naw....
>Randall_Thomas: DV 12K D.V +7 238
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGLRTU I10 .UAG +16 299
#note Didn't even know GAULT - N11 for 20 points.
>Randall_Thomas: F 14B F.. +14 252
#note I think I'm in trouble now.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABLPRTW K9 W.L. +26 325
#note Took me awhile to see this neat play, which scores and keeps my only vowel, and doesn't give Randall a chance to bingo (unless he has an unlikely word ending an O).
>Randall_Thomas: EIN M12 .EIN +18 270
>Matthew_Larocque: ABCEPRT N11 CAB +20 345
#note I think was slightly into overtime here, and this seemed like a pretty safe play that should clinch the game. Unfortunately, the problem with this play is that it leaves one in the bag. (Yes, that's a bad thing in this case).
>Randall_Thomas: A 3C A.. +6 276
#note Because Randall can do this.
>Matthew_Larocque: ELPRTTW -  +0 345
#note I spent like 3 minutes trying to figure out the best way to deal with this. Then I decided that his rack was far too flexible, and no matter what I played, he would still bingo out. It turns out that passing does in fact still win the game without time penalties. Also, a handful of plays score enough to stay ahead of his bingo.

#note -40 points for overtime. A very unfortunate turn of events. But props to Randall for getting the win.
