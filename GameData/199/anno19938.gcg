>cesar: AFILNWZ 7H FLAW +24 47
#note FLAW seemed right and left a small chance at a huge score. FANZINE is probably the right play though - or maybe even just ZINE? this is a tough move because i didn't know what XU implied.

#note ugh terrible outcome
>cesar: DIJNRTZ J5 TZ.R +33 80
#note this is an interesting move. i really was tempted to do JERID 2K and hope to hit the Z spot next turn.

#note -1.5 .. 10B JO will keep a better leave (slightly) and not give up as much? i need to bingo.

#note ugh. i wonder if this is actually the right move. these draws are annoying this game.  i suppose i could exchange and go for the blanks/Ss but why not score 21 points....

#note i don't know what my other tile was. this is probably wrong but i need some luck.
