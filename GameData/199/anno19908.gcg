#note Already showing my pitiful lack of Collins knowledge (VOGIEST# works) and it's just Turn 1, lolz

#note UNCOWL# is cool, didn't know it - BLOWN sims second best here. BAWN# D1 was also considered but I passed on it.
>Chris_Cummings: AER D1 .EAR +22 121
>Jesse_Matthews: AACEILU 9G ALA +20 183
#note Due to the lack of rack balance Quackle obviously hates my play. I saw 9E AUA and 9C AECIAL right away but didn't want to offer free points to the TWS unless I could at least break even on average for points with my move. Of the other options that don't offer the TWS to my opp, 9G AA is probably the most appealing. What would you do here?
>Chris_Cummings: ?AABEFM -?A +0 121
>Jesse_Matthews: CDEEEIU 10F CIDE +30 213
#note I saw 10F EIDE and 10G IDEE#, but decided to keep on going for points. Opp seems likely to bingo with an exchange of two so might as well just aim to outrun it. Additionally, YOW with the E hook allows for some kind of play involving CE- or -ICE- next turn to dump vowels if necessary and still score decently. Es are starting to run out so I don't mind holding onto more than one here.
>Chris_Cummings: ??AALOR D6 OLeARiA +63 184
>Jesse_Matthews: EFIIIPU C11 PFUI +26 239
#note This is probably the only play worth making besides exchanging.
>Chris_Cummings: EX E11 EX +39 223
>Jesse_Matthews: EEIINTY L1 YIN.E +34 273
#note 14B YITIE# is suggested as better, but I don't like offering a free TWS to my opponent when unnecessary
>Chris_Cummings: IPS 1L .IPS +27 250
>Jesse_Matthews: EFGIRRT 8A GRI.F +24 297
#note C2 REFIT is 11 more points, but I like the balance on my play better for bingoing on this board. With few Es left, I don't want to give mine up unnecessarily. 
>Chris_Cummings: BDQRTVZ 14B Q. +22 272
>Jesse_Matthews: EEIKORT 2K K.TE +26 323
#note With his last play I can assume he has no i, and probably ES at the very least (YIPS makes no sense otherwise). I need to at least make 8s harder for him, and without an i on his rack I don't need to worry about -ING bingos to the G. Taking out this lane makes the most sense to me.
>Chris_Cummings: DI 15A DI +20 292
>Jesse_Matthews: BEINORU B6 BU.RO +15 338
#note Ok, so he drew an i after he played the Q. Lucky for me, no -ING bingo. He's still clearly pretty close to one though, so I'm going to take out the other lane for 8s.
>Chris_Cummings: LMOT A10 MOLT +11 303
>Jesse_Matthews: ADEGINR 3L .ANG +21 359
#note Bingoing is almost certainly wrong here since it empties the bag. He's clearly sitting on a great rack and a bingo out from him would likely lose me the game. YOWED or CIDED, however, are both better options than my play because they keep me a great leave and don't empty the bag. I was trying to get closer to emptying the bag while keeping a decent leave and scoring well, but AEGINR is too good to pass up.
>Chris_Cummings: TV H7 V...T +9 312
>Jesse_Matthews: DEIINRZ 10F ....R +10 369
#note Now I know he has an S, if not both. I want to try to force him to bingo in a way that offers me points back with my Z and at the same time minimize his scoring. Taking out the JETES lane without emptying the bag seems to make the most sense.
>Chris_Cummings: ADEESST 12H SEDATES +79 391
>Jesse_Matthews: DEIINRZ 11K ZINE +54 423
#note DZEREN# is cool, didn't know it! My play is also enough to win. Shaky start for me.
>Chris_Cummings: U O3 .U +4 395
>Chris_Cummings:  (DIR) +8 403
