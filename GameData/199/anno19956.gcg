#note i just learned the word FUNEST. i would have challenged that in a heartbeat. Quackle likes FLAT keeping a nice TUNES leave.. probably, right? i don't know why i play like this sometimes. (-3.5)

#note i got really paranoid about the potential for a huge score on lane 4 so i decided not to play BARONG... but ugh, the star play here is the beautiful C1 MENORAH. I also thought MEHRAB* might be a word. It's MIHRAB. (-9)

#note this could be a blown game. DIDY/YIRD/EDDY win 100% but i was paranoid about LAEVO and didn't figure out that every tile draw wins for me with those plays. I have a 5 letter word at 10B every time which will outrun anything from H11. so I went for LYaRD and hoped I drew a vowel... how come it's hard for me to focus? all I gotta do is go through the 8 possible draws and I had enough time.
