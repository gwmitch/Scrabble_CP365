>Jesse_Matthews: ADDQRSY O8 R.ADY +39 67
#note O8 REDDY# 42 is slightly better. 
>Michael_Akonor: AELMORT G3 METRA.OL +74 141
#note Nice find by the Scrabble god Akonor...sounds kinda Nordic doesn't it?
>Jesse_Matthews: ACDMNQS 11C DAMNS +36 103
#note H1 DAMN accomplishes the same purpose of scoring and keeps my S. Sloppy play here from me.

#note The great Akonor continues to smite me.
>Jesse_Matthews: ACDEIOR E7 RACE.OID +63 200
#note This one goes out to Lucas Freeman. I play this knowing it doesn't take an S, and besides that it continues to open up the board for a long shot comeback.

#note I'm back in this!

>Jesse_Matthews: EFFJLSW 13D J.FF +21 303
#note A lack of Collins knowledge hurts me here. 5B JIFF 42 making FOUD# is much better. I was so tempted to play JEFFS#/RACEMOIDS*, but I assumed that he would know RACEMOID doesn't take an S. Surprisingly, he told me that he thought it did! I couldn't imagine he'd let an 80 point play stay on the board if he wasn't sure of it. 
>Michael_Akonor: TTUY 4K .UTTY +28 342
>Jesse_Matthews: AEELOSW H13 SOW +36 339
#note This is on top along with 14B ELODEA 39. I like dumping the W though, and S is not particularly vital to keep on this board.
>Michael_Akonor: HKLT 5A TH.LK +29 371
>Jesse_Matthews: ABEEELU 14B BLA.E +36 375
#note My winning chances are not particularly high given the lack of consonants in the pool. My play scores the most of all considered here, but a play like M2 BATELEUR# 22 dumps more vowels as needed.
>Michael_Akonor: AEGIOPR M8 P.OGERIA +72 443
#note Bingoing in that pool? Only by the power of the great Norse god Akonor!
