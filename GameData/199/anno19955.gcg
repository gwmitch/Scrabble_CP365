#note crackle prefers UPON L3 for the superior leave. i always play hyper volatile against JD for some weird reason that i don't understand. (-2)

>cesar: IOQRRST 7G S.Q +44 247
#note i was really tempted to play 15D or 12D QI but in the end 44 pts is just too much to give up and there are still 3 Ss unseen.
>jd: AEFILVZ B7 F.AZIL +38 255
#note quackle likes B7 FRIZ or 10E EF slightly more 
>cesar: EIORRST M2 RIOTERS +77 324
#note this is a lucky draw, not gonna lie
>jd: ?AEERSV 2G AVERrE.S +74 329
#note damn it jd. I write down AVERtERS, he says "the blank is an R", so I go to take my turn then I'm like wait, did you say the blank is an R? and he says yeah and has already drawn >_< ... I'm not sure I would have challenged though...
>cesar: ABINOUY 15A BUNYA +48 372
#note in the end BUNYA seems to not be worth the extra 8 points, according to quackle. However, look at the bag - it's very not vowel heavy and I was worried about drawing a very unbalanced rack.. plus the 8 extra points over BAYOU can't hurt, right? (-2)
>jd: AABEIOO 10B .OEA +18 347
#note quackle seems to like the very aggressive N11 ABOIL best. I wonder if that's right. ZOEA seems ok too.
>cesar: FILOTVW 1D WOLF +19 391
#note for some reason quackle prefers 12A FLOW. I think it's wrong. It's by like a % point.
>jd: ABDGGIO O10 BAGGI. +12 359
#note best play by far
