#note Duck prefers 7G OY. I suppose less can go wrong with -ESSTU than -EST?

#note There's just no excuse for being this sloppy. 14H STATURE is just fine.
>Terry_Kirk: AEHL 15L HEAL +44 174
>Jesse_Matthews: AAQRRYZ A14 ZA +45 171
#note Curiously, 13L YARR# sims higher than my play.

>Jesse_Matthews: AENQRRY 13L YARN +29 200
#note 13J YARER 35 or L2 ERRANCY 32 are both better than my play.
>Terry_Kirk: ITX 8M TIX +34 276
>Jesse_Matthews: AEEEQRR M6 Q.. +12 212
#note This was not a rack than I needed to play through by any means. Dumping EEQR is perfectly fine, should've gone with my first instincts.
>Terry_Kirk: IILV J5 VI.IL +9 285
>Jesse_Matthews: AEEENRR 5G NER.E +16 228
#note I like this over NEVER because it creates a lane above and below. NEVER only creates one above and is much more easily blocked.
>Terry_Kirk: DFI 4F DIF +22 307
>Jesse_Matthews: ADEGOOR L1 GORED +28 256
#note As Nigel Richards would eventually tell me later on in the tournament, "you play much too fast...slow down and consider each play." In my hastiness to keep the board opened for bingos, I missed the bingo I'd just drawn. Game losing play right here.
