#note Many options to chose from here. I thought BROOMY was phony, so that cancelled out a chunk. I initially played BU(M)PED K6, but thought PIE was a better leave than AI. The hotspot created after BUM(P)ED was also less desirable. Quackle's standout play is 9I PIU, although that could lead to a staircase. I've never played Mark before, so I wasn't sure how to approach the game.
>Mark_Peltier: AQT K3 QAT +31 59
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEIOPW M3 DOW +24 46
#note Quackle says it's a toss-up between POW/DOW at M3 or 7G. I assumed that PIED would be a better leave than DIED. I left the 7G spot alone since I'd rather wait for him to use it and hope I can score with a counter parallel play.
>Mark_Peltier: AENO 7F AEON +11 70
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEIPPR E5 DIPPERs +101 147
#note Yikes. That was lucky.
>Mark_Peltier: AHI 9H AHI +25 95
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHNOT D4 NOH +20 167
#note I didn't like this play when I made it because it seemed like there had to be a better play I was missing. It should have occured to me that the N helps my leave, so fishing off OH makes more sense.
>Mark_Peltier: MOST 8A STOM. +36 131
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGTTW B6 WA.T +15 182
#note Sacrificing points for defense, probably too many. The S makes it too easy to bingo, I thought.
>Mark_Peltier: CERST F4 REC.ST +44 175
#note He originally said something like 52, and that seemed like way too many. After several attempts at recounting we got the real score.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEEFGT A8 .EG +6 188
#note I didn't see any plays that I liked very much, so I tried to muck the board up. Quackle says I'm better off to keep EEGT?.
>Mark_Peltier: AILX C2 AXIL +29 204

>Mark_Peltier: AEEJ D11 AJEE +23 227
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEEGGR 14D .GG +9 231
#note This seemed like such a silly play, but it keeps a good leave and there's only two Os left.
>Mark_Peltier: AK 13C K.A +17 244
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEEEIR 4F .EC +8 239
#note Tricky bingo here, but it doesn't score very many points. I didn't want to waste time making an opening that was easily blocked - while giving him free points. If he decides to play down to the C here, then that gives me a floating letter at least. Not sure why I didn't play REE instead though.  
>Mark_Peltier: FLO H1 FLO. +27 271
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEIRSZ 2H .EZ +32 271
#note I missed FRENZIES! I did pass up the sevens here though, in favor of LEZ.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIINRS 13G .INERIeS +72 343
>Mark_Peltier: ADIRU -  +0 293
#note Mark didn't know VINERIES.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILNOU 12L LOIN +17 360
#note Kind of choked here. I just wanted to find a play that took out the floating S, and didn't give him any easy opportunities to bingo. Q goes with 10J LIEU.
>Mark_Peltier: ADIRU O7 DURIA. +21 314
>Matthew_Larocque: BEENTUV G3 B.N +21 381
#note He did hold LODEN, but it's still a bad play. I couldn't see ELOIN for some reason. VE(R)TU guarantees I go out next turn. 19 spread points lost assuming he makes the same play next turn.
>Mark_Peltier: ILNRSU 6K S.N +24 338

#note 14I for 13 points.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (RU) +4 404
#note -10 time. Second blank bingo rescued me.
