>Jennifer: BDFGIOR H7 FOB +16 16
>Zach: HNO G6 NOH +18 18
>Jennifer: DEEGIPR I8 PEG +20 36
#note Why does Quackle prefer PIG or GIP at I8, keeping DEER? Isn't it better to not have duplicate E's and keep DEIR?
>Zach: ACR F8 CAR +18 36
>Jennifer: DEIMRWW 11C WIDER +24 60
#note I thought about playing WIDER at D11, which Quackle slightly prefers, but I didn't like putting the R above the 3WS.
>Zach: ?EILORT 12F RETInOL +73 109
>Jennifer: ABDMRTW 11K WAB +28 88
#note Wish I had known that BAWD was a word. MADW(O)RT is cool.
>Zach: EGOV D8 VOG.E +26 135
>Jennifer: DEMRRTY 13A MERRY +30 118
>Jennifer: DEMRRTY --  -30 88
#note Sigh.

>Jennifer: DEMRRTY 13K TERRY +25 113
#note T(AW)DRY at C9 is nice.

#note Here's what happened:

- In my brain: "Hey Jenn, you just studied all the words that end in PT and remember looking this one up. It opens the board, sort of, and keeps a decent leave. Let's do it!"
- I hit the clock.
- I immediately remember that CHOPT* was among the PT words I looked up that is not good. The salad shop is bad, and so is this word. 
- Zach holds and correctly challenges.

#note Consolation prize: Zach creates a bingo lane for me.
>Zach: ILOT 15A LOTI +23 258
>Jennifer: ACDEJRU 13A RAJ +44 247
#note I almost played JAR before I realized I could flip it around.
>Zach: EILNNOT J9 LO +14 272
#note I spent a lot of time after this play trying to convince myself that BELD* is good.
>Jennifer: ACDEEIU F4 CUE +11 258
#note I was really unsure what to do at this point. I was behind, but I didn't want to open too much and give Zach high scoring spots. This is Quackle's third choice, after ADIEU and DEUCE from F2. I also considerd ECU in the same spot for a long time, but thought it was better to not leave an E hanging out there for Zach to easily play through.
>Zach: EGINNQT -  +0 272
#note Zach exchanged. I don't know what his rack was.
>Jennifer: AADEEIQ 4D AE.IA +16 274
#note Another turn when I was not sure what to do. Quackle prefers A(C)E or EA(U) in this area. I was really low on time at this point and kind of freaked out.
>Zach: ?EINNST K3 INTErNS +68 340
>Jennifer: DEFGIOQ J3 QI +24 298
#note Quackle hates this and wants me to exchange.
>Zach: IKNS L3 SKIN +46 386
>Jennifer: DEEFGOS B8 FE. +15 313
#note Desperately low on time here.
