#note playing ENSTYLED# probably would've not gone very well. good thing I passed it up.

>Jerry_Lerman: AARSTTU N3 TATA. +22 202
#note I didn't even realize the massive benefit of TATAR here - it blocks the R and makes him even less likely to bingo.
>JD: ?ACGO H5 GO... +13 166
#note he told me later he had a C on this turn.
>Jerry_Lerman: EENRSTU 8E RE... +18 220
#note not a very good time to miss tureens. lol.

#note lucky to draw another bingo. but Q says I might as well play SUPINATE.

#note yikes, I really sucked at the end of this game. VOLUMED is the play but OVUM would also be better.
>JD: DIIMP 3B .IMPID +26 338
>Jerry_Lerman: CDEMRSU 2F MERC +27 366
#note must block Q spot, even if it wasn't a setup.
>JD: IQ 10J QI. +32 370
>Jerry_Lerman: DEHKOSU J1 UH +33 399
#note it was looking good. I can save my K to score with next turn.
>JD: AEEFILR 13E .ALEFIRE +68 438
>Jerry_Lerman: ADEKOOS M11 KOS +42 441
#note I can come pretty close, but I only gave myself a minute to figure out how to block INN and go out next turn. best sequence is KOA at 7C and then DOSE to go out, but he will easily see QI/IN/IN for the 4-point win.
>JD: INN 6D INN +13 451
#note went over by 2 minutes.
