>Dave_K: RTY 8G TRY +12 12
>Suresh: ABEEOOT J5 OBOE +19 19
#note I was considering BOOTEE at the same place but couldn't resist a good leave like ATE with OBOE.
>Dave_K: ELOOY K3 LOOEY +29 41
>Suresh: AEEEHTZ L6 ZEE +33 52
#note I did see HEEZE for a nice 40 odd points, at this stage of the tournament I like to keep things a bit tight, its the last game after 23 gruelling rounds. Dave had lost 6 games in a row before this. I can't let him have easy plays off my Z on to the triple. Pllus I didn't want him to score big with a WHEEZE or a PHEEZE. If it was earlier on in the tournament I would have played HEEZE without any hesitation.
>Dave_K: HIOW L1 WHIO +34 75
#note Didn't I tell you.. He did have the W... I hypnotised him into a trance and had a peek ..
>Suresh: AEGHIPT H7 G.APHITE +65 117
#note Well I had to play the bingo even though it leaves room for a dangerous reply with an S hook. 
>Dave_K: ?AIVV 15D VIVAs +84 159
>Suresh: EKNSTUU 14H .UK +17 134
#note If I had known PUKU I would have played it. KUTU seemed a bit meek with only 10 points. The Q yet to come, so TUNES seemed a reasonable leave.
>Dave_K: AFGU 11D FAUG. +24 183
#note When I saw him put down the F and then the A, I thought it was game over.. FAITHERS is coming down for a nice 100+.. instead it was FAUGH.. I was still smarting from Vannitha's CORDOBAS for 140 a few games before. 
>Suresh: AELNSTU M8 ELUANTS +68 202
#note Good pick up, ELUANTS is more defensive than LUNATES at the same spot. A potential bonus from Dave would have to end with an N. Won't play INSULATE at H12, gives away good floaters for 8s.
>Dave_K: EX 10E EX +52 235
>Suresh: EELMQUW 11K QU.LM +32 234
#note I spent a lot of time contemplating this move. QUEUE at J10 is a very volatile move, gives easy access to the triple lane, my leave is also not very good. QUALM gives a good leave. I ddn't want to play a tame move like QUA at K11, need to keep the pressure up and throw away tiles to get a blank or S. 
>Dave_K: ADGIN 1J DA.ING +33 268
>Suresh: DEELNRW O11 .EWED +36 270
#note Pretty straight forward move here. 
>Dave_K: IN 12K IN. +21 289
>Suresh: ?DFLNOR 15J ORF +16 286
#note OK need to brush up on my nines. FLORIDEAN at E4, rank 270 in terms of probability for 9s. mere mortals like me have to settle for less.
>Dave_K: CEISSTT 12A CITES +33 322
>Suresh: ER O1 .LIADINe +80 366
#note missed a big score here too. INDICIAL for 140. Well, I was happy to spot a regular 8 like GLIADINE.
>Dave_K: RRT B11 T.RR +8 330
>Suresh: AAEJNNO 2F JNANA +35 401
#note pretty straight forward move.
>Dave_K: BPR H1 B.RP +33 363
>Suresh: ACEIMOO A7 OOMIA. +32 433
#note I was half sure of COMICE, so didn't want to risk it.
>Dave_K: DERSST N3 STED +23 386
