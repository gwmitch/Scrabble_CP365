#note For reasons unknown to me, 9C EAU is significantly stronger than my play. Any ideas?

>Rafal_Dominiczak: EMNRSTU (challenge) +5 126
>Jesse_Matthews: AEINOSU A5 OU +9 132
#note Debated A7 OZEKI# 20 (which sims a little below), but decided to stick to the stronger leave.
>Rafal_Dominiczak: EMNRSTU I2 STERNUM +65 191
>Jesse_Matthews: AEEGINS 5D GESNE.IA +86 218
>Rafal_Dominiczak: DEHOW 2I .HOWED +42 233
>Jesse_Matthews: ACDELNP 1K PANEL +39 257
#note PANED and NAPED are preferred in the same spot. I kept the D for GESNERIAD plays, assuming my opponent would not know it. I was only partially correct; he had seen the hook before, but did not think of it during the game.
>Rafal_Dominiczak: AGL 3K LAG +27 260
>Jesse_Matthews: CDDIPRR L5 DRIP +21 278
>Jesse_Matthews: CDNNRRY (challenge) +5 283
#note Right word, wrong spot! I didn't know ALAP#, but that would have been the ideal spot for DRIP. L1 AWARD is also interesting - I did consider it, but wanted to dump at least one more consonant.
>Rafal_Dominiczak: UV D3 VU. +14 274

>Rafal_Dominiczak: OX A13 .OX +36 310
>Jesse_Matthews: DGIINNR 8L .IRN +18 331
#note 3A DRIVING 28 is better. DGIN is not good enough of a leave to warrant sacrificing points.
>Rafal_Dominiczak: AV 3B VA. +18 328
>Jesse_Matthews: DEGIJNN F2 JIN. +27 358
#note His last several plays indicate fishing. He seems unlikely to use a blank (not sure if he has both, but at least one seems almost certain) to make a D word and hook JINS, so I've at the very least left myself scoring next turn with the last D in my rack, and in a best case scenario I'll have a high scoring bingo up there.
>Rafal_Dominiczak: ?AFLORT O5 FRO.TALs +60 388
>Jesse_Matthews: ?DEGNST M7 D.NGiEST +79 437
#note M6 EDITINGS# 81 is better. Besides logging a few more points, it doesn't offer bingos back to the T like my play does.
>Rafal_Dominiczak: CEEMSTW 14J BOW.IE +34 422
>Rafal_Dominiczak: CEEMSTW --  -34 388
>Jesse_Matthews: CEMST J8 SECT +17 454
#note N12 STEM is better. Scores three more points, and leaves CESS, TEC and CID as options to go out next turn.
