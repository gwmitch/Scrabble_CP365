>Matthew_Larocque: EEKLNUW 7H LEKU +14 14
#note Kind of an agonising turn trying to find the middle ground between defense, points, and leave. Quackle vehemently disagrees after about 62 iterations. Never a good sign. Q warms up to it after about 1000, but likes 9F NEWEL leaving KU or 9E KNEW keeping ELU. I thought LEKU made it pretty hard for him.
>Christopher_Sykes: EEGINRV I6 V..EERING +65 77
#note I thought.
>Matthew_Larocque: CELNOTW -  +0 14
#note Christopher sort of implied he was guessing when he played this.
>Christopher_Sykes: ?ADGHNS 12D DeASH.NG +82 159
#note I don't think too many Scrabble players would be confident on VENEERINGS.
>Matthew_Larocque: CELNOTW 11B CLOWN +33 47
#note I'm in a giant hole, my only real concern now is taking any points I can.
>Christopher_Sykes: BRU K9 BUR. +14 173
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIJTY 13C JETE +34 81
#note bingo draw with IIY let's do this.
>Christopher_Sykes: AW 9G AW. +19 192
>Matthew_Larocque: AFIIRTY 14I .RATIFY +32 113
>Christopher_Sykes: BI 13M BI +21 213
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEIMTX 10I .X.DE +29 142
#note VENEERINGS wasn't even occuring to me as a desperation phony, which is too bad considering it's actually a word.
>Christopher_Sykes: DEINST O8 DENSIT. +41 254
#note What was his seventh letter? Possibly an O.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGHIMT B7 GAMI. +12 154
#note Trying to open some space by setting up AGAMIC. But this gives up m-m-m-monster points if he has a Z play. And still pretty big points with other letters. I guess I didn't want to play out a losing game in a crawl space of a board or something like that.
>Christopher_Sykes: AMP A8 PAM +41 295
#note Yeah.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAHITV 6B AVA +21 175
>Christopher_Sykes: OOZ N6 ZOO +35 330
>Matthew_Larocque: AHILOPT 5D POH +20 195
#note Instead of HOP/HOLP because POH is easier to play off of. I might be better off to just leave this alone, though. C8 HILL/HALL score 27.
>Christopher_Sykes: EFST 4B FEST +26 356
#note That's not good.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIILLT C2 LI. +6 201
#note Let's fish for something random.
>Christopher_Sykes: ?EIOQRU 2A bE.IQUOR +86 442
#note Obviously I should have reconsidered LIE because, you know, he might play BELIQUOR. Shame on you Matt.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNTU 1H ALUNITE +80 281
#note If I draw the last S, then this game looks marginally less embarrassing.
>Christopher_Sykes: ADIS O1 SAID +45 487
#note CRUSHED
>Matthew_Larocque: CEORT 4K CORE. +16 297
#note I wasn't 100% on RECTO, thought it might only be RECTI. Not sure what I had to lose by trying it, though.
>Christopher_Sykes: EOR L8 RO.E +12 499
>Christopher_Sykes:  (T) +2 501
#note I won the first four games, then lost all of that spread in one loss.
