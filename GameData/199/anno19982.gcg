>Zach: BERV 8E VERB +18 18
#note I kept thinking there must be a cool front extension on this, like AD(VERB) but long enough to hit the 3WS.
>Jennifer: EFIIJOS E6 JI.E +14 14
#note Quackle wants me to play JO(E) or JO(E)S. Why would I ditch the S like that and retain 2 I's?
>Zach: CEIRR 10D CRIER +24 42
>Jennifer: CFIMOOS D10 .OIF +18 32
#note I saw FICO, but couldn't remember if it was good. It is.
>Zach: FGNOU F2 FUNGO +30 72
#note I held, but this looked too weird to NOT be good.
>Jennifer: CEIMOSV 11B CO.S +44 76
#note Quackle prefers M(O)S or MO(O)S, holding the CEIOV or CEIV leave. I do not understand why. I don't usually like to have V and C on my rack.
>Zach: AILP 2B PILA. +20 92

#note Missed MEOW @ G3 and MOME @ 1A.

>Jennifer: ADHNOTW 5I DHOW +36 264
#note After I played this, I thought maybe I should have held the D to hook on to DAZE. Quackle prefers DHOW to HOW.
>Zach: BK 10L K.B +25 303
>Jennifer: AILNSTY O8 NASTILY +93 357
#note Kind of worst case scenario for Zach. But it's not over yet...
>Zach: EP C11 .PE +24 327
>Jennifer: DHINOSU O1 HOUNDS +48 405
#note Quackle was smarter than me and recognized that if Zach bingoed, I would be in trouble. So Quackle blocks the A3 lane with (G)UIDON. Instead, I play HOUNDS and think I'm finally going to end my 15-game losing streak. If I was going to play from O1, I should have played UNSHOD instead of HOUNDS, but I didn't know UNSHOD was a word.
>Zach: UX N3 XU +20 347
>Jennifer: ?IIOOTT G13 TOO +14 419
#note At this point, I'm thinking that I need to block the bingo lanes. I see three lanes. To the H in row 1, through the E in row 14, and through the W in row 15. But wait, what about the lane down from G at A3? I saw that lane earlier and thought, "I should do something about that sometime," but then I forgot. I only saw the bingo lanes in rows 1, 14, and 15 at this point. I considerd TOOT(H) at K1, but decided to block rows 14 and 15 instead.

Quackle likes OI at N14. I'm not sure why, unless it's because Quackle thinks I'm going to bingo next turn. Unseen tiles are AEEGINRTTU.
>Zach: AEEINRT A3 .RATINEE +80 427
#note Ah, crap. I empty the bag by pulling GTU, finish my tracking, and realize that Zach has AEEINRT. Wish I had blocked that G lane. Zach bingos out and my 16-game losing streak continues.
