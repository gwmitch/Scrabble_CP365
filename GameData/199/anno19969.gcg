>Abie_Cromanty: ACEINN 8D CANINE +22 22
>Michael_Fagen: ?EILOPS E5 POL.rISE +86 86
#note I am posting this game because it is the first where I managed to score over 700 points. This and SEPALOId score 86. 
>Abie_Cromanty: KU 12C KU. +14 36
>Michael_Fagen: EEHLOTY F4 HEY +34 120
#note I think I saw the F6 hotspot first and was tunnel visioned on using it. It wasn't until too late that I saw the same word plays at G7 for five more points. 
>Abie_Cromanty: AM 13B MA +20 56
#note Not sure what AM wasn't played for 4 more points.
>Michael_Fagen: EILMOTU 14B MEOU +31 151
#note Best. 85% to win
>Abie_Cromanty: CEORS 15E SCORE +23 79
>Michael_Fagen: BILOOOT 7G BOO +21 172
#note Best
>Abie_Cromanty: GITW 6H TWIG +19 98
#note There are 3 places the same word can be played for more points. 
>Michael_Fagen: LT J5 L.T +9 181
#note Don't remember what I kept here but it was a strong leave.
>Abie_Cromanty: AAJNW 4I JAWAN +34 132
>Michael_Fagen: DINORST 10B DIN.TROS +65 246
#note I was fairly sure DINITRO was an adjective but having played Abie before, I didn't think she would challenge. The best valid play is LID for 25.
>Abie_Cromanty: T 6D T.. +6 138
#note I guess she didn't see T(HEY).
>Michael_Fagen: AAOPTVZ 3K AZO +44 290
#note Quackle suggests VAPOR but AZO is good enough. 
>Abie_Cromanty: OX 9B OX +37 175
>Michael_Fagen: AELPRRV A6 PERV +40 330
#note Best
>Abie_Cromanty: H 5E ..H +8 183
>Michael_Fagen: ADELRTU 3B ADULTER +78 408
#note I was feeling quite greedy when I put this. I knew it wasn't a word but also knew she likely wouldn't challenge and that I would likely have nothing to lose. 
>Abie_Cromanty: BDGIINS 14I BIDINGS +80 263
>Abie_Cromanty: BDGIINS --  -80 183
>Michael_Fagen: AQ D2 Q.A +24 432
>Abie_Cromanty: BDGIINS 14I BID +12 195
#note Quackle says BINS for 41. 
>Michael_Fagen: EEIINRV L9 VEINIER +79 511
#note Very lucky for me, since this bingo wouldn't have played had it not been for her last turn. Misscored as 77. 
>Abie_Cromanty: A D1 A... +14 209
>Michael_Fagen: ADEEFGT M11 DAFT +39 550
#note I saw this first and then noticed that DEFT would normally be better. 
>Abie_Cromanty: EY 2M YE +16 225
>Michael_Fagen: ?EEFGIL 1A FIL.GrEE +149 699
#note At first I was upset FEELInG didn't play. So that forced me to look harder to find the best word available. This is how I got my first ever 700+ game.
