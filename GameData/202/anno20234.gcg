>Winter: ADIQS 8D QAIDS +50 50
>Amalan_Iyengar: GIORSUV 9C VIG +25 25
#note Between VIG and VI(R)AGOS. I decided on VIG because Winter is a better player than I am, and I probably need binges+luck to beat hi. VIGOURS no-go.
>Winter: ELLMY H8 .MELLY +12 62
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEIORSU 9H .IAOU +8 33
#note This gives back way too much. A more conservative play, or SOI(L)URE 2x2 would have been better.
>Winter: UX 8L XU +34 96
#note Glad he didn't have an I. MIAOU did give back too much.

>Amalan_Iyengar: EGIPSVY N13 GEY +24 125
