>Jesse: ACEINU 8G UNCIAE +18 18
#note JD: comments are by brett unless prefaced with the letters JD. I felt that the leave after exchanging OU or AOU wasn't quite good enough to justify passing up the points. Q agrees by a couple of points.
>Brett: DEEFIOY L8 .DIFY +24 24
#note Q like DIOE(C)Y; my play isn't top 10.  This game is a showcase how a top player gets into bag before me.  
>Jesse: EEIOOSS K10 OE +16 34
>Brett: ACEORRT M11 TOR +17 41
#note I don't think this was my rack; I had trouble reading my wrting on this one.  
>Jesse: EIORSST 14I ROSIEST +72 106
#note JD: quackle thinks that playing on column N is just as good due to better defense.
>Brett: ADEERSU O12 DA.E +21 62
#note His bingo blocked mine (undersea/unerased); thought I might be able to hit something through the t. Q like playing U(T)E.  
>Jesse: AGINOPU H13 UPO +25 131
>Brett: EJQRSUY G7 Q.EY +27 89
#note Q(U)EY @ 13G is an improvement; right word, wrong spot.  
>Jesse: AFGINNT F9 FATING +28 159
#note JD: with the closed board and two blanks unseen, saving the INT leave with FANG is devalued.
>Brett: IJRSUX E10 JUS +39 128
#note Q likes this.  Incomplete rack unfortunately.  
>Jesse: EELNORU J5 LOU.E +7 166
#note JD: a hard play. I was trying to flip over tiles in some way that wasn't horrendous defensively. LOUIE gives up a lot of points compared to Q's favorites of CLUE/LUCE or EON at 15J. but, not too much worse
>Brett: AEIRRVX K2 VARIX +43 171
#note The way he was opening the board made me think he was trying to get a blank or was sitting on one.  
>Jesse: AEGLNRR 3I GR.AL +16 182
#note JD: the bag is rather heavy on consonants, so GNARL leaving AER is better.
>Brett: ADEHORW 4K .HO +24 195
#note (C)HOW is 1st, my play is 2nd
>Jesse: AEEGNNR 2E REGNA +11 193
#note JD: REGNA isn't initially in the top 15. quackle's fave is GENRE at I11, which accomplishes mostly the same as my play but without giving back so many points. I can also keep the board closed and fish with OXEN, but the AEGNR leave is not worth a whole lot on this board.
>Brett: ADEIRTW 1F WAIT +39 234
>Jesse: ?AELNPT 3A PLATENs +77 270
>Brett: DEIINRV A1 VI.ER +33 267
#note Best.
>Jesse: ?ABKMSZ 4C BAM +27 297
#note it seemed that it would come down to who drew the blank, so I felt great drawing that and the Z after my bingo. I didn't play BAMS because being able to play the S on column N seemed key.
>Brett: BEEEILN A1 .....INE +39 306
#note best.
>Jesse: ?KNOSWZ N7 ZONKS +35 332
#note Very shrewd move.  No a's and he's most likely sitting on the blank.  I'm forced to plug it.  
>Brett: BCDEHLO 8N .H +15 321
#note JD: Quackle seems to advise leaving the right side open and settling for the out-in-two instead with TALCED -> HOB.
>Jesse: ?DEIMTW B6 DEMIT +27 359
#note JD: I realized as I was looking that it was probably best to play something at column H but then ran out of time to find the right endgame. DINTS -> MEW is the best sequence
