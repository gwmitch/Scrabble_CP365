#note Airballing* and Massifying* in New Orleans, Episode 3.  I played this game in a bit of a hurry because I had to be at the Saenger Theater by 7:30 pm.  So of course that means I was waiting around for my opponent for about twenty minutes.  I think the game started about 6:20.

#note Passing up the bingos.  Or rather, I passed up the bingos that I SAW.  I didn't see 6H GRAVIES/GLAIVES.  The bingos I saw put a tile in the 3x3 lane and I didn't want to do that after an exchange.

#note Final scores recorded as 414-354. And no, your eyes are not deceiving you.  I really did just play a clean endgame.  It must be because I wasn't really thinking straight this game.   But I made it to the Saenger Theater right on time! :D
