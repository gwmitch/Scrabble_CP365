#note many reasonable options are available. I quite like quackle's suggestion of LIFE at 12A which keeps a much stronger leave than my play.

>JD: CEIILOU -IOU +0 63
#note ETOILE is a pretty cool way of scoring some points on this mostly dead board. did not see it. also quackle prefers keeping just CE.

#note must be worth it instead of playing HOUR at 3K, right? his road back is now much more complicated
>Darrell_Day: AF D12 FA +32 287

#note the blank looms, so quackle prefers playing ARIA.

#note a slight gamble
>Darrell_Day: AINO H7 ...ONIA +15 322
#note I didn't really think this was good, but he's just closed all the lanes on the board, maybe thinking I also have the blank...
