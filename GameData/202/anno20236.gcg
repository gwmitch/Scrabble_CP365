>Jim_Burlant: ADEGNRV L4 GRAV. +24 24
#note The only 8 in this is ENGRAVED, so no 8's play. This is best.  K6 VEX is also a strong choice.  GARVEY scores 2 more but burns the E for not enough game and, consequently, wins 2% less often and sims almost 5 points down.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EMOP M3 POEM +25 67
>Jim_Burlant: DEENOOS 9H OE +10 34
#note Too much rack grooming. ODEON (which I almost always miss) scores 27 at K2.  Don't know why I couldn't think of EON at K4 though.  This is lame.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DEILNRT G9 TRINDLE +65 132
#note 10H TENDRIL scores 70.
>Jim_Burlant: DEGNOST 15D DOG.S +27 61
#note I was looking for the O for STEGODON and spent a couple of minutes looking for the 8 that wasn't there in the absence of an O.   This play is the wrong execution of the right idea.  GODET scores identically and keeps the S; I never thought of GODET.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AIIMN K3 MAIN +27 159
>Jim_Burlant: CDENTTY -CDTY +0 61
#note Couldn't think of any of the best plays  here and didn't like what 10I plays did to the board.  This is unnecessary; TYNED 14A scores 24 and is just fine.  Best play here wins 9-1/2%; this wins 7 and coughs up a boatload of equity.

#note Only bingo.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BEE 12D BEE. +21 196
>Jim_Burlant: GIIORSU O8 GUIROS +34 165
#note This is the only scoring option I have.  Clearly best - 18% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AELZ 12J LAZE +54 250
>Jim_Burlant: EIIKLOS 10B KILO +23 188
#note I considered better rack balancers like KOI 14B as well as 13A and 14A KILO.  The main priority here was opening lines, and this was the only choice I had that did that.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACFORTU B10 .RAUT +18 268
#note Actual rack.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEINSY J2 YA +17 205
#note I saw the 7 ELYSIAN in this rack, but didn't see where to put it down.  Sam had initially put down a phony 7 in his last rack, and front hooked MAIN with the A before taking the play off and putting down KRAUT.  I thought that AMAIN was no good (I don't recall that I've ever seen that played before) so I didn't take the chance.  I've obviously got to bingo now and this is a terrible miss.  Since I thought I had a nogo, I put this down to open up a line he might not be able to block. All that said, even if I bingo, this is still bleak.  If I hit, I'm still only 25% or so to win.

>Jim_Burlant: ?DENNOT 4K ...N +5 320
#note The frustration comes to a head, as I miss DONNErT on row 1.  I saw where to play it; I just never recognized the DENNORT anagram.  This is why you have to stay calm.
