#note Hard to believe the other AX at C6 is simming better, but it actually isn't as dangerous as it looks. And it doesnt open bingo lanes.

#note Had no idea what to do here. It would have helped to see the highest scoring play WHANG, which looks like the best play here. Somehow didn't look for it.

#note I figured I could be patient with the bingo, since the board was likely to open up. But improving his Z play isn't going to help. I'm better off killing the QADI/QUAD bomb with WIRE or prioritizing my leave with WYNN (setting up a QADIS/QUADS bomb...) I dunno, I guess this was bad

#note Keeping the R is a clear mistake. I am likely to draw another one, and there's one to play through. Not playing too well
