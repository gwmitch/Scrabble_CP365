>Jim_Burlant: ABCEHOR 8D BROACH +32 32
#note Q says I shouldn't worry about possible BROACHING extensions and that I should play  for 34 at 8G.  This only gives up 2 scoreboard pointsand doesn't give those extensions back. I also wasn't aware that this took a front A hook - something else that impacts how this sims.  Best would have been 8G BREACH.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BEEIOOO H8 .OOEE +8 8
#note Actual rack.   BOOBIE D8 scores 20.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AADEJR 11E JAD. +24 56
#note I never recognized JARhEAD and was only 50/50 on JEmADAR, and didn't know the front hook to BROACH.  Kinda killed this position for me.  Best is obviously JARhEAD C7 for 110.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ABEHIOV E1 BEHAVIO. +82 90
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEORS 1B SEA.ORnE +80 136
#note I alphagrammed this for 3 or 4 minutes and this was the only thing I could come up with.  Too bad I couldn't think of RhEOBASE, which would have scored 140.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ITU 2I TUI +7 97
>Jim_Burlant: AEFMOQR 2A FORM. +30 166
#note I considered 2 plays:  FROM 12C and this.  For reasons I can't put a finger on, this looked a smidgen better, so I went with this.  The sim indicates that my evaluation of those two choices was correct, but yet again I didn't know the best plays:  FORMEE 2A and C3 FEMORA (again, that BROACH front hook, which neither of us knew).
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: OZ 10F ZO. +66 163
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGGIQ 6B QAD. +34 200
#note Better at C7 for 40, but again, I didn't know the BROACH front hook. If you don'tk now that, this is the best of the rest.  I'm still 54% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AIMNSTT 13B MATTINS +78 241
>Jim_Burlant: AEGGIOP 14A GIGA +25 225
#note Setup play, and this worked.  Slightly better would have been 1K AGGIE for 29, but this did work out.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: TY 10F ...TY +25 266
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEOPV 15D PAVED +50 275
#note Yet another word I've never seen, PAVEED, is best.  This is a solid runner up, but PAVEED is a hair better.  42% to win.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EL 7I EL +9 275
>Jim_Burlant: EFKNOUU 3K FOU +17 292
#note Missing K4 FUNK; never thought of the K back hook to EL.  FUNK scores 29 and is best.  Missing this was the first part of the one-two punch that killed the game for me.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ILN 7A LIN +18 293
>Jim_Burlant: EGIKNTU A7 .UNK +24 316
#note And if I played FUNK on the prevous turn, I'd be looking to kill row 4 and leave him with very limited bingo options.   But even with all the word knowledge missies on in the fisrt half of  the game and the misfire on the previous turn, this was the key position.  If I made the right play here, I'd rate my winning chances against this opponent at roughly 2 out of 3.    TAKING for 24 at 4D leaves a terrible EU combination, but given this board and pool, might be a reasonable choice, as his only lines for 7's would be limited.  Instead, I fell for the decoy he opened up, and punishment was swift:
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ELNNRSS 4A ENSN.RLS +70 363
>Jim_Burlant: EGIITWX 2M XI +27 343
#note Best. 7% to win...but his next rack renders that 0:
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?ADEPRY O2 sPRAYED +98 461
>Jim_Burlant: CEEGITW 9C WE +13 356
#note Annotation stops here, final score 375 - 480.  Winnable for a better player, but too many plays were outside beyond the reach of my skill set.  And on the one turn that I made a strategic error, the punishment was brutal.  Frustrating.
