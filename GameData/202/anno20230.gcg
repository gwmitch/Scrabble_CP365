#note Nice opening for Paul
>Marty_Gold: AIMOSTV 10A OM +23 37

>Paul_Peyser: COP 8A COP +33 98
#note I should have seen this coming.
>Marty_Gold: ACEISTV F4 CAVIT.ES +73 110

>Paul_Peyser: BKOOY --  -26 179
#note Yeah, I thought this looked weird.
>Marty_Gold: DEEGNOR J4 DOGE. +14 166
#note H8 (DEF)ENDER would have been 42. Neither Quackle nor CP like my play at all. I figured it opened things up a bit and left a decent leave. Lucky for me, I draw well next.

#note This was slick.
>Marty_Gold: ADEHIIN 12C HIE +18 284
#note Quackle and CP like 12B AHI. CP doesn't like my play at all. I guess it doesn't open anything up at the bottom. 
>Paul_Peyser: JO 6B JO. +26 290
>Marty_Gold: ADEILNS O3 SNAILED +80 364
#note CP slightly prefers the same word at M8 for five fewer points.

>Marty_Gold: ?AEILRT 2B In.LATER +74 438

>Paul_Peyser: AMX 1H MAX +50 369
#note Nice comeback, but probably too little too late.
>Marty_Gold: AAALNSU L12 AA +10 448

>Marty_Gold: AALNNSU 13A ULAN +21 469

>Marty_Gold: ANS G11 .ANS +5 474
#note H1 (ME)NSA or (ME)ANs would have been 8.
>Marty_Gold:  (GTUV) +16 490
#note I think I put this one away in the middle with the back to back bingoes, which was more luck than anything else, but it was back and forth until then.
