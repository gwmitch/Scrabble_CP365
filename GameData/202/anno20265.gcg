#note INfRUGA(L) 12B scores 2 more, but I prefer this, INFRUGAL leaves the board wide open for David to come back.
>David_Whitley: BETUY 5H BE.UTY +20 137
>Morris_Greenberg: AEEEOPU H12 A.EE +21 189
#note This was a really tough call between A(G)EE, A(G)UE, and UPO 12K. The 12K spot is really dangerous and blocking it should be one of my priorities. I just didn't see how I could easily get out of AEEE ever as a leave though, and thought that there is enough synergy in EOPU to leave it open for 1 more turn and hope David doesn't cash in on it.

#note I lucked out here.

#note David said he was all set to play ZA 12L before I played JO.

>Morris_Greenberg: DEIMNOS M3 DE. +24 348
#note I decided to pass up bingoing with DOMINES or EMODINS here, since the only way David can really beat me at this point is if he triple-triples. All 3 plays win over 99% of the time according to Quackle FWIW, and likes DOMINES best, the DEY, then EMODINS.

>David_Whitley: CEHILLR D9 CHILLE. +24 275
#note David said after the game that he had CHILLER here. He considered LIC(K)ER B2 to fork the board, but envisioned more trouble with me already grooming my rack.
>Morris_Greenberg: DEIMRSS 15L SEMI +33 415
#note I did not know S(CHILLER), fun word! There are better plays using that hook at 8A (SIMS, REMS, MEDS, and DEISMS to name a few), but otherwise, this looks good. I am winning no matter what anyways.
>David_Whitley: DMN 11C M.ND +14 289

>Morris_Greenberg: DEHORSS --  -8 415
#note Most hilarious word knowledge error of the tournament. I thought both HAB* and SHAB* were words, so I phonied to set up another phony! HAD->SHAD, HAG->SHAG, HAH->SHAH, HAM->SHAM, HAT->SHAT, HAW->SHAW, HAY->SHAY all are things. This is no way shape or form was even close. As Conrad said after he heard about this, "not too shabby"!

#note PAN(E)L, to block my outs.

#note I completely missed ODO(R)S and DOO(R)S F1, oh well. Otherwise, this game was fairly boring, I got everything.
