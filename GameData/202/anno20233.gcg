>Amalan_Iyengar: EGHITTV 2F VET +20 318
#note I spent a while on this turn. I considered VETTI(N)G but I thought it might take some 2 letter extensions. I didn't like GIVE with the number of Os left in the bag. I couldn't reconcile burning so many points to block rows 14 and 15. Quackle likes TIGHTE(R) or VET. I think TIGHTER might open the board too much fr my liking.

>Ryan_Fischer: BEE 7J BEE +21 350
>Amalan_Iyengar: ACEFKOT D12 KA +27 389
