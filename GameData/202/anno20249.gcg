>Joey: EEGNOST I5 EST.OGEN +61 61
>Jesse: FYZ 9H F.ZY +24 58
#note JD: important to dump the Z so I can bingo faster on the wide open board
>Joey: BLSTUUV 6F LUV. +9 70
>Jesse: ?ABDNPT 11H B.DPAN +22 80
#note spent too long looking for imaginary bingos

>Joey: ?ACEINR O2 ARCsINE +93 246
>Jesse: IILMNOW 9C WINO +20 171
#note JD: weak play on my end, totally missed MIAOW at 11D.
>Joey: AACDJQX E11 QA. +24 270
#note AX can wait its turn.  The Q had to be disposed of first.
>Jesse: DGILMRT 14A GLIM +22 193
#note JD: Now I quite like BIELD for 30 at H11 - the leave is miserable, but the D will be a threat for many turns.
>Joey: ACDEFJX M7 FAX +55 325
>Jesse: DDPRTVW D12 T..P +26 219
#note JD: yuck, why did I do this? it takes out some of my volatility and leaves trash. DAWT at L10 is nice because at least I threaten a draw like PROVIDE which goes top and bottom.
>Joey: CDEIJUY A11 JUD.E +45 370
>Jesse: DDIMRVW L10 V.W +18 237
#note JD: just play WIDDY, I was trying to keep OESTROGEN open but I should cut spread instead
>Joey: ACEEIUY 15D .AYEE +30 400
>Jesse: DDIMOOR B10 DOM +23 260
#note JD: MOD at 10B for 1 more, I wanted to be able to play AHI to open a lane if necessary, which is a ridiculous concern since I'm already down 163
>Joey: CEEILSU 7B LUCE +18 418
>Jesse: DIINOOR K11 .OI +10 270
#note JD: give up and play IODIN?
>Joey: AEGIOST C9 .OG +21 439
>Jesse: ADINOOR O12 ORAD +21 291
#note JD: at least quackle likes this play okay
>Joey: AEIRSST O2 .......S +19 458
>Jesse: EHIILNO 4E HELIO +20 311
#note JD: HO 1 better on spread. I didn't have a ton of chances this game but I missed a few chances to scrounge a couple of win % (WINO and TAMP were particularly egregious).
