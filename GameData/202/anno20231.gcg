>Marty_Fialkow: EHMPY H4 HEMPY +38 38
#note At long last, the epic battle of the Martys. I have been waiting for this for a long time.
>Marty_Gold: IJLORSW 5C JOWLI.R +34 34
#note CP and Q like G3 JOW for 31. My play is their second choice.
>Marty_Fialkow: OW 4D WO +25 63
>Marty_Gold: ILOOSST 6B SOT +20 54
#note TO(P)SOILS or (P)OLOISTS play at 7F and 7H respectively. This was not a good play.
>Marty_Fialkow: CET F3 CE.T +14 77
>Marty_Gold: DILNOST 7A DOT +18 72
#note Quackle likes my play. CP prefers 4H (H)OLD
>Marty_Fialkow: AGNP 8B PANG +24 101
>Marty_Gold: IIILMNS G8 MINI +14 86
#note Quackle prefers I3 MI(R)I for 18, CP likes I3 LI(R)I for 14. My play is their third choice. I liked how it opened the board.
>Marty_Fialkow: EFGLNR 11E FL.NGER +44 145
>Marty_Gold: EILOORS L5 ORIOLES +70 156
#note Ironically, I can remember Marty Fialkow once winning a special prize category with this word for "Best Baltimore Word"
>Marty_Fialkow: CENV 8K C.VEN +30 175
>Marty_Gold: AALRTTZ J10 Z.TA +33 189
#note Q and CP like this play.
>Marty_Fialkow: ?ABDHSU 14H HUSBAnD +94 269
#note This was a really nice play. Dangers of opening the board too much.
>Marty_Gold: ADILRRT 15F DRAT +32 221
#note This reflected my feelings after the last play. Q likes it, and it's CP's third choice. It likes 15E LIRA. My win % is down to 10.86. 
>Marty_Fialkow: OOX 15K OXO +40 309
#note Well crap.
>Marty_Gold: DEIILNR K3 LID +14 235
#note Still trying to keep my bingo hopes alive here. I figure this gives me four possible lanes: N, O, 2, and 13. Maybe 12, but it would be a long shot. Q LIKES 14E LI for 9, CP likes 14B INDIE for 21. I guess it makes more sense in that it would be hard to bingo in that corner anyway. My win % is now 3.31.
>Marty_Fialkow: ABIT M2 BAIT +16 325
#note This was a nice move that eliminates one of my potential bingo lanes, and makes N almost impossible.
>Marty_Gold: AEFINRU E8 .UF. +11 246
#note Q and CP like N1 FAINER for 39. CP doesn't like my play at all.
>Marty_Fialkow: EY 7N YE +12 337
>Marty_Gold: AEEGINR N2 AE +14 260
#note Finally a bingo rack, and not a damn thing I can do. Q likes 10J (Z)E(E). CP likes F10 A(L)E for 14. My win % is now 1.52.
>Marty_Fialkow: AAEQU 14B AQUAE +37 374
#note And there pretty much go my bingo hopes.
>Marty_Gold: ?EEGINR J2 RE +6 266
#note Last desperate attempt. And I know he's going to block it. CP seems to tink I'd still have a 3% chance of winning with 15A REI.
>Marty_Fialkow: EEIRSV 1G REVISE +33 407
>Marty_Gold: ?AEGIKN 12A KINGs +39 305
#note O10 KINAsE is 42. Didn't know the word.
>Marty_Fialkow: INU 15C IN +17 424
#note He could have gone out with (EN)NUI at O7, but that would have been boring.
>Marty_Gold: AE 11B AE +6 311
#note Missed K10 E(R)A for 17. I just wanted this to end by this point.
>Marty_Gold:  (U) +2 313
#note Marty F. played a really good defensive game. After HUSBAnD, he did a really nice job of closing the board down, and I just couldn't come back. Also, OXO was a really nice play.
