>Chris_Tallman: ?AADETU 8B cAUDATE +66 66
#note Probably the weirdest game I played this tourney, because of this move. I knew Lawren was one of the lower seeds, so I thought there was a good chance she didn't know the ACAUDATE hook and I could cash it in soon for a huge early lead. The fact that the C helps protect the setup from being blocked due to a parallel play made it even more appealing. It's super risky of course - most people who I asked about it after would just play ADULATE for 68 here. The thing is, I had forgotten about that it takes an E in front too, even though I definitely *knew* that before. Hilarity ensues from here ... :P
