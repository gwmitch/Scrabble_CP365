#note not in the top 15 on static, but it sims best, even with SWELL or WAN. with the influence of her maybe having a bingo leave or the blank, I wanted to force her to use her blank as the S to hook QUOD (since I hold the last one)
>Terry_Kang: IX 11E XI +22 101
>JD: EGLMORS 12F GLOMS +30 150
#note that last S is no longer worth quite as much

>JD: AEIINRU 11I I.EA +21 171
#note still inferring a strong leave, I didn't like opening a new lane with URIDINE.

#note ugh, dislike. why not play YE at N2? it's very easy for her to block, but at least it's some kind of threat
