>Joey: AINPRST 2H SPIRANT +74 210
#note Scored as 74 as documented but I only had my total as 200.  Apparently we both made the same math error.

>Joey: ?EEOSYZ 4K OYEZ +37 247
#note I sure wish OYEZZES* was an alternate plural, since it would have given me the lead!  Of course, that requires me knowing INEXPERT takes an S.
>Eric: ABEINRU 14A BRAUNI.E +74 410
#note Eric smartly makes sure that I won't get to bingo there.
>Joey: ?EHNQST C13 Q.T +24 271
#note I can still score a lot with INEXPERTS, but the unseen pool does not mix well with the Q.
>Eric: FOS A12 FO.S +39 449
>Joey: ?DEHNOS 15H HONS +44 315
#note I almost tried DORHENS* to go out, then thought better of it.  Lots of plays using INEXPERTS are obviously better, but at least it only cost spread.
