>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: EFN 8G FEN +12 12
>Morris_Greenberg: AFILORU 9H FOU +15 15
#note AFOUL 9G all the way, missed that. This is still fine though. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: IIII -IIII +0 12
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AAILRR K3 ARRIvAL +69 84
#note I had a tough time deciding which placement of RAILcAR or ARRIvAL to choose. FWIW, Quackle likes K6 RAILcAR the best, then K7 ARRIvAL, then this. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: ?CKOTTU 4G OUTT.iCK +78 90
#note I held this for a while, and correctly let it go. 
>Morris_Greenberg: DILNSYZ O1 ZINS +57 141
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: EGLT -  +0 90
#note Kate was also unsure of OUTTRICK and challenged my play. I outtricked her that time! 
>Morris_Greenberg: DDDHLNY 6J L.DDY +20 161
>Morris_Greenberg: DDDHLNY --  -20 141
#note I was convinced that DIDDLY was phony and it was only DIDDLEY. The price of listening to Bo Diddley.

I also thought L(I)DDY* was a word. To summarize, I suck. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: EGLT 8K .GLET +24 114
>Morris_Greenberg: DDDHLNY M1 LYN.H +26 167
#note I am still pretty sure that DIDDLY isn't a word, and I am especially nervous to play something I'm unsure of after losing my last turn to word knowledge errors. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: AACHORT 1F THORACA. +92 206
#note Well that came back to bite. 
>Morris_Greenberg: DDDGIRW -  +0 167
#note I was unsure of THORACA(L) so I challenged. My lack of word knowledge really hurt me this game, and I am lucky that this was the only game it really hurt me in the tournament. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: EX 2I EX +52 258
>Morris_Greenberg: DDDGIRW 7E GRID +20 187
#note I prefer this to (K)IDD(E)D, I need the variance here to make up the spread difference. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: IPP 5E PIP +18 276

>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: AIQU D1 QUAI +56 362
>Morris_Greenberg: ABDEGMO 9C MOB +25 265
#note I just need an S, and then I may have a chance. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: EU N3 U.E +15 377
>Morris_Greenberg: AADEGII D8 ..GIA +12 277
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: EIIMNST N8 .NMITIES +82 459
#note Kate sort of hated making this play, as it leaves the possibility for me to triple-triple. She correctly assessed that this is about as strong as anything.
>Morris_Greenberg: AABDEEI C11 BAAED +22 299
#note I played this to force Kate to choose one triple-triple line to close down. I specifically noticed the possibility of WI(D)ENESS or WIDENE(S)S. BAAED + WIDENESS gets me to 466, and if Kate draws the Y out of the bag after blocking one of the lanes, I would win since I would bingo out in that scenario. BAAED and ABIDE at C11 are the only plays with a greater than 0 winning percentage according to Quackle, with BAAED being slightly better. I am happy to have played this over something like DIABA(S)E, my pre-endgame play this tournament is really what made the difference in a lot of games.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: ERSSY 15C .RESSY +33 492
#note Oh well.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEEEIRT 15L EA.E +15 314
#note Blocking WEEN(E)D. RAI(S)E or ARI(S)E nets 4 more.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connolly: DEENW 14E WEE +19 511
>Morris_Greenberg: EIRT 12K TRI.E +12 326
#note LIDDY* and not knowing DIDDLY turned out to be extremely costly. I think I could've won this game had I just played DIDDLY.
