#note 8C SKIVED would have been 38. 
>Mary_Goulet: BBORR K4 ROBB.R +20 20
>Marty_Gold: AEIJKQR H7 Q. +11 33
#note L1 JAKE would have been 50. I just wanted to get rid of the Q.
>Mary_Goulet: EGHINR 4H HER.ING +30 50
>Marty_Gold: AEEIKRS I6 KI.A +25 58
#note O1 KAISER would have been 46. I wouldn't have thought of that, or been bold enough to try it. Championship player likes 3L KEA for 27, although my play comes in 3rd. I thought this nicely neutralized a potential hot spot.
>Mary_Goulet: IJN L1 JIN. +19 69
>Mary_Goulet: IJN --  -19 50
#note Mary...tsk.
>Marty_Gold: EEEFORS 3F REEF +26 84
#note I didn't FORESEE the missed bingo at 3B or 5B. 
>Mary_Goulet: AEJ M1 JEA. +22 72
>Marty_Gold: DEEOSSU 1M .EU +30 114
#note Quackle and CP like O1 DOUSE for 34. I figured I'd take the 30 and neutralize another potential hot spot and keep the S. My play is Quackle and CP's 2nd choice.
>Mary_Goulet: III -III +0 72
>Marty_Gold: DELOSSW F1 WO.DLESS +66 180
#note Here I thought, "if I get an LY later on, I'm totally extending this".
>Mary_Goulet: AE 1F .AE +18 90
>Marty_Gold: EEINNOR E5 EN +10 190
#note Quackle and CP like 8A IRONE(S). I couldn't think of what else to do really. 
>Mary_Goulet: AEILNOT L8 .ELATION +72 162
#note She's not going down without a fight though.
>Marty_Gold: EGINORT D1 GENITOR +76 266
#note 15E NITROGE(N) would have been one more point. I think Mary briefly held this or at least gave it a funny look.
>Mary_Goulet: FITU 15K U.FIT +24 186
>Marty_Gold: ?CILSYZ F1 ........LY +25 291
#note 2J ZYm(E)S would have been 76, but you know what? I don't care. I spent about two seconds thinking about this and absolutely could not resist. This would be my first tournament 10. It's CP's fourth choice, and now my win probability is 99.58%
>Mary_Goulet: OY C2 YO +19 205
>Marty_Gold: ?CCIRSZ 8A CRIS +31 322
#note Quackle likes 11J CZ(A)R for 30. Also, 2J ZIn(E)s would have been 70.
>Mary_Goulet: ?ADEIMT 12G iMITA.ED +63 268
#note B2 TIDEMA(R)k would have been 97. B1 ADMiTTE(R) would have been 93. B1 MEDIATo(R) would have been 90. And there's a whole bunch in 80s and 70s. Still, decent find.
>Marty_Gold: ?AACOTZ 11K Z. +44 366
#note 13C ZACATOn for 93. Oh well. It's a Mexican grass. Time to review my 14000 7s. CP seems to think if I had played it 13A, my win probability would be 100%. 
>Mary_Goulet: ADP M10 AP.D +36 304
#note This was a nice play.
>Marty_Gold: ?AACOTU 13E AUTO +11 377
#note Quackle likes H12 (M)AUT for 18. CP likes B1 OAT for 21. My play is CP's third choice.

Almost as soon as I played this, I felt like this was my dumbest play of the entire day. I thought long and hard about defending the hotspot at N10, but I fixated on making it into a nice play with the C. I couldn't think of anything decent, and in retrospect, I would have blocked it with the T, and played CAT from N8, which also would have neutralized the TWS. Then, I was thinking, well maybe I'll get the X. 


>Mary_Goulet: ALX N8 LAX +52 356
#note And then this happened.
>Marty_Gold: ?ACNOVW O7 VOW +38 415
#note But at least I was able to come back with this. Quackle likes it. CP has it 5th, and likes H12 (MO)WN for 27. 
>Mary_Goulet: GHMNOTU 14B MOUTH +51 407
#note This was a nice play. MONTH would have also worked. 
>Marty_Gold: ?ACNPS 15A CArP +42 457
#note Could have gone out with B1 PeCANS for 43. At first glance, I thought I could play P(R)ANCES at B7, but realized there wasn't enough room. I guess neither of us ever took advantage of the opening at B2-3. For shame.
