>Tasha_Asberry: EENRSTZ 8H NERTZ +48 48
#note Tasha: Airballing* and Massifying* in New Orleans, Episode 4. This is the fourth time I've played Noah so he now ties with 3 other people as my most played opponent. I think this is strange considering how long I've been playing and the differences in our rating.
>Noah: EGIKNOU J6 KO.E +18 18
#note Noah: It was hard to find a good play here, but I missed a huge improvement. UKE 7F sets up my N quite nicely while keeping the RT open for bingos as well as the Z for decent scoring plays if I don't draw a bingo. Big error.
>Tasha_Asberry: ADEHOST 7H OH. +21 69
>Noah: AEGINSU 6B GUINEAS +67 85
>Tasha_Asberry: ADEFNST F2 FAST.NED +70 139
>Noah: AAIOPUV E5 A.OPIA +29 114
#note Noah: Not loving the UV leave, but this scores so much. I also thought about playing PIANO because I thought AUV might work a bit better than UV, but I like the openness of ANOPIA -- PIANO makes it harder to access the bottom of the board, I think.
Tasha: Whew, good thing he didn't have an S!
>Tasha_Asberry: ADPRTVW 3C VAW.RD +28 167
#note Tasha: I don't have Noah's board vision yet so finding D3 PAVID/VAPID wasn't going to happen. It's probably better for me to play VAWARD over the D3 plays anyway.
>Noah: ACDEGUV D9 VAGUE +27 141
>Tasha_Asberry: ?EFIPTW 13C W.FT +20 187
#note Tasha: I considered 13C FEW (leaning towards that) and PEWIT (eliminated quickly) but decided on WEFT because I can play on both row 12 or row 14. FEW only leaves row 14 available. A little more leeway can't hurt.
Noah: I like C13 FEW or D2 TAWPIE, just to score a bunch of points. 
>Noah: ACDMTUY K3 YUCA +24 165
#note Noah: ADYTUM is cool though if I play it it would probably have to be at 12F. This play was too much for me -- lots of options and no standouts. I thought a lot about CYMA but I was a bit too worried about column L overlaps -- they're not as dangerous/likely as I expected. Seems I should just do CYMA, though it's a close position so maybe I could do better.
>Tasha_Asberry: ?EEEIPY 9H EY. +27 214
>Noah: BDIJMNT D3 .MB.T +26 191
#note Noah: Had to choose betweem AMBIT, JAB, and MANTID here. The J didn't seem awesome here but I was really worried about a consonant heavy leave. 3-1 was enough that I preferred AMBIT to MANTID. Sim agrees with my play here -- AMBIT has the highest average next turn.
>Tasha_Asberry: ?EEIIPQ 4I EQ.IP +32 246
>Noah: DEEIJNR 14B NEREID +42 233
>Tasha_Asberry: ?EIIIRS N1 IRIS +25 271
#note Tasha: I took a long time on this play because I WANTED to play SIZIER, but wasn't really sold on the play. I wasn't really sold on IRIS either, but I liked it better than SIZIER. I have 3 I's so what else am I going to play?
Noah: Conrad was watching this game with great interest (it sure was a good one), and suggested changing II as another option afterward. It's a good one but I think taking the points would be better. Not sure between SIZIER and IRIS though.
>Noah: GJLOOST 15A JOT +38 271
#note Noah: Thought about JIG but the I spot wasn't great and TOOLS seemed pretty weak.
>Tasha_Asberry: ?EIMRUX 1M M.X +36 307
#note Tasha: I spent a while on this rack because Conrad kept walking by and I wanted to make damn sure MIXTURE is a no go and I don't have something like 15G EXORIUM*. No National Championship winner is gonna be na eyewitness to sucky play on MY watch. After I assured myself I'm not missing any bingos, I went back and forgth between REMIX and MIX and decided to sacrifice 9 points for a better leave.
>Noah: CGILOOS 15F LOGIC +30 301
#note Noah: Another mistake -- COLOG is certainly better here, but I missed it. 
Tasha: Actual rack. After the game, he asked me if ISOLOGIC* was good and I wasn't quite sure, but I could swear I challenged it off the board once. I said I would have held the play but I would probably let it go. Once I realized he was referring to a 3x3, I said I was definitely gonna challenge it.
>Tasha_Asberry: ??AEIRU L7 A.URItEs +80 387
#note Tasha: Oops, I had SUZERAIn for 6 more. But I'm not that upset because I very nearly played ARGUFIES until I remembered my new rule: Always jot the alphagram down even it looks like you can't bingo. Before my new rule, I used to have this thing where I'll assume I won't have a bingo through a second H or a Q only to find out that I missed HOTHEAD or COEQUATE. Also, check out those awesome drawing skills! I drew the second blank after a two tile play.
>Noah: ABINOOS 12G BONIA.OS +60 361
#note Noah: I looked for some time here but couldn't find a way to win. I don't think there is one either. Quackle thinks ABO wins more than 1/5 of the time, which is bizarre and I'm pretty sure is wrong. Anyone see chances here?
Tasha: Noah took a long time here and I'm sure he's thinking of some evil way to steal the game. Quackle says best play is K12 ABO but that's one hell of a stupid play. ABO takes out the only bingo lanes. Noah plays ABO and then I'll play long through the G on column B and Noah loses by a lot more than 40 points!
