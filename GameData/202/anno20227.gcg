>Marty_Gold: AAEIRRR 8G RARE +8 8
#note Quackle doesn't like this at all. It likes 8G ARREAR for 14. I figured a leave of AIR wasn't bad. It seems to prefer a leave of I, AR, ERR, or AERR.
>Gwen_Stewart: BBO 7H BOB +19 19
>Marty_Gold: AGIJORY 6I GOY +20 28
#note K8 RIOJA for 29 would have been better. Mine is Quackle's 8th choice.
>Gwen_Stewart: NOW 5K OWN +22 41
>Marty_Gold: ?AIJRRS L3 JA. +26 54
#note Quackle thinks I should played the S there as well for an extra 10.
>Gwen_Stewart: OT M2 TO +22 63
>Marty_Gold: ?CIRRSY 2M .RY +12 66
#note 4H mISC(A)RRY would have scored 78. I don't think anyone short of Joey would have found that. My play is Quackle's fifth choice. 
>Gwen_Stewart: AE O1 A.E +18 81
>Marty_Gold: ?CIIIRS -CII +0 66
#note I4 RI(GOR)IStIC would have been 66. What can I say, I guess I'm a little weak on my 10s. For exchanging, Quackle prefers exch. II, CIII, IIR, IIIR, and then finally my CII. Overall, it was the 11th choice.
>Gwen_Stewart: AIOT 4I IOT. +10 91
#note Can't really tell what she's doing here besides trying to open the board and get something going. She seems to be playing it pretty conservatively so far.
>Marty_Gold: ?ACHIRS 9B CASHIeR +68 134
#note This took way too long. I probably blew seven minutes looking for something to end at I3, preferably something with ending with an H. (It was SCRAICH, SCRAIGH, or CARLISH by the way, all for 91 pts.) But I couldn't come up with anything, and finally found CASHIeR.
>Gwen_Stewart: AWX 3G WAX +42 133
#note And she takes advantage of the hotspot I forfeited very nicely.
>Marty_Gold: DDELOTU B9 .LOUTED +24 158
#note Well, this was Quackle's second choice only to (C)LOUDED for 2 more and a leave of T instead of D. (It actually seems to value the D leave better.) So, I didn't feel great about this play at the time, but not knowing what else to do, I figured I'd keep the board open, maybe hunt for the other blank, and play a funny word that might draw a challenge. It was briefly held, but released. Darn.
>Gwen_Stewart: ?GINPST D2 PoSTING. +74 207
#note SPiTING or SPITiNG at N5 would have worked too for the same score. So much for going for the other blank. At least the board's still open.

>Marty_Gold: AADILNO A12 NADA +35 193
#note Quackle prefers NAOI, at the same place, but this worked out better, because it did draw a challenge. It's Quackle's third choice. 
>Gwen_Stewart: EHRZ -  +0 207
#note Gwen challenges NADA
>Marty_Gold: AIILOST E9 .ILI +14 207
#note I forgot to write this rack down, but I'm pretty sure this is what I had. Quackle doesn't like this. Not even on the list. It prefers E8 O(H)IA. I was kind of hoping that she might take the bait and try to hook an S onto HILI. She never got another S, so it was a moot point.
>Gwen_Stewart: EHILRUZ 5A HER.Z +34 241
#note This is a nice play.
>Marty_Gold: AENORST N5 SANTERO +68 275
#note Could have played the same word at K8 for one more point. I didn't think about the fact that RARE is also a verb and takes an S. Also, I got really excited for a minute about the prospect of a triple-triple, but H does not combine with SENATOR (MEN SPRUCING FIBS). See, if I didn't do stems, I might have blown another five minutes staring at it.
>Gwen_Stewart: EIV A5 .IVE +30 271
#note She's certainly keeping it interesting.
>Marty_Gold: CEKPSUV O11 PUCKS +46 321
#note Quackle prefers D12 PUCK for 42. My play is its second choice.
>Gwen_Stewart: DEU 15L DUE. +7 278
#note I didn't really understand this play. I would think she'd want to keep the open S at O15. This also makes it more difficult to bingo along the N column.
>Marty_Gold: EEEFIOV 14J VEE +17 338
#note Quackle likes FE(T)E at 8L, and does not like my play at all. OK, so FE(T)E scores 33 as opposed to my 17, but it's a slightly worse leave (EIOV vs. EFIO), and it does nothing to shut the board down. It even prefers 2A VEE(P) for 18, which gives it the exact same leave and worse board strategy. Anyway, I felt good about this one.
>Gwen_Stewart: AELN O6 LEAN +24 302
#note That was a pretty play, and I'm wondering if she had a bingo rack at this point.
>Marty_Gold: EFIIIOU C13 EF +23 361
#note This is Quackle's second choice. It prefers E3 FI(Z) for 21. I was starting to run into time trouble here.
>Gwen_Stewart: Q 12D Q. +22 324
#note There it is.
>Marty_Gold: IIILMOU C3 MI. +18 379
#note Quackle doesn't like this either, but I realized that there at least 3 hotspots open for her F, and if she gets a 30 pt play, then a battle of attrition to the end, and she has the consonants. I figured I was more danger of her hitting a five-letter word from B2 to B6 than anything else, because that could have been a 35 or 40 pt play. So, I opted to block this. Quackle likes M9 MOL for 23. Also, I had less than a minute left on my clock, and this puts me by 55, which is I'm pretty sure is a safe margin at this point.
>Gwen_Stewart: DEFGMNT M9 FEM +31 355
#note And she takes the spot Quackle wanted me to block. But now, she has no vowels, I have only vowels. Let the war of attrition begin.
>Marty_Gold: IILOU E1 OIL +11 390
#note Quackle's second choice. K10 LOUI(E) would have one fewer point, but would have enabled me to go out in one instead of two.
>Gwen_Stewart: DGNT B4 T.D +18 373
#note This is her best choice.
>Marty_Gold: IU 2D ..U +7 397
#note I'm down to less than 0:30, and I figured the U would be my first choice to get rid of.
>Gwen_Stewart: GN 10E .N +8 381
>Marty_Gold: I 14A ...I +8 405
#note She took a long time on the preceding move, and I found this during that time. I think I ended with about 15 seconds left.
>Marty_Gold:  (G) +4 409
#note So a pretty close game. I'm not going to fret about the two ridiculous missed bingoes. Strategically, I could have some better choices, but I can at least justify everything I did. And I didn't fish too much.
