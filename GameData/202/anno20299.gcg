>Gunther_Jacobi: AAOOOSU 10G A.OA +6 6
#note Why in the world I chose to play through this was insane. The first 12 recommendations from Q are exchanges. ANOA has a -4.2 eval. It's strange that I didn't exchange here because I feel like that with even slightly 'better' racks I would normally trade in this garbage. Bad, bad decision.

>Gunther_Jacobi: IJOOOSZ 15G ZOOS +57 89
>Daniel_Goodwin: ELM N10 MEL +37 104
#note Seeing OMS, SCORING and QUAILS as possibilities I'm definitely putting him on a blank or an S, I just have to try to imrove my racks and even think about opening up the left side of the board.
>Gunther_Jacobi: BIIJOPW 8F WI.O +7 96
#note Completely missed JOI(N)...ugh. I saw almost no resources on this turn, until I spotted WI(N)O, which is most likely pretty weak but it least sets up JIB if cashes in anywhere on column O. Q won't even acknowledge WINO...second it chooses B(E)WI(G) then PI(A) L10. Not much to work with here although missing JOIN is quite awful.
>Daniel_Goodwin: BSTUY 8K BUSTY +43 147
>Gunther_Jacobi: BIJLMPR 12D JIMP. +38 134
#note I saw JIMPL(Y) in my head after the game. Ridding myself of an extra consonant and scoring two more points is very necessary.
>Daniel_Goodwin: EH 11E HE +24 171
>Gunther_Jacobi: BFFGLRU O2 GRUFFL. +18 152
#note I got too impatient here. Seeing that the board was becoming unfriendly and also getting a bit frustrated with difficult racks, I make an irrational play. Q registers it as a fourth choice 2pts behind FRUG 10B, a play I should've made had I kept my cool.
>Daniel_Goodwin: ERT 6L TRE. +9 180
#note This is a hard play for me to comprehend, although he's likely indicating bingo tiles? This somewhat induces a positional mistake on my behalf next turn.
>Gunther_Jacobi: BDEIIKT M2 BIKE. +22 174
#note I discredit BIKIE KIBEI since they leave me vowelless, but 5I BIKIE should be played for the four extra points. My play blocks everything and doesn't score enough to contest him if he plays from 12O. TREF confused me too much I suppose. Also, I shouldn't be worried here about leaving DT after BIKIE since there are plenty of E's and A's to be drawn...Scoring and turnover seem to be the priorities here.
>Daniel_Goodwin: ILPS O12 SLIP +37 217
#note Yup.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADDEITV 10B DIVA +18 192
>Daniel_Goodwin: AEGINRT B7 GRA.IENT +70 287
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?ADERTT A11 TREAD +30 222
#note T(R)AD is a close runner-up.
>Daniel_Goodwin: HO 7F OH +23 310
#note This signals a blank being that OH could be played A8 for 3 more or HO for 5 more at N14. It can't be an X block being that C9 is open.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?ADNRTX 9A T.X +35 257
#note Oh no...I miss DeXTRAN, a word Matt Ross played against me two weeks before in Vegas. That's hard to stomach.
>Daniel_Goodwin: EIV D12 .IVE +15 325
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?ADENRT 6C vERDANT +78 335

>Gunther_Jacobi: AAEW 4J WEA. +22 357
>Daniel_Goodwin: ES 5J ES +13 362
#note Too many mistakes this game beginning with not exchanging all but AS on my opening rack. Then, not finding JOIN, missing JIMPLY, misreading TREF and most costly perhaps missing DEXTRAN...when it rains it pours I guess.
