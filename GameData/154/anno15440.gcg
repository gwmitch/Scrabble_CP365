#note Wrong. I can keep exchanging. Exchange T or exchange D are great here and I wish I'd thought of them.

#note I considered this and WOO G13. I chose this to make the board more scoring-friendly, keep a better leave and block off the S hooks. WOO scores more, keeps a worse leave, and blocks the OED lanes. This play is difficult. WOO has the short term advantage of making Kenji much less likely to bingo next turn. AVOWER has a long term advantage in closing S hooks, which are harder to close on this board than the OED lanes. The latter could be closed anytime. However, AVOWER also allows for openings to the top of the board. I don't know. It seems like I overvalued the usefulness of closing down S hooks here. After AVOWER a few lanes are going to stay open for quite some time, while WOO only leaves the S lanes and the R. Maybe if we trade a bunch of small plays AVOWER eventually leads to a closed board more than WOO because of the difficult to block S hooks, but Kenji just gets so many bingo chances before that that AVOWER doesn't seem worth it.

#note Yeah, I should've at least just played HI. I way overvalued the GH versus GP combination, and EGHI? is hardly better than EGPI?. And I really should've just played HI(E). It's scary to block lanes here because he could bingo on me but I just have to do it. I have to start blocking the board. Play HIE.

#note This rack is weird. What are you supposed to do here? Should I still be blocking lanes? Should I play GHI M3 (which I didn't see)? Should I lay BIGEYE 14C (also missed)? What about GLEY/GLIB? I really just have no idea what to do here.
