>Adam_Ginzberg: DEENRST 7E D.E +8 310
#note This board is gonna get hard. I don't like opening an s hook, I had a feeling he had one.
>Daniel_Citron: OTU L12 OUT +12 321
>Adam_Ginzberg: ENRRSTU 14J RU. +5 315
#note I like this play. If I play at 13K, most likely he'll have a solid response. Which is why i play RU(T) rather than RUT.
>Daniel_Citron: INOSTX N4 TOXINS +40 361
#note Bold move, it seems pretty solid to me.

>Adam_Ginzberg: ENPRSTY 15L SPRY +35 386
#note Now what? On this play I try to come up with a cute setup. Nothing doing. I look at his clock and see its running and hes down to 30 seconds. I don't say anything, keep thinking (it is a pretty hard turn) until he realizes at -8 seconds and hits his clock. Then i think for another 3 minutes on my time and play spry.
>Daniel_Citron: ACDEELN B6 ....ED +13 420
#note He's flustered after having gone accidentally overtime and doesnt track my last rack.
