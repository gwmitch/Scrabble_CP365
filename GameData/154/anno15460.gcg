#note Didn't know DOVISH.
>Erickson_Smith: ADINW I3 WADIN. +16 28
>Ryan_Fischer: CDHOSST H1 CHOT +38 53
#note CHOT* -- it needs two Ts to be good this way.  SHOT was my other consideration.  Shoulda played that, but didn't want to give such an easy lane.
>Erickson_Smith: ETV G3 VET +26 54
>Ryan_Fischer: CDLNRSS -CDLNS +0 53
#note Don't want to keep a C on this closed board.  Shucking as many consonants as I can.  Need to give myself chances to draw vowels, and I'm thinking 3 consonants to no vowels doesn't pan out too well, especially here.  Q's suggestions to play through the I are nutty, IMO.
>Erickson_Smith: AEHINTX 1A XANTHEI. +113 167
>Erickson_Smith: AEHINTX --  -113 54
>Ryan_Fischer: EJLORSU 1F JU.O +13 66
#note I got this one right, even with rack inference.  I was expecting him to play N(I)X, giving me an E lane.  He tried to set up his X instead...
>Erickson_Smith: AEHINTX 5I .AH +14 68
#note It's funny, Champ picks (D)AH too.  Nice one, Erick.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAELNRS L3 ARSENAL +74 140
#note Champ says no question, play ARSENAL and let him have his X bomb.
>Erickson_Smith: IPX 6H P.XI. +60 128
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGLMRT M1 GAM +20 160
#note Another word I don't know (and should).  GAM(ETA)L.  Hard find, though.
>Erickson_Smith: AEEINRT H8 .NERTIAE +77 205

>Erickson_Smith: CEILNOS D6 LICENSO. +76 281
#note Yow.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEMORY 14J MAYOR +42 288
#note I just had this rack versus Randy last game and played AnYMORE/(WEDEL)n.  I think I'm justified in playing MAYOR as ANYMORE and ROSEMARY, which I both saw, give back way too much.  I think anytime you can score 42 and keep ?E on an open board, it's a good thing.  Thoughts?
>Erickson_Smith: BDEOR 15K BORED +41 322
#note Erick continues to score excellently.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADELTZ 8K L.ZED +45 333
#note Oh wow, I missed wALTZED for 129!  Big mistake.  I thought passing up TEAZELED was smart.  Didn't think to look for much of anything else.
>Erickson_Smith: DEFIW N2 WIFED +47 369
#note And I pay for my miss.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AINOOT 11G O.ATIONs +64 397
#note Finally cash in on the blank.  One big downside to waiting so long is the sooner you bingo, the sooner you can bingo again.
>Erickson_Smith: ABEIQSU C3 SQUAB +47 416
#note Champ agrees, SQUAB is best.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?FPSTUY F12 F. +5 402
#note This is a case of me getting way too cute.  I saw PUNTY FIRST and it's champ's top choice.  F(E) is just dumb as it gives him a chance to shut me down and still score.  Shoulda just played the game out in two.  (F(E) sets up PaSTY for 67, which I thought was a good idea.  Obviously it wasn't.)  It sims 3rd, which means my followup move was no good.
>Erickson_Smith: EINOU 14E NU +14 430
>Ryan_Fischer: ?PSTUY B6 PoUTY +38 440
#note (Q)aT still wins here.  I had him tracked right, I just didn't stop to think.  It's like I suddenly became adverse to winning even though the tiles were handed to me.
>Erickson_Smith: EIO D3 OI +28 458
>Ryan_Fischer: S 4G ...S +14 454
#note Well done, Erick.  He finished 2nd in the 1st State Championship and I slipped to 4th.  Mistakes kill.  This was definitely a fun game, though.
>Ryan_Fischer:  (E) +2 456
