>freak_by_ovens: BCDEGIS 8D CEBID +26 26
#note the duck says to sacrifice four points to go with GIBED for the preferrable CS leave. duly noted. <tosses suggestion into garbage>
>torn_berlin: AADDINS D8 .ANDIDAS +76 76
#note HOW DID QUACKLE KNOW I WOULD GIVE HIM THE ONLY LETTER TO MAKE AN 8LW?!? THIS GAME IS FIXED!!!!
>freak_by_ovens: EEGMPSV 7G MEVE +26 52
#note despite the questionable leave, MEVE# sims neck-and-neck with c12 GEM (25). score one for rational thought.
>torn_berlin: HOWY 15D .HOWY +42 118
#note nice <snort> play <snort>.
>freak_by_ovens: CGINPSW 6J WING +29 81
#note another instance where a less-than-favourable leave is still the way to go. two 14c plays are offered as alternatives: WASP (30) and PAC (14). good luck with those, quacker.
>torn_berlin: INOY N6 YONI +35 153
#note lucky bastard. how dare he gets both Ys.
>freak_by_ovens: ?CINOPS O9 SCOPINg +91 172
#note there's only one available bingo that scores more. nod at the screen if you got it.
>torn_berlin: AELMOTU 13B MO.ULATE +76 229
#note there's something else that scores 85. see if you can spot it.
>freak_by_ovens: AEFJOQU 5K QUA +51 223
#note duck rogers really likes c9 JOE (40). i had considered that or just JO in that spot to draw one of the letters for a 60-pointer at m9. hey, 51 ain't too shabby. yeah, i'll take that now.
>torn_berlin: AGI 11B GA.I +12 241
#note hmm. alrighty then.
>freak_by_ovens: EEFJORS E5 JEF. +28 251
#note thanks for blocking JOE. probably shouldn't have done this since this cuts down two lanes. had i seen it, the JEFE at 12g (32) would've been my choice. 4l SJOE# (41) is cute, but it just isn't my style.
>torn_berlin: IX M9 XI +35 276
#note nice find, nigel.
>freak_by_ovens: EEORSTT C9 TE. +9 260
#note i must have racked my brain for at least five minutes trying to formulate a rational decision. really wanted to ditch an R with the other five outstanding. as you can plainly see, i didn't do so and settled on some god-awful excuse for an expert play. just slap down 14a TOEA (18) and get it over with.
>torn_berlin: AEEIIRS 11G AIERIES +74 350
#note what a stinker.
>freak_by_ovens: EOORSTV F3 VROT +22 282
#note m2 VORAGO (25) serves as the feature attraction, creating another line for an eight while leaving better tiles and scoring a touch more.
>torn_berlin: EKNOR 14J KRONE. +40 390
#note nothing to see here. stop looking before this gets really ugly.
>freak_by_ovens: AAEORST 5J A... +19 301
#note yup, that's the way to go. let's hope he does something stupid soon.
>torn_berlin: BDEENOR 3E O.ERBEND +68 458
>torn_berlin: BDEENOR --  -68 390
#note that'll do. way to remember OVERBENT* is VERBOTEN.
>freak_by_ovens: AEORSTU 3A OUTRA.ES +74 375
#note ok, you HAVE to bingo here. even though you're providing a spot for one of the three in BDEENOR, it already fit at b3. you're pulling within 15. and guess what? you're drawing seven of the last 14. AND THERE'S A BLANK IN THE BAG. so he bingoes and there's a possibility you can bingo out and totally piss off your opponent.
>torn_berlin: BDEENOR 2G DEBONER +67 457
#note and he misses the higher scoring one. although this is slightly better defensively for bingos along the top row. can karma reward me with something good?
>freak_by_ovens: FHLTTUZ 1L FUTZ +71 446
#note well, yes and no. 71 would be great most of the time, but not when i needed that blank and the outbingo to steal the W.
>torn_berlin: ?AGLLPR 1C GALLoP +45 502
#note hands up if you found SPURGALL. keep them up if you would've been confident enough to play it with the risk of losing hanging over your head. exactly.
>freak_by_ovens: HLT A2 L.TH +8 454
>freak_by_ovens:  (R) +2 456
#note darn it. guess i can't feel too bad about not winning where i had no reasonable shot at winning.
