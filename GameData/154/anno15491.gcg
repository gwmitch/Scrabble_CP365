>Thomas_Reinke: EEIOTWW 6F WO.E +19 41
#note I had him pegged for good stuff as he took so long with his first play, so I blocked the double-double lanes as best I could.
>Will_Anderson: ?AADERS 5E RAD.AtES +92 106
#note Overscored by 2.

>Thomas_Reinke: AADEETU D7 E.AUDATE +72 137
#note I was really hoping that he wouldn't block the C.

#note I like M's.

#note I saw 14J CRUST and CURST, don't know why I passed on them. This isn't a great leave on this board.
>Will_Anderson: ELLM A5 MELL +33 295
>Thomas_Reinke: ?AFNRST 2A eN.RAFTS +88 304
#note I could play INGRAFTS instead and hope for QI.

>Thomas_Reinke: EGIJNPR K8 REJIG +32 336
#note 12I JINGO keeps the P and E in case I draw the X for D1 PREX. This wins the sim, for whatever it's worth.
>Will_Anderson: INQST 13F Q.INTS +30 343
>Thomas_Reinke: HHLNOPY 12M .H +5 341
#note No, Quackle, this doesn't win 100% of the time. I was hoping he'd play PREX without considering the PHYLON response, since he was down on time. If he does that it would have been a tie over the board, and a win by 2 after a recount. 
>Will_Anderson: AEIPX 13M .A +7 350
#note He has to block, this sets up another X play for him.
