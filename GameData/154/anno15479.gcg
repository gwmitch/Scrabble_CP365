#note 8L AGIO does about the same thing, but doesn't retain the possiblity of -ING bingos.

#note This scores the most points, and since the point of scrabble is to score more points than your opponent, this must be the best play. 12B BOFF is the actual play to make.

#note Thought about 12A FROM, but there are enough lanes that opening another seemed fine.

#note Luckily MISWRIT got blocked, because I was waffling on whether it was actually a word. I like to think I would have played it.

#note Quackle thinks this is the only play that wins 100% of the time. But winning percentage doesn't matter because the only way I can realistically lose is a huge blunder on my part. This does give back 4A stuff, but whatever.
