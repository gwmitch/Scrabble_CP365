>Nick_Fraher: BHHNNOO E5 HOB +23 50
#note i really hated this play. There are a bunch of plays like this, all clustered at the top. Top is NOH E5. I just didn't value BHNO over HNNO enough i guess. 3 extra points seemed worth it
>Andy_Healy: ATX D6 TAX +27 43
>Nick_Fraher: HLNNORT 10B HORN. +19 69
#note A obvious setup, but it's also the best equity play I could find so maybe he'll miss it.Sims best
>Andy_Healy: IQ 11A QI +16 59
#note I don't know if this was a block or just his best play

#note I remember taking a really long time on this. Glad I got it mostly right. INK E9 (-1.5)
>Andy_Healy: AEEIJNW 14A .WN +12 110
>Nick_Fraher: DILLNRS H6 DR.LL +6 137
#note Stupid play. I was just impatient and played quickly. DOLL for one less is way better, keep INRS. Also ANIL 12A. Quackle also likes a bunch of plays that burn the S for 14-16 points. Not sure about that

>Nick_Fraher: ??DRVWZ 4H VR.uW +28 241
#note Crazy draw. I wanted to play VROW 4H, but there are 3 Ss unseen! My logic was this: I'm not going to bingo this turn or next unless I play VROW, which I don't want to do.VROW is slightly back, third in the sim.

 If I'm not going to bingo, ditch the crap and score, play the Z for 30-40 next turn, and bingo the turn after. Obviously VROWs is in contention in the same spot, and it's dead even with VROUW. 

Anyway, I'm really happy this was best
>Andy_Healy: CEM 12A .CME +24 224
>Nick_Fraher: ?DEEOYZ 3L OYEZ +37 278
#note Another tough call! I figured I'd take a change and lure him away from my lines on 13 and 14, which can both be blocked with an untimely play. The problem is that OYEZ gives back way a little too much to make it worth it over 10H LEZ.

I saw the latter and took a good 3 minutes deciding between the two.


>Andy_Healy: ABENT O1 BE.ANT +54 278
#note Case in point. 54 is too much to give back. Ugh
>Nick_Fraher: ?DELRTU 13D RUnDLET +62 340

>Nick_Fraher: ACEIIMS 12H AMICI +29 369
#note Love this play. It's perfect
>Andy_Healy: AAISSTU A8 .I +4 296
>Nick_Fraher: EGIJOST 7L JIGS +31 400
#note From my few, the only playable bingo I saw was audiles down N6. 

JIGS seals the deal and blocks it all. I almost played JO 2L, which doesn't empty the back and still lets me outrun him if he does bingo. There's just no good reason to play it over JIGS though. Sims best
>Andy_Healy: ILU N6 I.LU +11 307

#note Did not correct work out endgame :/. Sigh. I gotta start caring at the end, regardless of score
