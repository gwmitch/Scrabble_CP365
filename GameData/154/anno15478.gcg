>Thomas_Reinke: AEFMOPR 8H PROEM +24 24
#note This isn't very good. But it does keep one of the letters for the -IAL hook.
>Noah_Walton: EEGO 9F OGEE +15 15
>Thomas_Reinke: ADFIINS 10E IF +26 50
#note K5 FADEINS is 44, which I would have played had I seen it. Quackle likes this best, so that's cool, maybe this game won't end up being a total trainwreck. (That's an example of the advanced literary technique called forshadowing)
>Noah_Walton: EIOV L8 .OVIE +20 35
>Thomas_Reinke: ADIINST 11C DISTAIN +76 126
>Noah_Walton: EENSSST J4 STEN.SES +77 112
#note He said he was going to play just OSES until he saw the rest. This is a very nice play.
>Thomas_Reinke: KLNNUYZ 5G KLU.Z +36 162
#note I played this thinking it didn't take the Y.
>Noah_Walton: AFTU 6D TUFA +21 133
>Thomas_Reinke: IINNORY H11 .RONY +27 189
#note Not playing L1 IRONY is a huge blunder.
>Noah_Walton: AAGV H1 VAGA. +30 163
>Thomas_Reinke: BEEIIIN D2 BINI. +14 203
#note C9 INDIE. Mistakes piling up.
>Noah_Walton: DHOO 12A HOOD +33 196
>Thomas_Reinke: ABCEEIR A8 BEAC. +36 239
#note BEACHIER is a word. I shoould have just played it, it's 185 ever-loving points. Embarrassment envelops my soul like a shame-cocoon.
>Noah_Walton: IRTTU 2A TUR.IT +20 216
>Thomas_Reinke: AEIRRRT 14B RETRAI. +18 257
#note With TARRIER blocked I spend a while only to make this poor play. BEACHIER is still the best.
>Noah_Walton: DOOP C1 D.OOP +26 242
>Thomas_Reinke: ADEEIRW 15A AERIED +36 293
#note W's aren't much fun, but 36 points is more than enough fun to make up for it.
>Noah_Walton: MY B9 MY +32 274
>Thomas_Reinke: AGJLLNW 13F GL.W +21 314
#note Quackle likes tacking on the A for four more points. I seriously thought about E5 GULL to block the X, but I thought he might be doing some bingoing and I wanted it for myself.
>Noah_Walton: X 5C ..X +42 316
>Thomas_Reinke: ACHJLNQ E1 Q. +11 325
#note The Q wasn't really what I needed. I wanted to avoid getting stuck with it, and it doesn't empty the bag, but I have basically no chance after this, even if I draw a blank. Quackle likes A2 TAJ, but that seems hopeless as well. 
>Noah_Walton: ??AEELU M3 EUcLAsE +76 392
#note Underscored by 2.
>Thomas_Reinke: ACHJLNW L1 JAW +26 351
#note M12 HAJ.
>Noah_Walton: N 3L ..N +6 398
>Noah_Walton:  (CHLN) +18 416
#note Very poorly played by me. Final score recorded as 351-414.
