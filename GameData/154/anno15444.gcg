#note Not even worried

>Winter: ADEFLMO 9K FAMED +35 149
#note Want to keep it tight b/c Mark gets into time trouble.

>Winter: AIILNOR 10C INRO +17 166
>Mark_Pistolese: AI J10 AI. +5 153
#note He's letting his clock run low.
>Winter: AEGILLN O9 .EALING +30 196
>Mark_Pistolese: A 15N A. +3 156
#note He takes forever--down to about 10 minutes now.
>Winter: EILOOSS 14H SOLO +14 210
#note As I play this, hoping he cannot bingo through I. If he can't, I kill the spot and he's fucked.
>Mark_Pistolese: AELNRST C6 RATL.NES +70 226
#note Nertz.
>Winter: CEIRSSX M13 XIS +24 234
#note He's still way low on time.
>Mark_Pistolese: BNU 10L BUN. +28 254
>Mark_Pistolese: BNU --  -28 226
#note No way we wins afterr this. Down to about 6 min.
>Winter: CEIRSVY 10N Y. +28 262
>Mark_Pistolese: BGNU 6B B.UNG +18 244
#note This is great, making a bingo extremly difficult, but it creates a dilemma for me.
>Winter: CEIRRSV 8A VE. +18 280
#note I'm only up 18--that's not a lot. I want to keep the board tight and push him over time, but I cannot assume that he's not going to open up the board and bingo. Also, he could easily pass me by hitting that T spot if I leave it alone, or else if I do something like (T)IC for 6.
>Mark_Pistolese: HO 7L OH +28 272
#note See--he can still catch up if I don't score.

>Winter: CEIRRSU D3 REC.RS +28 308
#note Quackle hates this, and I wasn't thrilled about opening the board. If I had seen URIC, that would have been a vastly superior play.
>Mark_Pistolese: ENTZ 3B NE.TZ +28 300
#note This doesn't look so bad.

>Winter: GIIJLPU B1 JI. +20 328
#note I'm feeling pretty good. He has to bingo from the J, or start with an A--what are the odds of that?
>Mark_Pistolese: ?AEMNOW 4F AdWOMEN +91 391
#note What were the odds?
