#note Missed another option here, IMPIOUS. This looks fine. Down a tempo, opening the board seems like a good thing, while the two plays have similar equities.

#note FUCOSE is an option I didn't know here. Also COFT 5C, which I missed. I don't like COFT because the S looks worse than average on this board and Us suck. FUCOSE seems correct because it's so many more points than FUB.

#note Dave's actual rack, and a huge break for me.

#note Okay, so I didn't see the simple (R)HO hook. That opens up some more interesting possibilities for this play: GAR and RADAR. RADAR scores more than GRADE and opens up scoring spots that can help me counterbalance a bingo if he gets one. However, RADAR lets Dave open the board much more effectively than GRADE does (outside of PROGRADE), by simply playing up and opening rows 1 and 2. Still, if he makes such a play, I come out reasonably well, being able to score through his opening and stay more than a bingo up. Of course, it also seems like GS makes it harder to close both the 4 and O lanes than ARS does if he makes a row 4 scoring play. Then there's the GAR direction, which I'm not satisfied with. What does ADRS accomplish for me on this board? I'd rather make a blocking play. The RADAR vs. GRADE decision is interesting though. I'm leaning toward GRADE because of the more balanced leave and because it's much harder to open off of, but 9 points is definitely useful here as well.

#note I considered FRAYED, JOE, and FRAY here. My main goal is to outscore Dave. I can't worry too much about bingos because the score is close, I thought. I played this over FRAY because it scored 9 extra and I was still quite likely to have JOE after it. I didn't choose JOE because the line O scoring spot looked like the best one on the board. Now that I look at this position more, I wonder if my original assessment is wrong. If we trade scoring plays I will come out ahead here, because my rack is strong and I have tempo on Dave. Thus, maybe I should think about bingos more. After JOE, Dave will often make a play opening something, though. The question is, can I afford to block? I think the answer is yes for the most part. JOE - Dave's Y play + blocking play usually still retains tempo on Dave. And then there's the matter of outrunning bingos. Even after FRAYED, I can outrun a lot of bingos, as I can get some really strong out-in-twos after he plays to the R. I think I prefer JOE to FRAYED here though. After JOE I can still outpace his scoring almost all the time, while the bingo lane he has to work with is much weaker.

#note Best sequence here is cool. It's fairly involved, and only one point better than my play. Try to find it!
