#note I saw this and didn't think hard enough before playing it. I knew SCION could be spelled as a 4 (they don't mean the same thing, but whatever), and decided this was it. This was an embarrassing sequence.

#note This is a laughably bad play. DREIGH or DRIEGH would have been perfect.

#note After AERIFIES got blocked, I was pretty happy to see this. J3 ALEF for 41 is the star play. I wanted to go quick to alleviate some of the time pressure I put myself in.

#note The game starts getting fun around here.

#note I shouldn't be slotting the D here; DETAINEE is way too likely. MENTA or MEANT in the same spot is way better, not only because of the unduplicated T's.
>Jan_Cardia: ?AEEEST F10 .E. +5 273
#note I think she said she drew a T after this, so this must have been her rack. She probably should be doing something to block 2B TWINJET, which is the only playable bingo in the pool. The unintuitive G2 ER blocks the bingo, and if TWINJET is played through the E anyway, has the possiblity of coming back with 1H SEPTATE to win.
