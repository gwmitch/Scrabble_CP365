>freak_by_ovens: ?EEFHIR 8D HEIFERs +82 82
#note CHIEFER is best for obvious reasons. both score 82, so i'm gonna pretend like i care about what i didn't play.
>airwoman_b'n'b: HOOY E5 HOO.Y +22 22
>freak_by_ovens: ?AILORS H1 vALORIS. +74 156
#note ooh, d7 SHOALIER is a touch better. but why worry when you've drawn both blanks and bingoed on your first two turns?
>airwoman_b'n'b: ABEGILN 3H .ABELING +74 96
#note GAINABLE is two more but this leaves more open real estate for stuff like, you know, other bingos. hey, i like it.
>freak_by_ovens: AEIOTWY D1 YOWIE +35 191
#note f4 YOW sims way ahead of YOWIE for some reason. in hindsight, i would've rather gone with 2j AWETO# (39) - even with the IY leave. and if we're talking about changing the past, then i'd go back in time and convince nigel richards to choose another board game as a competitive hobby.
>airwoman_b'n'b: ADEENTV L3 .EVANTED +76 172
#note ouch. words really do hurt.
>freak_by_ovens: AAIKTTU O1 KA.U +30 221
#note there's an argument for 1a TAKY (33). but i forget what it is and i'm just going to continue with this game, if that's alright with y'all.
>airwoman_b'n'b: DEEGIMN M9 DEEMING +84 256
#note fact: brian is as much a blocker as i am a male prostitute. (go ahead, draw your own conclusions.)
>freak_by_ovens: AIQTTUW 14J QUA.T +68 289
#note you know what this game needs? more points, gosh darn it.
>airwoman_b'n'b: AX O14 AX +42 298
>freak_by_ovens: DEIJLTW 15G JEDI +47 336
#note use the force. it's your only hope.
>airwoman_b'n'b: AENORSV 12H OVERS.AN +80 378
>airwoman_b'n'b: COOR (challenge) +5 383
#note screw the force. are there any scrabble voodoo dolls for sale at the vendor tables?
>freak_by_ovens: CEFLTTW 2B FL.W +20 356
#note 1a CETYL (30) scores the most by far but isn't worth the nasty leftovers. FLOW ranks near the top because the leave is fine, no bingo lanes are sacrificed, and i keep my only vowel.
>airwoman_b'n'b: COOR O8 CROO. +21 404
>freak_by_ovens: CEISTTZ J6 ZE.T +32 388
#note wow, i'm shocked i missed 10b ZITS (45) or 6d SOZ (44) - or even 2g CAZ (25) as a rack balancer. but i'm not going to lose sleep over my move.
>airwoman_b'n'b: GOPU 11E UPGO +16 420
#note he's two turns without a bingo. talk about a drought. however, i've got a feeling we're not done with the excitement yet.
>freak_by_ovens: BCIRSTT C4 BRIT +17 405
#note BRIT doesn't appear in the top-15. but when you insert the play in the list, it jumps to second place. what's #1? 12a BRITT (22), which wipes out the open rows at the bottom and allows easy comebacks to completely destroy the board. your move, quackalicious.
>airwoman_b'n'b: AINRSTU 13B NUTRIAS +69 489
#note eep. for those scoring at home, that's FIVE bingos for the other guy.
>freak_by_ovens: ACEINST B8 ANCIE.TS +82 487
#note wow. just wow. kudos to brian for not tossing the board at me in disgust.
>freak_by_ovens:  (DLMP) +18 505
#note the moral of this story is if you draw the perfect tiles at all the right moments, then you too can pull an unwinnable game out of thin air.
