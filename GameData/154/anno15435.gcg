>Keith_Pries: AEV 7E AVE +17 17
>Winter: IILORTU 6G LITU +16 34
#note Quackle heavily favours TORII over LITU--odd. Maybe it's because of the better scoring opportunity available to my opponent.

>Winter: CIIOORS 5F OI +13 47
>Keith_Pries: ADGT 8A GAT.D +21 112
>Winter: ACFIORS 4G SCORIA +34 81
#note I knew that Quackle would not like this, but based on Keith's rating, body language, and his missing the double-double, and just based on what had been happening, I decided that I was going to lose if I gave up points trying for a bingo.
>Keith_Pries: UY A8 .UY +7 119
>Winter: AEFNOPR C6 PA.EN +27 108
#note Same logic. I'm close to catching up.

>Keith_Pries: FGSU 10E FUGS +12 217
#note Wow. Both esses.
>Winter: ACDEEMR A1 RA. +30 204
#note By this point, Keith is REALLY low on time, under 5 minutes, maybe less, so I'm trying to slow the game down.
>Keith_Pries: BIKS O1 BISK +54 271

>Winter: ELOQRTY -QLT +0 247

>Winter: ELORTWY 11D WET +24 271

>Winter: LLNRTVY C12 .L +4 308
#note Need to push him over time.
>Keith_Pries: AENNQT K9 .ENT +14 364
#note Ah, this is why Quackle hates my play--because he had a Q play but didn't see it.
