#note Considered DHOTI, but I decided to take the opportunity to tighten the board, even though my lead is tiny. I just really hated giving the triple back and keeping no vowels. The plays sim close.

#note BERGS sims better. I passed it up because I am paranoid about the slightly easier nines it gives back. But really, those are unlikely. My thinking was that if I got a disaster draw, he might try to outrun me with a play like QAId, then I will at least have R(E)B to come back. Or if he goes for a one-tile fish like 3D NE, I can block with NEB.

#note Mostly played okay this game, I think. Paranoid plays like PEGS are going to become a theme of this tournament.
