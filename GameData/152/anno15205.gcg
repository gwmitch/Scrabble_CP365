>Siddharth_Murali: CEEEILR H8 RELIC +20 20
#note This was a terrible play... didn't know CEILER, and thought EELIER was worse, but EELIER is actually tons better. I must have overestimated EE.
>Mark_Rosenberg: ERX I7 REX +38 38
>Siddharth_Murali: EEEFHIY G7 FEH +37 57
#note Okay, slightly better than YEH. CHIEF is also worth consideration, but I was afraid I would spell it wrong :)
>Mark_Rosenberg: FGILNRT 11F TR.FLING +74 112

>Mark_Rosenberg: AIIN E2 INIA +12 124

#note A lot of plays are close, but this is the bottom of the lot.
>Mark_Rosenberg: DEIOZ 2B IOD.ZE +72 196
#note Jeez... 
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AEEIRS 1G AERIESt +73 163
#note Aww... right word, wrong place.. N6!
>Mark_Rosenberg: ?ADIOTU 13E OUTsAID +66 262
#note N4
>Siddharth_Murali: BOW 1A BOW +31 194
#note Didn't write down this rack
>Mark_Rosenberg: ARTY N7 TRAY +30 292
>Siddharth_Murali: EHMSSUU 14B SMUSH +51 245
#note Bleh, missed HUMUSES (but somehow saw humus J6 as an option!) Gah, I suck. Well I had a hard time debating between smush and humus. Yes, smush is 51, but ditching both my esses will make it harder for me to bingo in the future although it opens a new S lane.  But I said, "Screw it, I'm taking the points".
>Mark_Rosenberg: Q -Q +0 292
#note Exchanged 4.
>Siddharth_Murali: AAENORU 13A EAU +16 261
#note I didn't see NONA immediately, so I opted for the best rack balancer. It holds a decent leave and allows me a chance to bingo at D5
>Mark_Rosenberg: DEW 14J DEW +21 313
>Siddharth_Murali: ALNOORV 15L OVAL +30 291
#note Still didn't see NONA. VOLAR is better too.
>Mark_Rosenberg: GMO 12C MOG +23 336
>Siddharth_Murali: AANOORU 3C NO.A +34 325
#note I figured chances of bingoing were getting slimmer and slimmer, so again, I went with the "shove points down his throat" mentality.
>Mark_Rosenberg: Q -Q +0 336
#note Exchanged 4. 
>Siddharth_Murali: ABORTUV A7 OUTRAV. +42 367
#note You might call this a brave comeback, but I failed to find the befitting bingo :(
>Mark_Rosenberg: EJT B6 JET +30 366
>Siddharth_Murali: BCEGINT 9L C..G +7 374
#note This was an extremely weird turn, and I spent about 8 minutes on this play. My thinking was that I didn't really need to go out in 2 or 3 turns because of the ugly pool. Rather, I did not want to set up QI for 22 with a play like BINGE, and I also did not want to get C stuck. I also wanted to retain both my vowels because I am guaranteed to pick a consonant out of the bag. I didn't want to block the QI 10K spot in the 1 in 8 chance I would draw the Q. In the case that he indeed has the Q, I figured it's okay for him to play it for 11 instead of 22. CLAG seemed to achieve all of these goals.
>Mark_Rosenberg: DKNPPQS K10 Q. +11 377
>Siddharth_Murali: BEINNT I1 .IB +8 382
#note Okay, this is fine. Again, my priority wasn't really to go out as quickly as possible. I have TENT for next turn and I didn't want him to play IODIZES for 19.
>Mark_Rosenberg: DKNPPS I6 P... +13 390
#note Mark was time pressured here, or else I'm sure he would have seen TSK.
>Siddharth_Murali: ENNT 9A .ENT +16 398
>Mark_Rosenberg: DKNPS 12M .NK +12 402
>Siddharth_Murali: N J1 .N +8 406
#note This an example of 'win by brute force!' Mark played fine, I didn't really deserve to win this one. 
>Siddharth_Murali:  (DPS) +12 418
