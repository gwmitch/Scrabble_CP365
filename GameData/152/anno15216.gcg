>Thomas: CDEOU 8D COUDE +22 22
>Will: ABIIKRS H4 BIKI. +14 14
#note BIKIE keeps a good leave but scores weakly and leaves only one difficult-to-use S hook so it can't be best. KRUBI, KAURI, or IRK are better.
>Thomas: EOW 6F WO.E +19 41
>Will: ?AADERS 5E RAD.AtES +92 106
#note Missed SEABOARD/AWOKE. Doesn't make the easy ERADIATES scoring spot.
>Thomas: AABIW L3 WA.ABI +24 65
>Will: EEINSTU G8 .ETINUES +61 167
>Thomas: AADEETU D7 E.AUDATE +72 137
>Will: EEGRTVZ 15E ZE.T +39 206
#note Wow, guess this wasn't such a no brainer after all. I played ZEST pretty fast, but Quackle thinks at least 6 plays warrant consideration. Normally saving the Z for future turns when you can score 30+ without it is a good plan, and maybe especially so on a board like this with a ton of intermediate scoring opportunities and a simple spot for a Z play at C12.
>Thomas: DGO M2 GOD +23 160
>Will: AEGRRRV C2 GRAVER +25 231
#note It's well worth it to play GRAVER 4A for the extra points. The board is open enough that the G at A4 isn't too likely to offer something better than what was already there.
>Thomas: MNOOY B6 MOONY +37 197
>Will: FIILORV M8 FRIVOL +31 262
>Thomas: CU 4F CU. +19 216
>Will: EILLMNT A5 MELL +33 295
#note Quackle likes LIMEN; I'm not so sure. Vowels are scarce and it seems easier to play from A1 than from A10. Grabbing for 6 extra points could get me into trouble next turn.
>Thomas: ?AFNRST 2A eN.RAFTS +88 304
>Will: INNOTTX 1H INTO +18 313
#note Well, this just got interesting. I don't think I appreciated the virtues of N3 TOXIN. Yes, it opens another triple, but very few consonants unseen (just NS, in fact) play parallel to the I down column O, and both of the letters in my leave play there. Also it ensures that I take a slight lead and have scoring options available to counter any plays Thomas makes. INTO is too risky. It has the upside of big X plays but as I have learned before, keeping a power tile this late in the game with several more to draw can get ugly fast. I'm in trouble if I don't draw two of the remaining seven vowels and an E in particular.
>Thomas: EGIJR K8 REJIG +32 336
>Will: INPQSTX 13F Q.INTS +30 343
#note I had a hard time evaluating this position too. First of all playing either the P or the X is not right so that I can threaten PREX D1 with the E. But can I avoid emptying the bag, and do I even want to? Also I hoped to mess with the ZESTY hook, which looks like a great scoring option for Thomas and might be his best shot at outs-in-two with 5-consonant, 1 vowel, and a Y type-racks. CP recommends 13I QIS (33%) over N6 QIS (30%), which somewhat confirms that blocking ZESTY is worth doing, then 4B QAT, and then my play, which wins a quarter of the time. It seems like with such a small lead after any of the candidate plays here, I just have to hope both for the E and that Thomas can't go out in two while blocking PREX if I do actually draw the E. Perhaps if he has the E but it's his only vowel, I'll still be okay, because the X is still useful here to me without it.
>Thomas: HHLNOPY 12M .H +5 341
>Will: AEIPX N12 .A +7 350
#note I am in major time trouble at this point and Thomas' clever move has caught me off guard (I should have been brainstorming what plays like this he could try on his clock). I quickly count the scores for PREX vs. PHYLON and find that we would tie if I play PREX - but actually after a recount it would have been a two-point loss. After that I have to quickly block and I neglect the top option of PIE/RIFE leaving AX - but fortunately enough this play does win.
>Thomas: HLNOPY 4B H.Y +18 359
>Will: EIPX O13 PIX +41 391
#note E11 EX is better because PI goes out in a couple good places.
>Thomas: LNOP N1 LOP +24 383
>Will: E 13C E. +4 395
#note Down to only a couple of seconds, I try to slap this down before incurring a penalty, but fail - so I get the worst of both worlds (time penalty + inferior play). Fortunately it doesn't deal me a heartbreaking loss. I played imprecisely in this game and was extremely fortunate to win. Final score 387-383.
