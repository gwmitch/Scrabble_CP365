#note Went for points. Stupid play on my part. 8H EKE 14 and 8F EKE 14 (both of which I saw) are clearly better.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: DDILR E3 RIDDL. +16 16
>Jesse_Matthews: ?CDILST I3 CLaDIST +74 102
#note Quackle prefers I2 DeLICTS for 70. I prefer my play not offering him easy TWS points.

>Jesse_Matthews: BDJORRS B2 DR.B +14 152
#note Quackle prefers C3 J(O)B for 24 and C3 D(O)JO for 24. I don't like D(O)JO at all given the leave, but J(O)B has some merit to it. I made my play to give myself an easy JO for 30 next turn at A1, but what would I do if he played something small in the top left on his next turn? Quackle's probably right here.

>Jesse_Matthews: AGJOORS A1 JO +30 182
#note Saw but passed on 6C GA(D)JO 30, which barely ekes my play out in sims.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: HM 11E HM +28 159
>Jesse_Matthews: AGOORSW 12C GOA +14 196
#note Quackle suggests 6H O(D)A 24, 2E GOO 16, N2 GROW 27 and 2M WOO 17 ahead of my play. The last 4 all needlessly open up the board for him to bingo, which seems highly probable given his last play. O(D)A has some merit to it given how many Es are still in the pool, and it scores 10 more than my play, which doesn't really block anything. My reasoning for my play is that if he bingos below my play, he's almost never hitting a DWS and I'll likely get a TWS play next turn. If he bingos off of CLOVE, I'll likely have a shot at a TWS to counter next turn. I'm also likely to have a play using my O and my W underneath GOA next turn if he doesn't bingo.

#note My first big word knowledge chickenshit moment of the tournament. I see M1 OV(E)RWISE 65 and think "Wow, that'd sure be nice if that were a word. Seems stupid, and he'd challenge it off for sure." Le fail.

#note I am so desperately not wanting to stupidly lose a turn I pass up on FAENA in the same spot, which I am only 95% sure of at this point, and play this instead. Quackle says that I have 15% less of a chance to win this game because of it...ouch!

>Jesse_Matthews: IINNORU 15A UNION +29 392
#note Seeing no chance to win with any play with words I know 100%, I decide to make a play that will allow me to win if it is in fact valid. SHAMEN* does that rather nicely...
