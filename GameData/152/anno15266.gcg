#note I wanted to fork the board.  Players like Katya like to control the board.  My goal was to create more choices.  He gold would probably shut down column A ASAP.

#note Not sure why this is not on the list.  She told me she had a +70pt play with the z.  Almost played ENATURE but chickened out.  RENATURE and DENATURE are good though.

#note she played this as block and said she may have not had she known I wasn't going to hook a s on ode.  Hooking an s was my plan until she made her move, and then I figured I cold score more at O1, keep my s, and have O column relatively blocked for a bingo.
