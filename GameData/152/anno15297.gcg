#note Wasnt sure if I wanted to blow the rack up, but K5 ELM sims better. Weird because it keeps the S but kills the hook.

#note Some bad word knowledge here. I talked myself out of CULLY and MENSED.

#note The sim likes LOUIE, but that seemed easy to block. I though OUD was hard to deal with entirely.

#note I didn't see LEAKS winning very often. But I'm surprised I11 HAO sims best. I thought the K would make things too hard.

#note I dunno, I definitely could have improved my chances this game. Peter definitely schooled me on the tight board while I allowed myself to get frustrated with bingo tiles. CURLY and YIN were ugly plays.
