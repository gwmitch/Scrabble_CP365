#note Quackle hates this. E5 OBA sims best. I really didn't think the leave was anything special, but it's a 8-point error in the sim.

#note Ugh, I missed the same play at K4. Silly. Brain not quite on in the game.

#note Hmm... I didn't consider RETUNE to open the board up. I was a little nervous that Avery would bingo and leave me with no lines, though.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EENRUU I7 U.U.ER +8 226
#note I immediately regretted not doing SURE. I have the only remaining hook tile for SURE, so that play is awesome. What a huge mistake.

#note Blocking the OX play.

#note Avery making me sweat about the Q
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACDGQUV 1F QU.G +14 374
#note I had time here, but just could not solve the pre-endgame. I decided the Q-stick was a risk I didn't want to take, and that maybe Avery wouldn't know all of the bingos that were unseen to me. The best play is the simple 2L BED, which loses to his bingos that start with S, but outruns the ones that hit VIRAGOS.

>Avery_Mojica:  (ACO) +10 358
#note One of my worst-played games of the tournment, I think. Equity mismanagement on turns like BRADOON. Playfinding failures on GIP and TEPHRITE. Lousy, lousy strategy error on USURER. And then a totally botched pre-endgame on QUAG. Not happy with this effort at all.
