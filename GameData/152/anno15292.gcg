#note Quackle thinks AYIN is worth it. Actually, I kind of like INIA in hindsight, since it actually reduces bingo lane volatility and shortens the game

#note I liked this since it actually increased volatility for me, but weakened it a bit for him. Quackls says to just take points with 10L DENS, though.

#note Aw, RESHARPEN is good. Anyways, this is meant to open a scoring spot for me to race his bingo, should he hit it. RESHARPEN is obviously the play, but Quackle also prefers 13D INIA.

#note I bled a ton of spread this tournament blocking bingos that I didn't think were there. I just don't trust my tracking/playfinding enough. I don't think it's necessarily wrong, but there you go.

#note Easy game with what I drew. Not thrilled with all of my plays though, like my post-bingo exchange.
