>Matt_Canik: ?ABETUY C6 BU.YlATE +84 110
#note BUTYRATE, EURYBATH also? Nice. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: EEJRT 12A JE.TER +42 77
#note I thought about holding here. I have been paranoid about Geoff beginning to phoney me for a while (and held a few of his plays this tourney, even), but man, I should know shit like this isn't good. 
>Matt_Canik: EGILMOV A12 .IVE +42 152
>Geoff_Thevenot: DDEFOR 11E FORDED +34 111
#note I did hold this one, but decided FORDING was good so this had to be too. 
>Matt_Canik: DGIILMO H11 .ILDO +24 176
#note I don't like how this opens things up, but BUTYLATED was not something I wanted to try with VID.

#note BEWIG

>Matt_Canik: ABEGIOQ 14F QA.I +34 233
#note I almost instantly played Q(U)AG lol. Slow down Matt. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: HRT 3C H.RT +14 182
>Matt_Canik: BEGORSS 13G B.OG +21 254
#note Hiding the esses here seems like a good idea. GOBS M7 was considered for a while to close, but plays through 8L scored easy points and gave me positions that were difficult to close without sacrificing a lot. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ANW L10 .AWN +18 200
>Matt_Canik: DEEORSS 9I ODES +32 286
#note Mmmm that closed stuff beautifully.
>Geoff_Thevenot: AAIKLT H2 LATAKI. +23 223
#note ...but he wasn't even close to bingoing anyway lol
>Matt_Canik: EILNORS 3H .ILERONS +68 354
#note Last game I played AILERON, this game I played AILERONS. Good work, me.
