#note I really wanted to do N1 YEW, but couldnt believe that was actually the play. It's Quackle's fave over this by a good 4 points, though!

#note I felt compelled to at least weaken the scoring spot to the triple, but I'm not weakening it much. The sim prefers F2 WRANG.

#note N5 DUSK or DUST don't work well after the S inference. Though the S is not assured after QIS, it seems likely.

#note I guess I blew this one. I though my just chance was to outrun her, but my best chance is to just draw outs in two spots. and catch her with the F or P. F2 DRUG sims best, and it would have won. Damn...

#note The small mistakes seem huge in a 3-point loss. But I'm pretty disappointed in my failure to solve the pre-endgame, especially since the winning tiles were in the bag. Tough one to lose when it's so clearly my own fault.
