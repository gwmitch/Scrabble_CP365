#note JD: this is the game where I showed up with 3 minutes on my clock after standing around outside for half an hour looking for a taxi... MT: Jesse has 3:03 left to start this game. I wasn't sure whether to try and fast-play him or not.
>JD: EIJLNTZ F6 JE.N +27 27
#note JD: after the game I reconstructed what I thought were my racks, not sure they are all right. 3:03 to start

>JD: ACINNOO E2 COON +19 173
#note JD: I was doing a good job of getting plays down instantly, so I probably had about 2 minutes left at this point. Might have been nice to play something like CORONA to stop the obvious S setup.
>Matt_Tunnicliffe: AEERRST L2 RETEARS +80 193
#note MT: Threw this down and didn't stop to look for the 2x2 for two more pts.

#note MT: This is an easy turn if I know FULLAM. But the word is out of my range. Tsk  JD: This was a huge break for me in this game

#note given that I know he has AES it would've been to block row 12 but didn't have time to do more than take the points and pray

#note JD: we had the score as 451-417 for me. I was feeling a bit unconfident going into this game, this was a huge surge of momentum. MT: Jesse had a full 30 seconds to find the best spot for this tile. How the hell did he play so fast?
