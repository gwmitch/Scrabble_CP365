>Will_Anderson: CEGIMOT 8G MOG +12 12
#note Will: I was wary of Noah's considerable tactical skills - I might have opted to take an equity hit to play GEMOT here. Certainly not COG over MOG, though.
>Noah: EEIMOPR 9C PREMIE +21 21
#note Noah: I thought about this play for a few minutes, but didn't see what I think is the best option until seconds after hitting my clock. Why not OE (or maybe ME) 9G?
>Will_Anderson: CEFINPT D8 C.EPT +24 36
#note Will: Yes, on the very next play I made a very closed play instead of E6 INFECT which would be more thematically consistent against Noah.
>Noah: AEENOOU 11B EU.NOEA +18 39
>Will_Anderson: ADFILNV H11 .VAIL +36 72
#note Will: FLAVIN seems a little risky - maybe AVIAN, though.
>Noah: BEKLOOY 13G K.BLOOEY +100 139
>Noah: BEKLOOY --  -100 39
#note Noah: Thought about this word for a bit and couldn't figure out whether it was good, so I played it because if it is it's just so much better than anything else if it is.
>Will_Anderson: DFNORRT B10 F.TOR +32 104
#note Will: I know YOK is coming, but that's a net -5 after his next turn and might work out better in the long term if I get a crack at column A afterwards to establish tempo.
>Noah: BEKLOOY A13 YOK +37 76
#note Noah: I thought of BLOKE here, but didn't realize that it set up my Y. Still an interesting position, as BLOKE does set up my Y, but Will knows that's what I'm doing. If Will doesn't know my rack BLOKE is correct but as it is the two plays seem close.
>Will_Anderson: ADEINNR A4 NARDINE +82 186
>Noah: BEEILOS J3 OBELISE +68 144
>Will_Anderson: AAEIORS 4I O.IA +12 198
#note Will: Yes, the C will hurt, but what else, really? AEROBIA?
>Noah: DIINOUY 10J DUI +23 167
>Will_Anderson: AELORSU 5A .UREOLAS +66 264
>Noah: CEINOSY H1 SYNC. +51 218
#note Noah: This seems best for sure, but I don't consider fishing enough and I should have at least thought of it here.
>Will_Anderson: GIILRTV D1 GRIV.T +24 288
>Noah: AEHINOZ G13 ZOA +47 265
>Will_Anderson: BEFILQT 3C Q. +22 310
#note Will: I almost played BEFIT now and sim loves it. I imagine every time I pick the case U after BEFIT and play an L8 Q play it's basically a sure win. Also QI is reasonably likely to stay available whereas the BEFIT spot gets taken every time Noah has NX and probably some other combos. There aren't too many vowels left, so it could be a struggle for Noah to play at C13, whereas he should almost always have a decent play down K in that spot.
>Noah: EEHINNT 1A HIN.E +27 292
>Will_Anderson: ABEFILT K1 BEF.T +29 339
#note Noah plays two vowels, which should signal that he has at least one of AAE in reserve - thus I should probably change gears and play C13 BA instead of BEFIT here, because that spot is quite heavy.
>Noah: ADEJNTX C13 DEX +39 331
#note So it looks like I missed some plays here. JINXED ADJOINT JINX JOINTED are all options I didn't consider. I considered JOIN/JOINT, and saw ADJOINT but thought it was too long to fit on row 15. I really like playing 5 tiles off here because the blanks are excellent, and I'll probably need one or both to win this game. DEX is quite weak because it draws few tiles and AJNT doesn't mesh too well with this pool/board.  Of the good plays, I prefer JINXED to JINX because I'd rather try for blanks than keep ADET, which doesn't fit anywhere very good except off row 1 B plays, and a blank helps me with those anyway. Add in 6 points and JINXED has to be better. JOINTED vs. ADJOINT is interesting. JOINTED is punished much more often than ADJOINT but when it's not, it reaps bigger rewards. I think I prefer JOINTED. After ADJOINT, I'm probably going to have to play the X at 15D in the next couple turns. On the other hand, Will is probably making a lot of 3 and 4 tile plays, which doesn't give X plays the best timing. Making a waiting play and saving the X doesn't look good either, since I can still only play two. The 34-point payoff doesn't seem enough to make up for the loss in timing. However, a 47-point payoff from JOINTED is less likely, but has a decenter win chance. I think I prefer JINXED to either play though. JINXED scores more points The W is still a good draw after JINXED. JINXED restricts bingos, which looks like an advantage, since Will's non-bingo plays aren't that strong outside of column C (which I'm just hoping he doesn't get). And since it doesn't keep the X, it saves a more realistic bingo plan for me, using plays from the B either by Will or me.
>Will_Anderson: ?AHILUW 2F WH. +20 359
#note Will: If I expect Noah of having an A when he played HINGE, WHY seems like a good choice here to score decently and very likely draw two consonants - but 6D THAW scores 6 more points, sheds the A in case I draw a second one, and blocks a possible play of 7F JAW. However, it leaves the possibility open for Noah to fish off his J with H7 JOE and leave one tile in the bag. 7F HAW is another option available here that does many of the same things as THAW, but also prevents that possibility. My chances appear to be pretty good with all 3 options.
>Noah: AADJNTW 7F JAW +26 357
#note It looked like this would win with a few double blank draws and maybe a single blank draw or two. Nothing else seemed to give me much of a chance, and this at least gets me *something*. I could do some kind of spread play but the options for that aren't all that great. ATWAIN? DIWAN? Meh.
