>Reid: AFINNQU H6 QUIN +26 26
#note #1 play.
>Wayne: ABIMT 10D AMBIT +29 29
>Reid: AFINRTU 11C FRUIT +32 58
#note I saw ANTIFUR, but missed the hook at H11. I had given up when Wayne hooked QUIN and blocked my spot. FRUIT is the #2 play based on valuations from all choices.

>Wayne: EZ C11 .EZ +30 59
>Reid: AAEEELN 13C .EE +12 70
#note ZEE (46.15%) is #4. AE (47.75%) at D13, ALEE (47.70%) at 9B, and ZEAL (46.32%) at 13C are 1-3. I agree with Quackle concerning the best play. I think ZEAL has a leave that is too vowel heavy. ALEE has a good leave, but is not a good defensive play. My play is okay here, but AE is certainly better. 
>Wayne: OW 9F OW. +25 84
>Reid: AAAELNX 12E LA +14 84
#note LA (41.70%) is #2. AAL (43.13%) at 9B, better at solving the AAA problem, is #1. I had missed that spot. AE (40.84%) at 12F is #3.
>Wayne: GHI I4 GHI +18 102
>Reid: AAAELNX 4I .ALAX +26 110
#note #1 play here. Finally solves my AAA problem. GALA is certainly safer, but I didn't want to keep dragging around the X anymore either.
>Wayne: EKY N2 KEY +37 139
>Reid: AEGJNRT O1 JAR +38 148
#note #1 play.
>Wayne: EOUV K1 OVU.E +16 155
>Reid: EGNPSTT 1H NET.P +30 178
#note #1 play.
>Wayne: NP L3 P.N +11 166
>Reid: GNOOSTV 12A VO. +10 188
#note VOE (52.48%) is #10. SONG (54.86%), SNOOT (54.54%), and SNOG (54.14%) at J6 round out the top 3. Quackle strongly believes I should play my S. I was hoping to pick up an I for an easy ING bingo. Unfortunately this did not happen. I still like my play here, although I will agree that there are still 3 S left, so using an S here would not be such a bad idea.
>Wayne: AEL A12 .ALE +21 187
>Reid: DDGNOST 6L GOD +16 204
#note GOD (48.53%) is #2. DONG (48.73%) at 14E is #1, but too much of a gamble for my blood. DUST (47.90%) at 7G uses my S. I didn't want to play my S for 17 points. I like my play best.
>Wayne: AD B14 AD +13 200
>Reid: DENOSST J6 SOD +20 224
#note Since I had 2 S and there were so many left, I was okay parting with one. SOD (64.07%) is #5. FRUITED (66.46%) at 11C, QUINTS (66.24%) at H6, SH (66.09%) at 5H, and NOSH (64.91%) at 5F are 1-4 respectively. I like QUINTS best here. It scores well, keeps an E, and doesn't close off a bingo lane like SOD does. 
>Wayne: INS O6 SIN +15 215
#note I found this silly if Wayne doesn't have another S, but some people just love to play defensively when the game is close.
>Reid: AEINRST N8 ANESTRI +70 294
#note ANESTRI (88.63%) is #3 according to Quackle 5-min championship player. I saw RETSINA (#1, 89.10%) at 2B but didn't want to create an S hook.I considered ANTSIER (#2, 89.04%) but didn't want to expose O12 to a high powered consonant for a triple. I think my play is best here.
>Wayne: FIRUY 12J FRUI.Y +32 247
>Reid: CDGHIOR K9 CHO.D +22 316
#note CHORD (71.92%) is #3. ORGIC (75.08%) is #2 at 8B. Missing (#1, 82.08%) RHODIC at 8A is a huge mistake because of the forsaken point differential. At this point, Wayne has both blanks, so tile turnover is not a big advantage.
>Wayne: ??CIOTW 2B COWrITe +75 322
#note COWIEST at 14F scores more, but I agree with Wayne's choice here.
>Reid: EEGILOR D2 .OE +12 328
#note My strategy here was to try to grab the last two tiles in the bag, create another lane, and hope I could grab the last S. FRUITER (38.89%) is #1 at 11C. FOE (15.28%) at J12 is #2, and ELF (13.89%) at J10 is #3.  WOE is #3 based on valuations from all choices, so it's not like it was a horrible play.
>Wayne: AEEMNST 14F MEANEST +79 401
#note Just a lucky out.
>Wayne:  (BEGILRR) +20 421
#note This game was scored officially as 326. I missed a bingo early, which is probably my biggest mistake this game.12 and possibly 13 of my plays were in the top 10 and 11 or possibly 12 of my plays were in the top 5. Overall I give myself a B+ this game because of the missed bingo. This game is potentially winnable with the momentum from that play.
