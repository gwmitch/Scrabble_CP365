>Will: ABNOOPT 8D BATON +20 20
#note WA: Probably BOP or PANTO, no need to get hammered by JX here.
>Jesse: AGGHMNO 9G HOGG +26 26
#note JD: where's the J when you need it?
>Will: ALOOPXY 7G POX +37 57
#note WA: I prefer holding the Y.
>Jesse: ADEMNST E4 MAND.TES +94 120
>Will: AELLOUY D8 .AYOU +29 86
>Jesse: ?EIJQRU 6B QUI. +33 153
#note WA: Look at this brutal decision for Jesse. JD: QUIN? QUIRE? I can take the 13 extra points, but it's quite likely that will's picked up an S by now, and I basicaly keep a random rack. QUIN seems much more low variance, almost guaranteeing a bingo in the next two turns. In retrospect I wish I had taken QUIRE - not sure that my lead is big enough at this point to take the safe route.
>Will: EILLOYZ 10C O..Z +36 122
>Jesse: ?CEIJRR -JR +0 153
#note JD: doesn't seem worth it to play through
>Will: EIILLOY J2 OILILY +29 151
>Jesse: ?ACEEIR 4A CERA.IdE +80 233
>Will: ADEFINW 3H WA.FED +33 184
#note WA: So much better for the board than either WIFED or WIF(E) - definitely best against a sharp opp. like Jesse.
>Jesse: ACEIIOU -ACIIOU +0 233
#note JD: this is worse than playing through just because there aren't that many tiles that are especially worth keeping at this juncture. QUAI is interesting - with a lot of Os and As gone it won't be that easy for him to burn me on column A, and I keep an O of my own.

>Will: ABCIPRS L2 B.CAP +22 304
>Jesse: DEEENST 6L .ED +10 299
#note JD: might as well just fish an E at 6I, turnover should be prefered because of the unseen blank but EX/EL ups my bingo percentage by a ton and there's not really a lot will can do about it. stupid time trouble. unnecessary creation of an S hook. there are plenty. just giving him points.
>Will: ?IKRRSV O6 SKIRR +34 338
>Jesse: EEENNST N8 TEEN +14 313
#note JD: might as well flip some tiles over and hunt for the blank
>Will: ?EILTUV J9 .UV +9 347
>Jesse: DEJMNNS -JMN +0 313
#note JD: only had a minute or so on my clock, just happy to dump the J. unfortunately, I was so excited that I drew my new tiles before Will could draw his, which is definitely not legal. Director's call involved civil war reenactment and blindfolding but ended up being fair (possibly even too fair to me). thanks Will. in any case should probably throw back more tiles trying to draw the blank. maybe keeping ENS.
>Will: ?EILOOT 13C OsTIOLE +76 423
>Jesse: DEEFNSU H12 F.UE +33 346
#note JD: need to stop having games where I get so obsessed with making the right decision that I blow all of my time! here it may not have mattered but it could easily have come down to the wire.
>Will: AGHJMNR 14A JAM +28 451
>Jesse: DENS 12J SEND +18 364
#note JD: optimal endgame decision-making
>Jesse:  (GHNR) +16 380
