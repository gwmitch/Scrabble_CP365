#note I didn't think HAAFS would sim so much better, since I wanted to guarantee keeping a letter that fits under the F next turn, and HAAFS is so easy for him to underlap. It's about 5 points better in the sim.

#note I didn't spend enough time considering 13E WAFT which is actually a wonderful board shaping play. For some reason, I thought taking the HEX overlap out was important, but I should have realized how few unseen tiles hook to DE. So yeah, this is a bit of an error.

#note Nah, the leave is too clunky. I should do 11K AFT.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ENPSSTT I12 P.T +5 237
#note This is needlessly risky. I just completely whiffed on the word PST, which is worth playing at F2.

#note PETS hook is so hard to block, so I might as well try again.

#note Lots of annoying little small errors this game. CAW is the one I want to work on not making in the future. I made the play based on generalizations rather than actual game context. Sure, it's a scary-looking lane, but I have most of the remaining DE- hooks, so why worry about it? WAFT is totally worth sacrificing equity for. Missing PST could have cost me, but I don't think PET was a huge risk.
