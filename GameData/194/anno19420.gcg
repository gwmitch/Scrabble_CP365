#note Maybe I was too obsessed with keeping my name as a leave (no, that wasn't the real reason).  I was way overestimating the value of the N I guess.  I tend to have a preference for an equal number of vowels and consonants, but apparently in this case having 3 consonants to 1 or 2 vowels is greatly preferred, although I'm not sure I understand why.  Either way, I can see why KA is better, which I didn't consider.  Major strategic error.
>Diana_Grosman: Q -Q +0 12
#note I don't know what she really had but I think it was close to a bingo rack based on the next few plays.
>Sean_Wrona: AAEELNS I7 A.E +15 30
#note Yeah, I guess scoring is better, but I still think this is acceptable albeit a bit dangerous.
>Diana_Grosman: GINZ 6F ZING +40 52
>Sean_Wrona: AEELNOS 10G OE +10 40
#note ENOLASE?  I missed ENOLASE?  In multiple places?  I instantly saw it when I saw what the rack was before simming it.  I do that a lot.  I have no explanation for that.  Given that, I almost deserved her scoring JAVELINS for 108 points soon after this to take control of the game.
>Diana_Grosman: EHR 11E HER +18 70
>Sean_Wrona: AEILNRS 12A NAILERS +80 120
#note Does it really matter which bingo I play here?  I don't think it does (well, it matters that I didn't play a bingo last time).  Having said that, slotting the I where I did turned out to be very costly.
>Diana_Grosman: ?AEJLSV C7 JAVEL.nS +108 178
#note Wow, I was freaking out after this play blissfully unaware that she coud have scored 95 points more than this.
>Sean_Wrona: DEFIIOO D4 FIDO +25 145
#note IODINE's better.  I didn't see it.  This is an error.  Not a huge one.
>Diana_Grosman: AAGLU A10 LA.GUA +21 199
#note Not a word.  Major error.  I could have taken control of the game had I thought to challenge this.  She obviously thought it was a word herself (no doubt confusing it with LANGUE/LAGUNE) or else she would have played LAGUNA which would have also been strategically safer.
>Sean_Wrona: EEEINOW E2 WEEN +23 168
#note Major board vision error.  ENOW is beautiful and it even leaves arguably a greater leave.
>Diana_Grosman: ANTUV 1A VAUNT +35 234
#note And here's ANOTHER reason why WEEN was bad (especially since I wasn't holding a T).
>Sean_Wrona: BDEEIOR F2 ODE +22 190
#note Do I really want to completely shut the board like this for a decent score and leave?  Well, it's not like anything else is much better but ZINGIER, which I didn't see, is probably best.  I also wasn't likely bingoing through the E I just blocked even if I did play ZINGIER.
>Diana_Grosman: II -II +0 234
>Sean_Wrona: BDEIIRU 5G BI +10 200
#note Well, I may not have known that BEDUIN was an acceptable spelling, but I certainly knew BURDEN.  This forces me to bingo on a board not good for it while BEDUIN or BURDEN I could still outscore.  Major strategic error (had I been looking for plays I should have at least seen BURDEN).

#note Major board vision error.

>Sean_Wrona: ADEPRTU 4H PURATED +84 308
>Sean_Wrona: ADEPRTU --  -84 224
#note I attempted an intentional phony bingo.  I really shouldn't have done it when all the P 5s score 30 points and I still might have a chance.  I did this under the assumption that she was going to block the last spot on the next turn no matter what I did and I figured I needed to bingo *now*.  I certainly knew it was just UPDATER/UPRATED, but I thought I needed to bingo here.  Looking at the score after PRUDE or whatever, the game was not at all riding on this, although her challenging it essentially ended the game.  She was way too experienced to not know this wasn't a word though.  I deeply regret it, and not just because I got caught.  It's rotten to do to begin with especially when it's not all that strategically sound.

#note So exchanging almost everything is the probabilistic thing to do here?  I guess I can see that with ?acehiorsstttu left.  Unless I draw multiple t's I  almost certainly draw an S and a bingo rack.  When I asked championship player, the top ten plays were *all* exchanges.  Apparently keeping a T was best even though there are three left?  I don't buy that, but I do buy that exchanging was the correct thing to do and I didn't even think of that.  Of course she bingoed right through this, but she wouldn't have done that had I not played it.
>Diana_Grosman: AEINOST 15D E.ATIONS +77 428
>Sean_Wrona: ?CIIMRT K9 MeTRIC. +20 348
#note Sigh.  At least this wasn't very winnable.  Maybe had I not missed ENOLASE...
>Diana_Grosman: HRTTU 12J T.UTH +16 444
>Sean_Wrona: I M12 .I +4 352
#note Major errors (7): KA (strategic), OE (rack vision), WEEN (board vision), BI (startegic), NIX (board vision), PURATED (bad phony gamble), HEXYL (strategic error)

Also, I went over by exactly one minute.  Groan.
