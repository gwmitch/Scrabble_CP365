#note My emotions definitely got in my way this turn. I spent about 4 minutes on that play but I would estimate that 3:45 of that was spent being really mad instead of thinking.

#note "and this is going to be a C".

I told mike that I couldn't remember the last time I had drawn a blank against him. Then I checked....
>Matt_Canik: ADEGIIL L3 .IG +29 351
#note Mike has drawn 11 of the past 12 blanks in our games, and my one came in the endgame. 

If I draw the Q I can pull Q(A)ID 10B and maybe win. I also hold the case A for ZA plays. *crosses fingers*

(mike does have a history of scoring like 12ppt in situations where he just has to keep running to win)
