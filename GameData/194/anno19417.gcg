#note Obviously after this, I know she has an S.
>Sean_Wrona: AHH N4 HAH +30 313
#note I did not have my entire rack here.
>Carol_McDonald: EST 8L E.TS +24 257
#note If she did this, she must have *another* S.  Now I need to block aggressively.
>Sean_Wrona: DGIIORR 5D GIR. +10 323
#note This is about the best I can do as far as blocking is concerned.  The choice is *where* I need to block.  It looks like TRIO is simming betetr than GIRO (probably because of the higher score), but I just ended up playing TRIO on the next turn anyway, so that's okay. It was the play *after* TRIO where I choked the game.
>Carol_McDonald: IP D3 PI. +12 269
>Sean_Wrona: ADIIORT N8 .RIO +15 338
#note Oh man, DIORITIC is cool, as it totally shuts down the SCENT line, but still leaves the A and the S open, so I'm going to guess TRIO is still right.
>Carol_McDonald: F L8 .F +11 280
>Sean_Wrona: AADIORT E9 OR.A +6 344
#note Thar she blows.  This was the first choke that I considered unforgivable.  I still knew she had the S and at this point probably the blank but I was still paranoid about bingos with the S.  However, for her to hit this, the S would need to be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position when it is MUCH more common at the start or end of the word, so this isn't what I needed to be worried about.  I needed to be worried about row 1 much more I think.  AORTA or RIATA up there or something is probably what I should have played if I wanted to block.

Since all these things score not much, probably just playing RADIO and DOR is fine since I should be able to outrun her AND draw some good stuff rather than keeping something that doesn't mesh well with the rest of the pool or the board and only scoring six points...

Huge strategic error and it cost me the game and my mental stability for the rest of the tournament.  It appears scoring is what I needed to do here more than anything else.
>Carol_McDonald: ?EEGNRS 1C GENER.lS +59 339
#note So she didn't know GESNERIA.  I didn't even think of it myself because at this point I was freaking out.  Even though I was still technically *leading*, the game was over because of my mental state and freaking out about how I could have played so well and then let her back into it with an easy bingo when I (erroneously thought) I should have blocked that line, but really I didn't have a good way to do that so the real error is that I wasn't scoring.
>Sean_Wrona: ADGIITT 3B GI. +12 356
#note With this ugly, ugly rack I can't score anything and I can't take the triple line.  I expect that she will inevitably take the triple line herself.  I figured my best bet was to try and Q stick her.  I was likely mistaken.  With two W's remaining, the odds of her *not* having something with DOW are remote and there's almost nothing I have worth doing there at all, so I figured the only way I could do it would be to Q stick her.  Unfortunately, there was still an I remaining but I could make sure I kept the I and kept AT so I could at least play QAT on the next turn if I drew it, and *maybe* I'd still be able to outrun her.  But as you can see, I was totally lost.

Championship player prefers O11 TI and I can see that (82% chance of winning after that, 64% chance of winning after my play).  The main threat is plays with DOW and I need to block those.  Without that the W has no value.  I'm certainly smart enough to be able to see these things but I totally threw this away, and perhaps *this* was actually the bigger error over ORCA.  If I still have an 82% chance of winning after TI (probably because I'd be way likelier to go out first with her likely having both Ws) this error was huge.  I was fixating on Qs when I should have been fixating on Ws and high scores.  Sure, she'd likely take the lead with a W play, but then I'd probably go out first and still win barely.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.
>Carol_McDonald: CEINW O11 WINCE +40 379
#note That's what this play made me do, but it was all my fault.  I had no. business. losing.
>Sean_Wrona: ABDIQTT 12D Q.T +26 382
#note I was so clever of giving myself an opportunity to play the Q and preventing her froim doing likewise.  That might have been a good idea IF SHE'D ACTUALLY HAD THE Q.  Yes, the W was the more probable threat and had I not screwed this up by my negative thinking I should have been able to see that.  So much for me having a chance to place...

Major errors (2): all my plays were reasonable until ORCA/GIP and that ugly sequence cost me the game.  And I was fuming afteward.
