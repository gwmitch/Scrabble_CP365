#note Major board vision error.  I guess OFT is the play.
>Roland_Filio: AEOSTTU 6G OUT.EAST +63 81
>Sean_Wrona: AAINOTT 5K AT +10 56
#note Yeah, TACO looks good.  That's incredibly hard to see.  This I think is better than it looks since most bingos will end in T or N, both of which I hold.
>Roland_Filio: ADGINOW 5D GNAW +21 102
#note He first put down DOWING, then switched to GNAW, presumably when he saw that DOWING created some additional bingo lines.
>Sean_Wrona: ABEINOT 11A TAI.BONE +70 126
>Roland_Filio: ADEEIOU A7 AUDI.EE +27 129
>Sean_Wrona: ?EEHIRU 4K HUE +24 150
#note Since the score is about even, I likely should play HIREE despite the less synergistic U? leave.  I don't believe I saw it anyway.
>Roland_Filio: IIIIO -IIIIO +0 129
>Sean_Wrona: ?EIIIRR -IIR +0 150
#note Um, I can't properly read the letters I exchanged but it looks to me like IIR (the first two letters are smudged, but I believe this is correct).  So obviously this makes me want to cringe since I certainly know RETIARII is a word.  Exchanging from a bingo rack is one horrific thing I don't think I ever did in a live game before, but I have missed that word several times before online so I wouldn't put it past me to do so in person.  Major error.
>Roland_Filio: ?CEHKRS O6 SHoCKER +110 239
#note However...as it turns out, if I *had* seen RETIARII he'd have had CHIRKEST/SHICKERS/WHICKERS for 239(!) points so this serious blow would have been much more severe had I *not* screwed up?  That's assuming he found any of those words (which I didn't really know, but I'd assume he did).
>Sean_Wrona: ?AEEILR B1 REALIzE +64 214
#note I knew I probably needed two bingos to win so I wanted to make sure the SHOCKERS line was still open.  I think that was a mistake.  If I bingoed somewhere else (EARLIER), I would score more points, be close enough I wouldn't *necessarily* need to bingo to win, not give him a really high-scoring outplay, etc...  I reacted to the 100 point bingo by wanting to create as many lines as possible, but then I didn't bingo again and he ended up using one of those spots to bingo himself.  If I'm going to play where I chose to play, I guess it would be best to play any of the lea_ier bingos, but playing here was a bad idea in the first place.  Major error.  The row 12 plays are all simming better than the column B plays probably largely due to the points difference...
>Roland_Filio: AMY 1A A.MY +39 278
>Sean_Wrona: AIIJPSX C3 XI +38 252
#note I didn't see PAX but I don't know if I like it since it seems he will instantly hit the triple, but it's probably better since it leaves those potential bingo lines open.  Not that I had anything close to a bingo rack after this...
>Roland_Filio: EERRSTV 13I REVERTS +88 366
>Sean_Wrona: ADIJPRS L10 JAP.R +28 280
#note Wow, I don't even think I knew JAPED was good, but I think I have to take this chance anyway, even though looking at the rest of the pool, there's almost nothing good left.  However leaving DIS with so many Ns and Os remaining means I have *some* chance of bingoing if I hit the E.  Unfortunately, JAPERY didn't come to my mind.
>Roland_Filio: GNOOY 15H GOONY +61 427
#note It came to his.
>Sean_Wrona: DFGIMSZ 3M FIZ +40 320
#note Ooh, I missed A1 ADZ.  That's a lot cooler.  I'd call that a major error in fact, since that has a 1% chance of winning, while all these other plays have much lower percentages (0.0_%).
>Roland_Filio: OO 7M OO. +12 439
>Sean_Wrona: DEGMNSW 12H MEW +25 345
#note Okay, keeping the E was certainly extremely important and I should have looked harder.  Major error.  In fact, I see DAMN/DAMNS right now instantly (without looking at sim results) and those look way better.  Just pile up the points I guses since I'm surely not going to bingo.
>Roland_Filio: ILNOOPR N1 NO.R +15 454
>Roland_Filio: ILNOOPR --  -15 439
#note Wow, not only did he accidentally phony with a Collins word here, he missed ORZO, which would have scored much more and still blocked my only high-scoring Q spot.
>Sean_Wrona: DGNQS N2 Q.S +31 376

>Sean_Wrona: DGN B10 D.N +17 393
>Roland_Filio: ILNOOR M9 NOR +15 466
>Sean_Wrona: G 11K G.. +8 401
#note Major errors (4): FLINT (board vision error), exchange (rack vision error but got extremely lucky that I missed my bingo), REALIZE (strategy error), MEW (strategy error)
