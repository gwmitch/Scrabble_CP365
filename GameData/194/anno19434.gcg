>dacrON: ANORTUZ 8F AZO +24 24
#note Perhaps too timid - setting up the N with AZO in the other spot seems stronger.
>Jim_Kramer: EEOXY 9B OXEYE +25 25
>dacrON: NORRRTU 10B RUT +20 44
#note Now saving the N for the hook, but I'm not sure it's quite worth it here. NORR seems noticably uglier than ORRT.

>Jim_Kramer: DEIV H11 VI.ED +30 77
>dacrON: AEEFLLL E11 FA.LE +28 94
#note Not a huge fan, but (FAR)L saving the E keeps a worse leave, and he will often have a 5 tile play ending in an E anyway. But I'm not sold on that - this play can also bail him out of a lot of racks. Maybe it's worth making the sacrifice now.
>Jim_Kramer: DOTTT 15A TOTT.D +24 101
#note hmm...maybe
>dacrON: DEJLLPW 7H JEW +23 117
#note Was between this play or H7 J(O)W. However, I missed D(O)J(O), which seems clearly best, and also failed to consider JELL(O). Yikes, this wasn't a great play.
>Jim_Kramer: EEGKLS K2 GLEEKS +36 137
#note I held this for a bit, thinking it might be Collins, but correctly accepted.
>dacrON: DLLNPSU 4G PULL.D +20 137
#note PUL(E)D is also an option here. Both plays seem just fine, but the LN combo doesnt seem worth the exta two points here.
>Jim_Kramer: BGO 9H GOB +18 155
>dacrON: IIMNSSU 2D MISUSIN. +65 202
#note A big break to get this play down.
>Jim_Kramer: ??AFIOR K9 OARFIsh +73 228
#note Jim has one bingo from the D here - can you find it?
>dacrON: AABCHIN 1A BACH +56 258
>Jim_Kramer: CEEGO 15J C.EGOE +27 255
>dacrON: AAINNRW M9 WARNIN. +30 288
#note So obviously, you can either play long, as I did, or play short, with sNAW or AWN in row 14. It seems safer to play short with the Q unseen and no remaining Us. However, the leave of AINR here is pretty week, with AAAIIINNR making up nearly half of the remaining pool. This play will sometimes backfire, as it does open a new bingo lane for Jim. However, he has a fairly random rack, so it's basically a battle of the random racks, but I have a 33 point advantage. So I think WARNIN(G) is the right option here. Sometimes you have to look past the obvious drawbacks. Thoughts?
>Jim_Kramer: IQ 1I QI +24 279
>dacrON: AAAEIMY 2A AY +24 312
#note This is a rough position - Jim seems to have a much stronger rack than me, and he's definitely in a better position to bingo. Looking at the pool, it seems like I should definitely not empty the bag here. So the next question is, do I play two tiles, or three tiles? The two main plays to consider here, as a result, seem to be N10 YEA or 2A AY. The former scores 7 more and leaves 1 in the bag, while the latter scores 7 less, but gives Jim slightly fewer options, and forces him to make more decisions with 2 tiles remaining in the bag - in other words, even if he has a higher winning percentage after YEA, which is very possible, it could be harder to permute through all of the possible options with two in the bag, and more room to make mistakes. I didn't think there was a big difference in win percentage here between the two plays, but in the end, I'm not entirely sure - which play would you make?
>Jim_Kramer: ADENNST 14B NA +16 295
#note Jim told me after the game that this was his rack. It seems to me that playing off just an N here should put Jim in the best shape to win the game. It's risky to play off both tiles, for sure, and this potentially wasn't a decision Jim would have had to make had I left just one in the bag. So did it work this time? I suppose so, but I'll consider myself very fortunate the way this endgame turned out.
>dacrON: AAEHIMR 5C MARIA +18 330
#note 3A HEM is best. I noted that (BA)STIONED didn't fit, but I forgot to block the 8 tiles plays from (BA)...
>Jim_Kramer: DEINOST A1 ..NDITOS +39 334
>dacrON: EH N9 EH +31 361
>dacrON:  (E) +2 363
#note And so now I am in first place with 5 to go!
