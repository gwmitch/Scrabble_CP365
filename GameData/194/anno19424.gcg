#note AS is probably the best leave to keep since there are almost no As remaining and there are still a bunch of Es.  This still probably isn't really wrong though.

#note Major strategic error.  I guess I have to exchange here...
>Michael_Ecsedy: ?EERSVW 15D SWERVEd +96 201
>Sean_Wrona: AEGNNOS B1 NONAGES +72 132
#note This is very similar to what I did against Roland where I wanted to leave as many bingo lines open as possible (even though that didn't come close to working).  However, sticking an N here is better than sticking an R there when I played REALIZE in that exact spot and playing NONAGES there is much better than playing it in row 14 as well since that could likely lead to easy massive points, while the N isn't very flexible in that position.  Having said, the highest-scoring NONAGES is also the best-simming.
>Michael_Ecsedy: ELZ A2 LEZ +47 248
#note Of course, I was certainly overlooking this sort of worst-case scenario play when I played NONAGES there.
>Sean_Wrona: ABFIIJP 14F FA +28 160
#note I like subtle setups.  I need to do them more often.

>Michael_Ecsedy: DER 5B ..RED +14 318
#note After the FA-->JIBE thing, he must have thought I was setting something up with the S.  Nope.  I definitely didn't have it although I don't know what I did have since I was missing the rest of that rack.
>Sean_Wrona: ?DIMOPU 4M UMP +15 245
#note I thought creating a hook here that he couldn't block except for playing through the M was really clever, especially holding the last D and blank, meaning I could easily draw a bingo, but there are lots of other plays worth doing that I didn't consider.  Luckily, this one worked out.
>Michael_Ecsedy: IORR O4 .RIOR +21 339
>Sean_Wrona: ?DEINOV 3G NaEVOID +88 333
#note Ouch, I was so proud at myself about this setup and after looking for almost 5 minutes I missed a play that scored 6 points more, and considering by how little I ended up losing this game, that easily could have mattered.  Not a major error objectively (indeed, this sometimes sims better, but I would *never* play it seeing INVOKED), but it might have decided the game, so in that sense it is.
>Michael_Ecsedy: EIL L9 LEI +14 353
>Sean_Wrona: AKUW N7 WAUK +28 361
>Michael_Ecsedy: BEELNOO 4E BOON +18 371
>Sean_Wrona: ISTT M11 SIT +18 379
#note Obviously, it would be really helpful to know what my precise last three tiles were besides WAUK to see if I had a prayer of winning on the previous turn, but I unfortunately did not record that, so I'll never know.  It might not have been a choke though.  But if I had found INVOKED instead of NAEVOID, would that have made the difference?  Well, we'll never know.  This would have been my most satisfying win of the tournament had I won, but how many of those situations do I eventually actually win?  That UMP setup was great.  I just wish I could play like that every turn.

Major errors (2): CUT (word knowledge), COO (strategy)
