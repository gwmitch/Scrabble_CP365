#note MT: Thought this bingo line would be helpful in the long-term. Quackle says 12A VENT is slightly better, but nah

#note MT: I thought this would win with Q in the bag since I have two big QUID spots, and I thought this would win with Q on his rack, since it forces him to play QAT while I get a big play. Wrong. If Q is in the bag, I just let him have CARNAGES. Stupid miss. If G is in the bag, I also lose, since even with QAT forced, he can outrun. This wins 6/8. I'm sure there's a play that's 7/8 or maybe even 8/8.  Likely a bungled pre-endgame.
