#note MT: H13 PAM was my other consideration. The leave seems weaker, but I'm essentially "keeping" the M by slotting it for bingos. But I wanted to set up my S. I6 AIM does that as well, but a little less reliably. Quackle likes PAM in the sim and it's apparently a big error at 5-6 pts. PAM has a significantly higher bingo%.

#note MT: I may not need to bingo if Geoff doesn't have anything to stop my AFAR setup. But if he does have the E to underlap, I will need to bingo. And in that case, I've at least succeeded in distracting him fro the row 5 lane which I desperately need to stay open.

#note MT: Nice play. Blocking my killer GUTLIKE and making a really tough-to-block setup

#note MT: Pre-endgames are not my strong suit. I was turned off by KERB because I figured he could easily outrun me with a TWS to the K. But really, he won't have the greatest tiles for plays like that. And I could draw an out. Also I overvalued the strength of keeping the K, when I thought setting up KEG was a solid move. KERB leads to a tricky endgame sequence that eventually ties at 422 (in theory; we were both low on time). I guess I should learn to quickly play 7 possible endgames in my head for these 1-in-the-bag situations. But man, that's tough. I just don't have the brainpower for that kind of stuff. And this one was especially tricky. Can't be too upset, I guess. BI was a great play.

#note MT: No wins. I was kind of hoping he'd play LEGGIN and it would end up being a sticky S on LEGGINS. Nope. Tsk
