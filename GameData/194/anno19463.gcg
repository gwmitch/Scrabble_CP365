>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIORSTU 8F SAUTOIR +66 66
#note MT: I dunno I guess 8C is good
>Geoff_Thevenot: ENNPRST G7 P.N +9 9
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?BCEGOO 10G GOBO +16 82
#note MT: Not much I can do to block, but taking out some eights can't hurt.

>Geoff_Thevenot: AFHILQS 5K QA. +24 109
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEGIOP L1 PODI. +29 197
#note MT: Ooh, I missed L3 DIAPER which looks a little better for sure
>Geoff_Thevenot: FHILSUV 1L .FUI +27 136
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEEEGM L8 .AGEE +14 211
#note MT: Another miss, whiffing on GEMMAE here.
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEHKLSV C10 H.VE +20 156
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AADEMTW H10 ..DEMA +33 244
#note MT: I saw an opportunity to grossify the board here and I decided to take it. Killing all sevens hooking HOVE and RAGEE looked great. And I'm saving a W which will be pretty good on this board.
>Geoff_Thevenot: AKLSUWY K11 WAUK +34 190
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABOSTWX I12 OX +37 281
#note MT: Considered taking SABOT here, but figured I would often draw an even better play like SWEAT.
>Geoff_Thevenot: EELLSTY G13 LEY +27 217
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABSTTWZ J7 B.Z. +15 296
#note MT: Pretty brutal play. The same tiles play for 11 more just one space over. Ooooowwww......
>Geoff_Thevenot: EHILSTT 15K SHITE +48 265
#note MT: I was 99% sure this was phony. But I have a bingo to go up 95 using the last S and blank. So I really didn't want to risk a turn here. But I was so positive this was CSW only. Pretty embarrassing.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AISTTW 3E STATeWI.. +63 359

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACFGLLN 14B FLAG +27 386
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEEIILU 6K IL.A +26 339
#note MT: Again, this word is CSW only and I absolutely hated it. But I somehow thought I was holding the case hook letters for ILIA in C and L. But ILIAD is a word too. This is a crucial error that could have easily cost me the game
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CDLNNRR 11K ..ND +8 394
#note MT: Again, I'm not blocking ILIAD. I can't block all his possible bingos, but O1 INN does a better job that this.

#note MT: Bad game for me! Tiles bailed me out
