>Harriet: ADEMTTV 8D VATTED +28 28
#note Strong opening start! I got the best play for once!
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEOO 7I OBOE +11 11
>Harriet: ?AEGILM M1 MILAGEs +74 102
#note This simmed as second best choice. A bunch of bingos through the L7 E were worth 2 points more. LIEGEMAN, MILEAGES, and GELSEMIA. GELSEMIA maybe the best play simply because it's most likely to draw a challenge, but my plugs up the 7 lane completely.
>Jonathan_Lindh: GINZ 6F ZING +39 50
>Harriet: ?HJKLNU 2J JUK.Ng +64 166
#note Quackle likes JAUK in Column 4 better. I disagree. My play shuts down two triple word scores largely and gets 20 more points.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BES 5K BE.S +14 64
#note I sense Al has multiple S's.
>Harriet: AEHLOPR N4 A.H +29 195
#note I had trouble here. I thought there was a bingo even though there wasn't one. ORPHAN in the H column for 45 points was best; ASH was 4th best. HOLPEN for 42 in H column was 2nd, SH keeping the A was 26 points.
>Jonathan_Lindh: E H5 E. +2 66
#note Al is fishing...
>Harriet: DELOPRR E7 P.RLORED +72 267
>Harriet: DELOPRR --  -72 195
#note Horrible on my part. I originally intended to do DROP and PEN for 21 points blocking the 4th row but went for this plausible phony. Al challenged it off. REOPEN for 33 points hitting the triple in the H column was the best.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AELOSST 4D SOLATES +70 136
#note My greediness gets me zapped again. Had I done DROP, Al also had SOLVATES in the D column for 72 points. SOLVATES sims better though Al had second best choice. Quackle likes D4 SOLATES better than B4 SOLATES due to lack of exposed S. Or something like that.
>Harriet: DELOPRR 5B DROP +24 219
#note Incorrectly scored as 22 points. ROPE or DOPE in similar spot connecting to make LEZ in 5th row are better anyway.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIV B2 VIE. +16 152
#note Al is trying to switch it on me and do the VIED IVIED combo for many points. However, I know that hook from a YOUTUBE School Scrabble video.
>Harriet: DEFILRT 1A FILED +39 258
#note My play was 3rd best, as LIFTED and LIEF for 42 were both better. My rack was FLIRTED and TRIFLED rack. None were playable.
>Jonathan_Lindh: HR 4L H..R +26 178
#note Somebody had to do HAAR.
>Harriet: AENRTUU 3I RUT +19 277
#note Quackle likes JUS better. Why not grab a few extra points Quackle?
>Jonathan_Lindh: FI 8K IF +20 198
>Harriet: AENNOUY A3 OY +20 297
#note Second best play. Quackle likes M1 MOA better.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ORUW D8 .ROUW +22 220
#note Scoring error #2. This was scored as 24 points, not 22 points.
>Harriet: ACEENNU C11 NAE +13 310
#note Considered C11 NUANCE but wisely decided on this. This keeps board shut down.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AINO E11 NAOI +20 240
>Harriet: CELMNRU 2D REC +16 326
#note Quackle hates this play! Bingoing is unlikely here Quackle!
>Jonathan_Lindh: IP 7E PI +20 260
>Harriet: LMNQTUX 14D M.X +28 354
#note Second best play again. MIXT gets the nod by a small margin. I like keeping the T. Fewer vowels that hook onto X.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEW 15A AWEE +29 289
>Harriet: DILNQTU G10 QUILT +28 382
#note QADI G3 would have been saver and kept the T for MIXT for another play. QUILT was 4th best play despite being highest scoring and Quackle does not like board volatility with one S out. This could have been fatal but Al did not have the letters to take adavantage.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AACGINS 15G SCAN +33 322
#note AACGINS was his rack. SCAG was better than SCAN.
>Harriet: DNORTY 14A YO +25 407
#note Second best play again according to Quackle! I like YO better because Al is going out either way.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGI J12 GAI. +7 329
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (DNRT) +10 339
#note Incorrectly scored as 405-341.
