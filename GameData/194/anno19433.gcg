#note Q prefers playing FAME holding AAW... both plays hold ?AX for me next turn but FAME makes t harder for him, plus FAME holds MEW.

#note I can't make an B play at B10 except maybe HA, but I like this more. Note: ORALS is good, and I am 100% sure of that for the rest of the game.

#note Ben said this was his rack. If that's the case he has JO(I)N or JO(I)NT for 38 or 40. I pointed out after the game that (UPO)N is also a really strong play here... I said I would set down (A)N for 2 as an angry fish, then I would pick it up and plunk the N for 8 instead, holding JUPON/JO/ODOR for 60. Too cute? Maybe. But on a closed board there are very few scoring options.

#note Wait why did I think FEZES was no good? FIZES* I guess
>Ben_Withers: EINOT F10 NE +17 237
>Matt_Canik: AAISSWZ B1 ZA +26 271
#note I really wanted to play 14A ZAS. only one E left, no As... he's really unlikely to have a play with the Z on the TWS. That being said I think Ben will open the board pretty often here so I won't be able to take advantage of my own setup.

>Matt_Canik: ADISSTW 2F ID +15 286
#note I can't remember which of WIST/WAST/WOST take an S (cmon let's be honest, you can't either... answer after this play) but any of those along 14A are sick blocking plays. I'm just sort of screwed if he bingos from the L after that.

#note WASTS and WISTS are good, WOSTS* is not.
