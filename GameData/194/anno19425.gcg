#note I guess I still like this.  Sets up AXE/FEE among other stuff, blocks his most obvious bingo line, and if he still bingos, I can likely score something good with the X, although I honestly wasn't thinking of the SWOT hook.

>Sean_Wrona: ?AEIOTX D7 XI +22 71
#note I clearly needed to hit the triple with the X and I didn't even *think* of doing that.  Well, at least I didn't try to play TOXEMIA and TE*.  Major error.

#note Major board vision error.  Should have been able to find LABOR.  Sheesh.

>Sean_Wrona: DKLRRTV -KLRTV +0 155
#note This is an example of making your own luck, not that my rack would be much better after LABOR.  And I probably should have played TROD as ugly as that rack is.  This still could conceivably be right though.

#note Can you say, "Far too desperate?"  Just VUG looks find if I'm not going to see GOLFED, which probably many experts would miss.  And VUG at least doesn't block a bunch of bingo lines I could potentially use afterward.  Major error.
>Sam_Hollington: EIOV M3 VO.IE +20 312
>Sean_Wrona: DEIILRU O1 .UI +3 209
#note Normally not something you'd want to fish with, but in this sort of position, it's not a horrible idea.

>Sean_Wrona: CDEGILR O5 DIRGE +32 241
#note I can't read whether my leave is CL or LL, but it looks more like a C, and I had a C and two Ls on my next rack.  This totally gives up the game though based on what's left.  I'll call it a board vision error since GOLFED/GOLFER both look like better ideas to leave the VERGE spot open.
>Sam_Hollington: AEIMNST 14H TAMEINS +82 420
#note Well, at least it wouldn't have mattered.

>Sean_Wrona: CILLNST D12 SN.T +38 310
#note Apparently I was supposed to play ZINC on this play and then play SNIT later?  I suppose I can see that since it might be hard to play the C off later but I'd rather take the points now in case he tries to block it (although he'd have no reason to do that, so maybe the idea is that I'm suppose to block plays like EON/ZINE/SO if he draws it...)
>Sam_Hollington: DELOU K11 DO..L +18 462
#note Wow, OUZEL is nice...
>Sean_Wrona: CILL M12 ...C +15 325
#note Major errors (3): XI (board vision), BLOG (board vision), VERGE (strategy)
>Sam_Hollington: EU 10E .UE +12 474
#note We were using the complimentary tiles I received at the start of the tournament because we didn't have a board or tiles at the start of the game.  The set was missing two N's and I didn't realize this (we didn't count at the start of the game) so he ended up scoring 4 points less than what is listed here.
