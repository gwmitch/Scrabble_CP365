#note Seems safest to take out the triple lane now, and although Ian may bingo, I should be able to outscore him to win the game.

>Conrad: ABCJRST K4 CRAB.. +30 434
#note I missed F4 J(U)S, which is a cool play, but this play is up there with the best of them. Ultimately, I can't stop all of his bingos, but I can outrun them.

>Ian:  (AAJST) +24 415
#note Felt like I drew much better, and won by so little - speaks to Ian's ability to get the board he wants. Nice game.
