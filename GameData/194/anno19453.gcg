#note MT: No real explanation for this. I was so tunnelled on this play that I didn't realize he just opened up a higher-scoring spot. Felt dumb when I hit my clock. But hey, it doesn't hurt killing all the 8s after a 2-tile play, so this isn't so bad. Especially with an early lead. Some people might actually prefer this placement. Doesn't excuse me for being a moron and missing AVOW.

#note MT: JIVEY sims ahead by a couple points. No argument from me. I once again had inexplicable blindness.

#note MT: A1 CUTER crossed my mind, but I figured the X wasn't going to get much better on this board.

#note MT: John's going to bingo or hit a big Z play eventually, so I need to dig deep for some of those power tiles. Walling him in on this board won't work.

#note MT: The M's are a boon here. But I need to pull a vowel.

#note MT: For some reason I thought SCHNOZ was in the pool, even though my tracking was correct. I think REFILM still wins though
