>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADLORT H6 LeOTARD +68 68
#note TROLAnD is probably better
>Jon_Shreve: ACEGIIN 11H .EAGINIC +72 72
#note Paying for the mistake!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEEELM 12A rEMELDE. +72 140
#note No good! I don't know what to do with good tiles it seems...
>Jon_Shreve: FHRW 10F WH.RF +45 117
>Joshua_Sokol: DKOPPTW N10 K.PPOT +48 188
#note No good! I thought it had to be good and that I might win a turn. KIPPA should pluralize to KIPPOT. He held for 2 minutes. 
>Jon_Shreve: AUV 15L VA.U +33 150
>Joshua_Sokol: DHIIQUW 6H .IQUID +36 224
#note problematic because of the Y hook, but I think it's OK to make the board very scoring-heavy here, for lack of a better option. 13K WHI(P) is an interesting alternative, as I average a lot of points next turn with my QU
>Jon_Shreve: ANNOOZ 6E NON...... +21 171
#note Cool play. Setting up a bingo lane for himself (sorta), taking out the Y hook, and scoring. Stylish! I knew this took an S, so I was fine with this. He said he kept ZOA, going for ZOEAE, ZOEAL and ZOEAS. Nice!
>Joshua_Sokol: AHILNUW 13B HULA +31 255
#note There were a bunch of great options here. I missed O8 UNI(C)A, which is nice and dynamic. I saw B10 WH(E)AL, and didn't really like what it did to the board much. He seemed like he was going for a bingo too, so I was good with trying to seal some of the board off. Lucky I blocked ZOEA stuff!

>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIMNW O8 AMI.E +41 296
>Jon_Shreve: CFOST N2 COFTS +46 256
#note I did not know COFT/! It is a past tense... There are many phoneys on this board.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGNSWYY L4 SW.NGY +30 326
#note I didn't like making this play. Therefore I should not have made it. I should just go with 5D YEW. Got paranoid about not drawing a vowel. Not good. Fancy play syndrome...
>Jon_Shreve: AEEEIIR E5 I.IA +8 264
>Joshua_Sokol: BBEEEOY D7 BYE +25 351
#note That is what I deserve for playing SWINGY. Forgot about BEBO(P) here, which nicely set up my Y. I should probably play OBEY D7 instead of this. Did I miss it? I saw the word!
>Jon_Shreve: DOT 12J TOD +23 287
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEEJOS B6 JEE +28 379
#note A good draw puts me in the driver's seat again. I underscored this by 2...
>Jon_Shreve: EEE -EEE +0 287
#note Lucky
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEEEOS K3 BEA. +24 403
>Jon_Shreve: AEINRST 14D STAINER +67 354
#note Heh.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEOORSX 15H OX +42 445
#note 9F OO(T) makes sense. Gives me REXES 15A as a guarantee, and some nice outs in two if I happen to draw a vowel. 
>Jon_Shreve: GINRTUV D3 VIG +17 371
#note -3 to D2 RUNT.
>Joshua_Sokol: EELORS 15A LORES +27 472
#note missing his out. -2
