>New_Player_1: AINRV 1F INVAR +26 129
#note The B's are out, unfortunately, so an extension to INVARIAbLE is unlikely. However, INVARIANTS is still possible....

#note OFT 13C is best. SE* is my latest phony two, and after it was challenged off, I saw TOED 15A, which is 2nd. (-20%)
>New_Player_1: EJO 15A JOE +34 270
#note I suppose I cannot play TOED anymore.

#note TORCH E7, ROTCH E7, and TRAD O6 win 100%. TORCH is best. (-11%?)

>Alec: CDEMRRT E10 METR.C +32 400
#note Best. I am now winning 100%. I had tracked incorrectly, so I thought I was leaving tiles in the bag--and might have been setting up COXsWAIN 15E for Rafi. I did not see DERMIC E10, which is surprisingly 2nd.
>New_Player_1: ?AGINOT O1 cONTAGI. +77 369
>New_Player_1:  (ADER) +10 379
#note This was my first-ever victory against Rafi, after 3 losses.
