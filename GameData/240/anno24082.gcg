>David_Gibson: AAELUVX 8G ULVA +14 14
#note I think this was his rack. This play was classic Gibson with a hint of Nigel setup. Every other player would play VALUE, and would be right to do so. But David was most definitely correct in doing this. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEILOOW J6 WO.LD +21 21
#note Couldn't really block, and it might not even have been a setup. Might have just been to prevent as many 7s from playing as possible/to shape the board. Maybe H4 WOOL(L)ED? Hm, I think I should have
>David_Gibson: AEX 7F AXE +37 51
>Joshua_Sokol: EIOORST K8 SOOTIER +77 98
>David_Gibson: EFIL 6C LIEF +28 79
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFIITW L10 WEFT +41 139
#note loved playing this over WAFT. Clearly the superior play, as AII is more flexible then EII.
>David_Gibson: AQT 5B QAT +16 95
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIIIJ M13 AJI +26 165
#note Do I do this, or do I exchange? Thought it was likely he was unbalanced here and incapable of taking advantage of my opening. 
>David_Gibson: DIM 15L M.DI +30 125
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEGII 14M .IG +31 196
#note how much longer can I hold on to this lead?
>David_Gibson: ACOR K3 ACRO +17 142
#note ...Before David Gibson gives up on outplaying me on a closed board...
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEIRS 10J ...IE +11 207
#note did you see what I just drew? Completely forgot about hooking QAT here and scoring 30. Wow. Really missed out on a good play this turn. EAS(E) or ERA(S)E are great.

Otherwise, I figured that if I closed down the 7 lane, I could respond to a bingo better, since it would likely open up another lane or a nice scoring spot. That's why I chose this over other more aggressive/risky plays such as 4K (C)EE or I(C)E 
>David_Gibson: AHTY 4I YA.HT +26 168
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEORS N2 RESEDA +36 243
#note I have David in a stranglehold at this point. Just need to keep it up
>David_Gibson: EEORZ D2 ERO..ZE +34 202
#note wow, this was not a good thing! When Gibson sacrifices points to blow the board open, your eyes should light up!
>Joshua_Sokol: HNNOPUY 3C P.UNY +28 271
>Joshua_Sokol: HNNOPUY --  -28 243
#note Oh, honey. Why did this have to happen? PRUNEY is the new word, and it compares as PRUNY* would. Unbelievable challenge by the champion, and an incredible swing. 
>David_Gibson: ALTV 8A VAL.T +24 226
>Joshua_Sokol: HNNOPUY O7 HUP +29 272
#note I have lost all control here. I could not see any plays here. 2D (E)UPHONY was a miss, but seems risky this turn. C1 PHON(AL) is the correct play here. This isn't the worst thing, as it sets me up for YON(I) next turn if need be
>David_Gibson: EIMNOST B7 M.SONITE +74 300
#note oh no...
>Joshua_Sokol: ANNNOPY 12A P.NNY +26 298
#note PINYON looks good here, in the same spot. I did not know the word. Another mistake puts me in bigger trouble than I already was.
>David_Gibson: ?GIIKNO 11E OIK +24 324
#note Gibson definitely regretted not playing A12 (P)INK here, for its outrunning potential and superior defense. OIK was the play anyone else would have made.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADENORS 14A R.ASONED +61 359
#note The story gets worse. Not only did I miss the easy and clear play of 3A ADO(R)NERS, but I also considered confirming the score with my opponent, and decided against it. I had David's score at 334, 10 points higher than reality. I waffled for minutes between both placements of REASONED, and ultimately decided that I was more likely to get outrun with the 2C placement, and that my opponents chances of an out-bingo were around equal with the two placements. I thought he probably had just one blank after OIK. My assessment was spot-on, if the score was correct. But the score was 10 points closer, so getting outrun was far less of a concern. But my real mistake was obvious. I missed a bingo I should never miss. For the nth time. 
>David_Gibson: ?BGINNU 2A UNB.NIGn +74 398
#note As I saw UNBEING+?, I figured I was all set. I knew UNBEINGS* was phony, and couldn't imagine that I could get outrun. And when David started to put down U, then N, then B, I imagined I was going to get a free turn, or that he had given up and was just going to keep the blank. Wow. What a find. What a word. What a game. What a champion.
