#note I had just studied MAIASAUR. Studying pays off! Not... How could I miss that? 
>Alec_Sjoholm: EEINRRV G1 REVERIN. +67 77
#note RIVERMEN was his best bingo. I actually held this for like 2 minutes, because I didn't realize that it was the word REVERE, rather than the word REVER...

#note 5E PO(R)T(A)bLES is 100!!! Wow, Alec could have won this game!
>Joshua_Sokol: BCEIKRT K9 REB +26 254
#note especially if I make a play like this. Blocking one of the 3 X spots on the board. Nice defense, Josh. F6 KI is winning the sim by a lot, because of the Q spot as well that it blocks.
>Alec_Sjoholm: Q 6F Q. +31 235
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIIKTX 3L XI +32 286
#note lol, drew the X. I can't do anything wrong.

#note I should just play 13I T(H)ICK for more. 
>Alec_Sjoholm: EEEEE -EEEEE +0 256
#note Actually, no, I should close the board down.

#note missed REBAR! This was weird, and definitely wrong. 12J (C)AD. Ugh. Was trying to prevent the bottom right from being scored on/opened.

#note N4 (T)IZ makes more sense. I think I should have gone with that and forgotten about the case A beginning a bingo.
>Alec_Sjoholm: AGLU C10 AGLU +16 323
>Joshua_Sokol: EIIOOTZ N8 TIZ +34 421
#note Sim likes just N4 (T)OO or 7E TI(N) to go for a bingo with UNITIZE or OZONIDE. Quackle is funny. This was wrong, but whatever
>Alec_Sjoholm: DDEENNU 12A DE.UDE +20 343
#note -4 to UN(L)ED. Alec was unsure of the word.
