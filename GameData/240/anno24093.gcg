#note I considered GI, DOLCI, and 1D WIT. I decided that Jason probably did not keep the Z with NOT and hence opten to block his bingo line rather than the Z bomb at 1A. Also, he could have easily kept a bunch of one-point tiles and drawn the Z for TRIAZINE down column O, but a 1A play requires the Z in the fourth spot to score enough points for Jason to outrun me. Another good option I missed is 4L GNAW, which blocks neither the bingo or Z play but scores more and keeps a more flexible rack to try to outrun Jason in the endgame. I think I'd do GNAW if I had to do it over, but definitely not an easy position here.

#note No wins. I did this to save spread, blocking 13B FES and hoping he'd miss my out of ELICIT
