>Joshua_Sokol: EIIORVZ H4 VIZIER +44 44
>Orry_Swift: GILNORY 6H .ING +16 16
#note This is Orry's rack. RO(V)INGLY is his play here. I didn't know the word, dunno if he did. I suggested (V)YING when we talked after the game. 9F LO(R)Y also seems strong, to set up an ING bingo. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEEFOT 6F FA.... +27 71
#note I sensed something was up here, so I opted to block the ZINGY hook. Otherwise I can play K2 BEFO(G) or FO(V)EATE to blow the board open. FEA(ZING) also looks better for balance, though. I wanted to keep things relatively closed.
>Orry_Swift: CELORSY 10F COSEY +43 59
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEMOQT G5 Q.T +27 98
#note I should just play B(R)OME this turn. I failed to consider not playing the Q. That leaves Q(A)T for next turn, which will likely not get blocked.
>Orry_Swift: AALMR 11I MALAR +23 82
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEIMOO 12J MOB +32 130
#note liking destroying his options that don't contain an S. But I might just want to play K3 BOO(G)IE to expand my own horizons. I'm not ahead a lot, but MOB puts me up a handful with little way for Orry to score.
>Orry_Swift: ALP 13K PAL +20 102
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINORT M4 ORIENTE. +60 190
#note I just drew into a bingo on a dead board after having left EEIO. It's nice to be Matt Canik.
>Orry_Swift: DFIU 8K FU.DI +30 132
>Joshua_Sokol: BEJNRST 4L J.B +24 214
#note I knew that playing this fast would set Orry off a bit, since his strategic mind is so acute, so I played it almost immediately. He was also in some time trouble.
>Orry_Swift: AD N8 .AD +18 150
>Joshua_Sokol: EGINRST 14E STRINGE +70 284
>Joshua_Sokol: EGINRST --  -70 214
#note He's so good. Just blocked all of my bingos.

This was probably the best worst play of all time, though. If he challenges it off, he can do almost nothing with most racks to make a comeback, since it will give me a spot to bingo, and if he doesn't challenge it off, well, I probably win.

Just kidding. I thought it was valid at the time I played it. How? I just learned the hard way that RESTINGS* was invalid. I know STRINGES* is invalid. 

And so the choking begins. But wait, it gets better.
>Orry_Swift: EE 4H .EE +6 156
>Joshua_Sokol: EGINRST 9G G.R +18 232
#note Orry took 2 minutes to challenge the worst phony of all time, and then told me at the challenge computer that this might be the worst challenge of all time. I started laughing uncontrollably. No, Orry, this is my time to shine!

Also, Orry challenged apparently because he thought STRINGED was not a word.

I love Scrabble.
>Orry_Swift: AAEEINT 14E TAENIAE +67 223
#note Uh oh...
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIINST 15J ISATIN +30 262
#note Uh oh!

I missed 15H ANI, but this is better. Not in amazing shape anymore, but with my luck...
>Orry_Swift: LUY H12 LU.Y +24 247
#note could have been so much worse
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIOOPX 15A POXIED +56 318
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIOOPX --  -56 262
#note So, remember when I played PROXIED*? I thought it wasn't a word, since POXIED* was. Welp... Orry took another 2 minutes to challenge here. My gosh, how can this game go any worse? Saw EXODOI after I played, but POXIED* was better and I thought it was good. 
>Orry_Swift: EKNOR 15A KRONE +32 279
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIOOPX 14M OXO +43 305
>Orry_Swift: ADHO 13C ODAH +24 303
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEINPW 12A WIPED +45 350
#note My luck. It's showing.
>Orry_Swift: OSVW O1 VOWS +47 350
>Joshua_Sokol: ??LNTUU J3 T. +2 352
#note C12 (PO)L(O) apparently wins with all draws? Nope, just checked. I missed UNDULATED, saw UNDILUTED and eschewed it because I was unsure, and allotted to play this and hope it works. Was worried about him blocking with CE(E) but I thought I could just outrun him in that case. I didn't have time to go through all the scenarios. I knew I was choking. 
>Orry_Swift: CEGHRST I2 CE. +9 359
#note Such a good play. We both had around 1 minute left on our clocks. I knew he just had consonants after this, but had no time to see which ones. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ??ELNUU A7 cUrLE. +21 373
#note I saw UNQUELLED, missed UNEQUALED, and UNDELUDED fits too. Thought this won, since he had all consonants. One second on my clock. He held
>Orry_Swift: GHRST O7 R.GHTS +22 381
#note I couldn't believe my eyes when this came down. Orry is so deserving of having beaten me here. I defied all odds, and still could have won easily. This was my worst choke in a very, very long time, but it's good to see that I still have it in me!
