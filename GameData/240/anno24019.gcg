#note the O column spot isn't actually too dangerous, only NVYY goes there. I could play FUZE but that seems really crazy, even though the leave is much better. I could draw FUZE next turn as well...

#note considered a few options... exch keeping nothing, R, Z, RZ, and CURF. RZ could hit the C nicely. part of my thinking with CURF is that I *could* draw SOYUZ next turn or in a few turns (the spot isn't going away too often). He might have an S but if he doesn't he sacrifices a lot to block. exchanging down to RZ makes a bit of sense cause I could draw stuff like CRAZE or CRAZY which could outrun. a Y here is a good friend. CURF might be a bit premature.
