>Ian_Weinstein: ENOPRWY 8D POWER +26 26
#note Ian told me he probably screwed this turn up, and this was his rack. Really only looks like POWER is a close second to WYN keeping PORE, but POWER definitely fits Ian's style more than WYN would, so I don't see this as a mistake. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ABLNPRU 7C PUB +18 18
#note So PRUNABLE is good! Makes sense. I think I screwed my first turn up a bit more than you did, Ian.
>Ian_Weinstein: ANOUY 6B NOYAU +29 55
>Joshua_Sokol: AAELNNR 7G NAN +10 28
#note Ouch. Don't miss your best play, folks. Or you will have to play NAN for 10
>Ian_Weinstein: JT E5 J...T +28 83
>Joshua_Sokol: ADELORX E5 .....ED +34 62
>Joshua_Sokol: ADELORX --  -34 28
#note Was all set to play LOX, then I saw this nice X setup. The best setups are those that are challenged off, a wise man once said...
>Ian_Weinstein: HS 10E SH +28 111
>Joshua_Sokol: ADELORX 6H LOX +31 59
>Ian_Weinstein: CIU 10B CUI.. +16 127
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEKQRT C9 Q.AKED +60 119
#note Something did not want me to lose this game, I thought after I drew the Q and he gave me a huge spot for it. This play definitely fazed Ian, as it should have. I am never keeping a Q after JABOTED* + LOX. Almost never. 
>Ian_Weinstein: IIII -IIII +0 127
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGRRRT 5J ERR +15 134
#note OK, I guess that makes up for that ridiculous sequence last turn. ERG is much better than this. Incredible that I did not realize this in game. 
>Ian_Weinstein: ?DMNOSY L1 SYND.OMe +78 205
#note Mondays... Actually, it was Sunday
>Joshua_Sokol: EGOOORT 3H ORGO.E +16 150
#note No idea here
