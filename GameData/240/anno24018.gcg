#note hexad, hexed, hexads? HEXADS is nice equity wise but opens for hgh scoring overlaps. NSX has some scoring potential here. Matt flashed an M earlier, with VAR. I wonder if overlaps after hexads could be good for me, cause it closes off a lot of bingo lanes.

>Jackson_Smylie: AEINOSX 13E .IOXANES +68 220
#note SAXONIES below makes more sense than on top, cause less bingo percentage and it's harder for him to open the top left. dioxanes seems like a big mistake now, cause SAXONIES blocks the S lane. I wanted to create some scoring potential and then block the e-venter hook next turn to close the top of the board, but saxonies is a better version.

#note probably gob, even though closing the G-LAD and -H lane comes in handy.

>Jackson_Smylie: GIINOOQ 1H OI +12 352
#note tough turn here - I considered this and OI 7M for a long time. Valuation wise, OI 7m is much stronger because when he doesn't have an L I could get QI for 62 next turn, which could offset 1h plays. more likely though is that he sees my setup and blocks it, and he could do that for 25-30 points possibly, and then I might get a slightly better block for 1h next turn. Spread wise, OI makes more sense, so I probably should play it in a 6 game 4 person tournament, but it seems like the only way to lose after a huge bingo he could have.

#note I was thinking he might open so ENNOS could bingo, but it's probably better anyways to tack on the S.
