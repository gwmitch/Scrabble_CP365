#note Bizarre opening rack. It took me several minutes to convince myself that this was correct, which it is.

#note Missed 11E UPDIVE and G1 UPEND; chose this over 3C PUDEUR. I think I prefer UPDIVE.

#note Debated this and ZAIRE for a while, ultimately choosing this to score more, block 8A, and go for the blank and esses. This isn't a particularly bingo-friendly board, especially without an S, so ZAIRE didn't seem worth it. Quackle hates this play but I'm fine with it.

#note The one good thing about my seemingly horrendous draw is that with only one I unseen, Paul will almost certainly not block my 42-point play of M2 YID next turn.

#note Missed A11 TINEA, that's probably a little better to try to draw the last S and bingo with MUJIKS or ZAGS. My objective here was to hope Paul drew junk and that I could draw a big play with TACONITE. Not a bad idea by any means at this score, but I think TINEA gives me a better shot.

#note I was hoping Paul would have no vowels and I could play at O1, but he could still play SH so if that's my goal I should play DA, not AA, and folly up with AY next turn. But given what was in the bag I was sunk either way.
