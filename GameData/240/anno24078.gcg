#note I was very intimidated by Chuck. He has insane results.

#note This looked like it was definitely a word. Chuck held for a while, and released. It's good. But MOCKABLY* is not. I rightfully allotted not to play that.

#note Chuck wasn't too familiar with this recently added word.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ANWY -  +0 143
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEFIVV I9 FIVE +27 264
#note I was so relieved that he challenged, cause the board was insanely volatile at this point, and I could do nothing about it.

#note VEGGED is good?! Of course it is. I chickened out of it, for whatever reason. VEGES, VEGGES+, VEGGING VEGGED. I guess this is fine though. Scores more, sets up bigger scores, allows me to block stuff with my V next turn... Lots of one-pointers left too, so RS isn't amazing.

>Joshua_Sokol: CEESTUV 12A CUTES +32 340
#note Other plays score less and leave well, but I just need to outrun my opponent at this point. This should be the correct play. Chuck probably has one more turn to make something happen.
>Chuck_Armstrong: IRSTU A10 RI.TUS +24 249
>Joshua_Sokol: EENOTVY 1L .YVE +33 373
#note Huge draw, huge play.

#note ok, now it's become pretty dumb
>Chuck_Armstrong: EP D4 PE +20 296
#note This seemed like a very good play to me. Scores, and partially protects the lane at 2D
>Joshua_Sokol: AAHILOR O12 HAAR +46 491
#note Even though there are two A's left, I should just play HOAR here. Even HAIL. Keeping ILO is quite unbalanced here, and I learned that immediately after my play.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEIMNNR J2 A. +6 302
>Joshua_Sokol: ILLMNOR 1G MOLL +23 514
#note I have probably a 50% chance of drawing a U here, for an out in two spots. Although perhaps his range is more flexible than I thought.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEINNOS J5 NA.IS +19 321
#note 15D NO(I)S(Y) or 3A EN(J)OINS. -7. Chuck wanted out of this game.
