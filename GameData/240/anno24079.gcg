#note Seemed like this closed the bottom pretty quickly and the top in a few turns. Although S(HEAVE) will be an issue, (HEAVE)R or (HEAVE)N can block that but set up a new lane. This really just made so much stuff inaccessible, but then I talked myself into SCREELING* being good. STREEL STREEL STREEL. I always think it's SCREEL*

#note I feel really really bad now for winning this game. Gosh. What a disappointment to miss that bingo last turn... I didn't even look for a bingo. I already felt sickened by how well I was drawing

#note EYEBALLS was missed. WEASELLY was missed, WALLEYES was missed, MESIALLY I didn't know, SERIALLY plays through the I you idiot... The list goes on and on. What the hell was I doing this game?

#note I really should have lost this game. I even told Thomas before I played CREELING that I hope he wins. I guess I psyched myself out. I didn't think SKEET was valid. But it's a normal word.

#note this blocks everything except ERUPTIVE, but spread-wise it's pretty bad. Nothing wins 100% as far as I can tell. Perhaps I can outrun more often if I play 13A OWE or TOW and he bingos. More often than him having the exact rack of RUPTIVE, that is. Probably not.
