#note I really should have just gone with 8H FEZ. I decided he would smell the setup and ruin it somehow, but it's difficult to do that.

#note This was probably my best play of the tournament. I was pretty sure this was invalid, but, if Joey challenged it off, there was a chance that he would give me a tile to play through. Either an A, an E or a U yields me a bingo.

The previous day, Joey had registered me, Jackson Smylie and Matt Canik by proxy, since we were only getting in very late that evening. Because of this, I saw this as the perfect opportunity to potentially get away with this. 

Joey said "wow" after I hit the clock, and did not hold. I said "oh, yeah, thanks for that again!". Did I go too far with the coffeehousing?

#note Considering what's out there, it's probably safe to assume Joey has another S. This seemed appropriate nonetheless, since it blocked a scoring spot, a couple of bingo lanes, and left TER to still bingo at 1A next turn, some of the time. Perhaps it's too risky to block these lanes, though, since Joey can just bingo to WIGS next turn and close the board further while taking the lead. That is definitely what Quackle thinks. What do you think? The Quackle play is J9 (G)REY to keep the board open and retain a very good leave for bingo-ing next turn.

#note And this was just dumb. I saw C8 FAN(ON)S and didn't like that it gave Joey an easy 7 lane. Really stupid logic. I'm ahead 2 bingos.
