#note the funny thing is I saw SQUARERS but chickened out on it the first time. So why would I not chicken out on it the second time? I don't get how my brain works.

>cesar: AHIITYY 10B HAY.Y +30 108
#note -2. Quackle likes AY, or even YAH, at 13B. probably; AY looks reasonable as I can still score a lot next turn with WHIT at the very least.

#note i did see the only bingo here (WISTErIA) and actually laid it down but decided to not play it. first of all I should not be picking it up, because now he knows my whole rack. It's also the best play. The best non-bingo play is 13A OWE for 25. and AI at B6 is 3 more points. I was still recovering from a bad start, or something. -16

#note i cannot tell why quackle prefers 7A HUG by THREE points despite it scoring the same.

#note these decisions are super tough, and i was actually pretty low on time already. BIZE sims best mostly because I have no other choice and need to keep scoring.

#note keeping RE is better, quackle agrees. I should go through the endgames to make sure, though.
