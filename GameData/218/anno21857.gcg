>Thomas_Reinke: AEEILTY D8 .ILAYET +26 41
#note This gives too much back with parallel plays. That's okay. How am I going to beat someone better than me if I don't make brazen board-opening plays?
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: APZ C11 ZAP +52 107
>Thomas_Reinke: ?AEEIIO -AEIIO +0 41
#note 10D LIE blocks high-scoring stuff hooking ZA, I didn't think of anything but exchanging.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: BCIKNSU J3 BUCKINS +85 192
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: BCIKNSU --  -85 107
#note I was donning my Milwaukee Bucks shirt this day, which gave me the inner strength to challenge.
>Thomas_Reinke: ?AEEPTT E11 PET +49 90
#note This sims better than 15D SEPTATE until I add his rack into the sim. I didn't see SEPTATE until right after I hit my clock; I assumed that any bingo would be worse than the 50-ish point play keeping AET?.

#note Held this for a bit, trying to decide if TALAR was the singular of TALARIA or something. It isn't.
>Thomas_Reinke: LNNORSW -WNNL +0 215
#note 7F ADOWN was the only play I considered. But then I remembered something a learned elder once told me: "Never keep an L and an N at the same time you dip."

He was a wise man.

#note Super clutch drawing.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: DEINUW 1E UNWI.ED +33 317
#note Oof. Game losing non-challenge here. Didn't even think about it; it really looks way too much like a word. Only while going through the game in my head during my next game (a great habit, I know), did it come to mind that this might not be good.

>Thomas_Reinke: FILMNOY M2 MO.IFY +38 395
#note Empties the bag, which is not ideal, but 38 points is a ton at this point. Gotta hope for the best, the board is not great for scoring.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ?BDIORU N1 DUI +18 395
#note According to Quackle, this is one of two winning plays, the other being 5K ORIBI.
>Thomas_Reinke: AELNNNO 2A NONANE +22 417
#note I thought that this won, I didn't see his best out after this. Doesn't matter anyway, this is the best I can do. Plays at 5K like ANION also lose by 2.
