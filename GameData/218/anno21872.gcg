#note Oh what's that? Is my counter-defense too much for you Jason? ;)

>Jason: DEIMNRS 2F MINDERS +82 152
#note Jason took a while to gather the courage to possibly phony me here. He ended up pulling the trigger on a word he doubted. Issue being, when I played HIVIN(G), I liked that it created a phantom S hook. Silly me. Just SHIVE, SHIVES and SHIVER. I knew that HIVED didn't take a front C, but I should have also gathered from that distinct memory that it didn't take a front anything. Huge swing!
>Josh: AFRRSTX G1 F.X +21 78
#note This seemed the only sane play here. But it gives back a lot, keeps a do or die leave, and I have a couple of other possible plays. RAX and FAX at 1E aren't actually that bad. They create a tough to hit but also tough to block lane on row 3, and keep sort of flexible leaves. Otherwise, 6J FR(I)AR would be a much stronger play if I actually had a leave that hit something on column O often enough next turn. Also, there are two Y's out that will sting a lot if he has one of them.
>Jason: INORTTT 4D TRITON +28 180
#note lucky he couldn't hit me harder.

#note :(
>Josh: AAFGIJZ 3L .AJ +26 169
#note I was very close to playing FA(V)A for 37, but I really liked my chances on this setup. Not that I could hit something huge next turn, but it's possible, and I can always just play FIZ for 39. Perhaps I should exercise patience, but JZ seemed horrid here as part of a leave. Otherwise I can sort of open the board slightly with D1 ZAF(T)IG, but I'm not a favourite to hit that big hotspot at 1A next turn... N2 GAZA(R) was the other option, but it seemed like a worse setup than HAJ on every level.
>Jason: AT N1 TA. +20 239
>Josh: AFGIPQZ 3C QI +24 193
#note Didn't have the I last turn. Seemed safe to leave that spot open though, and I need to get rid of my Q. 4 U's out though, so maybe patience again. Maybe ZAF(T)IG again, as I might even hit QUI(Z)! Probably not. This play obviously bade terribly for the board, but I'm not worried about prying it open later.
>Jason: BEGI O2 GIBE +27 266
>Josh: AFGLOPZ N5 F.AG +13 206
#note Quackle not liking these setups. I like 'em. I'm not gonna get anywhere otherwise.
>Jason: EEUUUU -UUUUEE +0 266
>Josh: ALLOPSZ O7 LOP +26 232
#note Jason had AY last turn, and exchanged 6, so I assumed he exchanged the Y. But playing OPAL or OPALS, setting up my Z seemed way too risky. I was within range to catch up to Jason here otherwise, so I decided it was finally time to be patient. Quackle thinks I should set up! Nah...
>Jason: AY K6 .A.Y +24 290
#note AY magically reappeared on his rack. Good that I didn't play OPAL.
>Josh: AELLPSZ 10L LAZE +39 271
>Jason: ?EEIMOU E4 .OUE +8 298
#note Actual rack. Jason thought it was a good time to be aggressive.
>Josh: CELPSUW M9 W.ULS +24 295
#note In this position, two plays came to mind, both assuming the same thing; Jason was close to a bingo. I could not ascertain that he had the blank, but that seemed more likely than anything else. The blank seemed much more likely than the S did, for sure. Given that, I felt like I was more in trouble than it seemed. Fishing then came to mind. How can I fish on this board? I can simply drow my W, but what spot is best for that? I want to be able to win even if Jason has a bingo, so playing (A)W M10 looked like the correct fish, since he cannot block both bingo lanes simultaneously with one play, as he can with H8 or I8 W fishes. It looked like CELPSU hit many tiles, but not down column D. Given that, it seemed less strong to fish, as I could only hit in one spot and that spot is likely to get blocked. So I decided not to fish, unless I played M9 W(A)UL for 11. That seemed to hit a decent amount, but not much more than just WAULS did, and given just that WAULS was my play. PAWLS was 2 more points but CEU was just much worse of a leave than CEP. WAULS also put the game close to a tie, which was important at this stage.

>Josh: EORRSUV 11B OV.RUSER +72 395
#note I thought this and OVERSURE were a pair! This could have been a catastrophic blown game for me, but Jason also liked this. We were probably both confusing this with MULTIUSER. Luckily (should I even use that word), Jason had the game clinched... OVERSURE is apparently a 70% win, but that's generous. He almost definitely has the blank.
>Jason: ?CEILNT 13F sTENCIL. +69 419
#note only bingo and only win. I risked losing even if he didn't have anything and didn't challenge!
>Jason:  (AEU) +6 425
#note Don't phony and don't let phonies go! At least my gambits seemed like they worked well on this closed board. Maybe I should close boards even when I'm losing!!!
