#note Missed 2E LATERIZES, this scores 2 more though, and that's what Scrabble is all about in the end. It's not about always keeping the best leave or having the best board control. It's about scoring frickin' points.

Frickin' points, man.

#note Had to think about this for a while, even though my first thought when he played it was "no way. nope. nope. nuh-uh. nope." Playing for a spot in the playoffs wreaks havoc on one's decision making. The new word SUNCARE+ played some part in my confusion.

#note Our score at the end of regulation: 13-8 + 885, just good enough to squeak into the top 8. As other's dreams of glory are dimmed into black, mine glow brighter than ever.

Not really though. I'll win a Nationals when I make my own splinter Scrabble organization (take that NASPA! I reject your authority!) consisting of me and my two cats.

They really suck at Scrabble, despite their unflappable demeanor and soft fur.
