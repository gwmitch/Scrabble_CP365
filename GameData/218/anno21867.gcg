#note E5 BIELD if I don't want to fish. 9C BA if I do.

#note I didn't consider anything else on this turn, but 7B AJI is reasonable. I try not to open triples like that if I can help it, that's part of the reason I've gotten better despite my seeming inabilitiy to find non-obvious bingos.

#note Before he made his play I said to myself "If he plays an S so that I can play SEAFOAM, I'm gonna do it no matter what." Let no one say that I am not a man of my word.

#note All of a sudden the board isn't very good.

>Thomas_Reinke: EIILNPR 5H .RIPLINE +70 295
#note I wasn't confident in this at all, in fact this may be the closest thing to an "intentional phony" that I played all tournament. I knew it would be hard for him to challenge, since lots of plays to the triple would get him right back in it.
>Orry_Swift: ADIRU O3 UR.DIA +24 287
>Thomas_Reinke: AEGLOPR L3 GA.LOP +24 319
#note 4J GOAL doesn't give back X plays or anything much at all really.
>Orry_Swift: AESWX M7 WAXES +48 335
>Thomas_Reinke: BEEEERS 3G E.E +8 327
#note What a messed up draw.
>Orry_Swift: DM 4D M.D +22 357
>Thomas_Reinke: BEEIRSS G11 BISE +23 350
#note I thought that this play won, but I totally missed his 4J QUA, which kills me in most endgames, as well as his actual next play. K5 PERSE wins easily if I can find it.

#note It took 30 games but I finally did it! I couldn't let myself go a whole nationals without blowing an endgame.
