#note probably should just play this at 8G, but I didn't like letting his bingos score extra by hooking TOMBS. BLOT at 8F looks better - MRT scores better if I don't bingo and the placement doesn't give back a double-double.

#note I stared at this rack for many minutes! this is the only bingo, amazingly. I thought about fishing the I and trying to triple-triple with DIGESTED. the bingo actually sims very very poorly, even 10 points worse - I average 87 points per turn next turn after fishing with QI!!

#note this worked out much better than I would've imagined for me, because I blocked ANATHEMA and he couldn't remember the valid anagram
>JD: IIJNPSY O8 JI. +33 240
#note I should block, but I figured that it would be tough for him to play one of the valid anagrams after spending that long staring at this rack.

#note sets up the case A , which I can use to score any time I want.

#note definitely not the right play because he can hit VIRGULE to bingo out! I was under lots of time pressure and didn't realize the possibility. RAWIN is a safe spread play.
