>David_Engelhardt: ACHIO 8D CHIAO +26 26
>JD: DIIQUWY F6 QU.D +34 34
#note slightly worse than YID which I considered, or the crafty WADI setting up QI. QUID sets up a massive hook I won't get to use for awhile and keeps a truly dreadful leave. YID is my pick.
>David_Engelhardt: DLOU D8 .LOUD +16 42
>JD: AAIIIWY 9D .A.Y +26 60
#note what an atrocity of a move. trade now!!!
>David_Engelhardt: GPR 10B PR.G +20 62
>JD: ADIIIUW -ADIIIUW +0 60
#note david failed to play EQUID two turns in a row and yet I still have absolutely garbage. evidence I should've exchanged last turn. there's only one more D left so I can maybe keep it on the exchange.
>David_Engelhardt: AEEIRRS 5E RERAISE +93 155
>JD: AINOORU G2 URA.I +17 77
#note I am already in terrible shape (10% win percentage!!) so setting up a gimmicky hook seems like a good idea. maybe he'll miss the front hook?
>David_Engelhardt: AEIINRS L5 SENARII +66 221
#note how on earth did I end up winning this game?
>JD: FNNOOSW 1F WOOF +36 113
#note thankfully I finally have an S for SPROG. he may know the hook given that his last 2 bingos weren't supposed to go there, but my best bet is that he forgets it and I eventually cash in on a giant column A bingo.
>David_Engelhardt: EHP K11 HEP +26 247
>JD: ?AFJNNS 8J JN.NAS +39 152
#note sucks to give up my S, but no alternative here and at least I now have the blank. FINJANS# for 118 in CSW would've been pretty nice
>David_Engelhardt: DEINTT 6I DIN.TTE +21 268
#note cool play to block the right side and burn tiles

>JD: ?BCEKLT D1 B..K +26 327
#note Q suggests I'm 50% to bingo next turn, and david has shown no particular interest in blocking SPROG, so I have a chance.
>David_Engelhardt: AEGU 2I AGUE +18 378
#note after playing such steady defense I was really surprised to see this go down.
>JD: ?AACELT A5 LACTAsE +81 408
#note thanks to my excellent draw I have lots of bingos - ACETALS is 3 more, but I can even play ACYLATE/CLOUDY and ANALEPTIC through the T and I. David was probably in trouble anyway, but surely it would've been close had he not emptied the bag. He had absolutely no idea that SPROG was good so I guess he would've blocked the wrong spot anyway.
