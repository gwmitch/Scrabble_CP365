>Kitt_Morehead: EIP 8F PIE +10 10
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 12: Kitt and I faced off at the first game of the 2015 Nationals so I know her style a bit.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIIOOOY -DIIOOOY +0 0
#note I exchanged 7. Q thinks OPIOD F7. This is the only word worth playing in this sorry mess and I don't think it's worth it.
>Kitt_Morehead: GO 7G GO +12 22
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABIORTU I7 BRA +24 24
#note I strongly considered BRIO but didn't want to leave the J10 spot blindingly open.
>Kitt_Morehead: EINV 10F VEIN +21 43
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIOTTU -TOUIA +0 24
#note Quackle likes J4 AUTO here for 13. I guess that take over exchanging even though everything is bad.
>Kitt_Morehead: AEEINOT J1 ETAGERS +69 112
>Kitt_Morehead: AEEINOT --  -69 43
#note Kitt is a good player but likes to play phonies. I'm not letting this one get by me.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEHIJNT H6 J.. +10 34
#note 5th best play! Quackle likes 11I TAJ for 27 blowing up the rack a little, but I prefer to wait to see if I can draw a bingo if Kitt bingos and opens up the board.
>Kitt_Morehead: AEEGRST J1 ERGATES +69 112
#note 2nd best play for Kitt. The other ERGATES hooking SPIER is 4 better.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEHINRT 1C HERNIAT. +86 120
#note Best play! My strategy worked to perfection.
>Kitt_Morehead: MOTZ 4I M.TZO +32 144
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDFIOSU 2A CUIF +28 148
#note Best play!
>Kitt_Morehead: EU A1 E.U +15 159
>Jonathan_Lindh: DGOPQRS M3 G.RP +14 162
#note I screwed this play up. Just do GODS or DOGS at N1. -11.2
>Kitt_Morehead: ?DINOTW 11I TIeDOWN +77 236
>Kitt_Morehead: ?DINOTW --  -77 159
#note OUTWIND is her bingo which I didn't see and she didn;t see right away. This is why GORP sucked.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEOQSTT 3C STOT +26 188
#note 7th best play! N2 DOTE for 32 JON!
>Kitt_Morehead: ?DINOTW L6 OuTWIND +76 235
#note There's the bingo.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AAADEQ K10 QAiD +43 231
#note I had the right idea but my execution was terrible. K9 AQUAE for 47 burning the blank is the stuff. This was a 15.9 mistake.
>Kitt_Morehead: AHO J12 HAO +17 252
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEEEOY 8L .OEA +12 243
#note 2nd best play! I figured I'd leave the ANY plays for the next turn.
>Kitt_Morehead: CDK N7 D.CK +21 273
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEFINY M11 YEA +25 268
#note Best play!
>Kitt_Morehead: UX N13 XU +27 300
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEFIILN H10 .NFILE +39 307
#note O11 FIE is my best legit play but I decided to try a phony 6. It worked as Kitt held but accepted.
>Kitt_Morehead: AENV O12 VENA +45 345
#note And I get hit up with that.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEIILW F10 .IEW +10 317
#note 2H WIRE for 14 seems to be best. My leave is best but WIRE uses the same letters for 4 more points. -4.
>Kitt_Morehead: ABILNOS 15B ALBINO.S +63 408
>Kitt_Morehead: ABILNOS --  -63 345
#note BOA E11 is Kitt's best play. I think she confused this with ALBEDOES. Unfortunately, it's my turn to blunder now.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEILRSU N2 RISE +30 347
#note Oh for crying out. LEISURED! 60 points at 15B, probably wins me the game. Knew it too. This sucks. -20.3
>Kitt_Morehead: ABILNOS E11 BOA +25 370
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: DLLMRUY D12 DRUM +34 381
#note DRY or DRUM here? DRUM keeps VIEWY alive. However MULL can't go out. Is there a win here? I think I missed it on LEISURED! Kitt probably plays INS B4 here and I play ILLY to go out and lose by 3. I don't see a closer endgame. Does anyone else.
>Kitt_Morehead: ILNOS 4B INS +27 397
>Jonathan_Lindh: LLY B4 .LLY +9 390
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (LO) +4 394
#note Should have this game. LEISURED!
