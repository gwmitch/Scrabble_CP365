>Jonathan_Lindh: DENORRT A7 DRONER +33 171
#note 2nd best play! A8 RODENT keeping is R is best. -1.2
>Joey_Krafkchick: AIK 9K .AIK +17 218
#note Joey apparently had an A here but I knew the hook so this strikes me as a tad aggreessive. I'm sure he knows better than me though.

#note Best play!

>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIILNR N9 .I +12 238

>Joey_Krafkchick: H 14B H. +20 273
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEILNR 11J LIDAR +19 257
#note I wanted to try and draw the blank here so I went for turnover. Quackle says -12.2 but what I did worked.
>Joey_Krafkchick: DEINV 4C INV.DE +31 304
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EFLNSU J10 F.U +14 271
#note FUNICLES C1 was the bingo that played for 72. Quackle says it is 3rd but since it blocks Joey's X play I think it is best. Quackle likes 12K FENS keeping LU? but that's stupid on this board. -11.8 but I need to bingo! This or FUNICLES which I like best.

>Jonathan_Lindh:  (OSTW) +14 370
#note -83 equity loss with -38 on the horrible misses of AIRLINE and FUNICLES and some of it coming on the intentional play of LIDAR. This game was winnable.
