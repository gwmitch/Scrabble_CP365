>Joey: CGHIMTU 8D MIGHT +28 28
#note Interesting opener.  If MUTCH was a verb I'd play that.  Nothing quite gets rid of all the weaker letters, whether it's MUTCH, GITCH or HUMIC.
>Jeff: AIILMNU F1 MIAULIN. +65 65
#note GITCH and HUMIC (ALUMINIC) would have been much worse.
>Joey: CEEEPTU 1E E.CEE +27 55
#note I can't get rid of both a U and a 3-pointer.  Might as well use up all the E's with 9 remaining.
