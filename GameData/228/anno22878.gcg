#note Jonathan gave me his racks to plug in. He thought about this for a long time. YEZ looks worthwhile
>JD: AACFHRS 9E CAF +32 32
#note normally I would play FAH in a heartbeat, but Jonathan took so long to play ZEIN (and ZINE looks like the normal play to me) that I wanted to guard against the possibility of him having the X and getting a massive ZAX play. hence the leave sacrifice with CAF. quackle actually thinks it's an even decision even without any inference on Jonathan's rack just because of the good defense.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIOSTY E9 .OY +16 42
>JD: AHNRSST 10D H.ST +29 61
#note again guarding against him setting up the X again. this is best play anyway, or HAZAN
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEISTT H7 T.E +12 54
#note jonathan missed insetted/dinettes here.

>Jonathan_Lindh: ACDEIOR 3G RACE.OID +84 242
#note nice find
>JD: ?AAGKPT 2M PAK +28 212
#note I considered a more aggressive move here like PAK or KAPA at C12, but I think this is fine. the situation isn't that desperate yet and I should be able to bide my time.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EELLLNR H1 LE.L +15 257
>JD: ?AAGJOT E2 JOTA +30 242
#note didn't like blocking the L that much, but I retain plenty of good lanes including the potential GHOST hook for an -ING bingo
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILNRV N5 RAVELIN. +66 323
>JD: ?AAEGLO M9 AGO.AL +24 266
#note now I'm in trouble. I was really happy with this play because I block him from scoring a lot at the right-hand sign and also create a valuable new lane.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DDIMOUX 13G DIM +22 345
#note with both blanks unseen jonathan is rightly concerned about me bingoing. since I just blocked XI he decided to focus on blocking. Indeed, this cuts my bingo percentage from 15% to about 4%, so it seems like the right idea. I would probably just go for OXIM at 13F taking the points, this way he has OX/OX for 36 next turn but he'd probably prefer to make a play that turns over more tiles.
>JD: ?BEEEHO O8 HEBE +54 320
#note luckily for me his play gets me back in some kind of striking distance.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIORTUX 4K .X +36 381
>JD: ?EENOQS 4A QuES. +46 366
#note very difficult spot! I considered OPINE, but I would still stuck with the Q and he can just close row 15. After OPINE I'm depending on drawing a U for a 68-point Q play at 14J, which Jonathan can still outrun. I felt that my play gave me a real chance - there are two Us left, and if he has neither it could be tough to stop me from drawing a big scoring play. if he does play down from the Q, I now have a E to bingo through on column C if I can pull the other blank. Also, if he makes any kind of mistake I can just outrun him on points. OPINE sims better, but Jonathan has already shown the strategic awareness to shut down bingo lanes, so I think this is the play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIORTTU A4 .UITTOR +48 429
#note sweet play. not a guaranteed win though
>JD: EEINNOV H12 ..NE +18 384
#note PION and PINE are both 2/36 wins here. with PION, I have an unblockable bingo drawing E? or G?, and I also threaten NERVINE with N? and UNENVIED/UNVEINED with U?. PINE only threatens NOSEDIVE and OVERFINE (drawing E? or F?). PION looks like the try, hoping that he mistracks or fails to block one of my bingos.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEFGNUW 15D FUDG. +14 443
#note best play is FUGLED, jonathan is just playing it safe here.
>JD: ?EINOVY 14J VOI.E +32 416
#note I ran out of time and missed VOLLEY. 1 minute over
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENW B9 WEN +17 460
#note really nicely played game by jonathan - I tried my best but couldn't quite overcome his bingos.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (NY?) +10 470
