#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 8:
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EFHIMN 9G HIM +24 24
#note 8th best play! Suprisingly, FEH 9G is quite a bit better. -8.5 but mine is OK.
>Michael_Thelen: AGO 7I GOA +18 42
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEFILN 10B FELINEs +76 100
#note BAD BAD! L1 FELINELY for 89. I think it may draw a chalenge too. Mine is 3rd  best behind the 2 FELINELY plays at L1. -13.
>Michael_Thelen: EW 6J WE +30 72
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDGSTUW 5K BUG +24 124
#note 2nd best play! C9 DEBUG! Better leave and is 2.1 better. It also blocks his next play!
>Michael_Thelen: ?ACISUV D4 VICtUA.S +76 148
#note 2nd best play for for Michael! VeSICULA D4 is 80. -4.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIOPSTW 9C W.P +25 149
#note 11D STOW! Mine is 3rd best! -2.5
>Michael_Thelen: ART 11D .TAR +26 174
#note STOW doesn't give him that either!
>Jonathan_Lindh: DGIIOST 6D .IG +10 159
#note Quackle is right. M3 GIGOT is best. Mine is too fishy. -5.6
>Michael_Thelen: HILN 5A NIH.L +20 194
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIOSSTT N2 DOTS +17 176
#note This isn't that bad but ODIST N2 scores 23 and allows for a more open board. This may have helped to cost me the game. -5.6
>Michael_Thelen: ABIR A1 BRAI. +24 218
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIOSTV O1 VOE +23 199
#note Best play!
>Michael_Thelen: DLOPR L2 PRO.DL. +38 256
#note This was an amazing play by Michael! This coupled with the next game helped to seal the deal.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIJOST K1 JOE +16 215
#note 7th best play! B10 FEIJOA scores much more and shoots the board open. -14.7 drip drip drip on the moderate  to mild mistakes!
>Michael_Thelen: ILY A1 .....ILY +39 295
#note Great play! My chances are slipping away.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFIISST -II +0 215
#note I exchanged. Don't recall my rack.

>Michael_Thelen: TZ G9 ...TZ +27 322
#note Another fanastic play by Mike because I have been kind of fishing and I just exchanged so there's a good chance I have something good. He also had no vowels at the time!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEINRST 2A .ENTIERS +70 285
#note Not giving up yet! Best play!
>Michael_Thelen: Q E1 Q. +11 333
#note I have a chance!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADENRU H13 ACE +26 311
#note Rack not recorded. I think I needed to do this to score and open up the board.
>Michael_Thelen: DNOR B10 .ROND +18 351
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEFINR A12 NAIF +32 343
#note Best play! Don your rally caps!
>Michael_Thelen: OX I12 OX +44 395
#note That was crushing! I couldn't prevent that at all and if even I did, he still has OX A14 for 30. There goes my rally.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEEEOR 14H .ODE +21 364
#note 3rd best play! I needed to do CODER in the same spot which I strongly considered but I didn't have him tracked exactly. I only knew he had an S. -3.6
>Michael_Thelen: AEKMSTU 15K MAKES +40 435
#note This or SKATE in the same spot.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEER M12 REE. +16 380
#note 3rd best play! This was TERRIBLE. SAREE H2 was my out and EAR 1G is respectable. This sucked. -4.6
>Michael_Thelen: TU 1H UT +12 447
#note Best play! I threw away points in this endgame because the result was determined after OX!
>Michael_Thelen:  (A) +2 449
#note Total equity loss was between 60 and 70 including the plays I didn't record the racks for so I'm guestimating here. It was an alright enough game from an equity perspective, but a turn or two differently and I may have beem able to squeeze this one out.
