#note I sacrificed the two points to avoid slotting a vowel next to a double-letter score. However, as is almost always the case, the point sacrifice isn't worthwhile. The forgotten aspect of putting a vowel next to a DLS is that both your opponent AND you will end up scoring more. Therefore, it is almost never correct to sacrifice even 2 points to avoid putting a vowel next to a double-letter score. I ran a 2-ply sim with 5000 iterations (about +/- .5 standard deviation) and got these numbers for placements of ROWEL: 8D 20.3, 8E 19.2, 8F 17.0, 8G 18.8, 8H 20.3. Moral of the story: Take the points on the opening when placing a 5-letter word!
>Orry_Swift: EINOOSV K5 VIO.ONES +94 94
#note of course, maybe I'm unusually sensitive to my choice of opening moves given his followup

#note zero regrets about trying this - it's a word in french (means floor tiling) and I thought it had a good chance of being an art word. he definitely thought about it for a long time.
>Orry_Swift: ?AAIMNR 9A MARINAs +61 186
#note orry thought this was his only bingo, but he had MARINARAS available as a 9!
>JD: ACEEGLR B4 CLEAR.GE +67 101
#note I don't have much to lose at this point. he actually didn't even hold. turns out it's CSW-only!

#note I really didn't want to block the UNCUTE hook. if I really want to inject a ton of volatility I can play DEBT at A11, but quackle's suggestion of BUNDT at 11D looks good too. I do need to open this quadrant at some point though, so I don't mind my leave in spite of the inferior leave.
>Orry_Swift: ?BEGINY N7 BENIG.lY +80 280
#note did he sacrifice points to block the 3x3, or not see the UNCUTE hook? probably BIOGENY is worth it if he spots the hook.
>JD: ABDHIMT O4 HABIT +52 169
#note I'm probably not going to win here no matter what with both blanks gone, but disappointing to miss BIMAH here for 12 more.
>Orry_Swift: NO A7 NO. +23 303
>JD: DDEMSST N1 MEDS +19 188
#note at this point I was honestly just fishing for DIASTEMA or some miracle 3x3 that could go unblocked. quackle likes TEDS at N1, same idea but leaving an easier shot at a 3x3. doesn't matter much

#note the UNCUTE hook stayed open basically for the whole game - too bad the Es took a really long time to show up.

#note worth a try, HE at C12 seemed easier to block.
>Orry_Swift: DEFY 5D DEFY +34 433
>JD: DEIRSUX 4H DEX +37 306
#note I can actually block all his outs by playing XIS at 14J. didn't have time to figure this out.
