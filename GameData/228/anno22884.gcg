#note Clever CP says 13L WHY, setting up the case S and saving the X with several spots to play it and both vowels I need, is the play. Interesting idea, but I can't say I'm that upset with HEXES.

#note Burned all of my remaining time on this move. From my perspective, the biggest scoring threats are QUEAN and QUIET at 2K, and I think I have to play this as if he already has the Q. Matthew just played 4 tiles drawing into a 6 tile bag, so if he didn't have it already, he's a big favorite to have drawn it. It's also not out of the question that he already had it on his last turn and simply needed to shed his Vs, possibly even holding QE and giving him multiple shots at drawing into the 36 point Q plays. Finally, if I draw it after this play I'm pretty doomed anyway, even if I try to make a play keeping the U. FRUG has a 20 percent edge in win percentage compared to any other play here according to CP.

#note I drew the E required for both of the Q threats anyway. 5A PERCH is best, setting up another spot for my BY (BEY).
