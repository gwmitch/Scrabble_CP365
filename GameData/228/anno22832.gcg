#note Not sure what to keep here.  Probably no more than 3 letters though.

#note I had another six tile overlap!  But it only scores the same.

>Joey: EEHINSU J5 UH +28 100
>Chris: ACDEER D4 RECA.ED +22 96
#note I knew this wasn't good in TWL2, and didn't remember it making TWL3, but seeing him use up 6 pretty good letters for a minimal score wasn't all bad.

#note This was a guesswork sort of move.  ATELIC N2 scores a lot, but I didn't want to be bogged down by V's.  Shorter plays might not score enough.  This felt alright.
