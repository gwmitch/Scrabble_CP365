#note i thought there was a good chance this was phony but i spent way too long on this rack. ROTE 10E sims best. i hate Us but sometimes you gotta keep them. ? -0.5

#note i'm basically out of ideas now. obviously didn't see JEU at K5. it has to be much better than my play, but i guess quackle likes my play because i absolutely need to draw blanks and Ss right away to win this game. -2.5

#note i think i'm trying to screw this game up again. HAWING and WADING sim best because they go for the blanks, and they block a lane. i was worried that he would be somewhat close to a bingo and thought i could go for my own if he doesn't block. i have no idea. -a lot, probably.
