#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 13: 13 would not be a lucky number this game. I exchanged but don't remember my rack.
>Helen_Joffe: AGIV 8G VAGI +16 16
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEENUU I8 .ENU +6 6
#note Everything is terrible here. I strongly considered the equity fave UVEA G11. I also considered exchanging. I don't think my play is that great but I do have the hook.
>Helen_Joffe: HLRT 11G TH.RL +16 32
#note The board looks disgusting already!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADERSU H11 .EADS +30 36
#note How do I miss HEARD here? Bad start.
>Helen_Joffe: GOO I13 GOO +16 48
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAORRTU J11 .OAR +16 52
#note Best play!
>Helen_Joffe: BJ H7 J.B +16 64
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEFLRTU 10D TUFA +17 69
#note 2nd best play! I should have done the best play FAIL J6 because of this unlucky break.
>Helen_Joffe: ?ILMNOO D8 MO.IONaL +76 140
#note 2nd best play for Helen! Great find but there is something better. POLONIUM E4 for 86. What a terrible break for me.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEEHLR 15A HEE. +21 90
#note Yeah 14B LEACH. -5.9.
>Helen_Joffe: AANRTTW -ATT +0 140
#note Helen exchanged here.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEEEIR 8A CRI.E +27 117
#note I think this was my rack. Quackle says -1.6 to 7C but I like this or CREME in this spot better because it closes down a prime spot.
>Helen_Joffe: ENZ J6 ZE.N +38 178
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEIUVX 7B EX +36 153
#note Look harder Jon! EXUVIA K1 is a word you know and gets rid of the garbage on your rack. -24.6 big error.
>Helen_Joffe: ARW K5 WAR +25 203
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEOUUVY 6A OY +27 180
#note This is best but everything is terrible.
>Helen_Joffe: ?CDIKOS E1 DOCKSId. +78 281
#note Great find by Helen and best play! Why not switch the blank and the D around?
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEPTUUV 1C UP.ATE +36 216
#note Best play! I'm not giving up yet!
>Helen_Joffe: EF F6 FE +27 308
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEGIRUV L1 REVUE +23 239
#note 3rd best play! VEGIE in the same spot is Quackle's favorite but my play bingos more I think. I really like this play.
>Helen_Joffe: ADEM 1K D.EAM +24 332
>Jonathan_Lindh: GIINSTW F1 .W +26 265
#note 2nd best play! I see the word but not the spot. One of my few board visualization errors of the tournament. I don't think I'm winning this game anyways, but this was bad. -36.9
>Helen_Joffe: IQ 5C QI. +12 344
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGIINST 4E .I +6 271
#note 2nd best play! 8G VAGINITIS for 49 blowing up the rack? I don't think so but great play! I knew that word too!
>Helen_Joffe: IN G3 IN +10 354
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGINSTY B14 Y. +10 281
#note Yes, this happened. -31.6. Do not view if pregnant.
>Helen_Joffe: BT 11C B.T +14 368
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADGINST M5 DATINGS +68 349
#note I get this down at least. In all fairness, even after WISTING I probably wasn't winning but at least I would have had a chance.
>Helen_Joffe: ILNOPRS 8L P.ON +27 395
#note Actual rack! 13A SPINOR seems to be best but this is only a little off. It's over. Then again on DATINGS I may have done better to fish the D. If Helen fishes again I ma actually come up with a miracle win. Or she may block and I get nothing at all. NOTHING AT ALL. NOTHING AT ALL. Stupid Sexy Flanders!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ALT 3B TAL. +12 361
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (LIRS) +8 369
#note Another decision that backfired on me with TUFA. Probably wasn't winning this game anyway but I could have gotten a little closer on spread and not taken 2 major equity hits.
