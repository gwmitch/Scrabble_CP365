>Jonathan_Lindh: ANNOTUY 8G TANNOY +26 26
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 5: Best play! Steven is another Scrabble player who attained his rating very fast. His trajectory mirrors mine in fact. He played much better than his 1300's rating suggests and should be found for a much higher rating very soon.
>Steven_Dinapoli: ACLRTWY L3 CRAWL. +28 28
#note SD: K5 ACTORLY for the 2x2 (-13)
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEGHUV 3I GAU.HE +28 54
#note 2nd best play! 9F VAGUE is better because EH is that much than EV. -.6
>Steven_Dinapoli: DIPRTTY N1 PR.TTY +38 66
#note 2 6's already. Good plays for Steven too.
SD: O1 TIDY 50.  I didn't know GAUCHED, which is new.  (-19)
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEEIPV 1L PI.E +33 87
#note Best play!
>Steven_Dinapoli: BDEILOR 9B BROILED +68 134
#note Best play for Steven! The bingo he referred to that he didn't know was TRILOBED at B9 for 65.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BDENSV D8 D.VEN +22 109
#note Best play!
>Steven_Dinapoli: AEFIIMS O6 AMI +20 154
#note I don't know what Steven's rack was so this may have been the right play, but the triple doesn't strike me as that juicy of a spot because all the words must start with a vowel. I was going to be bingoing on the next turn anyway, but AMI made things much better for me.
SD: D'oh!  J7 INFAMIES 67!  This was easily my worst miss of the tournament so far. (-41)
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BCLOSU N8 SUBCoOL +84 193
#note 2nd best play! Umm wow! B7 SUBBLOCk is 88. I didn't know that one. That's beyond even my bingo probability range. -4.
>Steven_Dinapoli: AEEEFIS E11 FEE +24 178
#note SD: 15K FEASE 38 scores well and blocks a big scoring spot. (-8)
>Jonathan_Lindh: EFGSTUW 15L WEST +44 237
#note 2nd best play! FUSE is better than WEST by .4. Pretty even.
>Steven_Dinapoli: AAEEIOS J5 AEO. +6 184
#note SD: It's either this or an exchange.  In retrospect, I probably should have exchanged AAEIO.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFGJNUV 5I J.V. +28 265
#note Best play!
>Steven_Dinapoli: AEEEIOS -AEEIO +0 184
#note Steven exchanged.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFGHNOU 12K GON.F +24 289
#note Quackle and I disagree here. OAF at H2 is utterly stupid. Mine is back at -11.2 but doesn't give that much back. I do mine again.
>Steven_Dinapoli: DEIKOSU C11 KOI +27 211
#note SD: Best.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAHISTU 11I AHA +18 307
#note AAH and AH I saw but are UTTERLY stupid at 2H and 2I. Mine is actually 9th best and -12 but I still like mine. I'm not opening up the board when Steven appears to be fishing.
>Steven_Dinapoli: DEERSTU 7G UT +11 222
#note SD: Trying to fish and give myself another bingo line.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIIISTU 13G SUITE +11 318
#note This is a blocking play so it's not going to be as great equity wise at exchanging IIU which is maybe what I should have done. Given the pool, Steven is unlikely to kill me at H12. Q thinks this is -17.4 but it meant to block.
>Steven_Dinapoli: DEEGRRS H12 R.ED +18 240
#note SD: GUDE and DURE are both slightly better (-3).
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EIIIMO -IIO +0 318
#note Now it is time to exchange! -1.2 to 10A OI but I like mine best.
>Steven_Dinapoli: EGNRRSZ J2 Z. +31 271
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEIMNQ B13 QI +33 351
#note Best play!
>Steven_Dinapoli: EGNORRS 10J ORG +18 289
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEILMN C2 MALIgNE. +73 424
#note 2nd best play! Once again, I miss a better bingo for 4 points more. C2 INFLAMER, which I knew cold. -4.
>Steven_Dinapoli: ADENORS D1 DONAS +28 317
#note Steven missed SOLANDER here. DONAS was his 2nd best play. -75 or so for Steven.
SD: Yep, I've really got to work on those 8's.  (-79)
>Jonathan_Lindh: IIX A14 XI +36 460
#note Best play!
>Steven_Dinapoli: ER B2 ER +17 334
#note Best play for Steven!
SD: Actually, O3 RE scores 2 more.
>Steven_Dinapoli:  (I) +2 336
#note Excluding turns 8-10 where Quackle's suggestions were way too aggressive, my total equity loss for this game was 9 points. TOTAL. Absolutely on this game.
SD: This was easily my worst game so far in the tournament.  Those two missed bingos cost me dearly.
