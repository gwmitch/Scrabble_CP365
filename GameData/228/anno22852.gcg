>Jonathan_Lindh: HLNOOSU 8G HOLO +14 14
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 10: Best play! I thought about this turn for a very long time. I hate U's but NSU has good synergy.
>Lila_Crotty: AHW 7H HAW +23 23
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAGINSU -AU +0 14
#note 10th best play! 9D IGUANAS for 82! This was a horrible miss. I could only think of SAUNAING for some reason. -60.
>Lila_Crotty: AJM 6F JAM +36 59
#note Good play by Lila.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADGINSS I6 S.. +16 30
#note 4th best play! JAM blocked SHADINGS which I saw! WOuld she have challenged SHADINGS? Probably not I'm guessing. Quackle likes best play  DASH by 4.4 over my play but I like my play just fine.
>Lila_Crotty: NU 9J NU +8 67
#note Lila is close to a bingo too?
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADGINPS L9 SPADING +79 109
#note Best play! Supposedly. What position of SPADING to use? My play of L9 SPADING scores a little more than L4 SPADING or L3 SPADING. In retrospect L4 SPADING is worth the 2 point sacrifice because it doesn't expose too many letters for 8's and doesn't give a blank check for bingos starting in S like L3 does. L3 and L4 expose a floating S which is why I went with L7.
>Lila_Crotty: ADEILNR 14H INLA.DER +72 139
#note Best play for Rita! I cringed when I saw this come down but she did have HARDLINE open at G8 for 64. Would she have found it?
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEFINY 15E EYEN +27 136
#note 12th best play! O11 FIERY! I was overly paranoid about H15. Both spots are massive. -12.2
>Lila_Crotty: ER 15N RE +14 153
#note My suboptimal play oddly worked out. Maybe EYEN was right after all and did better in a SIM than in equity.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEEFIT 13H FEE +18 154
#note Best play!
>Lila_Crotty: QT 11K Q.T +24 177
#note I think Lila may be close to bingoing again.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEIOTZ 9A ErOTIZE +73 227
#note Best play! Along with ZEOlITE and pOETIZE in the same spot. I needed to go with one of the other two. Look at what happens next!
>Lila_Crotty: ?ABEILR A8 B.wAILER +140 317
#note Best play! Fantastic play by Lila! I put my head in my hands when I saw the blank come down because I knew I should have played ZEOLITE. I also didn't see POETIZE on the turn before. Other 3x3's for 140 include BEARLIKE and RELIABLE.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IIMNOTT B12 NIM +22 249
#note 14D TOM! I couldn't be expected to play optimally after what happened the last turn. -9.9.
>Lila_Crotty: EKU C11 UKE +27 344
#note It gets worse.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IOORTTW 10G WOT +15 264
#note I didn't see the other placement of WOT one space over more. 10G WORT in the same spot is best. My play may be better for a bingo and that is what I need now. -5.9
>Lila_Crotty: AADEFIU -IUFA +0 344
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEIORRT 12L .OR +6 270
#note I'm REALLY regretting missing WORT. Quackle says -5.2 to INKER 12A, but I need a bingo to win and I need to  create lanes so I do my play in an instant again!
>Lila_Crotty: ACV F12 CAV. +20 364
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEIPRTT J12 P..T +6 276
#note Wow! I completely miss TRICEP I was focused on bingoing. Strangely I think that loses.
>Lila_Crotty: LU 11C .LU +6 370
>Jonathan_Lindh: BCEINRT -B +0 276
#note I don't remember my last letter. I hope it wasn;t an E but I do remember having CINTER and fishing for an S.
>Lila_Crotty: AFY O10 FAY +25 395
#note Smart play by Rita. However, my incompetence won't last.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEINRST K1 CRETINS +78 354
#note Best play! I almost played CENTRIS(T) instead of this. This was huge.
>Lila_Crotty: DIU 1I DU.I +8 403
#note Lila apparently had dreck on this play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAGIOTX L3 XI +31 385
#note Best play! I needed to draw the X to have a chance to win.
>Lila_Crotty: GO I1 .OG +7 410
#note Lila blocked VEXT. However, this play probably cost her the game because of what came next.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAGORTV H2 TAV +15 400
#note I was under a minute on my clock. I need to block BODIES and DOGS. Thankfully I tracked correctly this game so I knew she HAD BODIES has her remaining six letters. TAV and then AGRO is the correct sequence. I nailed it!
>Lila_Crotty: BDEIOS 9N BO +14 424
#note Um, wow! Lila missed a ton of plays for the win. D7 BOTELS for 34 is best. N6 DOBIE for 21 also works. Her play was -25 and this won me the game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGOR 7C AGRO +15 415
#note Best play! And I saw this endgame sequence with less than 40 seconds on my clock I believe.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (DEIS) +10 425
#note Score recorded as 425-420. Lila didn't ask for a recount but probably should have. Sweating out a point difference would have been terrifying. A lot of things I did seemed to backfire this game but BO/OFAY allowed tme to squeak it out with AGRO.
