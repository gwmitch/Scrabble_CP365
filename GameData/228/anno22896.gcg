>Rafi: EEFGTTX 8G TEXT +22 22
>Will: AGKORTY 7F KAYO +31 31
>Rafi: EEFGLOR 6I FORELEG +78 100
#note Deftly securing the 50 point bonus with this #1 play upon simulation of all choices.
>Will: EGNPRST L3 REP.G +16 47
#note Giving up almost a 30 percent chance to attain the coveted 50 point bingo bonus is unwise. GNAT is the best play here to create an S hook.
>Rafi: BELMOOS 3F BLOOME.S +78 178
#note Idiotically missing BEGLOOMS... that rack looked familiar and I just didn't think of it. At least I managed to secure my second consecutive 50 point bonus.
>Will: AENPSTT 9B PATENTS +71 118
>Rafi: ACEHIIU O6 .AUCHE +36 214
>Will: CDEENUV 12L VEND +36 154
#note Considered the top 3 options here and was fully aware that VEND wasn't very good for the future of the lower right quadrant, though it could be reopened with some difficulty. I was eager to colonize the O12 spot before Rafi could score there, but I might need that area to be more open later. I could be persuaded that VENDUE is best.
>Rafi: IIIIITZ -IIIIIT +0 214
#note Can you believe this shit? I leave two I and I draw 3 more I? I have so many I, I can't believe my eyes! The Z plays well on this board so it's not worth playing through with ZITI. Looking to nab a blank to eventually secure a career high third 50 point bonus of the game.

>Rafi: AABDDJZ M9 JAD.D +44 258
>Will: CDEIINS 14B INDICES +94 270
#note I was so infatuated by successfully obtaining 50 bonus points that I neglected to add the points for hooking OUTWILED to my score.
>Rafi: ABIINNZ 4A ZINNIA +54 312
>Will: ?AAFOVW H1 AV.W +42 312
>Rafi: BEGILTY A4 .IBET +48 360
#note Setting up a potential big Y spot too!
>Will: ?AAFIOR 15H OAF +24 336
#note Mistakenly opted to sacrifice points to keep a consonant when there were three more R lurking and I needed the extra 8 points badly. Spoiler alert, I lose by 4.
>Rafi: GLMOQUY 1F QU.LMY +20 380
#note Considered QU(A)LM, MY, and QUO(L)L as well. I actually thought I was up by 10 more points because Will underscored INDICES (which I discovered next turn). After QUALMY, if Will doesn't immediately bingo I can shut down the lanes completely... there is nowhere else to even set anything up! Also, the lanes available aren't that strong and I can outrun a good portion of his bingos, withstanding the devastating 50 point bonus that most bingos provide. There's a huge case to be made for QUOLL... it leaves just the A which is often an airball bingo, and the Y has some scoring/outrunning potential. One thing that swayed me towards QUALMY was that Will almost never has the H (otherwise FOH) so I frequently will have the flexible-scoring H in the endgame for an out in two to outrun. After QUOLL, if an A bingo hits the triple I'm in worse shape BUT that's not super likely. MY also has a lot of merit... 30 points, and I can draw QUA for 41 sometimes to outrun almost anything. Tricky spot! I think QUALMY is stronger with an additional ten point lead... I might have played something different knowing the correct score. But then again QUOLL is stronger too.
>Will: ?AAIINR 12B fI.ARIAN +58 394
#note Hard to piece together why ALIZARIN is a bit better than FILARIAN...I figured FILARIAN would allow me easier overlaps in the endgame with a good draw, but perhaps I should be trying to prevent that.
