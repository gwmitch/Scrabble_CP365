#note finally a great draw after a series of near misses. really I should've found TENOTOMY to complete the bingo-bango-bongo in the first place.

#note with enough time, maybe I would've recognized that the only bingo available is ASSWAGE which doesn't fit. in that case I should block the high scoring plays he has on column O with KAY at M9. If this were CSW I'd have to block SEALGHS#.
