>Kit_Morehead: EEHMNT --  -30 0
#note HETMEN+, the plural of HETMAN, is now valid. not this though.
>JD: ADGGINT -DG +0 0
#note doesn't pop up on static, but exchanging DG destroys a sim - her play is probably going to be HEM, and so I get to try to draw an 8 with EATING. I bingo 70% after exchanging.
>Kit_Morehead: EEFHMNT 8G FEN +12 12
>JD: AGILNOT G8 .LOATING +64 64
#note since I know 4 of her 7 titles, it's more reasonable than usual to play LEGATION or GELATION. Her odds of having drawn an S or blank are only about 20%, whereas I'm turning over 7 tiles and so my odds are more like 40%. But I didn't think I needed the volatility here.
>Kit_Morehead: EHMTU 15D TEU.H +30 42
>JD: BBDEKOY 10F B.OBY +26 90
#note KNOBBY at I7 cleans up this mess of a rack further, but DEK will score pretty well - I foresaw a play on column J hooking FEND

#note would you believe I almost lost this game after being up 154 points?
>Kit_Morehead: ?ANRTTU 5E TURNc.AT +78 159
>JD: EIORSSW 7H WO. +15 251
#note key move. I got greedy and didn't take the points for RESOW/REVOKED.
>Kit_Morehead: EIQU L1 QUIE. +48 207
>JD: EIRRSSY H1 YE.R. +27 278
#note I started to play really poorly down the stretch. here I missed the new RYU/REVOKED as well as KISSY and YEARS which are all probably better. there are two more esses to come so I should really try to spend one.
>Kit_Morehead: ?EEEPSW N5 SWEEtPE. +76 283
#note inspired phony here! it turns out that this is a famous phony that Mike Frentz got away with on Kenji. if I challenge this off, my bingo will block SWEEPIER and WEEPIEST and leave me in extremely good shape. Instead...
>JD: ILOORSS O8 LOOS +25 303
#note completely falling apart down the stretch! thought of ROSOLIOS but not ROSINOLS somehow. another 22% dent in my win percentage...
>Kit_Morehead: AFOS 13K OAFS +41 324
#note again, failing to challenge off SWEETPEAS costs me a massive amount
>JD: AEEIPRS 6E APE +25 328
#note I wasn't wild about fishing here. I can hit CARSPIEL/REPRISAL or something through the T, but I liked staying in scoring range and requiring her to play a decent endgame.
>Kit_Morehead: AGIRT O1 TRAGI +26 350
>JD: CEIIRRS J2 R...... +17 345
#note gah, after she blocks CIRRI I'm in huge trouble. this is just kind of a waiting move to force her into a mistake.
>Kit_Morehead: IMV 7C VIM +17 367
>JD: ACEIIRS A8 SERIA. +21 366
#note I thought I was in big trouble, but her rack is so awful that I can almost certainly outrun from here. Quackle finds lots of wins, including CERIA, KIS and just QI. SERIAL only wins 3/8!! absolutely dreadful play that leaves me dependent on the draw instead of letting me milk my superior tiles.
>Kit_Morehead: CDDGHLO 11D CHO. +22 389
>Kit_Morehead: CDDGHLO --  -22 367
#note it's not totally straightforward for her to win because she has to see that I threaten IXIA, but this was a pretty bad way to go
>JD: CIX 3L .XI. +22 388
#note after spending the whole second half of the game seemingly trying to lose, I end up winning after all.
>Kit_Morehead: CDDGHLO 14I CLOG +16 383
#note this play actually doesn't beat IXIA either had kit played it first.
>JD: C F4 C.. +7 395
#note phew. I think this may wind up being my worst-played game of 2016. thankfully still won thanks to opponent phonying 3 times...
>JD:  (DDH) +16 411
