>Will_Anderson: AAAAELN -AAA +0 0
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 14: My biggest loss of the tournament. Which not surprisingly came at the hands at one of the best players in the tournament.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BOOOTUW 8G BOUT +12 12
#note All of these plays are terrible. Will and I determined. 8G WOO was the best and all of these options are dreadful. -5.2
>Will_Anderson: AELLNNO G8 .ALLONNE +62 62
#note I pay dearly.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEINOOW H12 WEAN +52 64
#note Best play! The bingo is mostly negated.
>Will_Anderson: GIIKOPQ I7 Q.IP +26 88
>Jonathan_Lindh: EFHIOOR 6F FORE +31 95
#note 4th best play! I went back and forth between this and 6E HOOFER which is Quackle's fave. I think HOOFER gives a lot back. It's -4.7 to Quackle but I think its a tossup.
>Will_Anderson: EGIKMOO H1 GOOIE. +24 112
#note Will makes me pay for another fairly minor mistake.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AHILORR G3 HA +20 115
#note The best play was one neither of saw. 5B AIRHOLE for 27. It prevents Will from making huge plays with his J. Or at least I think at press time until Will loads his version. I fully admit my play is terrible. -15.2
>Will_Anderson: AAJKMTV E3 JAVA +36 148
#note I'm being taken to task for mistakes that other people would fail to capitalize on.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EILORRY 14G ..RY +15 130
#note 11th best play! Yeah. I1 OYER. Also 10I PYLORI for 21 and G12 OWLERY for 24 which I saw after the fact. However, with my next pickup, I would exchanging no matter what. -9.4.
>Will_Anderson: AKMORTT 4A KORM. +32 180
>Jonathan_Lindh: EILORUU -ILOUU +0 130
#note 10I PURLIEU? Quackle? I'm not doing that. My exchange surprisngly rates down at -6.6. I don't care. I exchange here.
>Will_Anderson: ?ADITTU F6 .IAT +16 196
#note This play killed me because it cuts off the BOUTS hook. This play completely altered the course of the game. And it was a great move by Will. (W: It was certainly my goal to cut off the S hook, but I missed many nice overlapping plays forming UNARY, such as the star play of F12 DAUT. FIAT performs about as well as DAUT if and only if you have an S hooking bingo down the K column which doesn't play anywhere else - needless to say, I was fortunate that that was in fact the case.)
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEHORST 15J OTHERS +44 174
#note 6th best play! Um, wow! I was convinced my play was the best and Will seemed to approve in post mortum. 8A THERE(ABOUT) for 48 keeping OS is best. HO 3B and F12 HO  and 3B HE come next. I didn't expect this result at all. This play is still very reasonable because I'm turning over 6 tiles with 2 blanks and 3 S's in the bag while creating and scoring 44 points. I am about to be punished for this seemingly minor mistake in a big way. -9.6
>Will_Anderson: ?ADLNTU O8 oUTLAND. +77 273
#note Best play! I cringed a little when this went down.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EINPSUX A1 PUN. +30 204
#note 4th best play! PUNKIE in the same spot setting up my X. I agree totally. -6.6.
>Will_Anderson: ?ADEGIL N2 AdELGID +76 349
#note Best play by Will! I am getting taken to task for seemingly minor mistakes.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEISUX O3 EX +35 239
#note 4th best play! Oops. This was stupid. At this point I'm in shock at what is happening. M7 XU for 37 is clearly better. -4.5.
>Will_Anderson: EEIINSW E9 EISWEIN +73 422
#note Nigel Richards will soon to be checking under his bed for Will Anderson. Best play yet again for him. (W: I had to shake my head at this draw.)
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEISSU J10 ECU +13 252
#note Another moderate mistake. Since I have 2 S's 11I SUE creating a lane is clearly better. At around this point, my brain began to drift to other things because this game was unwinnable at this point. -10.4
>Will_Anderson: BCFMRTZ 2L CZ.R +25 447
>Jonathan_Lindh: DDEIIRS 13B SID. +10 262
#note What do you even do here? I2 ID doesn't open any new lanes which I need to bingo to keep the score halfway respectable. Quackle has this 17.2 back. My brain is kinda much at this point and I want to move on to the next game.
>Will_Anderson: ABFMTTY A12 BATT +33 480
#note I'm just getting raked over the coals here.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEIIRS C3 D.IER +14 276
#note OH NOES! There is the missed bingo! B6 DIERESIS for 69 and 36 points worth of tiles left on Will's rack. This was massive.
>Will_Anderson: FGMOVY L2 .OMFY +30 510
#note Because I missed my bingo, Will can play off his high point tiles for many points. (W: Because COMFY yields a high-scoring SEI in response, I should actually play B6 FOGY here.)
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIS K3 SEI +22 298
#note Best play! One of very few.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (GV) +12 310
#note Score recorded as 509-310. DIERESIS was a horrible miss but my mind drifted at that point in the game. The score shouldn't have been this bad but Will made me pay for a lot of minor to moderate mistakes. Well done Will! And not a well played game by me, probably my worst or THE WORST game played game.
