#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 16: I was feeling pretty gassed at this point but was trying to maintain focus because I wanted to come into the final day with a winning record. This game started off badly, but I turned it around. My exchange is 3rd best. CEE 8G for 10 is surprisngly best. I think it's worth a fish for a bingo. -2.9
>Robert_Fenske: IVY H8 IVY +18 18
#note This is the first time somebody opened vertically against me at the tournament. Every time somebody opens vertically, the tile gods kill a kitten.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABCEIST 10G B. +7 7
#note BA or BI in the same spot are better fishes. Quackle goes for BAY 10F as it's top play. -5.6
>Robert_Fenske: AGGNOPQ -QGGOP +0 18
#note Robert exchanged. Not actual rack but he dumped 5.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEEIST 9G A.E +13 20
#note Well, there's another missed bingo this tournament. I knew VESICATE too. I chose the 3rd best play. -30.5
>Robert_Fenske: GGIR F6 GRIG +18 36
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEIPSTT 7E C.IT +17 37
#note 2nd best play! Surprisingly my play is actually fairly good. Quackle likes H7 TIVY best, but only by -.4 so it's a tossup.
>Robert_Fenske: AEEGSSW 11A SEWAGES +77 113
#note Best play! This hurt.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EMMPSTT A7 TEMP. +27 64
#note 2nd best play! If this rack is correct, TEMPTS in the same spot! Minor miss. -3.7.
>Robert_Fenske: AJOT B6 JOTA +35 148
>Jonathan_Lindh: MOOSTUW 12B MOW +35 99
#note Best play!
>Robert_Fenske: AEHKLOR C6 ORA +20 168
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAORSTU 13A OUTA +31 130
#note Best play! 
>Robert_Fenske: AELZ J6 ZEAL +42 210
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABENRSU K2 UNBEARS +83 213
#note Best play! If there is one thing that I'm good at doing in Scrabble, it's drilling bingos in crunch time situations.
>Robert_Fenske: EEINNRT -  +0 210
#note Robert challenged.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DEILTU 3F DILUE.Ts +70 283
#note 2nd best play! I took a VERY long time on this play. I wanted to make sure DILUENTS was the right spelling (it is). 4F DUTIABLE is 2 more. -2.
>Robert_Fenske: EKP H1 KE.P +39 249
#note DUTIABLE is clearly best because it doesn't give that back and may draw a challenge in itself.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEHOQR 2J H.E +29 312
#note 2nd best play! What an ODD rack! Quackle likes the hard to see ASHORE for 39 best. This was 2nd but down by -10.8.
>Robert_Fenske: INVY D3 VINY +33 282
#note Robert autoplayed this so he missed it at L1. He commented on this at the end of the game. I was very afraid of an L1 play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EOOQRU -QUOO +0 312
#note I exchange QUOO. I think this is right because the Q sucks on this board.
>Robert_Fenske: DHIN 1L HIND +46 328
#note Missing VINY worked out well for Robert in the end.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EFIORT A13 .OF +18 330
#note ANOTHER MISSED BINGO? I missed l8 PIEFORT for 70 and M3 SETIFORM for 64, both of which I knew cold. TERRIBLE! This was the best of the non-bingo plays. -13
>Robert_Fenske: AX 2F AX. +26 354
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EILLRT L8 sTILLER +64 394
#note Best play!
>Robert_Fenske: DEINOR 1A IRONED +29 383
#note Good one by Robert!
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEFNOSU 14J FO.CES +38 432
#note Best play according to Quackle! Just FORCE would be a massive blunder. When I track correctly, Mr. -999.9 endgame man is on vacation. Probably in Miami. However 14J CURFS for 32 is probably more optimal if Robert finds QINDAR the next turn which he doesn't. With CURFS he almost certainly finds QADIS/QAIDS.
>Robert_Fenske: ADINOQR 13G QADI +31 414
#note 3rd best play! QINDAR 15F or QINDARS O8!
>Jonathan_Lindh: NU E4 NU +10 442
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (NOR) +6 448
#note 2 missed bingos  but only around -65 to -70 lost equity. Not a terrible game, but could have been better. I will post Episodes 17-20 at a later date.
