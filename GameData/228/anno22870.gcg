#note I felt like OVERTART was something Helen would find and try, but maybe after losing a challenge she'll assume it's not good if I'm giving her the letter to play through? Any advice for what to do here from the clever strategists out there?

>W: EIINRRS K5 REIN +27 71
#note Considered IRE but she's playing so aggressively - unless that suddenly changes it seems fine to play closed and wait.
>Helen: AFN L7 FAN +15 69
>W: AEHIIRS 10J HIE +21 92
#note Continuing to play more defensively than usual.

#note The S isn't looking great here, so the extra 10 points seemed worth taking.
>Helen: ADET H11 .ATED +24 216
>W: ADKLUWY J10 ..WDY +23 261
#note Probably should've done WEAKLY, which I considered, but I liked that HOWDY didn't even offer a triple in return. As it turns out this hardly matters in opp. average score.
>Helen: APY N2 PYA +31 247
>W: AEIKLTU 4L U..I +10 271
#note Painful to have almost no ability to close the line. She had PHONIES with a blank somewhere for ~100 points, so I saved myself some pain here.
>Helen: ?EHOP 2B EPOcH +47 294
>W: AEGKLTU C1 U.TAKE +24 295
#note Keeping vowels here was important - UPTALK over UPTAKE for sure, and PULK looks like a good option as well.
>Helen: ENRW B6 WREN +28 322
>W: EGIJLMN A8 MINGLE +44 339
#note CP says this is winningest but I wasn't feeling very optimistic - it certainly doesn't seem like I'm winning 56% here as it suggests. Need to at least threaten something like JIN or JIG at F10 and the S might be nice if only so she doesn't have it.
