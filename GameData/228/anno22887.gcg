#note A play that most people will think is really stupid but I like.  If I can draw a consanant making anything _IX I can drop it at M1 for 60 points next turn, and given Kevin's two tile fish opening the board I was pretty confident he wasn't going to block the spot so i took the 23 with a pretty good guarantee I would get 60 next turn to counter his probably bingo.
