>Quackle: CDEMOOU 8D DUOMO +20 20
>Mack: ??AADGY 7F GAYDArs +76 76
#note Lucky draw to start things off. This looks like the best of the bingos.
>Quackle: CCEINRT J7 .CENTRIC +70 90
>Mack: ADIIMNP 8L IMPI +29 105
>Quackle: EEFOOTT D3 FOOTE. +20 110
>Mack: AADNOSV E2 VANDA +33 138
>Quackle: EGHNNOT C4 THEN +24 134
>Mack: AELOOSU 11H OU.A +8 146
#note This unnecessarily gives too much back. I should just play something like K5 OUR or exchange.
>Quackle: FGINOQW H11 .WING +39 173
>Mack: DEELNOS 13C ELEDO.S.N +74 220
#note Yay!!!
>Quackle: FLOQRRV -FLOQRV +0 173
>Mack: EIKLLOS B6 KOEL +39 259
#note Didn't consider SKOL in the same spol for 8 more. It gives up the S, but there are two unseen and, with a big lead, it is better to avoid putting the E next to A8.
>Quackle: AGRRSYZ A7 ZA +52 225
>Mack: FIILRSW E10 WIF. +20 279
#note 10F FIL is another alternative. The two plays sim closely.
>Quackle: GIRRSUY 10E .IRY +25 250
>Mack: BHILRSX N8 .IX +28 307
#note This keeps 5 consonants, but if I can get one vowel I'll have a good play at D11 next turn, and I like how this closes bingo lanes on the right side. Quackle likes playing D11 BILL now, but I think I still like my play.
>Quackle: AGORSSU M10 AGRO +19 269
>Mack: BHLQRRS -BLQRR +0 307
#note No, Quackle, I'm definitely not keeping the Q here with 9I HERB. I liked keeping SH since I'll often be able to score well with the H next turn.
>Quackle: EEIJSSU 14E SEE. +24 293
>Mack: AEHLPST O4 HAPL.TES +79 386
#note I definitely wasn't expecting to bingo this turn, but I'll take it!
>Quackle: EIJLSUU N2 ULU +11 304
>Mack: AENRTTV 2K VAT. +7 393
#note Have to block bingos like JIBBERS and RIBIERS on row 1, hence not VERNAL or VENTRAL. I could have played VAU to prevent JABS, but he may very well not have JABS anyway and I'd rather keep only 3 consonants.
>Quackle: BEEIIJS 12D E. +14 318
>Mack: BENRRRT C13 .RR +3 396
#note Overcomplicated this endgame. L1 BARRE followed by 9I TERN is much much better than this Q-stick.
>Quackle: BEIIJQS L1 J.BS +42 360
>Mack: BENRT 4K E. +2 398
#note Blocking QIS while preserving 15A BRR.
