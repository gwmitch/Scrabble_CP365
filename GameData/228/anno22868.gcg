#note I could play GUY somewhere else, but I wanted to play it on column M to make it harder to score on column O.

#note This game very nearly became another endgame misadventure. See, I knew I had COALIER as an outplay and I was hoping he wouldn't block it.  I didn't think he'll see it because CEILOR just looks clunky and the board is closed.  I knew he'll play on column D because he has an O and it's sooo tempting to score there if you don't see your opponent's out. After he makes his play I do my calculations and I'm like "Dammit, I'm about to lose by 3..."   Thankfully, I remember that COALIER has two anagrams that will win me the game.  Whew! I made some pretty bad endgame plays in my day, but I think COALIER would have topped the list.
