#note dual-commented game (comments here are jesse's, matt's on matt's turn). Seth pointed out an interesting fact...2 vowel-1 consonant leaves are worse than often thought - usually improved by dumping the extra vowel. So keeping EN better than AEN on exchange. Q thinks I bingo enough next turn to make my play worthwhile.

#note A decision to be made between ALMUD and MAX. I had counted ALMUD as 33 and decided on MAX, but it's actually 39. Sim puts it ~2.5 points ahead. The X is fairly valuable on this board because of 5E and 3G, but there are also tons of bingo lines available and I don't really want to be stuck with nonbingo tiles. If I had counted ALMUD correctly, I think I would have played t.

#note I didn't notice HOWE 9F for 34, which wins the simulation by about a point. HOW 9F in the same spot and WHO 6F also sim slightly ahead of this.

#note Opens a bingo line in the 2 row that's hard for him to deal with withoug giving me a lot back.

#note Matt sez: He said after the game that it probably wasn't the right decision to open a 3x3 line here to score one more point, even if it's really improbable I can actually hit it. I think I agree. JD sez: the 1 point can't be worth it, I will almost be certain to burn equity to block the 3x3 later.
