>Jim_Burlant: ABEFFGY 8D BAFFY +38 38
#note This scores 40 at 8H, but I opted for this due to vowel placement.  Q says I should just take the 40 and not worry.  The duck notwithstanding, I'd play for 38 again.
>Linda_Villareal: IQ 9C QI +25 25
>Jim_Burlant: EEEGIOT 10B GITE +25 63
#note I didn't like the board position with this but felt that, with OGEE 9D having been blocked, this was the least objectionable of my options; this scored 25 where nothing else available scored more than 12.  Quackle doesn't entirely agree; it says I should play 10D OGEE, and it says this wins 1.4% less often and sims 3 points down.  Maybe so, but this worked out well.
>Linda_Villareal: CINO 7C CONI +22 47
>Jim_Burlant: EEGINOS 11E SOIGNEE +86 149
#note And then you fall head over tea kettle into greatness by drawing GINS to EEO.  This is my only bingo.  83% to win in a short sim.
>Linda_Villareal: DOY 10J YOD +30 77
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEIST G8 .E +6 155
#note I saw 9I plays like CATE and was scared of what they gave back at 8L, so I rejected them.  ACE 9H never occurred to me, but that's what I should have done apparently. This is lame, but I benefit from the mistake.  
>Linda_Villareal: AALV 9I LAVA +23 100
#note For the lower division players reading this game, this is why I knew not to put down something like CATE 9I on my previous turn:  
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIIST 8L CITE +36 191
#note At least I got this one right.  88% to win.
>Linda_Villareal: LL O8 .LL +3 103
>Jim_Burlant: AAIKRSW H11 .AWKS +42 233
#note Considered 6F KA and this; I chose this because I wanted to unload the W and turn 4 tiles instead of 2 with both blanks unseen.  Q says this sims with the highest valuation but KA wins a hair more often. That said, it's really stylistic preference:  KA wins just shy of 95%; this wins 94.5%. 
>Linda_Villareal: EZ 14F ZE. +36 139
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIORU N10 AUREI +18 251
#note Best.  Also worth consideraton:  15C UREA, B10 GIAOUR.
>Linda_Villareal: EJ 13M J.E +20 159
>Jim_Burlant: DELMOOO B10 .OLOM +16 267
#note Phony.  I saw GLOOM and for whatever reason I got needlessly paranoid about the vowel placement.  Against this opponent (she rates under 1300) I figured I could get away with this.  Instead of being a doofus, I needed to find MOJO M11.
>Linda_Villareal: HIT C13 HIT +26 185
>Jim_Burlant: BDEEORT 7M BED +23 290
#note Q likes 6F DEBTOR; I just saw this, saw that it didn't open up a whole lot, and balanced the rack.  Still 95% to win.

>Linda_Villareal: ?EGHORS 6M OH +32 217
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEIRT 6E AREnITE +71 403
#note ARIETTE also plays on this row, and the stylish ARSENITE plays on row 15.  Any of the bingos cross the line from 99% winning chances to 100%.
