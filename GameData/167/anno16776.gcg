#note VIC(U)GNA and CHEVYING are two words that I didn't know that play for 52 and 50 points, respectively. Neat!

#note Sim prefers (L)ETUP by about 2 points. I'd rather knock out spots. I also think this may pull a challenge.

#note I didn't know how to cope with this turn. Do I assume he misses CINEMAS again? Do I assume he finds AMNESIAC? Since this play seemed much better thna the rest of them, I decided to just play it and see if he would find one of his available bingos....
>Derek_Martinez: ACEIMNS 3B .MNESIAC +82 202
#note I shouldn't underestimate him!
>Matt_Canik: ABIIKLO D1 KI.O +26 326
#note Should I not play this just in case I get severely burned by the K? I have the game more or less in the bag at this point unless he gets a 90-100 point bingo, which is exactly what this play may give up. But it's a much stronger play than other options.
