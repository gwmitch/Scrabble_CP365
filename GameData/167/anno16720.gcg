#note TWERP is obviously better for leave, but WET blocks both spots. If she can't bing through the I, she's going to have trouble scoring.

#note Holy Moses!!! I didn't see anything for her at first, but there was a tingling in the back of my skull, and I decided to take a look at that ON. Thing is, I had mistracked an I, so I didn't immediately see EMISSI(ON)S. Fortunately, I saw the possibility, IF there were two Is, and I decided to retrack. Boom, I found it, and I blocked what would have been a winning bingo for her.

#note I hated this, and I ALMOST challenged, but I decided to take the time to look and see if she could score 20 with SEI, unlikely as it seemed, and I saw (R)ISE for 30 to win, if I challenged and loss.

Just like with Daniel Knag, I couldn't risk dropping the game, and I had to let myself get punked twice in the same tournament.
