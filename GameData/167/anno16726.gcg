#note I still have bandmate
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EGINORS I8 SIGNORE +70 185
#note So from Matthew's point of view I have a really good shot at a 3x3 this turn. Should he block it with something like GOR(M) or should he just go in guns blazing and play a bingo? And if so, which one should he go with. SIGNORE and IGNORES both bait me hooking an S, but SIGNORE sets up points (megahotspots) for Matthew next turn, as well as blocking a lot of non-3x3s through the M, therefore lowering my bingo % by a lot.
>Joshua_Sokol: ??DOOTZ 12H Z.OTy +46 82
#note I had less than 0 ideas on what to do here. Play ZOO(M) and be withing striking distance in 2 turns? Burn a blank with Z(O)OiD or Z(O)OTy?
