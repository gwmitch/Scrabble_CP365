#note Q says thsi is the best move....just feels like he's so close it feel like I should have played somewhere else.  I thought about I(N)TUIT which is 2nd best.  In hindsight it probably would have been better to clog up the board some more.  
>Rafi: ?AEIRRS L8 ARtSIER +71 285
>Brett: EIOOOTV 14L .OOT +8 270
#note Can I start whining about my tiles now?!?  Q calls for an 7 tile exchange.  Brilliant!  I don't know...trying to draw an M.

>Rafi: ELT 2B L.TE +8 387
#note Should have exchanged several times...just didn't think it would get worse.   And I suppose I was delusional thinking that I could get in a shootout with Rafi.  This is better than the 1st game I've played versus him at the California Open but I feel like there's room for improvement.
