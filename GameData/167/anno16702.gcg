#note I saw this immediately, but I debated a more defensive placement for all of 30 seconds. This is fine.
>bnjy99: BCEGINV E7 C.VING +24 24
#note VIBE maybe? However, that makes it super easy for me to kill the board.
>insidious: ?AEGIIW G7 W.IGElIA +67 149
>bnjy99: BEEIIUU -BIUU +0 24
#note Benjy exchanged BUUIIE, not BIUU.
>insidious: AAHKNOT F13 OKA +35 184
>bnjy99: DEEIOST 7E .O.ED +17 41
#note This was a creative play, but it would only give me an otherwise homeless bingo. :/
>insidious: AEEHMNT 6H METHANE +74 258
#note For some reason, this took me ages to find.
>bnjy99: AAEIRST O2 ATRESIA +87 128
>insidious: ?LOPQUX N8 POX +32 290
#note I missed the higher scoring POX. From here on out, even though I set a personal high score, I really didn't play all that well.
>bnjy99: CDEEILN M9 DECLINE +88 216
#note Benjy: Decline over lichened, because I need the extra volatility and points.
>insidious: ?ELNOQU 15H ELOQU.Nt +203 493
#note Yeah, and this happens. I also blocked his triple triple in the process. We call this dumb, dumb luck in Scrabble.
>bnjy99: AINPRST C7 P.RTISAN +78 294
#note Benjy: Partisan over the other, more open partisan because I no longer care about volatility, I'm not going to win.
>insidious: GHIMRRW M3 WRI.G +22 515
#note Second to WRIGH(T).
>bnjy99: EJLLSUY 12K JE.LY +38 332
>insidious: ADHIMRT B13 HIM +25 540
#note This isn't a great play, and while it's 4th on static, it sucks in the sim. But I was feeling psychic and knew I would hit ZA next turn!
>bnjy99: EELOSSU 5I LEU +22 354
#note Benjy: LEU to set up my case esses.
>insidious: ADFRTVZ A14 ZA +57 597
>bnjy99: BEOORSS L1 BROO +27 381
>insidious: DFORTUV 4F TURF +16 613
#note Completely missed the UDO hook. This play stinks.
>bnjy99: AEFRSSU D12 ARES +37 418
#note Challenging would have helped increase my personal best :)
>insidious: DDIOTV 5C DIVOT +22 635
>bnjy99: FSU 1J FU.S +9 427
#note This was a feel-good game, as I've never scored 600 live or online, besides a couple of blitz games and one casual live game that didn't matter. Especially given Benjy's prowess as a Scrabble player, this game means a lot! Unfortunately, pure luck paved the way for this one rather than good, deserving play.
