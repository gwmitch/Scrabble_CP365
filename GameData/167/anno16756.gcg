#note As I suspected, Quackle hates BEING, but I think the play makes it very difficult for a 1200 opponent to bingo.

#note Okay, this was unexpected, with so many vowels in the bag, that I'd draw none. I could actually lose this game because of this.

#note I feel better, with both blanks, but I could STILL lose the game, since I missed the bing through the E, if he slams me at 15A, with EYE or EYED. I consider playing the T there to forestall that, but I decided the six extra points were more valuable.

#note Interestingly, Quackle does not favour the bingo. It says that (MOW)N, (ME)L, (HI)N, (ME)N, and (O)N all win, but that would assume that no matter what he does to blog, I can bingo. Maybe that's true. It's too time-consuming to work that out.
