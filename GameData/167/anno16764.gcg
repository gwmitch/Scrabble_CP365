>Mike_Early: OPP 8G POP +14 14
#note Context: this is round 6.  I have already clinched the tournament win and, having been gibsonized, I'm just playing for the win and rating boost, period.  In this particular game, spread is irrelevant.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILNR J5 ALIENER +69 69
#note Luck box!  While this only scores 69 (the 9D placement scores 71)  I chose this for the board position; not only does it take away the easy E back hook to POP, it also doesn't give back huge plays at 8A.  Quackle agrees:  this is best.
>Mike_Early: EKX K3 KEX +46 60
>Jim_Burlant: ?AMUWYY L2 YAM +30 99
#note Yikes!  How do you even begin to clean this out?  I saw the I3 plays and didn't like what they gave back, even if I did have counters to play at H1 for the next turn.  I figued that no matter how I sliced it, it was going to take a long time to clean this garbage up, so I might as well take the extra points.  Quackle disagrees, saying I3 YAW or YUM were the plays.
>Mike_Early: OOT M1 OOT +25 85
>Jim_Burlant: ?RRSUWY H7 W.RRY +11 110
#note Too much rack grooming.  I need to burn the blank here with something like N2 WARY or N2 USURY.  Still in good shape but not adding much to my winning chances - still treading water at 70%.
>Mike_Early: AQT I3 QAT +32 117
>Jim_Burlant: ?AOSTUW N2 WAT +38 148
#note FAIL.  I saw OUTLAWS and OUTWARS but couldn't think of WASHOUT.  I did see OUTSWEAR 9A but passed it  up. WAShOUT plays at N2 for 98 and is clearly best.  If you whiff on WASHOUT this is next best, and it's clearly better in the sim than OUTSWeAR.  Of note:  WORRYWArT H7.
>Mike_Early: AI G11 AI +7 124
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEMOSU F9 UMBO +24 172
#note Saw EMBOLUS but chickened out on it and didn't know UMBONES.  Best would have been BESOM O1.  Again, just too much rack grooming going on.  This is bad.
>Mike_Early: AEFRT O4 AFTER +30 154
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIOOS 13G DOOlIES +76 248
#note Any number of choices here - ISODOSE 12I, OSTEOID 12I, DOODIES, DOOZIES...all score 74 - 76 and they all win within 1/2% of each other.  88% to win.
>Mike_Early: RU H13 .UR +9 163
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGNNV L8 AVENG.D +26 274
#note Now the strategy is simple:  empty the bag as quickly as possible whle playing into his easiest lines.  This is best.
>Mike_Early: IV 10D VI. +8 171
>Jim_Burlant: EHIILNO D10 .IOLIN +20 294
#note HOVEL scores 30 but that gives him lines for an easy 7.  This turns 5 tiles as well as killing both the D column and row 15.  Quackle agrees - this is best.
>Mike_Early: ?CEIRST 4B CISTERn. +68 239
#note Best bingo for Mike, but it's still very bleak for him:  he's 4% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEFGHU 3C HEED +33 327
#note Late day fatigue setting in.  HUED does the same thing and unloads the U.  At this point the difference is just equity - I'm still 95% to win.
>Mike_Early: EJO 15A JEO. +33 272
>Jim_Burlant: CFGILNU 14B FL.NG +38 365
>Mike_Early: BE D1 BE.. +9 281
>Jim_Burlant: ACINTUU 1B CU.IT +9 374
#note Not even one of the original choices, this percolates to the top of the sim.
>Mike_Early: IS 1B .....IS +33 314
#note I knew CUBITI but wasn't sure about the S hook.  Sitting on the Z with the win in hand, I wasn't worried about coughing up spread since I'd already clinched the tournament.
