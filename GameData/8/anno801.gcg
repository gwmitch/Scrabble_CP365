#note  completely missed INURBANE.  The next best play I think is URBIA @ 6H

#note  I was starting to get frustrated with these close-but-no-cigar racks.  This might not be best, but it opened things up.  Had this been an open U, I would have had NUCLEOLI.

#note Quackle likes thi play, but FEST/SCALL for 40 seems tempting.  This is where I could have thrown away the game.  I started to miss my 4s to make 5s hooks.  S front hooks that is.
>Dan_T: ENP 7C PE.N +11 325
>Brett_H: DEENSST J1 TEDS +19 344
#note now I have two S front hooks I completely missed.  DENSEST could have played making SCALL or SPEAN and I didn't even register them.  Embarrassing.  That being said, TEDS seems like the best non-bingo play because it blocks his QIs play.
