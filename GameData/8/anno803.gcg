#note  Why am I so bad at finding these basic bingos.  UNTIDIER is the play.

#note  at this point, somehow I managed to keep things close and figured that a bingo would be the nailin my coffin.  The R seemed to be the most probable lane despite the fact that there were 2 S's unseen.  Plus, look at that crap.

#note  Missed EUDAEMON.  He was blabbering on about how he wanted to play UNWEAVED*, but ended up thinking better of it.
>Brett_H: KOS 4E SOK. +15 390
#note  the play here is S(O)OK=18.  Surprisingly close considering all of my missed opportunities.  Al should probably consider fishing about half as much as he does.
