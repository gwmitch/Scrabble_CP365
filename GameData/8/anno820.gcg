#note 11J FOH 23 scores a bit less but has a strong leave.  sets up a big comeback play though.  best is 12D OFTEN 39.  leave is not great but maybe i need to focus on scoring at this point.

#note very risky play, but it has the highest win%.  was very worried that i had neither the blank or one of the four available esses.  she must have had something to play on the triple and i wanted to make it a little more difficult to take it.  also, if she hits the triple, she'll likely open up a bingo line.
