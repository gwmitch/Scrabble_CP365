#note This didn't seem right.  Maybe I was thinking of GLEG or the primitive Pink Floyd song "Corporal Clegg" (whose wooden leg made rhyming easy for the band).  An overlapping COTE or COLE is better, and can't be challenged off.

#note I missed ANTINOME

#note Quackle actually likes this play.  I ran ~19000 iterations of a 4 ply sim of the top 50 suggestions and this finished second to 15K DOOR which seems way to risky given that no Ss or ?s have been played.

#note A6 HARMONY is much better.  Otherwise, I like keeping the H to play at 11E.
>Jeremy: HRT E8 R.TH +28 236
#note so much for 11E
>Dave: ABEHNRT 15H BRA. +27 297
#note I wasn't in love with this play.  1000 iterations of a 2 ply sim and Quackle gives an edge to 15F THREAD, n2 BATHE, A7 BEMOAN, N1 BERTHA, amd 15G BREAD.  I guess with so many unseen vowels, I shouldn't worry about playing all of mine.
>Jeremy: OP C4 OP +11 247
>Dave: DEHILNT E4 EH +30 327
#note I didn't like this at the time either.  Since, I didn't know ETHMOID or HEMOID, E3 EDH looks best.
>Jeremy: EGQS 5K SQ.EG +30 277
>Dave: CDEILNT A7 DE..NIC +39 366
#note A4 CENTIMO scores a little better, but I'm happy with this.
>Jeremy: AEINZ C11 AZINE +34 311
>Dave: ??ALRTW 15A TR.W +33 399
#note I always forget which of TREW*, WERT, TREWS, WERTS* needs the S.  When I plaed DEMONIC, I saw the AL hook.  Then Jeremy joked about playing it.  I was relieved he didn't, and then failed to see I had it.  Weird sequence...
>Jeremy: IO 6J .OI. +19 330
>Dave: ??ALUUX N2 LUX. +22 421
#note I like LUXE here.  It drops one of the Us, scores some points, and opens a new lane that only I should be able to exploit.
>Jeremy: AEEGIIL 13E AGILE +13 343
>Dave: ??AEISU 2G EUSocIA. +56 477
#note I played this pretty quickly and didn't bother looking for other bingos.  There are 9 more, and 8 score 2 more points.  To be honest I would have had a hard time finding the other plays with only a minute left on my clock.
