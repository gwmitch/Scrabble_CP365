#note Quackle doesn't like this move much, and I have to agree. TARRY (4K) or FRAY (6K) seem quite a bit better.

#note Fishing off an I with QI is a better choice here - bingo chances with any other vowel draw.

#note I might have tried EYE (F10) to open things up.
>Bing: AEILORT I7 A.OL +15 250
#note Now OI (F10) is a clear favorite, holding the case L.

#note WOE (J9) would seem to be indicated, but there's something to be said for turnover, with 2 blanks and 3 more S's still unseen.

#note I guess this was to set up BATTU, but I think keeping the U is asking for trouble.

#note (Challenged off). A characteristic thrust. Never one to give up without a fight, Jerry tries to conjure up a way to win. I had to think twice before challenging, since GENS (N1) would win, but I was confident it was no good.
