#note FAKEER was new to me but was too plausible to worry about challenging.

#note Quackle gives AFOOT a slight edge here

>Dave: ACGOOST 4J .OG +14 135
#note Quackle give C1 COOTS a slight edge over C7 GO, with my play alittle behind.  I'm not crazy about COOTS, but like GO as it opens a new line and doesn't put two vowels next to a DWS
>Andrew: JO C7 JO +38 207
>Dave: AACLOST F2 COAT +19 154
#note I can't believe I missed COASTAL.  I don't think I even looked for a bingo.

>Dave: ABEELSV C2 BEL +22 176
#note Quackle give K3 VOE a slight edge over the rest of the pack in 2 ply sim.  I don't think my bingo knowledge is good enough to discern much of a difference between leaves of AEVS and ABELS.

#note Quackle seems to like C1 OBELI about as well as GOONIE.  The leave doesn't seem that much better.  I'm not sure what to think of this.
>Andrew: DIMR O8 MIR.D +35 317
>Dave: ?ADISSW O1 WIS +28 345
#note I really like WIS or WAS here.  I see no need to take the extra 19 points with 15L WISS since I have all the remaining Ss and ?s.  However, 3000 iterations of a many ply sim have WIS trailing B1 WAD, G3 WAS, G3 WIS, and 15L WISS by a % point or two (97.50 - 95.42).  I guess I like WAD since it keeps my options open if I don't draw into a bingo.
