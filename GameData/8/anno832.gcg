>Brett: AIJO 8G JIAO +22 22
>Dave: CCEHINS J7 C.NCH +18 18
#note I didn't known CONCHIES or CHICANES.  Quackle doesn't think too highly of CONCH.  9I HIC looks best.
>Brett: AGU G8 .UGA +13 35
>Dave: EIIRRST 11E RI. +6 24
#note RIA looks much better than I thought it would.  HI, RIG, and THIR are just slightly better in a quick 2 ply sim.  
>Brett: DEIINNU E7 INDU.INE +59 94
#note This wasn't familiar at all, but I'm shaky on my 8s.  He was most likely thinking of INDULINE.
>Dave: EIRRRST 14D T.RRIERS +62 86
#note I didn't know STIRRER which is OK given Brett may have challenged INDURINES*.
>Brett: AERWY 13I WEARY +43 137
>Dave: ?DFLOOT F1 FOOTLeD +65 151
#note I didn't known TWOFOLD, FLOODLIT, or FOLDOUT.

>Brett: AQ D12 QA. +48 214
>Dave: AEEFKUV 1F .AUVE +33 273
#note I forgot about AWEARY and missed KAIF for 60.
>Brett: DLLO 2J DOLL +16 230
>Dave: EEFKSTW 15A KEFS +50 323
#note This was my backup plan if he blocked FEWEST.  I should have looked more as I missed 15H FEET, N7 WEEK, and 15H FEST.  I never saw the T hook on HAS, only the P and H.  
>Brett: GNU M2 .UNG +10 240
>Dave: BEEITWY N1 BYTE +40 363
#note This is just one of those games, where I can miss the best play and still do well.  WYTE is much better here.
>Brett: ANOPT 15K PANTO +33 273
>Dave: DEEIOWX N9 EX +54 417
>Brett: EGV M7 VEG +21 294
>Dave: ADEIIOW 8A ADOW. +39 456
#note The leave sucks, but it scores so much more than anything with a pretty leave.
>Brett: BEIMOOT 4C BOT.OM +26 320
>Dave: ?EIIINP B10 PINIt. +26 482
#note I looked to see if there was some magical play that would block all 4 of his Z plays.  I should have at least blocked his best one.  I like Quackle's solution of 7A zIN followed by 5D PILEI (a word I always seem to miss over the board).
