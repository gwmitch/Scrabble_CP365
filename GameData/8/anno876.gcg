>Jeremy: AEIORSY F6 YO.A +16 16
#note Best.  YOGI gives up the N hook.

>Sue: IQ 9C QI +25 47
>Jeremy: EEILRSV 10F SERVILE +75 91
#note Best.  LIVENERS and SNIVELER also play.

>Sue: FHO 11J FOH +32 79
>Jeremy: EEEOORU C9 .UEER +28 119
#note Best.  OURE(BI) is also better than trading.
>Sue: ADW E5 WAD. +24 103
>Jeremy: EEFIOOP D3 POOF +32 151
#note 2nd best.  H10 ROOFIE is best.
>Sue: AAT 3B TA.A +12 115
>Jeremy: DEEEIIT H10 .ETIED +24 175
#note Best, just about tied with REEDIT.

#note Missed SATIRIZE.  Got 2nd best.

#note Best.

>Jeremy: ?EIIIJL H6 JI. +10 256
#note Best. Barely.  JIN also plays F12.  Exch IIJ and IIIJL are close.
>Sue: OW 6H .OW +21 235
>Jeremy: ?DEEIIL K4 DELI +24 280
#note I saw the bag was low on E's, so I picked up EDILE.  Quackle thinks EDILE is better by 0.01% in win percentage.  I disagree.  I don't want to give you and E to bingo through, and leave myself E-less.  Either way it's very close.

#note Best.

>Jeremy: AAEHNRT 1H AH +26 368
#note 1G RATHE 41 pts. wins 100%.  My move is a fishing play to see if I can squeeze out another bingo, but it puts me down to 92.81% to win.  8th from best.
>Sue: ?IMNTUX B6 Xu +50 345
>Jeremy: AENPRTU 3L .U +8 376
#note My play wins 100% but is 3rd best.  9L PA is best by 9 points, and M2 NU is also better.  With the unseen tile pool TUNER must draw more bingos -- however in reality -- if I empty the bag, you know exactly what I have and can block my bingo lane.  I like my play keeping ARPENT as a backup if I can't bingo. 
>Sue: BDR M2 B.RD +15 360
>Jeremy: AEINPRT 15J ARPENT +35 411
#note N1 PINE for 30 lets me score more total points keeping ART.  I went for too many points in my first turn rather than spacing them out in 2 turns.  Just 5 points lost.
