>Dave: EHKLRTZ 8H HERTZ +54 54
>Brett: AFY 7G FAY +31 31
>Dave: EHIIIKL K8 .IKI +16 70
#note Quackle prefers several plays with double-I leaves: KHI, HEIL, HIKE.  I'm just not that brave.  K5 KILTIE (which I don't know) is just asking for trouble.
>Brett: ACJ 10H JAC. +23 54
>Dave: AEFHILQ 6F QI +36 106
>Brett: GOW 11G WOG +19 73
>Dave: AAEFHLO 12D HALO +19 125
#note I think I overvalue Es.  AEF isn't a great leave.  Quackle seems to think 12F FOE, 12E FLOE, and 12E ALOE are best.
>Brett: ?DELRST 5G DaRTLES +71 144
>Dave: AEFOPRT 11D OF +25 150
>Brett: IMTY 4L MITY +36 180
>Dave: AEPRSTW O1 WAR. +30 180
#note WARY isn't good here.  Better plays include G11 WOW, 13E TAW, 13G WAP, and O4 YAWPER (which I didn't know).
>Brett: ADN 13E DAN +21 201
>Dave: EIOPSTV 14B PIVOTS +46 226
#note I missed 14E OPT for 37.  I like adding the S for an extra 9 points since it doesn't give him a S play on the triple line (though I could use it if he didn't).  WONS won me a challenge.
>Brett: BELNRSV -  +0 201
>Dave: EINNSTV 15A VET +24 250
#note I didn't really like VET but didn;t see 3I VINES.  I also didn't like what 2L VENA did to the board.
>Brett: CINTU L11 TUNIC +22 223
>Dave: AGINNSX 15K A.ING +24 274
#note 1250 iterations of a 2 ply sim of the top 50 suggestions give a slight edge to 14J AXING, but I'd like to keep the X for 3M.
>Brett: EEEMU J1 EMEU.E +16 239
#note Poor Brett is struggling through more crappy racks.
>Dave: EENNRSX 3L EX +43 317
#note I didn't see 14K NIXE which sims about the same.
>Brett: II -II +0 239
>Dave: ENNRRSS 12L .RN +3 320
#note I like this play.  It finishes as a close second to 1H SNEER in a 4000 iteration 4 ply sim of the top 50 suggestions.  If he bingos, I have another TWS bingo lane available, and the leave is about the best I can hope for here.  
>Brett: AABGNOR 13B AA +15 254
>Dave: ?BENRSS 1E BaREN.SS +80 400
#note The only playable bingo!
>Brett: BEGNORU 13K O.E +10 264
>Dave: BEOOPRU 2B BOOER +25 425
#note I wasn't positive but thought this was good.  COOER and WOOER are the only two words of this form.  I also keep thinking MOOER* is good, but no, it's ROMEO.
>Brett: ADEGLNU 3A LADEN +29 293
>Dave: DEILPUU 15H UPL..... +39 464
#note There are so many bizarre UP- words, that I thought it might be good.  There was really no need for this.  That said, I did help convince Brett to challnge it.  J13 DUP is best.
>Dave: DEILPUU --  -39 425
>Brett: GIO 1A GO +14 307
>Dave: DEILPUU 10B DUP +18 443
#note J13 DUP is still best.
