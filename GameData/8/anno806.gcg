>Bing: CEEIILP 8D CEILI +20 20
#note PIECE scores 4 more points, but takes many hooks and has a weaker leave. I didn't think of PILEI, which sims slightly higher.
>Jerry: BEIMRS E5 BIR.MES +44 44
>Bing: DEEPTTU 11C UP.ETTED +61 81
#note An intentional phoney. PUTTED (D10) is the normal play, but I thought this had a decent chance of success. 
>Jerry: GORR 6D R.GOR +10 54
>Bing: ?AFINNN 10I FANNINg +73 154
>Jerry: EKOR H11 .ROKE +30 84
>Bing: AEINTUV O8 VA.UE +24 178
#note Probably better to take the points with NAIVER (H1), as the G in the triple lane is not all that dangerous.
>Jerry: HRTZ F10 H.RTZ +58 142
>Bing: FINNOTT I13 FIN +27 205
#note Weak move. FINITO (M9) is much better, both for leave and blocking bingo lines. 
>Jerry: AX 9L AX +36 178
>Bing: DHNNOTT C9 HO.ND +26 231
>Jerry: J 10B J. +25 203
>Bing: ENOTTWY 7G WENT +25 256
#note This was attractive since it blocked the last likely bingo line, and left few places to score.
>Jerry: DIPU 13M PUD +21 224
#note (Challenged off VAGUED*) I think Jerry forgot what the blank was.
>Jerry: DIPU --  -21 203
>Bing: IOOTTYY 12A YO.I +30 286
>Jerry: DIPU B12 .I +5 208
>Bing: ELOSTTY 14H ..LTY +14 300
#note I figured that Jerry must be fishing for something through EN, but there was a better way to block: ANOLYTE (L9). 
>Jerry: DGPU L12 GU. +14 222
>Bing: EEEOOST 15L SOOT +24 324
#note Seemed like either this or exchange, but I missed EIDE (13A).
>Jerry: AAA -AAA +0 222
>Bing: EEEEORS 8J OE +4 328
#note EIDE sims best here too, but OE made it almost impossible to bingo.
>Jerry: OP M12 OP +19 241
>Bing: ADEEERS A12 .ARE +25 353
>Jerry: AG F4 GA. +9 250
>Bing: BDEELQS 14N BE +18 371
#note Quackle says to pass the Q while I still can, but I'm glad I didn't.
