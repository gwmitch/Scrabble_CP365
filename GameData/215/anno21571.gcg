#note Had I known NOILY, JOINT is best. Front hooks to OILY are: DNR (oily doner, perhaps?). Instead my play is just wrong.

>JDalt: EINPRTY --  -32 62
#note TYIN is probably best. I thought about TYE, but didn't like the back E hook. So I went with a phony instead. Idiot!

#note Now my spot is gone, and I have to settle for leftovers. The whole game hinged on last turn.

#note I may have held here, thinking about the cosmos. But it really has to do with the ocean.
>JDalt: ACEIPRT K10 ARC +15 89
#note I was too fixated on PICRATE which doesn't play. I failed by not knowing/seeing PARETIC. I should know that; maybe not APyRETIC, but that played too. Instead I waste my turn. If I don't see the bingoes, maybe CHILI is best, given the leave.

#note Felt pretty good about this, but wish I had known TWEEP. POTTAGE is also worthy of consideration here.

#note the dagger

#note Wow. I missed another bingo here. I guess I wasn't strong on the AEII 8s.
