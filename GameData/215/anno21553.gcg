#note erm. nice draw
>Panupol: AEGMZ K6 ZE.GMA +36 36
#note I wonder how far off of ADVENTURISM he was?
>JD: AEHINRS 12F NEARISH +91 155
#note erm. nice draw again
>Panupol: GKWY H11 G.WKY +48 84
>JD: ?EIQSTU N2 pIQUETS +91 246
#note lol. I'm the absolute worst. given the chance to score 283 points in 3 turns, I whiff on MESQUITE and play PIQUETS. I was too focused on trying to get the Q on the TWS. still mesquite is such an easy find! : (

#note fantastic play to open the board - after coumarin, he can play through the C and have a forked board with multiple bingo lanes (he also still has -ING bingos on row 11)
>JD: DEFFHOR 4J HOD +29 298
#note I felt like I couldn't do much about panupol's opening, but master chef james himself comes up with the great suggested of COFFEE at H3, leaving the board neatly blocked and a 138 point lead. I love it.

#note perhaps it's an overreaction to block the S hook, but it does cut his bingo percentage from 25% to 11-12% if I infer a leave of ES after his last play of AZO. FIBRE at J11 to allow the possiblity of EX- plays on row 15 is a nice idea, but I like my move.
>Panupol: AEEGPRS 1A PRESAGE. +89 273
#note hmm, we have a game...
>JD: BEEFIIR 2C FIE +15 360
#note I thought FIE was decent, but his bingo percentage remains pretty high, probably because of the -ING bingos he can hit. I initially didn't like quackle's top suggestion of KIBEI, but panupol will not score that many points in reply, and I get to turn over more new letters and perhaps be able to block more effectively next turn. FREEBIE at 4B is also not a terrible choice.
>Panupol: BINUY 6C BUNYI. +21 294
#note cool new word. I guess he didn't want to block the G by playing BUYING.
>JD: ABDEILR 4A RIDEABL. +74 434
#note lucky draw. also did anyone know DICOUMARIN??
>Panupol: AILSTTV 6J ...T. +14 308

#note in spite of my atrocious miss of mesquite, I'd done enough to finish first during swiss play! huzzah!
