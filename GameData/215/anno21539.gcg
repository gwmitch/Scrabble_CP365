#note I spotted SYMPATRY, but unfortunately chickened out of it, although after the game it looked like a perfectly fine word.

#note I thought long and hard about fishing with this rack, but I didn't like my chances of hitting given how closed the board was. My best short play is probably DE at 7C (he may think I have an O and be less likely to block). assuming a blocking play on row 3, my bingo percentage would only be about 60%. at the end of the day I think it's a tossup.

>JD: ?EMORSX N8 .XOSpERM +86 243
#note colossal error, lucky to get away with it! EXODERMS is the real word in this rack, I knew there was a bingo from the E somewhere in this rack but didn't take the time to find the real word!
>Joel_Sherman: ADU 15L DU.A +27 247
>JD: ACEHOOR N2 HERO +33 276
#note I spent a long time on the turn when I played VINED and for some reason completely whiffed on OOH at N4 on this turn, which keeps much more valuable letters and doesn't give back as many easy plays!!
>Joel_Sherman: AIKOT L1 KATIO. +32 279
>JD: AACIIOT M8 .OTA +19 295
#note I thought I was likely beat after KATION, if he plays to the K next turn it will be hard to keep up with him on points (he also blocked my best scoring play of CATION at the same spot). Then I missed OI at G2 which scores almost as much and keeps better rack balance.
>Joel_Sherman: IPRW 13K WIP.R +20 299
>JD: ABCEIIT 1H BATI. +33 328
#note lucky draw
>Joel_Sherman: EORS I4 RO.ES +24 323
#note possibly a nice play, trying to keep up with scoring and hope that I draw an ungainly rack, instead of fishing on a dead board and allowing me to block.
>JD: CEFHINQ L12 Q. +22 350
#note after BATIK I had an amazing FHIN draw, drawing almost all of the remaining useful multiple-point consonants.
>Joel_Sherman: ADW C5 WAD +22 345
#note nice play, sets up good scoring plays on column B without giving me any counterplay.
>JD: CEFHIIN 10C FI.E +12 362
#note deceptively tricky play, he set himself up for a big play of COUDE and I must out-in-two without giving him a big scoring reply. fortunately, I found my best play under time pressure. In fact, if he plays COED or CODE I get huge counter plays on column A, so he can barely use B6 at all.
>Joel_Sherman: ACDEEOU C10 .ACED +22 367
#note worse by 4 points than FACE or FEUED because it gives me lots of points for HIC. It took him awhile to realize that he couldn't play CODE (he was also low on time) and so he went over by 2 minutes.
>JD: CHIN I10 INCH +15 377
#note I'm supposed to play HIC at B13, but I took the sure win under time pressure.
>JD:  (EOU) +6 383
