>Josh: CDEENOS 13H SECONDE. +76 123
#note lol we both doubted SECONDER and SECONDEE
>Avery: AADGIVY L11 DI.GY +28 176

>Avery: ?IOORTU M3 ROU. +8 289

>Josh: ?ALNOST 3C T.OLANdS +66 353
#note He regretted not doing ORTOLANS
>Avery: ?AIILRT 8A sALI.IT. +39 368
#note Nothing wins very often, and the highest rated ones are at 1/8. I feel like this wins more often than Quackle says though. My computer is so slow and can't run simulations but 100 iterations says this is actually first
>Josh: AAACLNO H1 NA.A +15 368
#note The best endgame here is sick! We both found the same one though aside from 15A CALO (which is second)

>Josh:  (R) +2 394
#note Somehow we lost 10 points for Josh, so the recorded score was 375-384
