>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: AHLOR 8D HOLAR +24 24
#note My first thought was "that's not a word." Then I psyched myself out of challenging because I couldn't imagine why Panupol would open with a phony five.
>Charles_Reinke: CEFINTV D4 FINC. +26 26
#note Pretty close between VETC(H), FITC(H), and FINC(H).
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: AFQR 5A FAQ.R +34 58
>Charles_Reinke: EHILSTV A5 .ILTH +33 59
#note I thought this was an obvious play but 6B HI(N) is better. ELSTV is a pretty good leave with the A to play through.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ?EGIINY H8 .EIfYING +95 153
>Charles_Reinke: AEISUVX B9 EXUVIA +69 128
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: OOPRSTU I2 UPROOTS +72 225
#note HOLAR* bites me again. OOPRSTU doesn't bingo anywhere else on the board.
>Charles_Reinke: ?ACGIMS 4H o.GASMIC +80 208
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: INW C9 WIN +34 259
>Charles_Reinke: DILNOOU 15A OLIO +32 240

>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ADEIRTT N6 ATTIRED +79 364
>Charles_Reinke: EEGMORZ M9 GOMER +38 361
#note Sets up the Z and also leaves the K3 Z spot open. Just playing M9 ZERO for 55 crossed my mind, but not for long.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: OPW L12 WOP +32 396
>Charles_Reinke: EELNSSZ 3K ZEES +49 410
#note I can play ZEES at F2 for 51 but I figured that scoring spot might come in handy later.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: NY K3 ..NY +32 428
>Charles_Reinke: DEKLNRS 15L SKED +40 450
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ABOT K10 BOAT +23 451
>Charles_Reinke: ADEELNR 12B .END +23 473
#note I had five minutes on my clock and I blew it. J9 RAND/LAND win. I didn't think I could score enough points over there so I didn't even look. 12D ADEN(Y)L will tie.
