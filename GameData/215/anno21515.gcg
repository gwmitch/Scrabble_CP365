>Joey_Krafchick: ADEERRT H6 RETREAD +70 70
>Charles_Reinke: CGILTUY 6F CU.LY +24 24
#note Charles: I'm liking LITU(R)GY here.
>Joey_Krafchick: AAENOST F5 O.A +5 75
#note Charles: With this play, I figure my hopes of cashing are toast.
>Charles_Reinke: GINOTUX 5D OX. +20 44
#note Charles: I thought RETREAD was only a noun. RETREADING would have been nice. RETROD+ is new.
>Joey_Krafchick: ADENSTU 13F UNSATED +69 144
>Charles_Reinke: AAGINTU 4A TAIGA +29 73
#note Charles: I think this play is okay since I need some big scores, and soon, to stay in the game. Opening up triples in a wanton fashion is one way to score points.
>Joey_Krafchick: BFILLOP B2 FL.IL +20 164
#note Joey: I was being paranoid and made myself block the 3x3. I chose this because it leaves the P to score a lot at the 14F spot, and it's somewhat hard to score in that region now. BIFOL(D) is the best play equity wise, but this is a cash game so I'm being scared
>Charles_Reinke: EEENNSU 12K NEE +14 87
#note Charles: L11 EN(D)UE? Maybe a little TOO risky.
>Joey_Krafchick: BEOOPRY 14B REBOP +40 204
#note Joey: POBOY 11J is nice too but this is the play.
>Charles_Reinke: AEINSUW 3E WAIN +21 108
#note Charles: There's a lot of I's in the bag, I didn't want to keep mine.
>Joey_Krafchick: FGHOOVY 15E FOGY +43 247
>Charles_Reinke: ?DEESUZ 15A ZED +44 152
#note Charles: I missed DEFUZES and SQUEEZED, both for large enough scores that they would be justified.
>Joey_Krafchick: ?DHOQTV 11G Q.T +12 259
#note Joey: This took out a meaty lane, and I'm worried leaving QV? play DOTH. 
>Charles_Reinke: ?EIJSTU H1 JU. +30 182
#note Charles: Correctly passing on JESUIT(R)y, maybe I can draw JAROSITE or something.
>Joey_Krafchick: ?DHNOVV M9 HOV. +14 273
#note Joey: 2F HO(U)ND leaves VV?....no thanks
>Charles_Reinke: ?EIMOST A6 ExOTISM +85 267
>Joey_Krafchick: ?ADEINV L4 INVADEd +80 353
>Charles_Reinke: ABEIIOR K1 ORIBI +22 289
>Joey_Krafchick: CIKORST C10 CORK.. +26 379
#note Joey: Trying to make sure he doesn't bingo
>Charles_Reinke: AEEINNU 2J U.INE +14 303
#note Charles: Last-ditch attempt at drawing a bingo starting in S.
>Joey_Krafchick: IPRSSTW O1 PSI +21 400
>Charles_Reinke: AAEGHMN 14L HANG +23 326
>Joey_Krafchick: ELRSTW J8 TEWS +28 428
>Charles_Reinke: AEM O12 MA.E +30 356
>Charles_Reinke:  (LR) +4 360
#note Charles: 360 was my lowest score of the tournament. Will I ever again have a Nationals where I fail to have a bad game? Probably not.
