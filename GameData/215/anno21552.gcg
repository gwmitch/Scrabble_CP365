#description Joe Edley plays Jesse Day in Round 20 at the 2015 NSC
>Joe: HORTTTU 8H TRUTH +24 24
>Jesse: ?AAENUV K3 AVAUN. +18 18
#note a stellar start to this encounter with joe edley, as I thought of EVACUANT but then dismissed the possibility that it would be a word...no idea why, seems pretty normal now
>Joe: EFNOOOT H2 FOOTNO.E +62 86
>Jesse: ?EEEGIV 4K .IVE +20 38
#note yikes, two missed bingos in two turns. this time I looked for ING bingos, and even thought of ENVEIGLE#, but did not consider the anagram...this is also just kind of a weak play, I like the aggressiveness of VEGIE at 4K, especially against a player as defensive-minded as Joe.
>Joe: EEFPSTY N1 TEP.FY +44 130
>Jesse: ?DEEGJW 1L JE.E +57 95
>Joe: ELLOOSS 10E LOOS +18 148
#note quackle likes OLE at 2L a lot on this play, which makes a considerable amount of sense
>Jesse: ?DDGNUW G9 W.UND +24 119
>Joe: ?AEILMS E5 SELAM.Ik +86 234
#note sweet play
>Jesse: ?DGINOS 14A cODINGS +84 203
>Joe: AABHORT A9 ABROA.H +36 270
#note I think TORAH might be a better play for joe here, opening a less good bingo lane - but he was in his zone and playing fast.
>Jesse: ABEMOPX F4 BOX +55 258
#note ABEM may be a slightly stronger combo than AEMP. minor difference
>Joe: ACEQRRT 6J Q.ER. +37 307
>Jesse: AEEGMNP I2 AMP +26 284
#note not an awful spot, tons of Is in the pool to hopefully draw an -ING bingo on column B. but actually the -ING is a bit of a red herring, GAMP sims solidly better than AMP (EEN bingos just as much as EEGN). Can also score more with PREE at I7 keeping AGMN, which also bingos just as often. a pretty counter-intuitive move to me in general.
>Joe: AACRSTW 13A .WA +23 330
>Jesse: EEEGILN I8 .EE +16 300
>Joe: ACIRSTY M8 SATYRIC +85 415
#note yeow
>Jesse: DEGILNT B3 TINGLED +66 366
>Joe: CGIIKLZ 14J CLI.K +38 453
>Jesse: AEIINRR 12I AIRE. +10 376
#note blocking GRIZ, saving an out. the best play that does these things is RIA at N9. I am not sure why I didn't just play this at 12K.
>Joe: DEGIUZ C9 ZIG +46 499
>Jesse: INR C2 RIN +12 388
#note nice win by joe, surely quite a different game if I find EVACUANT or LEVEEING.
>Jesse:  (DEU) +8 396
