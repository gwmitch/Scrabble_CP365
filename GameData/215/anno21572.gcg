>Charles_Reinke: HIIOORT H8 ORTHO +18 18
#note Charles: This scores the most but II really sucks. THIO is better but for some reason I didn't see it.
>Rafi_Stern: AEEFILN 9C FLANE.IE +67 67
#note Charles: I have played Rafi at each of the last five nationals. Rafi thinks this is some kind of personal record.

>Charles_Reinke: BDGHIQU E7 QU.IGH +38 190
>Rafi_Stern: ADDIRTT D12 ADIT +22 153
#note Rafi: Pool is almost 50% vowels, so DRT is a better leave than normal. I saw and rejected DIKTAT... I think I was worried about running out of lanes. I bingo 29% after ADIT vs. 20% after DIKTAT, but I'm also giving back more points to either Charles or Thomas. Quackle prefers DIKTAT.
>Charles_Reinke: ?AABDGO 15D .AGBOArD +83 273
#note Rafi: What happens when you don't play DIKTAT.
>Rafi_Stern: ADEORST M2 ROASTED +80 233
#note Rafi: Is it worth sacrificing 2 points to set up BROASTED and to avoid putting a vowel next to the double? Perhaps going for ZEIN or JEER or something is what I need.
>Charles_Reinke: ?CEEFIU F4 FUCI +26 299
#note Charles: 7C FI(Q)UE looks pretty good. This is fine though. If Rafi ever reopens the board hopefully I will be able to pounce.
>Rafi_Stern: BEERSYY 1M BYE +35 268
>Charles_Reinke: ?EEMNOR 8A EMO +20 319
>Rafi_Stern: AEORSXY N10 OX.YE +43 311
#note Rafi: OXEYE gives more back than OX, but I need to bingo quickly. The Reinke who I was playing took a long time on EMO so I felt like he had the blank... does that mean I should play OX instead? Or do I need to hope he drew poorly, that I bingo and then can shut down the lanes? The pool does contain JUUVWWZ so there definitely is a chance he drew some of that crap. The Y is really easy to fish on this board which is a plus, but my bingo chances are much higher after OXEYE than OX or VOX. Quackle likes OX or VOX better.
>Charles_Reinke: ?AENNPR M11 A.P +35 354
#note Charles: "Why isn't Charles bingoing here?" you ask. Answer: I was under time pressure after the last two turns with the blank and didn't see the wide open new bingo lane until after I hit my clock. Usually I'm pretty calm but I was really frustrated with myself after this.
>Rafi_Stern: AEIJRSU 2K JU.A +32 343
#note Rafi: Saw JAKE, thought that at this stage in the game it was worth sacrificing points to increase my bingo chances. If I still think Charles has the blank, I'm not frequently going to win by outrunning so hitting a quick bingo is pretty important. With a blank inference, JURA bingos 41% and JAKE bingos 27%.
>Charles_Reinke: ?ENNNRW O7 WREN +23 377
#note Charles: I WANT TO BE PUNISHED
>Rafi_Stern: EEIRSUV G2 EVE +15 358
#note Rafi: I don't think I can win this game without a bingo, especially if I still think Thomas (Charles?) has the blank. EVE leaves only 4 in the bag, so a Z play making NEVE will empty the bag and can't outrun a bingo. Based on the pool, I have a decent chance of drawing NUTSIER 8s through the E, and Charles (Thomas?) also has to address the NEVE lane. Another interesting optinon that I didn't consider is E(L), which gives me a 4/14 shot at UNIVERSE and also REVUIST as a double threat. If we trade bingos of equal score (Charles bingos through the E, I bingo out with REVUIST) then I might get enough points off Thomas's rack (ZW perhaps?) to win!
>Charles_Reinke: ?ENNOPT 2B dEPON.NT +72 449
#note Charles: Now let's forget about NEVE and thus PONTiNE.
