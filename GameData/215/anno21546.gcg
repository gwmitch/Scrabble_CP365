#note new in TWL15
>JD: CMNOPVW 15F COWM.N +39 108
#note he held for a bit. the superior synergy of CMP after WOVEN leads it to sim better than COWMEN - bingo percentage goes up from 7% to 14%.
>Joey: EIILNTV 12H VI.ILE +26 122
#note apparently this was his actual rack, so I blocked lenitive.

>JD: AAEJLOV I4 JAVA +22 160
#note the board is quite closed, so making a play like JAVA that opens things is penalized. just taking the points for JEON is a substantially better idea.

#note I think this was actual rack given his subsequent play.

#note bad luck for him here
>JD: AHILOSY 14L ASHY +33 244
#note after two consecutive fishes in a row for joey, I have to assume that he has a really premium rack. he blocked my easy play of PHALLI so now I had to work much harder to find a decent option. I think this is a good choice, but it took a lot of time to find and convince myself it was reasonable.

#note nice draw
>Joey: BY N5 BY +32 317
>JD: EIQTTUX 11C TEXT +46 353
#note an embarassment of riches, his failure to play anything remotely blocking led me to think he might have the blank. I leave the T open, but block a bunch of other lanes and also hold a potent combo with my play.
>Joey: ?DEEGGO A5 GOrGE.ED +86 403
#note nice clutch find from joey

>JD: ADEINQU 5A .I +3 356
#note definite error on this play, with only two minutes left I thought about fishing for QUIETENED but completely spaced on potentially playing QUIETED/QUIETEN! I was fishing for QUANTED and QUANTA at 2J. However, QUIETEN and QUIETED never score enough to catch Joey, even if I draw the Z. The correct play is OD at 6B to fish for the duo of EQUITANT and ANTIQUE/QUINATE if I draw the T - I didn't think of QUINATE, which is why I didn't try that fish. I forfeited a 1/9 or 11% win chance with my inaccurate play. 
>Joey: ACERTUZ N2 ZA +46 449
#note joey has nothing to worry about as long as he has the T already, and can go ahead and play ZA
