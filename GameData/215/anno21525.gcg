#note i was literally 100% sure that if i played HOPE he would bingo. it took me so long to talk myself into it. what else looks reasonable? quackle sort of likes RUPEE or even 8L HUE which seems a little much.

#note maybe i'm not that good at defense. should i do 14A LEASE or 3E AGENE here? i wanted to block as much as i could and race to a blank at least.  definitely have no idea what is right here. quackle likes 14A LEASE best but i need to inference something from OFF right. -8
