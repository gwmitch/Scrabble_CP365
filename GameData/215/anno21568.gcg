>Evans_Clinchy: ENOPRTT K7 T..PON +20 47
#note Preferred this to OPT or TOP - first because it doesn't give back the obvious S hook on the DWS, and second because it forks open multiple bingos. I like bingos.

#note Didn't look hard enough through that C! Either CONIDIAN or ANODYNIC is 86.
>Stefan_Rau: BDEEILS O6 DE.IBELS +64 178
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEEILR 14J BRI.E +28 228
#note I looked forever for a play that doesn't give back any easy counters, and there just isn't one. At least this forces him to bingo with something kinda specific. I hate plays like BEE 13G - setting up an S hook and having to worry about it all game long is bad.

#note Didn't know LAURIC. JELLO hooks there for 46.
>Stefan_Rau: HOX M1 HOX +49 270
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEOOTV J3 OVATE +12 279
#note This sims best - it doesn't give back any big plays, and it also forks open multiple bingo lines. Either I can hit something through the V or A, or I can play a seven up top making NOVATE.
>Stefan_Rau: EKZ 10B ZEK +49 319
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ADENOT 4D DONATi.E +74 353
#note Very lucky draw. Phew.
>Stefan_Rau: ERR C7 ERR.. +8 327
>Evans_Clinchy: AFNOSSY 5C FOY +31 384
#note This is pretty decent, since it scores and blocks bingos in lines 2 and B. But even better is SAYONS 3C with all the overlaps! Leaves only 1 tile in the bag, so he can't really fish for anything. Looks like a fairly certain win.
>Stefan_Rau: AOV 3B OVA +16 343
>Evans_Clinchy: AAHNSST A1 TANH +40 424
#note No possible bingos, so I'm safe. Best is probably TANHS or SHA L4 (I wasn't sure of the S hook on DONATIVE).
