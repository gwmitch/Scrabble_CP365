>Charles_Reinke: ?AMOOPW H7 MOW +16 16
#note Quackle informs me that AMO? is better than AOP?.
>Sal_Piro: AEILSUV 7H .ISVALUE +65 65
>Charles_Reinke: ??ANOPU O1 APOlUN.s +122 138
#note The only triple-triple available. I thought there would be more for sure.
>Sal_Piro: BDO N1 BOD +27 92
>Charles_Reinke: AINQRTY 10F QINTAR +46 184
>Sal_Piro: IKT 11E KIT +27 119
>Charles_Reinke: BEEEIMY L4 EMB.Y +32 216
#note L2 EYEBE(A)M is much better. This play scores well but the EEI leave has the potential to get me in trouble.
>Sal_Piro: GRT 8F GR.T +7 126
>Charles_Reinke: DEEIIOV J2 VIDEO. +20 236
#note Not sure why I decided against K2 VIDE; at this point it's probably better to not set up lanes for eights unnecessarily. I did want to do something about (S)KIT but it's pretty hard to block that without giving something back.
>Sal_Piro: IX I3 XI +37 163
>Charles_Reinke: AEFHINS M2 FAH +39 275
#note I told myself that SHEAFING was phony. Why do I doubt my word knowledge so much?
>Sal_Piro: DEINOOT M7 .OTIONED +75 238
#note I was almost positive this was phony. Why do I doubt my word knowledge so much? However, I couldn't stop thinking about the worst-case scenario, which is that I lose a challenge and he blocks my bingo. If I just play the bingo I maintain a 100-point lead.
>Charles_Reinke: EEINRSZ 13G SNEEZI.R +69 344
>Sal_Piro: EF N9 EF +28 266
>Charles_Reinke: AIILORU 12D OI +10 354
#note Now (S)KIT is out of the way and there's only one tile in the bag that hooks OI. K9 A(R)RO(Z) is pretty cool though.
>Sal_Piro: EHT 14H ETH +31 297
>Charles_Reinke: ADILRRU I13 ..A +3 357
#note Quackle absolutely hates this, but I'm always making paranoid plays like this. Seriously considered 13B DURR here as well.
>Sal_Piro: TW 15G TW. +36 333
#note Sal has been scoring way too much the past few turns.
>Charles_Reinke: DEILRRU 11J RED. +16 373
#note In typical Charles-style paranoia, I didn't want to to do anything on row 13. Around this turn I start getting low on time.
>Sal_Piro: EY H4 YE +20 353
#note Scored as 19.
>Charles_Reinke: AAILORU N12 O.A +14 387
#note 12L U(N)AI.
>Sal_Piro: CEP 13C CEP +25 378
>Charles_Reinke: ACILRSU 5E CLU. +12 399
#note Now I'm thinking about what I'm going to do with the J if I draw it. I don't see the spot at J9 yet, so I set up F2 JAI(L)S.
>Sal_Piro: LLNU F3 NU.L +6 384
>Charles_Reinke: AAIJLRS J9 J.. +10 409
#note 2B JARI(N)A makes the game a lot less tense for me, but I didn't have time to see it.
>Sal_Piro: AEGGNRS O10 SAG +18 402
>Charles_Reinke: AAILRS 3H A..S +17 426
#note I end up playing a seriously suboptimal endgame due to time pressure. If Sal had blocked AXIS somehow instead of playing SAG, the abrupt disturbance of my plans might have caused me to lose.
