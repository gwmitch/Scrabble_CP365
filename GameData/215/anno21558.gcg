#note My play was not on CP's initial list of suggestions, but was a runaway #1 on a deep sim run.   
I can score my X in one of two spots next turn, and I'm hoping he if he blocks, he has to do so for few points and/or maybe  inure a good rack
>Tod_Taylor: IN 6D IN +5 338
#note I got what I reasonably hoped for, though it's possible that these were duplcates on his rack, mitigating the damage to his rack I hoped to do.  just don't know.
>Matthew_Ridout: CEEOORX 3B COX +39 338
#note HELP!
OXO 3A best (34% to win, 9% better than next best; 23 valuation pts); mine 7th (23% to win, 27 valuation pts)
The difference in ordinal rank between the two stayed the same after a deep sim.
Why wouldn't I want the extra 13 pts here?  Since I'm tying the game, I don't feel like I need the desperate volatility of the A column opening here.  Does it just come down to the respective value of the two leaves?
>Tod_Taylor: IKS 14E SKI +28 366
#note Not knowing what else he had, CP estimates him at just over 80% to win now
>Matthew_Ridout: EENORSU 11C ENS +23 361
#note OW 3L here is 34% to win and nothing else comes close.  Mine valuated a little better, but was only 9% to win.   Just flat out underestimated the need to bingo for a possible win here.

#note OVERRUN 1I and out best, though not enough for the win.  mine 4th, 22 valuation pts behind
