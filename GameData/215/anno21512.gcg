#note PLACKET at D4 is #1 (77.48%). CATLIKE at D8 is #2 (76.28%). TACKLER is #3 (72.23%). My play is #4 (71.25%). I agree with Quackle here. This is a medium sized mistake.

#note RUBIGO at 7D is #1 (57.01%). KRUBI at D11 is #2 (56.55%). Exchanging BIIIOU is #3 (56.13%). My play is #9 (55.06%). The rack is so bad, this is not really a mistake.

#note My play is #2 (21.25%). OI at 9J is #1 (21.61%). AI is #3 (18.90%). This is not really a mistake. Win % difference is minimal.

#note I'm playing my ass off here and this rack finally breaks the camel's back. UVULA at K2 is #1 (15.27%). ULVA at K3 is #2 (12.89%). Exchanging LQUUUV is #3 (9.91%). My play is #8 (7.68%). I thought my exchange was better than this. I saw ULVA and missed UVULA. Really didn't want to keep the Q in my rack. This was probably a small mistake. Still not sure.

#note SUQ at E4 is #1 (27.37%). SUQS at O12 is #2 (27.17%). BASQUE at E2 is #3 (24.97%). My play is #6 (13.25%). I figured I could save SUQS for later and prevent Alec from getting some easy points from the triple. Quackle thinks this is a big mistake. I'm not so sure. 
>Alec: DEV K3 DEV. +28 423
>Reid: EIMQSSU O12 .UQS +39 410
#note SUQ wins the game here. This assumes stellar play for the next few turns, but it is true. My play is #2 with no chance of winning. SUQ at E4 is #3. I didn't even think to get cute here and fully utilize my esses. 
>Alec: AENPUU H12 .EAP +18 441
>Reid: EIMS E4 SEMI +22 432
#note #1 play. Alec challenged for some reason.
>Reid:  (NUU) +6 438
#note No missed bingos this game. 8 of my 14 plays were #1. 11 of 14 in the top 4. All 14 in the top 9. An ill considered end game lost this game. While I think I was outdrawn for sure (I drew 29 vowels this game), this game was winnable. Overall, I give myself a B+ this game. This had the potential to be one of the best games I'd ever played, but I ruined it.
