>Charles_Reinke: AEGIRSX H7 XI +18 18
>Marty_Gabriel: ANOPY G6 YAPON +26 26
>Charles_Reinke: AAEGNRS F4 AGAR +24 42
#note I liked this better than just AR since it gives me another lane (eights through the A).
>Marty_Gabriel: DEEERTT 10E TE.TERED +63 89
>Charles_Reinke: EIINNSV 11K NEVI +21 63
#note K5 VENIN(E)S is probably too many to pass up. I missed it.
>Marty_Gabriel: EFFR N10 F.FER +38 127
>Charles_Reinke: AIMMNNS 13I AMMIN. +22 85
#note E4 MAN I guess. I was hesitant to close that spot but the potential for Marty scoring big there is too high.
>Marty_Gabriel: AOZ O8 ZOA +41 168
>Charles_Reinke: BEENPSU 11B UNBE +16 101
#note A dangerous Q spot, but I need a big score soon so maybe that's in my favor.

>Charles_Reinke: AEGGIRS 8L GRI. +16 260
#note 12D AGGIE. There's no reason to score so few points here. I think I just wanted to reopen this section of the board.
>Marty_Gabriel: ILT 12L LI.T +32 302
>Charles_Reinke: AEEGHOS 9B EH +34 294
#note It was EH vs. EGO. EGO sets up my S but I was afraid that Marty might have one. I shouldn't be so fearful since I'M the one who has an S RIGHT NOW.

#note Free exchange! Or I could just play something at 12D...AGO maybe?

>Charles_Reinke: AADLOSV 2J DO +18 388
#note I started putting down C7 VA(HIN)ES until I realized I didn't have an E anymore. I thought this was a good way to set up my A or my L but Quackle absolutely hates it. 2E OVALS is the sim winner by a mile but that play also gives up plays to the triple while not really setting me up for anything else. I don't know.
>Marty_Gabriel: EGOOY 1K GOOEY +35 396
>Charles_Reinke: AACDLSV 5K SCALD +28 416
#note I was kicking myself because now Marty has WA(HIN)eS and I just telegraphed him the spot. I ran down my clock trying to find an effective endgame sequence that involved me blocking that play but couldn't find one, so I just played this hoping he would miss WAHINES.
