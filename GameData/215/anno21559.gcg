#note Tasha's Eventful Events in Reno - Episode 5.  It took me the longest to remember how this game went down.  I mean I remembered the board and my racks, but I struggled with the order of the plays.  I think this is right.  Close enough, anyway.

#note Yeah whatever.  Just play something.  Just don't block any lanes.  Make another one instead.  Yeah, RAI is a word.  ....I think.   If I draw two consonants, maybe I'll miraculously bingo to the D if it doesn't get blocked.

#note O_O  Yeah, just as planned.  Needless to say, I didn't flip the table over.

#note Nah, don't play the J yet.  Just play PONDER to block the easiest lane left.  EUGENIC takes an S so maybe I'll draw into a huge J play at 15L.  There's plenty of E's and T's left and I just played off five tiles.

>Tasha: DEIOSTT 9K OD +10 305
#note I'm still being annoying.  I almost played TOYO to block the R hook and the N on row 2, but decided against it. (I didn't want to give her the open T.)  The N isn't easy to hit and if she bingos with a word ending an R...whoopty do.   I can outrun her.
>Laurie_Cohen: ADEFMRT 2H DRAFTME. +80 319
#note Phony!  I didn't even look twice.  DRAFTSMEN only.  For some reason,  I wasn't the least bit concerned after the bingo.  Now that I'm going through this game, I have no idea where the confidence came from because DRAFTMEN* is worse-case scenario AND a blank is still unseen.  Hell, she may even be drawing Mr. Blankie now.  Maybe the pool was telling me something.  I don't know.
