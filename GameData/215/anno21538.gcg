>JD: AEELRTU D10 LUTE +15 45
#note I liked LUTE as a way to keep the board open with the LUTEA hook. Quackle actually likes just LEZ, which surprises me, but it bingos 15% more often than my play of LUTE (45% versus 30%). Other options are HUE or LEU at D3, but I'm OK with my play, I think.

#note his actual rack
>JD: AADEEIR G2 ERADIA.E +62 107
>Orry: AEGISTV 3E VI.GATES +63 185
#note unfortunately, my bingo gives him the letter he needs to bingo, but at least the board is pretty open.
>JD: AEINQSX D4 QI +24 131
>Orry: AEMOOST L2 O.TEOMAS +72 257
>JD: AELNSXY 2L .XY +26 157
#note a few plays sim comparably. I didn't like XYLAN blocking row 14. once again I didn't think of XYLENE (much like round 3), which adds even more volatility. howvever, the board is already really open (don't forget the RERADIATE hook), so I think my play is fine.
>Orry: BCKOR 1F BROCK +49 306
>JD: AEGLNRS K9 ANGLERS +68 225
#note I need to bingo again. this placement makes it easiest to do so.

>JD: CDEEIII 8L .IDE +15 240
#note CEILI at 12H looks like the obvious dream play, except that it neatly blocks all of my bingo lanes. the play I see now that I missed at the time is CEILI at 10A opening a 3x3 lane - it usually won't work, but his rack is basically random, so it must be worth a shot! my play is rarely going to lead to useful bingos.
>Orry: AEINNSU 11H SAN.UINE +59 392
#note in this world I was well and truly screwed, since CEILI at 10A would've given him NUISANCE. I still think that was my best hope.
>JD: ACDEIIW J9 WI.ED +26 266
#note down 152, I started cutting spread - I guess I can play AW at C12 to open another lane, but it's pretty unlikely to work out positively for me. the spread play is CNIDA at N10 to block the triple lane.
>Orry: AJRU C11 JURA +39 431
>JD: ACEFINO 1M OAF +32 298
#note I can't win from here, but CAFE at B12 is a nice play, setting up SCUTE if I draw the blank to maybe cut some spread.
>Orry: ?ILRV O10 R.VILe +36 467
#note surprising to me, since he has ERVIL
>JD: CDEHINW 5J CH.WED +30 328
#note playing HEWED instead of CHEWED leaves CONI and IONIC if I draw one of the three remaining Os. quackle also likes WHENCE for some reason.

#note ran out of time and missed NAOI again!! 26 point swing
>Orry: GNO C5 NOG +9 515
#note missed AGONE at I11 for more points
