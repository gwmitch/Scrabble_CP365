#note quackle really likes the 7A placement over 9A (by 2 points) - I think because I am likely to get a good counterplay on row 6 if she takes the triple word score.

#note not going to play WETA since it opens up an unnecessary new lane for 7s. WET is a massive error compared to WEN!! in fact my bingo percentage goes up fourfold, from 2% to 8% with the improved synergy of ACOPT. an informative error

>JD: ACILNOP C2 PLICA. +26 309
#note my play isn't on the top 15 on static but performs well on the sim. my tiles have some bingo synergy, but the board is now rather closed unless an S is drawn. I am trying to end the game faster and maybe draw an S of my own with my play. I also didn't know if she would think of GYPO so I liked keeping the O in case I drew a play there.

#note sweet draw
>Marlene_Millkent: DEGINST 15B INGEST.D +62 329
>JD: ENNOTUU O6 UN.UNE +6 401
#note given my 66-point lead, I felt that it was important to block the new lane on column O - while not super-likely, a bingo starting with T was the one play which seemed like it could outrun me, whereas other bingos at the bottom-left I should have a shot at outrunning. A sim kind of agrees with me, showing that UNTUNE drops her bingo percentage greatly. I could also play TENUOUS at F9, but if I'm not scoring much on this turn anyway, I might as well use it for improved defense.
>Marlene_Millkent: AQU 14B QUA +51 380
>JD: ADEIOST E11 ASID. +26 427
#note lol what am I doing, I was waiting for the GYPO hook all game and then I missed DIASTOLE!! yurgh. I think that ASIDE is still pretty much a sure win however since it blocks the bingo lanes, so at least it wasn't all bad. still sacrificing a bunch of spread for no reason!

>JD: BEEOORT I13 BE. +27 454
#note I should play TOLE at 5K first to prevent her using the hook, but I thought again that she might forget about GYPO and let me play RETOOL.

#note nice play
>JD: EOORT 12A TORO.E +14 468
#note phew, I lost a lot of spread by missing DIASTOLE
