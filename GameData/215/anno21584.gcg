#note E5 YAU(P) is very much worth it.

#note 12B ETHErIC is two more, but I wanted to preserve the (E)EEW hook in case Chris hadn't thought of it.

>Charles_Reinke: ABEKOUX 6K .OAX +30 197
#note J10 KA sims best. Makes sense since the X is a more versatile scoring tile and KA scores four more than my play.

>Charles_Reinke: ABBEKUU B7 BUBKE +30 227
#note Phony. Confused with BUBKES and BUBBE+. I knew there was a new word along these lines.
>Chris_Cree: ANNOY C3 ANNOY +35 188
>Charles_Reinke: AEFOUUV A4 UVEA +16 243
#note Being paranoid about the TWS. Realistically, Chris is not going to have a monster play there very often. 4C (N)OUVEAU wins the sim, but it's not a big mistake.

#note 2D (A)DJUROR was way too open for my tastes.
>Chris_Cree: APW E4 WAP +22 237
>Charles_Reinke: ADEJRTU M3 JUR.T +26 296
#note This play pretty much kills the board for bingos. F2 JUT sims a little better though.

#note Spent a long time trying to figure out what to do here. Chris' play implies he's pretty close to a bingo. He was obviously trying to set up an S. With this play, he has to end a bingo in -IST basically (DIALIST and ALTOIST being most likely). If he has no bingo, he has to set up another spot, because he's not going to outrun me in the endgame. 13G MEH is another option that concedes bingos while scoring points and keeping the Z.

>Charles_Reinke: DHILMRY 14D HYDR. +16 377
#note My tracking indicated that DIALIST was the only possible O-column bingo. However, I wasn't sure if there weren't other bingos possible in ADFIILSTT that would play on row 15. It turns out there aren't. So if Chris has DIALIST I am going to lose, and if he doesn't, I'm going to win, no matter what play I make here.
