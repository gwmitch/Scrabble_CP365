#note OUTROAR limits the amount of letters I give to Joe for eights.

#note Don't like any of the plays that put the X at 7C. CO(cURATOR) is cool.

#note Wasn't sure if ACIERATE took an S. It does. It's a verb. I was pretty confident on ACIERATED, though, so I should have seen K4 RIdGILS. Scored as 66.

#note 14B STAND looks pretty good to me.

>Charles_Reinke: DDFSTVY -DDFVY +0 248
#note B12 D(A)VY is too many points to pass up. Putting the Y in that spot is not very dangerous. The G in row 1 is a much more pressing concern but I can't do anything about it right now.
>Joe_Edley: ILN 1A LIN. +15 212
>Charles_Reinke: EISTTUV B3 UT +12 260
#note I saw B10 VIT(A)E but I don't remember my reasoning for passing it up. I might have overestimated the quality of EISTV. Even if EISTV is good, it's not 20 points better than STU.

#note A bit of a smokescreen. What I'm really fishing for is one of the five E's for O1 AGENESI(S). There's a good chance that the E's are in the bag and not on Joe's rack because he played VARA instead of VERA, perhaps indicating that he had just one E or none. An M, O, or Z draw will also let me bingo in the spot I've just created. On this board, there's not really any way that Joe can score enough points to take me out of the game if I miss my fish. I hold the last S for VITAL(S) or QUIETEN(S).
