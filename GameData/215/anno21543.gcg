>Charles_Reinke: ADDENST J6 DAD +26 44
>Jesse_Day: ADIILRT 4I TRIAD +19 43
#note Jesse: TIDAL is a tiny bit better.
>Charles_Reinke: CCEHNST K4 .CH +27 71
>Jesse_Day: EILLORV 8J .RIVEL +33 76
#note Jesse: didn't see DEVOIR for a bunch more points
>Charles_Reinke: CENOOST N8 .COTONES +74 145
>Jesse_Day: AEEJLNO M10 JANE +39 115
#note Jesse: I felt that JANE at M10 would give back fewer points than playing at M12, and quackle seems to agree.
>Charles_Reinke: ABEIQUV 15K QUA.I +45 190
#note Charles: Good thing Jesse didn't play JANE two spots down.
>Jesse_Day: BDEGILO I9 OBLIGED +69 184
#note Jesse: fortunate draw
>Charles_Reinke: BEGISVY 15E GYVE. +39 229
#note Jesse: again, I think I chose the right placement of my play, but charles nails me with the big play for the second turn in a row.
>Jesse_Day: ?AFLNNO F8 NONLeAF. +73 257
>Charles_Reinke: ?ABIIST 3L BI +18 247
#note Charles: I was sad that TIBIALIS+ got blocked. No excuse for missing STIBIAL though.
>Jesse_Day: EEFIKRZ N1 FEZ +44 301
#note Jesse: tough call, FEZ gives back a lot of points, but none of my plays is especially defensive. the sim winner is FRIEZE at E3 setting up KEN for next turn, but I wanted to play relatively defensively after Charles's apparent fish last turn (he spent a long time before playing BI). indeed, FEZ keeps his bingo percentage lowest against random racks, and if he does bingo on column E I should get to score in reply on column O.
>Charles_Reinke: ?AEIPST O1 ATE +41 288
#note Charles: I think it's definitely right here to block the O1 spot and try to bingo later.

Jesse: charles already had the blank on this play, so he was able to pass up the bingo and take the free points.
>Jesse_Day: EEGIKRS E13 KE. +19 320
#note Jesse: huge miss, I simply didn't remember RESKIN being a word. beyond that, the EGIRS leave is deceptively weak. I wanted to keep an S for the STROW hook, but quackle suggests either GIE at E9 to save a scoring tile or GEEKIER at 12A. the bag is loaded with bingo tiles, so keeping a mediocre bingo leave is a particularly bad idea. just playing RESKIN would solve my problems here.

Charles: I feel compelled to note that RESKIN+ is new.
>Charles_Reinke: ?ILPSST D7 SPLInTS +79 367
>Jesse_Day: AEGIRRS 8A GRI. +21 341
>Charles_Reinke: EHNORWX J13 OX +53 420
#note Jesse: I kinda needed to draw this X at some point, he probably can outrun a bingo now.
>Jesse_Day: AEENRSU 11I .EU +6 347
#note Jesse: frustrating that I don't have a fishing play for more points here, but I think this is the best I can do.
>Charles_Reinke: EHMNORW H12 HER. +34 454
>Jesse_Day: AEENRST A8 .REATENS +80 427
#note Jesse: I think I have to take the bingo here, fishing for 15 points isn't going to help me catch Charles. presumably the only way I could win is if he phonied.
