>ian: EX 8H EX +18 18
>cesar: CIIOUYZ 7F ICY +16 16
#note ian played this quickly and i wanted to have a comeback spot for something.. don't think this is right though. 7H YOU takes an R/S..  maybe 9I ICY or just take the points with COZY 7E. -8
>ian: ?ABDEET 6H dEBATED +74 92
>cesar: IIMOTUZ 5K ZIT +50 66
#note of course ZITI is better.. I just didn't want to give him a scoring spot.. ugh. -4.5
>ian: CHITW 6B WITCH +42 134
>cesar: DIMOQUW M2 QUO..D +36 102
#note annoyingly I don't have a T or an S, so I thought to set up a spot here. meh. QUOITED maybe still. -1

#note i just need him to stop scoring for a turn

>cesar: ALORSST 14A SORTALS +78 301
#note i strongly considered playing O1 OS and bingoing next turn. quackle likes 10I a little better, makes sense to keep it a bit more open and sacrifice two points. -0.5%
>ian: EOR 15A ORE +19 336
#note ian exposed the case S here when he tried to play OSIER, which really sucks, because i'm basically dead.
>cesar: AENRTUU A4 .UT +24 325
#note should i maybe just fish off a U?
>ian: EFGI 2B G.IEF +34 370
>cesar: AEENORU 9D OE +11 336
#note nothing here is really good. he can trivially block the only lane i can hit if i play up top. so AEON 1E has to be wrong. maybe I can do MEOU from the M and hope to get lucky. -8.5
