>JD: AEEIOTW K4 TOWIE +29 109
#note I almost chickened out of TOWIE on this play for some reason!
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ATT 7C TAT +19 49
>JD: ABBEHIO C2 HOBBI. +26 135
#note extremely close on a sim between HOBBIT, BAITH and OBEAH (I didn't spot OBEAH actually). Given my early lead, I liked HOBBIT, especially given that TAT suggests an S in his rack.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AILRTTU I2 RUTILA.T +61 110
#note ok, no S I guess. TAT is a nice play on his part then to induce a blocking play.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: FILP F10 FLIP +32 166
>JD: EIJRSUZ 2K J.EZ +40 233
#note this is where it all went to hell. in CSW this is a perfectly reasonable play instead of JURIES, but instead I decided to play JEEZ, which happens to take a new hook of JEEZE in TWL15...
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEHW F4 HEWE. +36 202
#note miraculously for me, my opponent also forgot this hook for at least the next few turns...on this turn alone HEW plays for 48
>JD: GIIRSSU 14B RISUS +26 259
#note happy to come up with this play! sims best. two more esses left and both blanks, so turning over tiles is encouraged, and it blocks up the board.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: Q 6B Q. +31 233
>JD: EGIMNOS 13C GIM. +30 289
#note GIMP looked like a swell play except that I missed GENOM/JEEZE for 48 points. don't worry, it gets more entertaining than this quickly. also I somehow missed GENOM on row 15 for a whole bunch of extra points anyway.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CDEF 2B C..FED +34 267
>JD: ?EEKNOS 15A KEN +27 316
#note surely this is my worst single play of nationals. not only did I miss EIKONES for 116, I also airballed on my playable bingos of SOKEMEN and EIKONES. what the hell was I doing??
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AENRTU M4 NATURE +21 288
#note trying to draw a blank, which is probably smart
>JD: ?ELOOSY N9 LOOSElY +74 390
#note I'm in great shape here, holding a lead with the blank. if I know the JEEZE hook is there, I think that playing YE looks pretty good - limiting volatility, and restricting him to 70 point bingos on columns L and N that I can maybe bingo through in response, or score off of. otherwise, the choice is between LOOSELY and GOOEY. Again, with JEEZE available, GOOEY improves, since I might have to outrun a 100-point bingo. I think this is a reasonable decision though.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AINO 1D .ONIA +28 316
#note on this turn, Matthew realized that he might be able to win by hitting JEEZE, and therefore he tried to score as many points as possible to keep himself in range, since I presumably may not spot it.
>JD: ?ACDLRY O4 ACRiDLY +97 487
#note unfortunately for him, it never became relevant because I lucked out!
>JD:  (EGMNNOS) +20 507
#note and thus one of the two finalists at 2015 nationals blew 100 points of equity by not knowing a new 5 (I can't speak for the other finalist).
