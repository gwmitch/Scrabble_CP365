#title 2015 NSC Round 19
#description Panupol Sujjayakorn plays Jesse Day in Round 19 at the 2015 NSC
>Panupol: DEILORT 8G DOL +8 8
#note annotated game from round 19 of the 2015 NSC. quackle kind of likes exchange O!
>Jesse: GINNOTV J6 VOTING +25 25
#note this was an important game - we were probably both in bracket play, but a win here would clinch it definitively.
>Panupol: EFINPRT H7 F.P +8 16
#note Q likes FEINT on this play for a bunch of points
>Jesse: ?GHLNNO 11J .ONG +12 37
#note I figured that panupol would bingo next turn given his fish, and wanted to generate some counterplay. but, I probably just make more of his bingos fit on the board. DONG looks good - if he bingos, he'll probably give me lots of letters to play 8s through.
>Panupol: EIINRST M7 STIN.EIR +72 88
>Panupol: EIINRST --  -72 16
#note yeow
>Jesse: ?EHLNSX M9 LE. +5 42
#note I felt great about finding this play. quackle suggests ILEX, but he will respond by playing REIN or TEIN while keeping a pretty good leave. there's not really a way for him to block this play.
>Panupol: EIINRST 7G I. +10 26
>Jesse: ?CHNOSX N8 COX +55 97
#note fortunate draw as well to make this play even more painful for him
>Panupol: EGINRST F1 RESTING +69 95
>Jesse: ?AHNRSS 10B HARNeSS +76 173
#note I didn't really consider playing SHARNS on this move - sims very close to HARNESS.
>Panupol: AAEEILT 1D AE.IAL +21 116
>Jesse: AORUUUZ 9B AZO +50 223
#note might as well take the points and hope to draw a decent way to offload the Us
>Panupol: AEEENRT 3F .ERENATE +70 186
>Jesse: EERUUUU -EUUUU +0 223
#note well, nevermind then
>Panupol: EEOOQRW 4J OWE +23 209
>Jesse: DEFIIRT 8A IF +24 247
>Panupol: DEOQRTT 5E Q. +22 231
#note fortunate he didn't have the I yet!
>Jesse: ADEIRTU 5K EAU +21 268
#note on such a closed board I didn't want to make any play like ZAIDA or ETUI that opened things up. perhaps ADIEU is worth playing since it won't be that easy for him to play through the U. quackle things not playing ADIEU is a major error. probably a little too cowardly on my part.
>Panupol: DEIORTT 2B DIET.R +21 252
>Jesse: BDIORTU 6B BRUI. +24 292
#note missed BOUDIN, which leaves a slightly better leave
>Panupol: EELMOST 12D TELOMES +85 337
>Panupol: EELMOST --  -85 252
#note fortunately I knew that STOVING was the only word in TWL15 in that rack.
>Jesse: BDHKOTU 11D BOTH +33 325
#note since I know his rack, I don't have to worry about ORBY with both Ys unseen - in fact I may draw it myself
>Panupol: EELMOST 12A MELS +30 282
>Jesse: AADIKNU A12 .AKI +30 355
#note erk, UMIAK is clearly way better, just missed it.
>Panupol: ADEIMOT B12 .MIT +30 312
>Jesse: ADNPRUV C12 .UD +26 381
>Panupol: ADEJOYY 1A JO +30 342
>Jesse: ACENPRV 3A VAN +20 401
#note quackle wants me to fish with this rack, which surely can't be right....I supposed it prevents panupol from opening at the bottom-right or something?
>Panupol: ?ADEWYY 2M DEW +17 359
#note SHADY at G10 sets up YEOW!
>Jesse: CEPRU 12G ECU +14 415
#note ooh TEACUP!
>Panupol: ?AYY O1 A.aY +39 398
>Jesse: PR M5 .RP +8 423
>Jesse:  (Y) +8 431
