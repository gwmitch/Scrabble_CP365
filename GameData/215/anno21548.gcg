#note quackle slightly prefers JAUP because PUJA gives back the cheap H hook.

#note I think he said he exchanged II
>JD: EINOOVV 9F VINO +26 52
#note convenient blocking play in response to his X2.

#note this seemed like as good an opportunity as I would get to block the TAINTS hook

#note using my drawing skillz to draw a bingo to EEI. sick.
>Doug: EM H13 .EM +24 129
>JD: BDFIORW E10 WIF.D +24 259
#note I'm already in great shape, but I felt that WIFED contained the board better - making it hard for Doug to open more at the bottom-left and blocking miracle bingos to the M.

>JD: DEIORRT 15F RE.ORID +12 343
#note perfectly fine play, but RIOTED does essentially the same thing (turn over tiles to end the game) while keeping better letters. always fun to make a play that doesn't show up in the top 50 on static but still sims well!
>Doug: AILR C9 LIAR +17 228
>JD: AABGINT B8 GAB +24 367
#note I liked this play since I have the case A for A8, but really I'm just allowing Doug to bingo more easily - much better to play ALLOYING on the right, which I forgot about. I also thought that there was a good chance he was setting up the X, and I really didn't like the look of the board after the played EX/XI, but ALLOYING should outrun all of that anyway.
>Doug: CGOS O7 COGS +24 252
>JD: AIKNOTX 10G XI +24 391
#note this is the problem with GAB last turn - doug gets to fish for a turn, and I basically have no further way of blocking. the best play according to championship player is KA at D8, but it was tough to play with the thought that I might be missing some new bingo on column A that might actually beat me (I was getting low on time too, of course). So, safe route it is, and weather the storm when he bingos.
>Doug: ?NRSTUW A7 WaS +24 276
#note cruel luck for doug, he leaves EI in the bag and doesn't even bingo. apparently playing URNS or RUNS is one point better.
>JD: AEIKNOT D4 INTAKE +34 425
>Doug: NRTU C1 RUNT +10 286
#note he has UNIT/TUNER somewhere in the jungle.
