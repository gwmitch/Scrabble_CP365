#note wow, I did not think that SIMULAR took an S at all - I was ready to play AIRBRUSH next turn if Josh didn't touch that quadrant, and would've challenged SIMULARS had he played it. Lucky me.

>Josh_Sokol: EGO N12 EGO +15 152
>JD: ANNOOPR O14 PO +16 238
#note not realizing that SIMULARS was good, I passed up a lot of points on this turn to block the S hook on EGO, figuring that I would have to block it at some point and that this was as good of a turn as any to do so given my point cushion. If SIMULARS is phony, then blocking PO drops his bingo percentage from 16% to 5% - so I think that there was merit to my decision if I trusted in my deficient word knowledge. that said, I am now giving him free points on column O. PORNO sims better by about 19 points, which seems right.

#note all of a sudden, if he gets a bingo down I have so many points on my rack that I could be in trouble. quackle wants me to play JEWELS to empty the bag, but then he can tie me by drawing ANTITRADE! anyway, if he fishes I can play off the Z and I should win.
