#note Just PHT is of course better. Dumb oversight on my part. Luckily powerful leaves aren't as valuable on this blocked-up board.

>Evans_Clinchy: BGIMNST 6E ..B +13 156
#note This is a pretty potent fish, but M(AL)T in the same spot is probably worth it for the extra points.

#note I have no idea what's best here. My thinking was that since he clearly had the last S (WITES), this opening would lure him into a bingo at 12A, which might in turn give me a triple-triple. Worth a shot?
>Joel_Wapnick: ESY 11F E.YS +32 160
#note Not exactly the ideal response, but I still get to bingo.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?GINOST 12A TOwINGS +78 238
#note Obviously the V in the triple lane is safer, but I couldn't 100 percent convince myself that VOTINGS# was good.

>Evans_Clinchy: ACEIMNT B8 AME +20 258
#note Figured it made sense to block here. Plus CINT is a fantastic leave considering it's effectively CEINT - there's eight E's in the bag and I'll very likely draw one.

#note Best is RURAL in the same spot, saving either EGG or GER# to go out.
>Joel_Wapnick: ?DDEIOT 4B DIm +27 321
#note Joel originally put down ITEM making GE*, and he had 4 seconds and wasn't able to change the blank. So an M word was basically forced.
