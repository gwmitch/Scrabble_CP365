#note Key play. There are three big scoring spots that I have all the right letters for. I greedily snatch this one first since it gives me the best potential to hit all three spots (saving the B for A8 and the S for K5). But it's stupidly risky. If Jeremy has the S I am in trouble. That said, my options hooking VERONICAS aren't great. BOLUS burns my precious BO and hopes for a E for a decent WE play. But according to Quackle it's worthwhile being greedy about the S hook. There's a good chance he doesn't have the S and a good chance I'll draw a big play there. But passing on A8 BOW is stupid. I'm unlikely to hit a BRO or BOG type play after I play off my O this turn, so there's little reason to try to hold onto my B. BOW is the play, 7 points ahead of WO, and 8 points ahead of BOLUS/BLOWS. Mistake :(

#note I missed the worthwhile PUBIS, but this has got to be better. I need to open up the top left before it's too late. And although the S is not good now, I plan to make it useful at some point.

#note Okay so 3J DRUID is simming 4-5 points ahead, but I'm again not sure it's worth it. Yes, it opens up an S hook, but my leave isn't good enough to capitalize on it immediately. If/when I open up a bingo lane on that side of the board, I need to be ready to bingo immediately, since Jeremy will have a turn to close it or row 1. I'm happy with row 2 and column N open for now, with my S-setup likely coming if I need it.

#note I don't see a way out of this. I need a second lane, but I can't open one and score well enough to keep up.
