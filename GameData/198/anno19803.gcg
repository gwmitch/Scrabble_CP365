#note Club game on 11/18/2014 (I rarely go!)
>Jim_Pate: ?ERSTTY I6 TRYSTEd +76 76
#note He said the blank was the first tile he flipped up.
>Siddharth_Murali: DIINNOW -  +0 28
#note A couple of unfavorable things happened here.
- I overdrew, he picked CDW, threw back the C.
- I had never seen TRYSTED in my life. I challenged. Turned out it was around 50 words out of my sevens probability range. Wicked.
- By challenging, there's a high chance that I will no longer be able to play INDOWING. 
>Jim_Pate: ?CDEEKN E7 s.CKENED +78 154
#note Again I believe he flipped up the blank first. That's mad skills. But it's completely my fault this time. I made close to a one hundred point mistake.

>Jim_Pate: CFU F2 FUC. +17 218
>Siddharth_Murali: ADIIOOS J2 OIDIA +14 148
#note Hah. OIDIOID ranks highest. Scores the same, keeps a better leave, opens the board. It also sets up an S hook that only I can use.

#note An interesting turn. I think I made the right choice though.

>Jim_Pate: EEIQRU O4 QUIE.ER +26 343
>Siddharth_Murali: ADELNOS I14 LO +17 345
#note Need to keep the D here. But NO is slightly better, and the sim's top choice, for the improved synergy.
>Jim_Pate: ARY L1 Y.AR +22 365
>Siddharth_Murali: AADENNS F10 ADS +32 377
#note This in theory wins 6 out of 8 endgames, while just AN for 18 wind 6 and ties a 7th. But Jim might misplay, so it isn't that big of a deal.
>Jim_Pate: GMPRRTU J13 UT +12 377
>Siddharth_Murali: AEINN L11 INANE +14 391
#note Interesting game. I think I played pretty well, by anyone's standards, on the turns besides challenging. But if you take into account the challenge, I played very poorly. I'll learn eventually I guess.
