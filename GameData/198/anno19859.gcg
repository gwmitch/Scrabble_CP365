#note I saw KAGU, but AUK keeps the G and the S hook open that I desperately need - otherwise the board seemed like it would be getting closed. however, quackle completely disagrees - saying that my bingo percentage is actually higher after KAGU than AUK. how? at the very least this way I threaten much bigger bingos than column F.

#note nice move to block column F

#note it's not impossible for me to win from here - there aren't a lot of vowels, and the Q could give Dave some trouble. I thought about WYLE at 5K also but it seemed to give back too many cheap points.

#note a miracle bingo as well as a desperate guess on my part...

#note as soon as this play came down and he only had vowels, I knew I was set. lucky draw for me
>JD: EMNRSTY 15A REMS +41 459
#note quackle says TEMS is 1 better, but maybe he won't block TYNE which I threaten this way
>Dr_Bing: EIIIOO O8 OI +14 465
#note 1 point better for dave to block TYNE with OE at 5K.
