#note I wasn't certain enouh to pull the trigger on WELLIE (which is TWL) under 5-point challenge. I almost tacked on the S, but that would pretty much certainly be awful given that it cuts my bingo percentage in half (from 40% to 20%)
>Adam_Logan: EGIOOQT F2 Q. +31 271
>JD: AABEIIS 12H AIA +7 236
#note interesting, quackle thinks it's a point and a bit better to play AIA at 10H. I suppose I give up some over lapping plays on row 13. not a big difference though
>Adam_Logan: JLOT 11J JOLT +31 302
>JD: ABEGIIS 13J BIGAE +28 264
#note I have no idea why BIGA sims better than BIGAE or BAGIE (didn't know BAGIE). keeping the E actually bingos 7% more often for 5 extra points - maybe I'm hitting bingos from 1H more often? the pool is not especially consonant-heavy, so I'm a bit surprised.

#note tough game to have as 6th loss in a row, again not much to do. in retrospect my best chance at a win of all of those was probably against Phil Robertshaw in round 8. the others were all pretty rough.
