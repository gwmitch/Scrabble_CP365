>JD: AHIOTTW 8D WHATO +30 30
>JD: AHIOTTW --  -30 0
#note I get to play nigel about twice a year on average, so every opportunity to do so is really special. what better time to do something I've never done before...play a phony?! I am not sure what possessed me. at least he took about 30 seconds to challenge
>Nigel_Richards: DEOOPRT H7 TORPEDO +74 74
#note with nigel's rack of DEOOPRT, nigel then spent the next 4 minutes trying to choose an opening move, which is fascinating. TROOPED looks obvious, but I think nigel is right to pass it up - my most likely response is to make a play that closes up the board, whereas after TORPEDO nigel scores 3 points per turn extra. TORPEDO at 8F and 8G are dead heats on the sim, 8F because of improved defense. this is an especially difficult read because there are only a limited number of racks I can have, probably with two one-pointers in reserve.
>JD: AHIOTTW 11E AWH.TO +24 24
#note hmm, now what...AHIT and AITT were not thrilling leave opportunities. I'm already down to a 20% favorite, so why not dispose of the letters he knows about and create a big hot spot? maybe he'll even sacrifice a few points to block.
>Nigel_Richards: EPRV 12J PERV +22 96
#note nigel plays PERV at 12J instead of 10J at least partially because the threat of the S.
>JD: EEEIMOT M7 EMOTI.E +28 52
#note quackle prefers EPITOME at 10G which I missed because it gives back fewer cheap points to the triple word score, and blocks the hotspot at 10J.
>Nigel_Richards: DFINU 12A FUNDI +28 124
>JD: AEEGUUW A12 .UGU +24 76
>Nigel_Richards: CNN 8G C.NN +6 130
>JD: AEEEOTW 10J WEE.E +34 110
#note a pretty big gamble to put the other E on the end given the massive number of hooks and his apparent bingo threat. quackle also thinks that AEOT helps me bingo more than AOT on this board, which is intriguing (I guess because of the open N?). but WEET adds no new threats to the board, and if nigel blocks on the right next I won't have a lot of places to bingo. There's also WOWEE#/FUNDIE# but I didn't know FUNDIE#.
>Nigel_Richards: DLOR O8 LORD +24 154
#note I actually held WEETER. interesting that nigel didn't want to play LORD at O7 - what does it say about his rack?
>JD: AIKMOST B10 KO.MIS +56 166
#note whoa, I'm back
>Nigel_Richards: AGLOV L3 GALVO +20 174
>JD: AABILNT 3E ABLATIN. +63 229
#note whoa
>Nigel_Richards: AHY H1 AY.H +42 216
>JD: AIJOQSY 2J QI +64 293
#note epic draw and the threat of drawing a massive JOEYS play on row 1 next turn. the joys of blind luck
>Nigel_Richards: AAENNZ 4A ZENANA +56 272
>JD: ?ADJOSY G13 JOY +38 331
#note my win chances are really good here with a reasonable play. unfortunately I missed a CSW bingo here that I could've guessed on but didn't know for sure - JOYPADS#. The next play that comes up is one that would be tough for me to make - JAzZY for 69, burning the blank and also making sure that nigel doesn't score cheap points using the Z. I can see the logic in JAZZY, but burning the blank now would seem to me to leave me less able to control the rest of the game, whereas with JOY I have an 80+% chance of bingoing next turn.
>Nigel_Richards: CEIRX 5B XERIC +54 326
>JD: ?ADILSS N1 DaLASIS +71 402
#note do I play LADYISMS# here if I knew the word? I'm pretty sure the answer must be no - why would I leave the lane on column N open? I did miss ISLANDS for 4 extra valuable points. oops. poor form. I had been thinking about maybe playing DALASIS at 5B with 6 underlaps if nigel hadn't blocked, so the word was stuck in my brain.
>Nigel_Richards: ?EFGRST N12 EF +20 346
#note I asked nigel after the game what play he was going for on his play, and his answer was two vowels - I think if this his actual rack, which I believe it was, he can draw EI and hit GREYLIST# and STERIGMA#, but then I play AUBRETIA at the top to go out! It took a bit more searching to figure out what he was going for, but the answer is a draw of AU, in which case he has GRAYOUTS at the bottom and ZASTRUGA/SASTRUGA on top - and my best play of YBET loses by 2. This is why you put in the time and effort to finding ISLANDS!! awesome fish by nigel, lucky me he didn't hit the 1/36er
>JD: AEIIRTU 15F A.RIE +24 426
#note this is actually my best play, in spite of his unexpect response
>Nigel_Richards: ?BEGRST 14D GoB.ES +38 384
>Nigel_Richards: UNKNOWN (challenge) +5 389
#note TORPEDOER# is CSW only. I challenged although he has BESETS/AWHETOS for 2 points less
>JD: ITU O13 TUI +15 441
#note my first win over Nigel Richards in CSW! achieved in spite of monumental blundership on my first move
>JD:  (RT) +4 445
