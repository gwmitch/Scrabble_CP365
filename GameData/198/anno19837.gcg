>Michael_Fagen: AKT 8G KAT +14 14
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIISYZ F8 SIZY +44 44
#note Looks like J8 SIZY keeps the right of the board more closed than F8 SIZY does the left, and gives back less points. Small but sillly mistake to start things off.
>Michael_Fagen: IMX E11 MIX +38 52
#note well, at least now the top left is pretty much sealed already.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIIRTW 14B WAITER +35 79
#note 13C WA(X)IER looks way safer and just all around better than this. 0/2
>Michael_Fagen: EGV 15A VEG +29 81
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIOORT 13D O.O +14 93
#note I didn't like much here, but this gets rid of a lot of cheap scoring plays.
>Michael_Fagen: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 81
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINORT I2 TENORI.E +61 154
#note Problems with I2 TENORI(T)E: immediate floaters, new 7 line created. Problems with I8 (T)ENORITE: much more scoring opportunity for Michael, 3x3 (variance) opened, leaves the top right unlikely to get closed down, ever. With his 6-tile exchange I'll take my chances with this placement, no matter that I'm giving him so many floaters.
>Michael_Fagen: ?DEELLU J9 DUELLEd +64 145
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEENOU H1 CANE +28 182
#note missing 15J (D)ECANE, which seems like the better play by a bit, although I actually prefer the board after CANE enough to the point where it might be better against Michael, who thrives with floaters.
>Michael_Fagen: NY 11I Y.N +12 157
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEFJOU 15H JU.O +30 212
#note I had quite the decision on my hands here. YEN made JU(D)O much better than it was, since the S hook doesn't matter there anymore. It made F(L)UED a bit better too, cause it would seem he has an S at least, and (WAITER)S/ a 4 letter play could really sting, also it blocks some bingos with an S in the middle. But the J is really bad here, so I don't like keeping it. A play like 5H D(O)JO, which I missed, has a lot going for it besides its leave. It blocks a LOT of bingos, and I mean more than you could usually hope for on a board like this. (ED)S is no longer a threat, a plurality of 7s hooking (YEN)S are no longer a threat, and the floating R is no longer an issue, etc. That makes DOJO my all-around favorite. FJO(R)D was also a possibility but that didn't accomplish much and held pretty badly for the lead I needed to maintain. So yeah, this play seems like a medium error, unfortunately.
>Michael_Fagen: ACT G10 ACT +26 183
>Joshua_Sokol: AABDEFQ 6E AFEA.D +22 234
#note I wanted Michael to challenge this, but unfortunately that didn't happen. This was a clear mistake anyway, since I missed the possibility of playing off my Q with QAD(I) 9C.
>Michael_Fagen: AHI 5D AHI +27 210
>Joshua_Sokol: BEFPQTW 4A WEPT +30 264
#note WEFT looks better, somehow whiffe on that. But I probably should play through this anyway, huh?
>Michael_Fagen: ?AENORS A4 .AgONERS +80 290
>Joshua_Sokol: BBELPQU 2F QU..E +36 300
#note I think I have to play off my Q now and hope to be bailed out of my terrible leave, or be able to play PL(E)B/BL(E)B next turn. I still had scoring options if this game became a slugfest
>Michael_Fagen: AFOT 13I F.OAT +24 314
>Joshua_Sokol: BBLPRSV L12 V.RS +28 328
#note I probably need to keep my S? I really didn't know how I could win unless I drew the other one, even if I kept this one. I also keep missing BL(E)B, and this time it might very well be the best play. But the V was just so bad here given the pool, but PRSV is still so much better than BBLP. I think this was a mistake. I'm not sure.
>Michael_Fagen: DINR 3E DIN..R +24 338
>Joshua_Sokol: BBGHLPR B2 PL.B +20 348
#note Not the draw I was hoping for at all, but I'll have to do with this. Or BL(E)B. BL(E)B is better, again. I saw (A)LP H8 a few turns before this, but playing off two with so many consonants was just so unattractive. Anyways, these mistakes are adding up. Maybe Michael didn't even know BLEB...
>Michael_Fagen: MO A1 MO +16 354
>Joshua_Sokol: BGHIORU 9H B..OUGH +20 368
#note At this point I had him for sure on the S. So it looked like I could do nothing at all. (V)UGH was the only thing that looked like it might win, but it gives Michael way too many points as well as good prospects for going out in two. There are a bungh of plays that probably win with an S draw, but I didn't see any way out. Looked like I had to phony AND I had to hope he pluralized it. So that's what I did, and I played it out as such, coffeehousing that I was just done for, that this gave back so many points...
>Michael_Fagen: DEGIILS O4 GLIDES +45 399
>Michael_Fagen: DEGIILS --  -45 354
#note After the game we looked the endgame over. It didn't look like Michael could win without pluralizing BEDOUGH*. This isn't true, but we didn't do an exhaustive post-mortem, so it makes sense that he had some non-phony wins. Here's Michael's thoughts on the position. Take note that he had less than 2 minutes on his clock at this point.
