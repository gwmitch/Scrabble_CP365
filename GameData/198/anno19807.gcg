#note 3 minute ISC game, 11/21/14.
>Noah: BDFJQRY -BFJQY +0 0
>Carl: AADEIOT -AIO +0 0
>Noah: ADKLRTU H8 TALUK +28 28
#note KURTA looks better given Carl's short exchanges.
>Carl: ADDEIQT I7 QADI +35 35
#note I saw the A hook for TALUK a second too late, but this can't be much worse. 
>Noah: ADFHIOR J6 FIDO +35 63
>Carl: DEIRSTU 13F DUSTIER +70 105
#note I don't know why I suddenly thought DUSTIER would be better than STUDIER. This looks pretty dumb in hindsight. (-6)
>Noah: AAHJORX 12K RAJAH +44 107
>Carl: EEHNOOR O12 .ONE +21 126
>Noah: MOOTVXY N11 M.YO +27 134
>Carl: EEHLORY 11J HOY +30 156
>Noah: ?AOTUVX K4 OVA +17 151
>Carl: AEEFLRU 12A FERULA +29 185
#note It's all too easy to get married to a play in Speed Scrabble. OVA suggests bingo tiles, so it's no time to be opening big lanes. FLUE L1 would be a better play regardless because it keeps a better leave and scores about the same.
>Noah: ?EENTUX C6 UNEXpE.T +96 247
>Carl: CEIINNV 3I VINIC +35 220
#note NIEVE 8A is best. Didn't see it.

>Noah: AEIOOTT A11 A.OOT +24 335
>Carl: ADEEGSZ 8L Z.GS +72 368
#note This wins the sim, but ADZ 14E seems better to me. 
>Noah: ?AEINST 1A cIN.ASTE +113 448
>Carl: ABCDEES J2 B.D +15 383
#note I'm down to the minute of overtime here and spend most of it determining that there's no point in fishing with ID J13. With no time left, I play off two and hope for the best.
>Noah: BILMORW B3 WOMB +28 476
#note The only play that never loses.
>Carl: ACEEPST O1 PECTASE. +89 472
#note -10 points for overtime = TIE GAME! YAY!!!!! Noah: Wow!!
