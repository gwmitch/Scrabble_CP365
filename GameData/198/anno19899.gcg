#note Perhaps MUSIC to keep the E and score an extra point. Also might make it easier to keep the board under control?

#note Couldn't decide whether to take the points with JIAOS# 2J or opt for a fishier move like this. I decided I didn't love the potential of the GHL leave on this board, so it made sense to play off the H and angle for a bingo next turn with GL?.
>Piotr_Andronowski: EINUV 1C UN.IVE +39 266
>Evans_Clinchy: ??ABEGL B2 AB. +24 294
#note I spent a loooooooooooong time debating GORGEABLE# and GOUGEABLE*. Eventually I decided I had no clue and I was tired of wasting time, so I just played this. Bleh.

>Evans_Clinchy: EEIORRT A13 REO +14 386
#note Thought it made sense to block eights here.
>Piotr_Andronowski: CEIR 12H CERI. +23 357
>Evans_Clinchy: BEMORRT D10 TERM +17 403
#note Really anything that blocks bingos in this area works fine. I missed YBORE#, which appears to be the best option here.
>Piotr_Andronowski: EFINTUY H10 NI.ETY +33 390
>Evans_Clinchy: BIORTUU 14F BI.TOUR +17 420
#note Lazy. My best play is BISTRO or SUBITO in line F, since it blocks his best play of FAND#.
