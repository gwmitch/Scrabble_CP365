>JD: ?ADELNU 8H UNLADEn +68 68
#note a familiar bay area foe! and a nice rack to start
>Peter_Armstrong: ABIORSW N5 RAI.BOWS +66 66
#note uhoh, I sense a shootout coming
>JD: AEMOQRU O1 ROQUE +47 115
>Peter_Armstrong: CEGNOTY J2 COGENT.Y +72 138
>JD: AEHIMVY O12 HIVE +51 166
#note after each spending 5 minutes on our first two moves we realized at this point that the clock wasn't running.
>Peter_Armstrong: AIMO 11J MIAO. +20 158
>JD: AMNRUWY K3 YUM +32 198
#note I liked the idea of trying to turn the board gradually into a more defensive contest, hence my choice of YUM. quackle prefers just taking the point for WANY
>Peter_Armstrong: AEENRTT 15H ENTERAT. +77 235
>JD: AILNRVW L10 V.W +18 216
#note quackle says just take the points for WISH. I was overreacting to keeping the V, but might as well take the points
>Peter_Armstrong: DIITX 14D DIXIT +31 266
>JD: AIILNRZ 15A NAZI +46 262
#note for some reason I didn't play ZILA. not sure why
>Peter_Armstrong: DEJ 3I J..ED +48 314
>JD: BFILLLR 2L FIL. +22 284
#note my draw was pretty crippling, but I could've at least left myself a vowel by playing FLIR/NAZIR#. I thought of NAZIR but for some reason this play escaped me.
>Peter_Armstrong: KNOPS 13I KNOSP +42 356
>JD: ABDLLRS 13E LAB +26 310
#note quackle suggests LABIS# at E11 which I didn't know to open up some new lanes.
>Peter_Armstrong: AFGHRTU 9B FRAUGHT +71 427
#note uh oh
>JD: DELRRSS 4J ..RS +26 336
>Peter_Armstrong: GIO 8A GIO +19 446
>JD: DELORST H7 L..E +4 340
#note I think that peter only plays GIO at the spot he did if he's holding the last N, although I shouldn't necessarily assume the worst. in any case, I am probably down too far to have a chance, so I do like my play as a spread-cutting measure since it makes it quite hard for him to block all the bingo lanes, and there are lots of Es for me to draw to complete my rack.
>Peter_Armstrong: ?ACEEIN 6B fIANCEE +69 515
>JD: DEOORST 11B ROOSTED +73 413
#note only a few things to do differently, maybe FLIR would've helped.
