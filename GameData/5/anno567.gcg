#note This was good for leave purposes, but the resulting board position is poor for bingos. Surprisingly, FETE (I6), using the same tiles for 3 fewer points, sims about 2 points better.

#note This game seemed to contain more dinky fishing moves than usual for me. Maybe OMEN or MENO would have been worthwhile to take out the triple hotspot. I don't like MONOS as much.

#note EMU (3M,27) is worth considering, but I think the stronger leave is worth the 6 points.

>Bing: CENNOST M1 ..NT +17 239
#note Mildly annoying that CONSENTS got blocked. I think this play was fine - still grooming, waiting for an opening.

>Bing: CEENOST D1 CO.T. +24 263
#note OK I guess, but I didn't really like giving Mike a way to score without opening up something for me in return. ONCE (D10,14) is interesting, setting up the T hook.

#note This would have been a fascinating endgame if the score was closer. Knowing that spread wasn't going to matter for the standings, I weakly took a straightforward sequence. But there was a neat setup available: UPBY (H11,14).
