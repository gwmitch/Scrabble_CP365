#note The first in a series of close decisions. I judged that keeping the S was worth the 10 points.

#note UNSEX M3 is the other major choice, but I think this move was fine. Keeping the firepower of the X made sense, with a play at 10E highly likely, and I was opening the right edge of the board for my S.

#note I was happy to find this setup, which pretty much guaranteed some sort of 45-point play or better. Possibly KUDO (A10) is stronger, for the increased bingo chances.

#note The moment of truth. Playing the bingo would empty the bag, thus lose if Nathan had a playable bingo (about a 14% chance on the face of the tile pool). Fishing off the K would probably give me a bingo, but it wasn't a sure thing. And this would potentially give Nathan another chance to fish. Were there any other clues? Nathan's last play suggests the bag was likely to contain 2 or 3 A's (since he didn't play HA), maybe this was enough to tip the scales. Personally, I think only the result was wrong.
