#note ANION (6B,20) sims best here. Normally, I would expect the superior leave (AENR vs. ER) to roughly make up the 4 point difference, but in this early-game position, the board is already getting somewhat constricted. After a typical opposing play, such as some 3 letter word at 5C, many bingos may turn out to be unplayable.
