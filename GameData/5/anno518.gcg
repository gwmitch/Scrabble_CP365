#note I think it was about at this point when Kenji and Doug wandered over to start their Board 1 game, which would decide the tourney. If I couldn't win, maybe I could torpedo Kenji's chances by blowing a challenge. Kidding! I really wasn't sure about this word, and the game was surely over if it stayed. Spread was not any concern to me.
