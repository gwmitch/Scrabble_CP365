#note I could have bingoed through the D (probably CtENIDIA is the best one), but keeping the blank for only a 29 point sacrifice seemed like a bargain.

#note So far, everything was looking good. For the game to slip away, opponent would have to set up a bingo line, and I'd have to be unable to block it. So I should just score a few points, not open anything, and keep flexible tiles, right? Wrong.
