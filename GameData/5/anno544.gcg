>CC: DEOTX 8H DETOX +42 42
>Bing: ABDORTY 7K BOY +25 25
#note Obviously, BOY at 7G scores 2 more points. But the open E would combine nicely with my leave, and taking out DETOXING/DETOXIFY was another benefit.

>Bing: AEEGTUY 3M TUG +24 187
#note Nothing was very appealing here. I probably should have gone with GUYED (9E,17) to clean up the rack.
>CC: IIIII -IIIII +0 138
>Bing: ACEEEIY 1G AE +14 201
#note More ugliness. I guess this play was okay. YEA (1D,12) sims best.

>Bing: AFILNTW A4 WALT. +21 364
#note At a different score I might play FLAW or FAWN (C12,28), but with the lead and with 2 blanks out that was too crazy. 
>CC: KL L11 .LK +14 305
>Bing: EFIINNR 13I FIN. +15 379
#note ILK was very ominous. While I could probably weather a normal bingo, the threat of a heavy Q play was too much to ignore. Possibly, IF (M13,22) would have been a better block, though it seems wrong to open the triple lane.
>CC: ?AEINQU 14E QUINAtE +75 380
>Bing: EEEINRR 15K EERIE +21 400
#note Prospects were not too good, but this would win if the E,O, or blank were in the bag, and at least tie with the U.
