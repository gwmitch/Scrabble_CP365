#note This looks like a slight mistake. Obviously, the ISV leave is much better than OOSV after GHI 12B, but not enough to make up the 14 point difference. Taking out opponent's QI plays is also worth something. Against that, the board was so wide open that maybe trying for a bingo wasn't such a bad idea - it did work out okay this time.

#note Very tricky position. I considered XI 13B, but it looked like that would be a loser if opponent had the I to underlap. (On deeper analysis, that assumption may be seen to be flawed). With the heavy tile pool, I could hope for no out-in-2, and the 31 point XU play this set up might be good enough to win. That was my thinking, anyway. 2-in-the-bag endgames are tough: it's usually not possible to go through all 36 possibilities, and you sometimes just have to play by general principles. With the benefit of Quackle, I see that XI actually wins 60% of the time compared to 38% for PUNT. But opponents don't always play perfectly, either...

#note Well, I dodged another bullet there. CWM 13G, keeping 2 spots to go out with ADFT, would have won easily.
