>jason: AEEEEOV 8G EAVE +14 14
#note I like an exchange here; EAVE is the only play considerable and even that allows a lot on both ends, for just 14 points and a rotten leave. 
>hector: ?AAIQTW 7F QAT +18 18
#note I considered WAIT and AWAIT down the F column, potentially setting up a healthy cash on the Q next turn, but given the gift of the early blank, I want to cash that as quickly as I can, and that means I'm not going to fiddle around with the Q here. I realize that in some instances I'll get a home-run bingo with the Q if I play for it, but in this spot, I just want the win and I already had an edge on spread.  
>jason: EEEEILO I8 .EE +7 21
#note An exchange again can be considered. 
>hector: ?AABIWX J10 XI +50 68
#note Nothing else is close. 
>jason: EGILOOR H10 LOGOI +18 39
#note The -ER keep is always gold, but LOGIER nonetheless is best. I always see LOGOI as a back hook to LOGO, but funny how I don't associate it with IGLOO - I need to clean up that part of my game. 
>hector: ?AABNRW G11 WAB +26 94
#note Not a bad play but the extra points on NAWAB G11 probably are worth spending two bingo-friendly letters. 
>jason: CDEHOOR K5 HOOD +25 64
#note The right play, and it also mucks up what I want to do. 
>hector: ?AFINOR I12 OAF +22 116
#note I saw the only bingo and knew it didn't play. I don't think OAF is a blunder by any means but there is better stuff here. NAIF L4 has some interesting aspects; it's doubtful Jason will hook everything if he plays down the M column - since OI has just one hook - so I'll likely have a choice of OF_ or HA*_ for my bingo spot next turn. 
>jason: CEINRRS 6J C.R +11 75
#note Okay, he sets up a great hook area - and I can't cash it. Oops. 
>hector: ?AILNRR 13G ...R +6 122
#note I was pretty sure nothing was here, and that's the case. I'm not sure BOAR is all that great, though. I didn't see many other ways to ditch the extra R without compromising the rack too much. Of course I then did something silly, overfilling by hitting the second blank on a 1-pick. 
>jason: EHINRST M2 HINTERS +78 153
#note Two spots and this is clearly best. 
>hector: ??AILNR L3 LAI. +20 142
#note What a funny positon. Nothing from I15. I would have played a bingo from 2H if something was there, setting up counterplay in multiple areas, but there's nothing. I hate the N8 options, they just give too much back. LINeAR N1 is pretty hard to see, I think, especially since I devoted a lot of time looking for the good bingo that isn't here. Neither LAIR or LIAR show up on the initial "generate choices" list. I'm assuming LAIR sims better than LIAR because of the AN-E possibility, but I'm surprised there's a two-point difference in win percentage. At the end of the day, I think LAIR is a decent choice from this position. 
>jason: ADDEEGN N2 END +25 178
#note Not bad but GAED N1 is better. 
>hector: ??AENOR 15I sENAtOR +74 216
#note Yeah, 74 is the best you can do here. I looked for the giant O-column bingo that doesn't exist, of course. Given the lay of the board, SERRANO is probably better than SENATOR, to tuck the Rs and put the O at the right corner. 
>jason: AADEGLP 14L PAGE +27 205
#note Looks best to me. 
>hector: CEFNRTZ 13M REF +26 242
#note I completely forgot about the BOAR-T hook so FET wasn't an option, unfortunately. 
>jason: ABDIILS 1N BI +19 224
>hector: CDNSTTZ -CDNTT +0 242
#note There's no specific way to make the Z sing right now, but I have to assume it will be an asset eventually. 
>jason: ADEEILS H6 E.. +3 227
#note A clear sim winner, setting up a second S spot and likely to be bingo ready next turn. 
>hector: MMORSUZ 5E MUMS +20 262
#note I wasn't sure if this was a good play over the board; by this time I had already flushed a ton of game time away, and the other game in the room was over, I think, so the conventration level was mildly compromised. I was pleasantly surprised when the sim had my back. I just need to get lucky and hope he hasn't clicked on the O column. 
>jason: ADEILPS 4D PA +12 239
#note There's a star play here that I didn't know, and there's a second star play that I likely would not have seen. 
>hector: AEORTUZ 3B AZOTE +37 299
#note Maybe not the best of my options, but close enough. I'm figuring if he bingos through the A or at the RAM hook, at least I have a good chance for a healthy counter - and I'm up 60 to begin with. 
>jason: CDEILSY B2 D.ILY +34 273
#note Not the sort of play I was happy to see. He scores well, retains the S I assume he has, and I'm sitting on a bunch of garbage. 
>hector: DIORTUU A6 OUT +14 313
#note I forgot the AZOTE-D hook, but even with that I might have made a play here anyway. Also, I'm down to maybe 90-120 seconds and for the first time all day I'm not sure I've tracked right. Rather than play a good endgame, I might just have to get lucky ;) 
>jason: CEIIKNS O4 SNICK +42 315
#note Some interesting choices but I think that's best. For fun, note the unplayable bingo Jason's holding. 
>hector: DIJNRUY B8 INJURY +34 347
#note It scores, it doesn't have a major defensive issue, and it's something I saw quickly, so down it goes. 
>jason: EGINSTV 13A G.VE +22 337
#note Looks like one of the best options. Quackle doesn't see a win here. 
>hector: DLTUW 2F WUD +28 375
#note I'll outrun what this gives back. A funny little game - a blue hair would look at the box score and say "JQXZS??" and write off the game as an easy win. But it felt like I had to work a lot harder than that. Blah, blah, blah.
