#note This is the claim to fame of this game.  Chris originally put down WILDCAT, then switched it around to this for whatever reason.  Here was a guy rated nearly 2000 facing a naive 18 year-old.  Naivety wins (or loses, I guess).

#note EUGENIAS would have fit nicely, but ZA was several years away from goodness.

>Chris: CFHOU J3 FOH +18 383
>Joey: EGNO K5 ENG +22 395
#note I can score 1 more point with this at 4L to make the recount a tad less stressful.
