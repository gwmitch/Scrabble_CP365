#note The board is just getting more closed for bingos. But there's a glimmer of hope. If I can manage to draw an I, (FAN)ZINES 14G would get me back into the game. So my job is to find the best play that keeps ENZS together, at least that's the way I decided to proceed.

#note I suppose to should have tried a two-pronged strategy of opening another bingo lane plus keeping the I-draw alive.

#note I love this play. Granted, it never paid off, but this setup gives me a legitimate chance of getting back into this game. For those just tuning in, I've hung my future on drawing an I for (FAN)ZINES, so why not sweeten the pot for when it does hit. (YE)A wins the sim.

#note Still no I or blank for the biggie. Hope is dwindling.

#note And now my opponent starting playing off Is. It looks like no payoff for me.

#note I can't win at this point, but please let me draw an I as I empty the bag!
