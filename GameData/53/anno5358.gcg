>Steve: AGMRSSU 8G MUG +12 12
#note Was unsure of MAGUS. SAGUM is also good, and deemed best by C-player. A 2-ply sim reveals MAGUS to be best, followed by GUM. SAGUM is third and then MUG.
>Rob: OT 9H TO +9 9
>Steve: AAANRSS 7G ANA +18 30
>Rob: BEILRST 6A BLISTER +68 77
>Steve: ?AARRSS A3 RAS.oRAS +80 110
#note The other bingos off the B are BRASSARt, and BRASSARd.
>Rob: EN J9 EN +7 84
>Steve: EEGKOUW 5C KUE +26 136
>Rob: OTU K10 OUT +8 92
>Steve: AEGILOW L6 AGLOW +16 152
#note B9 GOALIE is C-player's choice. My play misses the board completely. L12 ALOW is a close second, but Rob's obviously fishing for two turns now. Wouldn't want to give up a 3x3 ending in -WARD, -WOOD or -WING!
>Rob: AEINPRS 12G PAIN.ERS +72 164
>Steve: AEEEIIT M10 TE.AI +17 169
#note It's correct to get points instead of passing here. Sim says playing 8K E(L)ITE is about three points better in valuation.
>Rob: HLLMTUV 14L V.M +16 180
>Steve: DEEEFIR 13C DEFIER +29 198
#note 8K FLIED. I was going for turnover. FE 7C also does well in the sim.
>Rob: HPU B10 HUP +29 209
#note This made me wonder if my last play blocked Rob from reaching the DWS.
>Steve: CEEFLTX 14D LEFT +40 238
#note H11 CAREX
>Rob: ?AEINOT 3A .ElATION +66 275
#note Mistakenly scored as 68 in the game, so I was playing the remainder of the game under the assumption Rob had two more points. And, with no recounts at club, he actually did end up with two more points;-)
>Steve: CCEEHJX 2D HEX +61 299
#note A little better to keep the H in your rack. Duck says valuation is 55.7 for EX, and 53.1 for Hex, even tho HEX scores nine more points.
>Rob: DDGOY K2 DODGY +27 302
#note Can't judge a play by its results, but EX on the last turn would have given DODGY up top for 48.
>Steve: CCEJNWZ 3J C.ZEN +32 331
#note Duck likes B2 JEW. I was hoping to hit a big play with the W at 1D, so chose this. It's 4th best on Duck's list, and wins 66 percent of the time, to 80 percent after JEW.
>Rob: IVY H1 VI.Y +42 344
>Steve: BCIJLNW D12 J..L +24 355
#note Critical turn. I was worried about a big play centering around the Z, like L1 DOZE, but realized there wasn't much I could do to stop it. I was also worried about QAID at 15A, and ultimately defended against that game winner. Q says that's correct, but ups its winning percentage to 64 by playing (P)IC 12B. My choice of JELL wins 60 percent. Big reason why is because it's harder to hit a big play at A1 such as BLEW or BLOW.
>Rob: ADIOOQR 4K .ADO +39 383
#note Since the E is in the bag Rob doesn't have DOZE, but he does have a good scoring play off the Z. Trouble is, he most likely gets stuck with the Q after makinig this play. N1 QINDAR is best.
>Steve: BCIINOW H11 B.. +5 360
#note I instinctively block the Q. Duck says there's better ways to win, starting with B(L)INI at 8K. In fact, blocking the Q loses to optimal play.
>Rob: EIOQR 2M ROE +16 399
#note I liked Rob's set up, but once I see it, it's easy enough to block. He has a winning play, however. Can you find it?
>Steve: CIINOW M2 ...O +5 365
#note It's obvious that I need to block. Wasn't 100 percent on CRED, so played this. 
>Rob: IQ N12 .I. +7 406
#note Best.
>Steve: CIINW O1 W. +15 380
#note 9B WHUP scores two additional points.
>Rob: Q -  +0 406
>Steve: CIIN 8L .I +2 382
#note Getting stuck with an I was my biggest worry. Under a minute on the clock, I ditch the first one, and have a spot at 7B for the other if necessary.
>Rob: Q -  +0 406
>Steve: CIN M1 C.... +8 390
#note Duck is unruffled, even under time pressure. 6J C(YA)N for 21.
>Rob: Q -  +0 406
>Steve: IN 10A ..IN +7 397
#note C-player gets this wrong, interestingly enough, playing (KI)N, and then getting stuck with the I. It still wins, but by only two. If you didn't find Rob's winning sequence earlier, it begins with OI at 2N, which allows the Q to go down on the TWS at 01.
>Steve:  (Q) +20 417
