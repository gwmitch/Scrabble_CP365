#note i guess i can sim with E? as a partial opp rack, but i don't know. my games with maddy always end up really closed, but i thought EAU was decent. i either gotta go all the way with REATA or do something like D4 IMAUM. maybe reata. TEDIUM M8 is also kind of funny. (-5.5) to IMAUM. ADIEU is another option!
