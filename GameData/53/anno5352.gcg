#note I wasn't a big fan of the board-killing Q(I). I still like PEW best, although exchanging QW is an interesing idea.

#note I saw but chickened out on COMFITS, convicing myself that only CONFITS is good (when, in fact, both are good).  I decide to take the sure points and leave myself a decent shot to bingo in another turn or two.

#note I knew I was taking a big chance playing REGAL, leaving myself AIO, but I was concerned about a big play with the J or Z in that spot, and I didn't see any other play that scored anything close to 21.  There was also a psychological advantage to drawing back even to you.  However, all of this could have backfired big time if I had drawn a rack full of vowels....

#note Fortunately, I drew some consonants, including the Z, and the blank!  Lucky break for me.  I miss VALORIZE here, but that's a pretty tough find.
