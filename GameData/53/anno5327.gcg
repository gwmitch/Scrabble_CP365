#note J(A)R might have been better to set up (JAR)L, but this gives no S hook.

#note What a nice play this is by Libero - big points for bad tiles, and closes lines.
>Libero_Paolella: AEEGIIU 9G A.EE +28 210
#note Enough coddling this Q; I'm not getting any U's or I's.

#note Trying to set up something on the bottom row.

>Libero_Paolella: AEY A6 AYE +26 252
#note I could have played off REBEC and kept the ST for another try.  Where are the blanks?

>Libero_Paolella: ELOTW 12F TOWEL +16 306
#note Not much choice but to throw the S into the triple-triple lane, but Libero did play five tiles, so...
>Ross_Brown: ?INNRSS 13I SINNeRS +69 303
#note This looks like his best play for points, possibly setting up an S.  I didn't suspect that he was holding back OUT for his next play.
>Libero_Paolella: OOUUFPT 14J POUF +34 340
#note Yikes!  Seven tiles in the bag.  Which seven?  Would it be better just to play off a tile and hope he draws drek?  Surely he's got at least one of HHQ by now...  How could a triple-triple possibly lose?
>Ross_Brown: ?EIMORT O8 MORTI.Ed +140 443
#note Ye gods!  "I hate this game," quoth I.
