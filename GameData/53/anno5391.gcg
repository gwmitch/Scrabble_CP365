>David_Jones: EEIIRSV 8G VIE +12 12
#note best, ekes out just exchanging the I.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AELOPRR 7H PREORAL +68 68
#note J6 PERORAL is much better.  I forgot this rack had an anagram.  Even so, this is about the worst bingo.  There is a bingo through the V as well.
>David_Jones: DEEIIRS 8M DIE +17 29
#note Quack like G8 (V)IE for 10 less points, for improved leave and more open board.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AABKMR J4 BAK.R +28 96
#note I strained for -MAKER bingos.  There were no bingos.
>David_Jones: ?DEGIRT 5G TRE.DInG +68 97
#note 5E DRIfT(A)GE or DiGER(A)TI gets the double-double.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AIMOUW 4C MIOAU +16 112
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AIMOUW --  -16 96
#note I whiff on this play transposing my tiles.  Best was 5E OU(TREADInG) which I didn't think of.
>David_Jones: AEENOTY 9J YE +20 117
#note Quack likes H1 TOYE(R).
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AIMOUW 4C MIAOU +16 112
#note Let's get it right this time!  I entertained 10K MIAOW, which turns out to be much better keeping U?.  OU(TREADInG) is best again.  I gave myself a mental pep talk here, no more careless plays.
>David_Jones: AEJNOTT 3G JOT +37 154
#note best.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AEHSUW 3B WHA +34 146
#note best.
>David_Jones: AENNNST E4 .NTENNAS +82 236
#note three N's!!!
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?EPRSUX O8 .XPURgES +101 247
#note I vocally turned down my dream play 11E (S)UPeRSEX here - just 82 points..  L9 aRUSPEX also played which I saw.  (E)XPURgES* scored the same without giving away the X in a triple lan, except it's phony.  (E)XPOSURE is the other 101 point bingo.  David didn't bat an eye, and it looked right to me too.  I also scored this as 91 instead of 101.
>David_Jones: BEINOQS 4L QI +45 281
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EHIOTVY 11C YE.HIVOT +67 314
#note OMG!!!!!
>David_Jones: BENORST L9 SORBENT +76 357
#note David wasn't sure on 15H SORBENT(S). The other playable bingo is M7 (AD)SORBENT.  Neat. 
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ACEILNS 15G CANIS.EL. +83 397
#note Luckbox McGinty at your service!
>David_Jones: AADFLNO 12A LOAF +31 388
#note Even with D7 FOAL(E)D.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: CEEGOUW F10 W.O +30 427
#note It seems like the one who gets to the Z first will win.  Keep in mind I have myself scored as 386 at this point-- but I don't want to turn down all these points.  The many ply sim winner is 3M WOG.  My play is still 56.09% to win (although much less with 11 less points), but I'm probably toast if 12A (L)UTZ or H1 ZO(O) happens.
>David_Jones: ADDGMNO A8 MODA. +24 412
#note David holds the unplayable GODDAMN.  Many ply sims says A7 MANGO(L)D.  Digs deepest into the bag and scores.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: CEEGIUZ 3M ZIG +48 475
#note Drawing the Z was clutch.  ZIG or ZEE at 3M put the game away.
>David_Jones: ADFGLNU 13G FLANG.D +34 446
#note Champ says 13G FLANG(E), saving DU for the double whammie* M13 DU(E) next.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: CEEITU B5 CUTIE +15 490
#note I saw 6C CU(T)IE, but I was only 99.97% sure (JUT)E was good, and I'd look horribly foolish throwing away this game.
>David_Jones: U 10N U. +6 452
