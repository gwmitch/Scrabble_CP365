>Ross_Brown: JKLLORR -  0 0
#note This is my Game 12 at the "2009" Kingston Cup, January 17, 2010.
#note I didn't pass here - this is just how I annotate games where I go second.
>Libero_Paolella: AVV 8G VAV +18 18
>Ross_Brown: JKLLORR H7 R.J +10 10
#note Quackle heavily prefers an exchange.
#note J(A)R might have been better to set up (JAR)L, but this gives no S hook.

>Libero_Paolella: AEEGIIU 9G A.EE +28 210
#note What a nice play this is by Libero - big points for bad tiles, and closes lines.
>Ross_Brown: EEEQRST -EQ 0 151
#note Enough coddling this Q; I'm not getting any U's or I's.
>Libero_Paolella: IOY 13B YO.I +16 226
>Ross_Brown: EEEORST 14B OE +16 167
#note Best.
#note Trying to set up something on the bottom row.
>Libero_Paolella: AEY A6 AYE +26 252
>Ross_Brown: BCEERST 15C SECRET +30 197
#note I wrote down (A)CERBEST and chickened out on it.  It's good.  :-(
#note I might have played off REBEC and kept the ST for another try.  Where are the blanks?
>Libero_Paolella: CDEU D1 CUED +38 290
>Ross_Brown: BDFIINN F2 BIFID +37 234
#note Best.
>Libero_Paolella: ELOTW 12F TOWEL +16 306
>Ross_Brown: ?INNRSS 13I SINNeRS +69 303
#note The only bingo.
#note Not much choice but to throw the S into the triple-triple lane, but Libero did play five tiles, so...
>Libero_Paolella: OOUUFPT 14J POUF +34 340
#note This looks like his best play for points, possibly setting up an S.  I didn't suspect that he was holding back OUT for his next play.
>Ross_Brown: ?EIMORT O8 MORTI.Ed +140 443
#note Yikes!  Seven tiles in the bag.  Which seven?  Would it be better just to play off a tile and hope he draws drek?  Surely he's got at least one of HHQ by now...  How could a triple-triple possibly lose?
#note Quackle says this wins 97.9% of the time.  With the knowledge of Libero's "improved" OUT leave, this becomes 90.5%.  O13 (S)OM, 78%.  Pass, 64%.  10B (M)ET, 62%.
