#note My reasoning was that Lou must not have had the R or S hooks, and was setting up the A hook to score big on column A if I chose to block or use K11. I think playing on column A is a reasonable alternative to OILED 10F, though DOULA A1 would be better and I didn't see it. As it was, Lou had overlooked ATONY, and OILED would have worked out a lot better for me

#note I'm surprised VATU C10 is simming slightly better. I'm in a pretty good situation here no matter what, though.

#note Held it, but didn't challenge...GAZETTE is a verb, but it's only GAZETTEER. Seeing he had GEsTATE for 78 didn't help either.

#note OILMAN H10 was a possibility, but I didn't want to open it up.
