#note Jeff actually went first in this game and exchanged four tiles. FARLE is probably correct here, but I didn't see it, and liked my chances at bingoing by drawing to LEARNS.

#note Guess I should have been. AROMATIC is 18 points better.

#note 10B JAW is the choice of C-player, but I liked how JEANS set up the Z. But if you're into set ups, check out c7 ZETA! JAW still wins the sim, however, but it's close.

#note AIRY preferred by the Duck. Thought I needed to keep the vowel.

#note Jeff was under 30 seconds on his clock, which probably led to this fateful choice.

#note Playing B(I) setting up OBI on the tws is probably better. But that would take forethought.
