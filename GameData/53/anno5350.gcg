#note TOLLED sims much higher than OLD when inputting my opponent's rack...like 16 points higher.  I'm not entirely sure why.  As it is, EELST is less likely to get borked on the draw.  My opponent is relatively new to the game, but has been studying quite a bit...I thought there was a decent chance that she would find one of the real bingos in her rack and, unless she sees LAMSTER, open up a 3x3 line for me.  EELST should give me a better chance to take advantage of that.
