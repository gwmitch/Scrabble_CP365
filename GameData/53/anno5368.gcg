#note Took a minute, but decided on this over PRAO/PROA. Very willing to hear arguments for the others, though. All three sim pretty much identically.

>Sam: BCELLNS F6 CL.N +12 141
#note Not a great play, though not terrible. Don't like Quackle's top choice of CELEB E7 with him fishing. Didn't know LENIS 2J, but that doesn't muck up any of the bingo lanes. If I had a redo I think I'd play CELEB E5.

#note After playing pretty well all game I hit a terrible patch in the last few moves. I saw EMOTE N10 later in the game, but it was obviously too late.

>Sam: EEIIMOO 3G I.M +17 395
#note This was close to correct, not that it means much. OI G2 is the obvious winning play.
>Darin_True: AZ 2F ZA +33 378
>Sam: EEIOORU 7K E.U +4 399
#note Darin and I both missed his third Q play, leading to this mistake. OI K10 is best.
