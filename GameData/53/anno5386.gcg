#note Sim likes keeping DES or DESS instead. Ex. BFSV makes sense.

#note W: Interesting play, to me anyway. Hoping the JO spot stays open next turn. Sim prefers taking it now, I imagine because there is a huge dropoff in what I can do with the J after JO, but many options for the Z (maybe ZIP still, MAZE 1G or ZEK with an E)

#note I think I should have gone with M3 here, as the M column is just as dangerous as the O column. Alternatively I can just play AETHER M8 and try to win in a different way.

#note Basically 12G is going to sit there until I play something there, almost definitely. Don't like any of Quackle's plays getting rid of the F. VAN G1 is interesting though.

#note S: Will mentioned that he was all set to play the cool ABEYANCE L5 before I blocked it
>Sam: AFGHIRT 12G FRIGHT +37 345
#note Considered UH L1. In the end this was too many points and too much turnover to give up.
>Will_Anderson: ACEENRR 12A CRANE +22 345
#note W: I think my (flawed) thought process here was something like this: whoever gets the blank is probably going to win, you just played 6 tiles, so I also need to play a lot of tiles. If you have the blank already, I'm already in big trouble, so why not open the board? I'm basically asking to lose with this play but get bailed out by my draw.

#note Champ Player actually says ex. AEIIIU, with this close behind. The real seven in the bag were AACINUY.
