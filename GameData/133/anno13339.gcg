#note Final game against Dave. I have a win on him, but he has spread on me. I've got to win, and being way ahead of Conrad, I'm not too concerned. However, he was playing the bottom seed, and almost caught me in the end with a 600 game!

>Noah: AINPTVX 8A NATIV. +30 209
#note Seemed better than 2A PAV 32. Quackle strongly disagrees. One nice thing about NATIVE is an EXPO draw at O1 and just a more generally open board. However, after playing off something like AX G9 I might be in good shape. (after PAV)

#note EXPO was tempting, but I like taking the points.

#note DORBUG is the other play here. FUG keeps a much better leave along with the OWED hook, which is usually a good opening, but he will almost certainly play on line H next turn. If I knew OWER#, though I think DORBUG would be correct, because I'm very likely to draw a setup.

>Noah: ?BDOQRT -BOQT +0 306
#note DORB# looks right, but I didn't know it. It's so cool to miss all these words I don't know! (no sarcasm) Also of note is DORBA#.
>bing: DO 15A OD +21 395
>Noah: ?DEMRRY 6K DERM +21 327
#note DREY# looks like the best play, because it's not that easy for him to block all bingos perfectly. I didn't know it (surprise!) I liked this play because it was difficult to block without any DERM hooks. UNRhYMED is pretty cool, but I don't know if it bingos enough. It may, given how little DERM and DREY will work. I'm happy with this play given my word knowledge. DERM and DREY might actually be pretty close.

#note DROOBS is correct.
