>Jack: ?ADENOP 8D PANDOrE +74 74
>John_Karris: QRUY J6 QU.RY +45 45
>Jack: BBDEHUU 10F HUBB. +23 97
#note BUBU 7C seems to be best. HUED 9E is a possibility. I liked HUBB(Y) but I do like BUBU's leave of DEH better than DEU. 
>John_Karris: ACEELMS D6 EM.LACES +78 123
#note BUBU. Even without EM(P)LACES, HUBBY allows (B)ECALM for 45. 
>Jack: ADEIILU K4 DUI +19 116
#note championship player likes (B)AILIE, (Q)UAI, and DUI best in that order. 
>John_Karris: IPU C12 PIU +18 141
>Jack: AEEILNT 4D LINEATE. +70 186
>John_Karris: ?AGINRT L6 sTARING +77 218
>Jack: AADEEIO 9C I.EA +13 199
#note O(L)EA in same spot or ODEA 5F which I didn't see.
>John_Karris: GGO 8L .GOG +18 236
>Jack: ADEJMOW C5 DOM +20 219
#note I try to get cute here, setting up my J in hopes of drawing the H,R,T. 

JAM at 3C or C5 is pretty solid, JAW or JOW at B11 just seems dumb with the 4 I's out, same with JE(E) at 6B (or J2) with the 3 A's out. (T)AJ 7L is okay, but I may need to keep that lane open.
>John_Karris: CITT F2 TI.CT +11 247
>Jack: AAEJRWZ B4 RAJ +55 274
#note I definitely lucked out with this draw. With the S I would have SWARAJ, that'd be fun. I also noticed at this point that if I had an O I'd have (B)EZOAR and was considering playing B4 JAW in hopes of drawing an O. 
>John_Karris: DEOTY A1 TOYED +38 285
>Jack: AEORTWZ H10 .EZOAR +81 355
#note that worked out pretty great
>John_Karris: EEFNORS 2C SOF.ENER +63 348
>Jack: HILORTW 1G HOW +43 398
>John_Karris: AKNO B11 KOAN +28 376
>Jack: AILLRTW I10 .RAWL +38 436
#note I was set for playing AWL and then realized the R fit too so played it on impulse forgetting there were only 4 tiles left in the bag. Fortunately John had one too many V's. 
>John_Karris: EINSSVV 15D VIVE.S +27 403
#note John put down V(AL)VE at first. He said he was just teasing me.
