#note My logic for bingoing rather than taking HILL was that the bag was so full of clunkers and the board was so lousy for bingoes, so bingoing after HILL might be hard. But if I don't take HILL and let Adam take the spot, I am going to need to bingo again anyways. So this has got to be a mistake.
