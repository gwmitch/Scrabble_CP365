>Travis: IRT H1 TRI...... +61 119
#note Challenged. This was the only JUGATE extension I wasn't sure of.

>Travis: ?ADLNOU N5 sOULDAN +84 203
#note Trusted him on sOULDAN#, which I didn't know, but I didn't think BULIMICS was good.

>Noah: CEILPRY --  -42 360
#note I thought YCLEPE* should be good because YCLEEPE# is good, but Travis had just studied this list this morning :(.
>Travis: EO 3K O.E +12 351
>Noah: CEILPRY 13H PRICEY +36 396
#note Still quite bad. Even after looking for awhile, I couldn't find PYRIC 13F, which is much better.

#note I didn't know FAUR# or FEEN#, and thought about them for awhile. THEEK# is a pretty solid play, but I didn't know it. For people not savvy in Collins, like me, this is the classic "let your opponent fish vs. weather an outbingo" situation. Possible plays are this, BORK, and PERVS, and maybe something else. What is your play? Or rather, since I didn't see THEEK#, rank some plays.
>Travis: AEEIILS B10 LIE.E +20 397
#note Travis thought the bag was empty. If he'd played BOI, he might've won if I didn't see YAPOK, though I might've tried OWER# for a tie (I didn't know OWER#).
