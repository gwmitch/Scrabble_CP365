#note GUTZER# is a fun word!

>Noah: DGIKMRU A5 MU.K +30 73
#note I found this choice difficult. I considered MURK A5 30, GUM 9C 30, and KID H1 31. I disliked KID because of the poor equity, and, though blocking a scoring spot was nice, there were still plenty of other places for Conrad to score. MURK seemed a bit better than GUM because it conserved the GO to open more reasonably from than the GU/OM, and blocked a more dangerous scoring spot.
>Conrad: BEGINPS 9C GIB +30 113
#note PINGS looks a bit better, according to Quackle.
>Noah: ADGIIRY 4G .YGIDIA +36 109
#note Maybe GYRI. I played this too quickly, not thinking of GYRI. I do like the open board this makes, though.
>Conrad: EFLNPSV N2 PELF +33 146
#note Scores 37 at 3J.
>Noah: ?NNRTUX 6F X. +25 134
#note I guess NNRTU? isn't good enough to justify this over NiXY. Burning the blank is always a tough decision. 
>Conrad: EEHNSVY O5 YEVEN +51 197
#note Drew the challenge.
>Noah: ?ANNRTU J4 .NsURANT +59 193
#note DUNNARTs#. Also URiNANT#.

#note Conrad also "misses" a bingo -- HARMANS#
>Noah: ?AEELRU 11D ULcERA.E +78 303
#note If I knew bLEUATRE# (BATELEUR#), I would have played it! It takes no hooks, which is nice.

>Conrad: DEHNRRT B2 THREN. +30 321
>Noah: DEIISTT N8 TIDIEST +78 409
#note Not sure which TIDIEST I should do. This one gives bigger scoring plays back, and that seems like a good thing, but I'm not sure. Conrad does need a decent score along with a bingo.
>Conrad: CDILORS O12 DIOL +30 351
>Noah: AACELNW M9 WEAN +30 439
#note WHA apparently has the best valuation.
>Conrad: CEOOORS 14A O.OCORES +63 414
>Conrad: CEOOORS --  -63 351
#note Challenging this would lose me the game if it were good, and not challenging would always win. However, spread is important, and I thought Conrad wouldn't know this to be a word, and just be trying it for spread. I was correct.
