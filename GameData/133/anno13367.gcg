#note I was kind of hoping that he wouldn't see the g hook and that I'd be able to use it later, since I'm pretty far behind at this point.

#note So far so good, he blocked the triple lane there.

#note Now here is where I make the worst move of the game. I have around 35 seconds to spare, so I should've checked and seen EH, which would have won it for me. I also missed the much better fish, BABY, for 34, which also would have one unless Jason saw the hook on LITTERED. Given that he has FOX, EH has a value of -23 if you add it to Jason's next best move. BABY has a value of -19 given that I will draw an s next turn and play LASHING.

#note Too much!
>rockzombie: ABGILNS 1D ABLINGS +94 494
#note I managed to draw the right tile, but had I gone with baby or eh, I likely would have won either 508-500 or 540-528.

#note Great score, as I had 5 bingos and still lost. A memorable game, even more exciting due to it being played in under 8 minutes.
