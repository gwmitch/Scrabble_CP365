>moh: ?AGOORY 8G GOY +14 14
#note GOY is best. YOGA is also fine, although I prefer to keep stable bingo tiles early, especially with a blank. So I'd rathre keep an A than use it at this point.
>carl: AEELMWX 7I MEW +21 21
#note Your MEW is best. Keeps a nice leave and scores well.
>moh: ?AINORU G1 AROUsIN. +60 74
#note All of the bingos use the G. RI(G)AUdON and ORI(G)ANUm are better than my play since they avoid opening up row 1 for big plays.
>carl: AEEILNX 1G .XEL +33 54
#note You had ALEXINE at L6 for 89. If you don't know that word, a play like 8K EXILE 65 is much better than your AXEL. Take the time to look at all hotspots, even when you have a play like AXEL that scores pretty well. EXILE was at the only other hotspot on the board, so if you had looked there, you'd probably have see it. Another point: even if you decide to play along row 1, why would you play the L and leave the consonant-heavy AEIN. (A)XE is much better because the leave is more balanced. Simulation shows AXE clearly ahead of AXEL in the same place, and it's mostly because of the significantly stronger leave.
>moh: AORTTUZ 6F Z.T +32 106
#note My ZIT is best. There aren't many other plays that score well, and J4 RAZ(E) 33 keeps two Ts, so it's inferior.
>carl: ACEINOR 9I CON +21 75
#note 8K OCEAN or OCREA for 35. COINER is a such a bingo-prone leave that a play like F6 (Z)A is also reasonable. Generally, though, just take the 35 points instead of fishing for a bingo. 
>moh: ?ALORTU L3 TORULAe +78 184
#note My bingo (or the equivalent TORULAs) scores best. There are some cooler words (3B ALUMROOT for instance) but nothing better.
>carl: AEHILPR M2 PAH +25 100
#note The top plays here are 10J HA 28 and 6J HA(U)L 33. They both keep really nice leaves and score well. Your PAH scores fewer points and opens up a huge spot for the OPAH hook. If you are going to play from M2, HIP is better than PAH because it has a better leave and doesn't open such a huge spot along row 1 (notice how much bigger the opening is for PAH since it takes a vowel as a hook; a vowel at 1M means a heavy consonant could show up at 1L, and then the play can hit 40-50 easily).
>moh: BEFQTVW N1 WEB +29 213
#note It's rare for an exchange to sim close to a 30-point play, but it happens here. The leave is so awful, and I open such easy scoring for you, that it's tempting to just throw tiles back. In general, I prefer playing through bad tiles when I'd ahead (if it's a close call), since I want to bring the game closer to resolution when I'm leading. So I chose to play, which is fine. N1 FEW or WEB are the only non-exchanges worth considering. If I chose to exchange here, I'd keep ET.
>carl: EEILPRU 10J PE +22 122
#note It's a shame you didn't see PUERILE, since it plays from O2 for 93 points. Your play is fine if we ignore the bingo. Also reasonale is 4A PURLIE(U), but it's pretty obscure.
>moh: DFJQRTV -DFJQTV +0 213
#note It seemed like an easy exchange at the time, but 3E FJ(O)RD 18 is actually a nice little play. I didn't see it, and there's nothing else that makes sense other than various exchanges. I kept the R, and case can be made for keeping RT or DR. I almost kept DR because of the CONE-D hook at M9, but decided against it. 
>carl: EILORSU O1 ER +26 148
#note SOILURE (at O3, M9, or 11D). If you miss the bingo, 1L LO(W)E 33 is strong. If you decide you play where you did, choose OR instead of ER since the E is better to keep than the O.
>moh: DIILORS 2G .ID +16 229
#note Spots like this are tough. Lots of options, nothing outstanding. Honestly, there's not much difference among the top ten plays. They all win between 86-88% of the time. Since I can score decently with plays like 2F I(R)ID and M8 IDOL, I decided not to break up the bingo potential with a play like M9 DIOLS (which I almost played). 
>carl: ILNOOSU 5I LOU. +8 156
#note There aren't many appealing options here. 1M O(PAH) 15 and 1L LO(WE) 17 are the highest-scoring plays that preserve our S. 5J OU(R) and 5I LOU(R) (your play) are fine, mostly because there just aren't many scoring options. These plays keep decent tiles to try to make a comeback next play. That said, it's situations like this with few scoring options where the ability to scour the board and find spots like M1 to eke out some points becomes critical.
>moh: ADILORS 8L .RID +15 244
#note Interestingly, the best play here was probably the best play for you last play: 1L LO(WE) 17. I didn't really like breaking up the strong bingo rack I had, but decided to take (A)RID, which I guess is fine. M8 IDOL is also solid, as is My SADI 30.
>carl: ABIKNOS N6 BO.NK +27 183
#note Your play is solid. It's a little stronger to take the 11K spot with BONK or BOINK there.
>moh: AELORST 11G OLESTRA +75 319
#note OLESTRA is the only bingo.
>carl: AAFINQS 4F Q.A +13 196
#note O5 QAI(D) is best. Your play is next-best.
>moh: ADEIITV H11 .IVID +30 349
#note Pretty clearly the best play. All of the reasonable plays are from H11, and this one keeps the best leave.
>carl: AFGINNS 10D FANG +13 209
#note E3 FAN 25 is best.
>moh: AAEIIOT O10 IOTA +11 360
#note All of the vowel dumps are pretty close here. Nothing scores very well, so it's going to be something like IO(D)ATE, OI(D)IA, A(V)IATE, or IOTA.
>carl: DINSTUY E9 D.INTY +20 229
#note DISUNITY at 14G or 14C. It's a tough find. L11 (R)UNTY 24 or (R)INDY 26 are fine.
>moh: AEEEEIR 9C AI.E +13 373
#note Or EI(D)E in the same spot.
>carl: EGHNSSU 13B HUN. +14 243
#note At this point, I'd probably just take the points with 14J GUSHES 33. 14K GENUS 17 is also fine, as is 14A GUSH(Y).
>moh: AEEEMRV E2 REAM +25 398
#note 12B AME(N) 25 is best.
>carl: CEGJSST 14A JET +32 275
#note A11 JESTS 47.
>moh: EEEFISV 14K FIVES +27 425
#note My FIVES is best.
>carl: CGSS M10 S.C +12 287
#note Your SAC is best.
>moh: EE 13G E.E +8 433
#note J1 (L)EE 12 is best.
>moh:  (GS) +6 439
