#note GALTONIA# sims a little better, but I don't mind playing a more wide-open game.

#note Ugh, gotta get better at finding CSW-only fours. YEED#, YERD# and YEDE# are all better.

#note Sims best. It's fine to wait on the Z with multiple good spots for it.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EILT M11 LIT.E +28 273
>Evans_Clinchy: AADESUZ J4 SAZ +43 274
#note This looks best. The N10 spot scores a little more, but it's kinda crazy.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: KO M3 KO +18 291
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ADEENU 7K U.A +9 283
#note I liked this because I might have an exclusive hook if she doesn't know/see UVAE#... though the sim recommends shutting down the TWS with DEED or DEEN# at 15L.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: BI 6H BI. +14 305
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DEEJNN N6 JEED +35 318
#note This seemed automatic to me, but it's actually a significant blunder. DEED or DEEN# is still the play -- wait on the J until I can use it without giving back big counterplays.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?NNNOPV -NNNPV +0 318
#note I thought getting rid of consonants made sense considering the pool, but the sim recommends a shorter exchange, keeping NOP? or NO?. Maybe I can hit a bingo in line 5, like PIANINO# or something? Not sure.

#note I honestly didn't even look for a bingo in this position, since I didn't think it would be enough to win. But if I stop for a second and think, I might find PORCINO, and I might have to at least consider it. Instead I look for a fish, hoping to bingo out and catch her with points on her rack. This fish scores a little and hopes to draw one of the three unseen N's for RONDINO#.
