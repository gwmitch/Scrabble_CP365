>Rob_R: AAEQSTU 10E .QUATE +37 37
#note This and 10A AQUA(E) run pretty evenly. The difference, I think, is largely stylistic and dependent on the opponent. I judged that I would be giving up more to give Carol an A to play through than giving her a set number of possible hooks, especially holding an S in hand.
>Carol_D: DGI K10 DIG +27 61
>Rob_R: AAEGMSS 13H MASSAGE +78 115
#note See the previous comment, though Quackle does more strongly prefer the 13I placement. Again, I judged that placing the E in the 3LW line was more dangerous than giving up hooks.

>Carol_D: ABJ M9 JAB +29 134
>Rob_R: ADEEINS I4 ANDESI.E +68 236
#note 14C ANISEED is a bit stronger, I think. I debated between the two across the board, but in retrospect it's quite possible that Carol won't be able to really wind up and sock me at 15H.
>Carol_D: HILOT H1 LITHO +47 181
>Rob_R: ACDENYZ 4G C..ZAN +40 276
#note This sims third best to J2 ZED and the brilliant and beautiful 14E ZANY.
>Carol_D: EIOV 6B VOI.E +20 201

#note Best in winning percentage.

>Rob_R: AADILNR 14C NADIRAL +66 369
#note This isn't volatile or anything.
>Carol_D: EFTW 15H WEFT +57 332
#note Well, that could've been worse...
>Rob_R: ILMNORS 15A LION +20 389
#note I'm pretty sure this is best. Getting hit with something like IBEX is a really good way to lose this game, and even something involving the W or Y would be problematic.
>Carol_D: BOUXY 5K BOXY +42 374
#note Carol would have had BUOY for 50 while holding the X, though I probably would have been able to withstand the hit.
>Rob_R: ?EMPPRS 2H .MPRESt +32 421
>Carol_D: EIKOTUW D3 KIW. +22 396
#note Both Carol and I missed C3 KOT(O)W, which ends up 11 points better. My best sequence is 13A PRoP, giving up 3K WOKE but going out with 12B EMS.
