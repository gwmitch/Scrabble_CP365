>JD: EEFORRS 9H FOR +12 12
#note EERS is just about as good as EORS as a bingo leave r better, but FOR sims 3 worse than FER due to defense. Interesting. Maybe it's just because of all the hooks on FOR.
>Leesa: AY J9 .YA +14 36
>JD: EEIORSZ 11G ZOE.E +28 40
#note I passed up ZEES because of the easy comeback on row 8 but it's 14 better than ZOEAE. ZEES is also really good because she's signaling a strong bingo leave and it makes it much harder for her.
