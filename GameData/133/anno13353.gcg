#note Oh, oops, this isn't a word. Wasn't sure whether to fish with PI or exch I or to try to play through more tiles. Sim prefers fishing  or PILEI.

>Jack: AERSTTU I3 UT +9 48
#note Missed both UPSTATER and LUSTRATE. And I don't know why I played I3 instead of J5. It was cold okay!

#note Of the 2 bingos x 2 locations, this is best

#note ut
>Jack: AIMRSVW D4 MAW +32 156
#note I put down VAW and then picked it up and replaced it with MAW. I thought VAW gave back way too much and with all the Es out IRSV doesn't seem too bad. Champ player agrees. Also likes WAIV(E) with the vowel heavy pool or (A)SWARM which I didn't know for 45 but it has a crappy IV leave and it throws open the board. Sim suggests VAWS K3 which I actually kinda like since it takes out all lanes (except for paralleling against STRAWED). In addition, the S is not of too much values on this board.

>Emely: ?AENORS 2H ONA.ERS +23 258
#note Laid down ONAgERS at 9I, thought about it for awhile and then picked it up and played ONA(G)ERS keeping ?. I was so confused. She said after the game the she was worried about how much ONAGERS (the bingo) gave back. But the O or E is ONAGERS (the non-bingo) is dangerous too. 
>Jack: ABFLNNO 1E FLAB +39 351
#note Oh oops, missed FOAL for 46. She's picking up 6 new tiles though, not a bad idea to block the J spot. Champ player likes FLAB best actually, then FOB.
>Emely: EOZ K10 .OZE +28 286
>Jack: ACNNOOO L11 NAN +32 383
#note Spent a very very long time on this turn. I like CANON, or ANCON at 14G or COON at 14H. NAN is pretty bad. I am not sure why (Z)OON sims well and is liked by champ player. I considered NOON at the top.
