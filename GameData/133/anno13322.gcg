#note Quackle favors I8 T(O)D, followed by -DGLLT. I, on the other hand, favored a mulligan. Quackle calls it a 4.7 point error, but I wasn't willing to put faith in a two consonant leave on this board.

#note Quackle slightly favors playing the D as well. There's a case to doing so, especially after Zbigniew exchanged. His counterplay through the D is not likely to outweigh his plays hooking VOICE, even when you take the two-vowel leave into account. A small error, but one I need to learn not to make.

#note Quackle evaluates F5 URI(C) as about 2 points better than my exchange. Q and I agree that exchanging IRUU is stronger than RUU, given the number of unplayed I's in the bag.

I personally don't think this is a significant difference in this position, but if there's something I'm missing I'd love to know.

#note Best, due to the defense of beginning with a consonant.

#note Surprise! Zbigniew didn't actually have the E, which makes DISRATED look a lot better in hindsight.
>Rob_R: ADELNOR 13L LOAD +19 387
#note Right idea, but flawed execution. LOAN sets up a potential scoring play at 15L, but holds the D for extra points.
