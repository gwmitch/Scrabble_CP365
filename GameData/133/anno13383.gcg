>Rob_R: ADEELOY 8D YODLE +26 26
#note It scores, defends against the TLS, and looks like a transposition so it might get challenged.
>Paul_K: AELO 7D ALOE +18 18
>Rob_R: AEEFRSS 9F EF +23 49
#note I don't generally like playing off a second S for only a few points, as EFS would do here. Yes, it increases the rack flexibility to drop the S, but it is quite obvious that I have it in reserve. I prefer to keep the element of surprise unless I can score a fair amount with the second S.
>Paul_K: ADHJ I6 HADJ +35 53
>Rob_R: ABEERSS 10B BRAES +22 71
#note Quackle prefers J6 AB to create a new hook line, and to retain a strong leave. I agree in hindsight, though there is something to be said for trying to goad an opponent into a challenge.
>Paul_K: COW J5 COW +22 75
>Rob_R: AEEIOST 10I IOTA +22 93
#note OI 10H looks to be a bit stronger, I don't need to destroy the leave in order to score and maintain bingo lines.

>Paul_K: IMV M7 VIM +33 156
>Rob_R: ?IKLTWX 2G W.LK +21 241
#note Best, though not necessarily ideal. With the blank in hand, I would generally prefer to keep lines open even though I'm only up by a bingo.

>Rob_R: ?CEIIOT H12 C.TE +27 363
#note Nine points is enough to make up for the terrible leave in valuation, though evidently this is 0.01% less likely to win.
>Paul_K: AH 11D AH +22 229
>Rob_R: ?IILOOR 15D LOOI. +6 369
#note OLIO M11 is a bit better, as it still has defensive value in addition to scoring a few more points.
>Paul_K: ITU 12L .TUI +5 234
>Rob_R: ?ABEIRY 5J .YBER +24 393
#note None of Quackle's suggested plays block the I, which seems to confirm what I thought over the board -- the unseen pool does not seriously threaten a triple-triple. I thought to make a play to potentially set up a bingo line for myself, but I didn't execute it very well for two reasons. First, CYBER only takes a colloquial S, not in the OWL. Second, WALKYRIE scores more, takes the S, and is utterly beatiful to boot.
>Paul_K: EGIMNRT O7 MERIT.NG +83 317
#note Just because he wasn't likely to triple-triple doesn't mean he wasn't able to bingo at all.
>Rob_R: ?AAINPS O1 sNIPS +40 433
#note I really thought CYBER took the S. I could have stuck the V had I paid attention to the endgame.
