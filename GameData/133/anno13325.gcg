>Dave_Koenig: AAIOSTY 8E OATY +14 14
#note A very close call between this and exchange AOY, which in a 1000 iteration 2 ply sim came out basically dead even.  AY 8H was not far behind.  Party of my reason for trying this was that even though GOATY# is the only good front hook, I might deke her into trying something else. For example, BOATIE# is good, but BOATY* is not.
>Marsh_Richards: EOX 9E EXO +25 25
>Dave_Koenig: AAEIILS 7H AALII +11 25
#note Maybe AIA or AI at 7H.
>Marsh_Richards: EHMRT D4 THERM +39 64
>Marsh_Richards: EHMRT --  -39 25
#note Sure enough, my opening gambit paid off.
>Dave_Koenig: AEEOSSU 10D USE +20 45
#note I really wasn't sure what to do here, so it is refreshing to see that Quackle prefers my choice.  Even though the leave is still vowel heavy, I really didn't have any good options that used more vowels.
>Marsh_Richards: EHMRT 8L THEM +33 58
>Dave_Koenig: AAEORST 9M ORA +16 61
#note Sheesh, AEROSAT is a really bad miss here.  I've probably played that word at least 20 times before. Don't know how I overlooked it.

>Dave_Koenig: CEEEOST 12K SECO +26 125
#note This is a funny situation.  Prima facie, CEDE 11I seems like a good play that mixes scoring and a good leave, but the problem is that it kills the board in such a way as to make the S fairly close to useless.  It seemed instead that this was the moment to burn the S and not leave Marsh much to do in response.  This also tries to deke her into making a phony SECOS* hook, but she isn't tempted this time.

>Dave_Koenig: AEEGIRT 2A AEG.RITE +72 262
>Dave_Koenig: CGINORT (challenge) +5 267
#note I was all set to play FIGEATER, but she forced me to play a more dangerous bingo.
>Marsh_Richards: ?BEFLMP H1 P.LF +39 194
#note Marsh told me this rack after the game. I agreed with her choice, and so does Quackle.
>Dave_Koenig: CGINORT A2 .RGOTIC +36 303
>Dave_Koenig: ADIINNU (challenge) +5 308
#note I saw plays like CORING B10 here, but shutting down the A column was critical. If the score was reversed I definitely would have gone the other way.  Once she challenged this play, it made it almost equivalent on equity anyway.
>Marsh_Richards: ?ABEMNN 14G BENAMiN. +64 258
>Dave_Koenig: ADIINNU 15D INDIA +31 339
>Marsh_Richards: IKOSSVW E2 .ISK +25 283
#note This was the other rack that Marsh asked me about after the game. She was very short of time and her tiles are awkward, while she still wants to keep whatever lines open that she can for bingo chances.  While she's a heavy underdog in any case, it's critical to dump more of the heavy consonants here. For that reason, I recommended WOK 6L.  (If there were still E's remaining for me, I would play KOW instead, but here she holds all the hook letters.  This gives her the chance even if she doesn't get a bingo to maybe get a big J play to O1.  There's a case for KOW anyway, to give a second S hook at 5L, though that makes it a little easier for me to play on top of it at 5M-O to block the board.
>Dave_Koenig: JNOOPUU K3 PUNJ. +28 367
>Marsh_Richards: OW 15N OW +23 306
#note If she hadn't gone here I would playing YOU 15M.
>Dave_Koenig: ILNOOUY L1 LOONY +31 398
#note This is enough to win, but LOOPILY 3H is better, because it guarantees an out on the next turn.
