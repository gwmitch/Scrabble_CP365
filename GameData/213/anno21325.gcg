#note Jim realizes the next turn that he's missed GENOCIDE here
>Matt_Canik: ?BCENTT I3 B.NT +9 76
#note I should try to score more points here and play something like BET(H). 
>Jim_Burlant: AEF N2 FA. +35 113
#note Jim set down FA(D)E and then changed it to FA(D).

#note I chose this to eliminate SKI counters, but I leave NEVER hanging open. Maybe I should just play YEsTERN/NEVEs

#note POO? POI? Wasn't sure which to play - those 4 unseen Is are rough.
>Jim_Burlant: EIMOQRS M12 ROM +16 296
>Matt_Canik: AEIINOV N10 OVINE +37 347
#note This was a really tough turn - I can play VINO or VINE, or I can put down OVINE for 6 more. The O gives up big Q plays, but I am pretty sure I can outrun them almost all the time - the only ways I lose this game are if he bingos (i'm sunk either way) or if I play VINO and then he plays QUAILS/ROMS or something.... I like this play
>Jim_Burlant: AEQRU O6 QUARE +44 340
>Matt_Canik: AIIILUW 3A WAI. +20 367
#note Aaaand I draw IILUW and lose. If Jim finds the correct endgame sequence, I cannot win this game. I have to hope he misses the LI(T)H(E)R sequence here, but I will still lose to GIRLS/YEPS and then H(E)R(E). 

If I play AW(F)UL, Q says I lose to (Y)IRR/SHL(ON)G and GIRLS/YEPS then HERE. but I don't think anyone except Nigel sees YIRR SHLONG. 

I should play AWFUL because it makes it a little harder for him to win.
