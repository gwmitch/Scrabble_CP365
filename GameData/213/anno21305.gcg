>Jim_Burlant: AAEKNNT 8G KANA +16 16
#note The best play here is a word I didn't know, ANANKE, which plays at 8H for 30.  This is best of the rest if you whiff on ANANKE.
>Matt_Canik: DHISTW K3 WIDTHS +35 35
>Jim_Burlant: DEMNNTU 4H MUT.NED +26 42
#note I didn't know MUNTINED+, and didn't think UNMINTED* would fly.  If you whiff on the bingo this is as good as anything.
>Matt_Canik: DDOZ M1 DOZ.D +32 67
>Jim_Burlant: CEEGINO 1G COIGNE. +36 78
#note Matt was playing very quickly and I lost focus and let myself get sucked into it.  COOEEING was the only thing that jumped at me and I didn't look very hard at the rack past that.  I saw CONGEED, then this and stopped looking.  Two turns later I realized what I'd whiffed on.  It's one thing to miss MUNTINED, which I didn't know.  It's inexcusable for me to whiff on the common GENOCIDE, which I've played before.
>Matt_Canik: BNT I3 B.NT +9 76
>Jim_Burlant: AEEFSTV N2 FA. +35 113
#note I initially put down FADE, then kept the E despite leaving myself extra vowel heavy; I just thought FADE could give back too much, even if I did set up the V hook for myself.  This or FADE are equally strong in the sim's eyes.  66% to win despite myself.
>Matt_Canik: ?CEEILT 9C CEnTILE +75 151
#note Best bingo for Matt.
>Jim_Burlant: EEEOSTV E9 .EVE +12 125
#note Q gives slight preference to 10I EVE - I did this to open the board because I don't expect him to leave the board alive for long.
>Matt_Canik: AABIOU 5C OUABAI. +22 173
#note Nice play!  Beautiful rack dump by Matt.
>Jim_Burlant: AEORSST 11E .OTARESS +72 197
#note The cartoon devil tried to convince me that NEVE only took the back R, not the S.  Since I was only 50/50 on NEVES and this was a guaranteed 72, I took this.   OSSETRA 13C scores 3 more.  The consolation:  he still bingoes on his next turn even if I hit OSSETRA.
>Matt_Canik: ?EENRTY C7 RE.ENTlY +76 249
>Jim_Burlant: EFLMQUX D3 FL.X +28 225
#note Couldn't think of XYLEM, but this isn't awful per se; it's a miss I can live with.
>Matt_Canik: AGY 10H GAY +37 286
>Jim_Burlant: EJMOPQU 8A JE.P +55 280
#note At least I got this one right.  I'm still in the game but I'm in the hole - 30% to win.
>Matt_Canik: OOP 12J POO +24 310
>Jim_Burlant: MOQRRSU M12 ROM +16 296
#note I iniitially considered the obvious Q plays like SUQ 13K/M12 and they both threatened to give back too many easy points because of all the unseen I's.  I saw this, saw potential for both the S hook on row 15 as well as the I back hook to POOR and thought it did the best job giving me the opportunity to score.  Q agrees - this is best, and nothing else is worth consideration.
>Matt_Canik: EINOV N10 OVINE +37 347
>Jim_Burlant: AEQRRSU O6 QUARE +44 340
#note Best.  This keeps the S, which may come in handy for a tight end game.  Surely I'll land some vowels given that pool, right?
>Matt_Canik: AIIILUW 3A WAI. +20 367
#note Against perfect play Matt can't win.  Fortunately for him, he's playing me, not Quackle.
>Jim_Burlant: GHILRRS 10E .H +27 367
#note The two plays that win are 13J SHLONG (how many humans not named Nigel Richards will find that) and 12A LITHER (which I never saw).
>Matt_Canik: IILU E5 .IL +12 379
>Jim_Burlant: GILRRS 15I GIRLS +13 380
#note Forgetting that YEP takes the back S.  What's inexecusable about my not trying that is that it would have been the only way for me to win because it would have scored more and blocked his out, so I should have tried it out of desperation anyway.  Yes, I'm a dumbass.  I totally deserved this loss.
