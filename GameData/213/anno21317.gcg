#note for some reason, didn't come up with VIRILE, or exchange 1, which both sim a hair better.
>John_Karris: SYZ F7 S.ZY +24 24
>JD: AACINTU D8 .ACUA +20 46
#note wow, what an informative and unexpected sim result! The top two plays are playing LA for 15 and exchanging the U! exchanging a U leaves me quite likely to draw a bingo to the triple from the E such as ACTINIAE, ANTIACNE or CRANIATE etc., and I can even draw lots of bingos through the V. Meanwhile, LA scores almost as much as VACUA and also leaves me with an unusually high bingo percentage (50%). fortunately my play is only a few points worse.
>John_Karris: QSU J8 SUQ +42 66
>JD: AIIINRT K10 INIA +19 65
#note an exchange 1 would've lead to a 76 to 83 point bingo with any of the tiles I drew this turn!
>John_Karris: AEEIOTW -AEEIO +0 66
>JD: EIILORT 14I OILIER +21 86
>JD: EIILORT --  -21 65
#note well, this is awful. however, in my defense, a man dressed as a clown walked past us in the middle of this turn, so I was somewhat distracted and perplexed.
>John_Karris: AELNX 12H XEN.AL +42 108
>JD: EIILORT H11 E.TOL +36 101
#note I guess I was still kind of flummoxed, because I missed IXTLE here.
>John_Karris: HNT E11 NTH +18 126
>JD: IIKMORR C12 MIRK +25 126
#note just to complete the ugly sequence, I overdrew! I was all over the place. also, I missed KIR which would've prevented john from potentially scoring so many easy points.
>John_Karris: ?AGILNS L4 LAdINGS +78 204
>JD: ?DINORT H1 ORDINaT. +77 203
#note the bad plays continue! missed ANTIDORA 2x2. needed to calm down!
>John_Karris: BEEGR K2 GREBE +27 231
>JD: ADEEEIS 15A EE. +21 224
#note for some reason I was thinking that DEKE was a 6 point upgrade. for 9 extra points DEKE is probably worth it.
>John_Karris: TUY 2F YU.T +15 246
>JD: ADDEGIS 15E ADE.GIDS +62 286
#note I was hoping he might challenge the new bingo, but no dice

#note I'm in good shape to win from here...
>John_Karris: HTU 14A TH.U +26 303
>JD: ACEJOPT 5D CAJO. +28 334
#note didn't want to play JAPE with so many Os remaining. this really limits john's scoring options (average of only 24 points)
>John_Karris: OW G10 OW +15 318
>JD: AEMOOPT M7 TOO +14 348
#note OW probably represents some kind of fishing leave like ADENR or DEINR. the board is pretty poor, but his rack is above average. bingos he could have: BANDORE, PARDINE, AVODIRE, PADRONE, PRAIRIE or PROVIDE. I saw him as having about a 15-20% chance of bingoing, which is definitely an exaggeration. I can play POMACE on this turn which empties the bag and prevents him from fishing, but I was reluctant to let him bingo out. That said, I should've realized that john's play meant that all of the high-point tiles are still hanging out in the bag, such that I will have a very clunky final rack - john may be able to catch me just by outscoring me. as it turns out this play cost me the game.
>John_Karris: DEIINOR 1A DINERO +29 347
#note nice play, wins a majority of his endgames from his perspective.

>JD: ABEMPPV N8 BAP +22 370
#note I was pretty shocked by my draw, but in retrospect, I shouldn't have been - even if I do manage to draw the A or R that were in the bag, he still potentially has game-winning outplays. I overestimated my chances of victory in the pre-endgame.
>John_Karris: AIR O10 AIR +8 355
#note nicely done john!
