#note i strongly considered playing off the Y here to try for ISOGRIVS or VIGORISH but that seemed pretty dumb.

#note we learn after this play that scott has the score wrong and thinks he has a 30 point lead
>k8: HIOOSSV 12I SH +23 324
#note i went with a 'take as many points as possible and don't empty the bag' strategy here. why is VOID best? just because V is so rough on this board? why am i so likely to score so much more after VOID?
