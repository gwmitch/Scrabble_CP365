>David: AEW 8F AWE +12 12
>Reid: ADEEKSU F8 .UK +17 17
#note AUK is #3 (51.61%). I agree with Quackle 5-min Championship player. UKE and KUE at I6 (53.32% and 51.65%) are superior. I missed the AWEE hook.
>David: CERSTUY 11B CURTSEY +82 94
>Reid: ADEEJST D8 JEE.S +40 57
#note JEERS is #6 (27.58%). I did not like this play. I typically don't use an ess this way, but I didn't want to waste my J. I also didn't want to use both my E. JADE (S) at 7F are #1 (34.15%) and #2 (29.05%). JEU at C9 (28.15) is more my style and in line with my thinking. Missing the hook to AUK was a huge mistake here. 
>David: OQTU H4 QUOT. +24 118
>Reid: AADIOTV I1 DAVIT +26 83
#note AVOID at 12H is #1 (25.50%). DIVA and DAVIT at 9H are #2 (22.76%) and #3 (22.69%). I'm noticing a trend of missing hooks here. Didn't even think to look to hook QUOTE.
>David: EFL 1F FLE. +24 142
>Reid: ADDEOTW H11 .AWED +39 122
#note YAWED is #2 (30.39%). YOWED is #1 (32.03%). DOW at 9H is #3 (27.94%). I considered YOWED but couldn't remember if it was valid. I agree with Quackle here. Small error.
>David: FLPRU 14C PURFL. +19 161
#note I figured this was done to clog up lanes and that David planned to use the U. I was right as David later admitted that he had an H.
>Reid: DGIOOTX I12 GOD +28 150
#note My play is #2 (31.99%). I wanted to play the X but didn't want use it carelessly. OXO at 15A is #1 (33.84%) and it accomplishes my goal for the play but I'm still getting used to PO as a valid word because I didn't see anything but #3 DOIT (28.51%). While the percentages are small, I consider this to be a big mistake. Keeping the X makes a bingo next turn far less likely.
>David: EHY 15B YEH +26 187
>Reid: AAIIPTX J9 IXIA +31 181
#note IXIA is #2 (34.99%). TAWPIE at G6 is #1 (37.41%). ATAXIA at 2I is #3 (25.4%). I slightly disagree w/ Quackle here. I want the X out of my rack. TAWPIE is positioned nicely defensively but the board is still fairly open regardless.
>David: EGNNORT K3 RONTGEN +68 255
>Reid: AAHINPT J2 HA +32 213
#note #1 (14.61$) play finally. TAWPIE from last turn is now #2. HA at I9 is #3 (13.22%). 
>David: ABNR L1 BRAN +29 284
>Reid: AINOPRT I9 PO +24 237
#note #1 play here (12.73%). TAWPIE and TAWNIER at G6 are 2 (12.17%) and 3 (11.13%).
>David: AEINORS L9 ERASION +72 356
>Reid: AGINORT M11 GOT +17 254
#note BIOG and BOTA at 1L are #1 (0.73%) and #2 (0.67%). The only reason Quackle thinks this game is winnable at this point is because both blanks are unseen. I try to create a hook with GOT. My play is #32 based on valuation of all plays
>David: CEELOS N6 ECLOSE +16 372
#note David decides to eclose off the board, but it could have been done better with SOCLE at M3.
>Reid: ADIIINR O8 IRID +31 285
#note According to 5 min championship player, INDICIA at B7 is #1 (1.6%). BIDI at 1L is #2 (0.5%) and RADII at 011 is #3 (0.33%). I like RADII. My play is #14 (0.00%) and is the highest scoring.
>David: ??AIOZ O1 dIAZOs +70 442
>Reid: ABINNTV -  +0 285
#note I couldn't remember whether it was DIAZOS or AZIDOS that was the new word. Previously neither took an ess. I gambled and lost.
>David: EILMM G6 ME. +16 458
#note MM scores 24 at N2.
>Reid: ABINNTV 2C VINA +16 301
#note #1 play here. Yippee!.
>David: ILM 9A LIM. +9 467
>David:  (BNT) +10 477
#note Game was officially scored wrong at 477-299. 7 of my 11 plays are in the top 3. 8 in the top 10. I made some mistakes early by missing hooks. No missed bingos this game, but I did lose a challenge. Overall, I give myself a solid C this game. Not a winnable game, but the spread could have been 30-40 points smaller.
