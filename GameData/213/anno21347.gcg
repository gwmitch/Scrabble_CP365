>Liz_Gottlin: EIMNV 8D VIMEN +28 28
>Kevin_Bowerman: DHNOXYZ 9G DOZY +36 36
#note DOZY on the top has much worse defense. I almost played it so as to set up (DE)X until I remembered XED is now a word!
>Liz_Gottlin: DILS J6 IDL. +10 38
#note Exposed an S here, in which case ID(Y)L is probably a little better so as to set up 2 @S bingo lanes.
>Kevin_Bowerman: EHIINUX 7E HEX +49 85
>Liz_Gottlin: AOPS K3 APOS +14 52
#note Strange play.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AIIINOU L2 UNAI +20 105
>Liz_Gottlin: EILNOT D8 .IOLENT +20 72
>Kevin_Bowerman: ADIIOOP C12 POI +20 125
#note (L)IPOID. Didn't know it. I played this to set up @OID words next turn. 
>Liz_Gottlin: KRU 11D .URK +16 88
>Kevin_Bowerman: ABCDILO B11 COIL +26 151
#note Didn't know CABILDO

>Liz_Gottlin: RV 8M R.V +18 161
>Kevin_Bowerman: ADEEENU 12K DEE +21 263
#note I never see EAU, but I chose this for defensive purposes.
>Liz_Gottlin: AGHT 6E GHAT +51 212
#note I wanted to take out this spot all game, but never got a single tile that front hooked EM at all lol
>Kevin_Bowerman: AENNOUW 5F AWE +33 296
>Liz_Gottlin: IIRUU -IIRUU +0 212
>Kevin_Bowerman: GINNNOU O8 .INO +9 305
#note Just blocking things. I saw that this saved UN(WAXED) for next turn to make a bingo nearly impossible.
>Liz_Gottlin: FO I1 FO. +8 220
>Kevin_Bowerman: EGNNRTU H1 EN +23 328
>Liz_Gottlin: ?EEMSTT 13F MEETeST +70 290
#note TEMpEST is the valid one here. Didn't want to do anything that would risk me losing, as spread no longer matters here.

>Kevin_Bowerman: AGIOQTU 15L QUAI +80 441

#note I don't know what she played here. It scored 11 and left her with 8 points, so this is my best guess.
