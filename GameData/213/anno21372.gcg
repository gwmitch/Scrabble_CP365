>Reid: DEEEEUW H8 EWE +12 12
#note EEEW at 8F, 8E, or 8G are top 3 (48.05%, 48.00%, 47.95%). I had forgotten that EEEW was valid. I remembered EEW. My play is #7 (46.05%). Small mistake here. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CGINTTU I10 TUG +6 6
#note Kenji's Comments: I like it. Quackle not so much.

Reid's Comments: I'm lucky Kenji doesn't go first. CUE at 10F is #1 (45.54%). CUT at G6 is #2 (44.90%). TUG at G10 is #3 (44.35%). Kenji's play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. It is #6 based on valuations of all plays. I agree with Quackle's top 2 choices here. I think the TING leave is stronger than TINC.
>Reid: DEEENOU 12I .EODE +14 26
#note DONEE at G8 is #1 (51.32%). OGEE and OGEED at 12H are #2 and #3 (49.74%, 49.56%). My play is #7 (47.52%). I saw OGEED but thought my play was better. I think #2 is silly.#1 is nice. I agree with Quackles choice here. Small mistake again.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?CIINST M6 zINCIT.S +76 82
#note Kenji's Comments: I want to take away the easy options. Maybe not the best play or mindset. Admittedly didn't even look for INdICTS though I saw CuTINISE.

Reid's Comments: Kenji gets the first blank bingo and ess. CUTINISE at 8A is #1 (68.44%). INDICTS or INCITES are next two (68.25%, 67.71%). ZINCITES is #6 (66.94%). Small mistake here. 
>Reid: BEINRSU 13C BURNIES +78 104
#note #1 play.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: BEEITUY E9 BUYE. +20 102
#note Kenji's Comments: Saw both UBIETY and YETI. Chose this instead for a better lane and to "complicate the game". Marginal: wouldn't blame others for disagreeing.

Reid's Comments: UBIETY at 10E is #1 (41.32%). YETI at 11K is #2 (41.13%). BUY at 14A is #3 940.64%). BUYER is #4 (40.45%). I think Kenji makes a small mistake here and I agree with Quackle's #1 choice. 
>Reid: ADIOSTW 11K WI. +25 129
#note WATT or WAT are top 2 (60.79%, 60.15%). DOW at G8 is #3 (59.85%). My play is #8 (58.59%). This is a small mistake. I disagree with Quackle's top two. I like DOW a lot.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEIMNTT 12B TAM. +24 126
#note Kenji's Comments: I saw options. I don't know. Again just complicate the game, but WOT hits a lot, maybe too much, though fishing against Reid isn't my goal. That being said maybe TAME for 31? I admittedly didn't think about this as deeply as I maybe should have: just focused on lines, bingoing, and taking away easy spots.

Reid's Comments: TAM and TIME at F8 are #1 (44.11%) and #3 (43.66%0 WOT at K11 is #2 (43.98%). Kenj's play is #11 (45.24%). Another small mistake. I like TAM. WOT seems to give up too many points. I agree with Quackle here. 
>Reid: ADORRST 14B ROD +19 148
#note #1 play. I just closed my eyes and hoped Kenji wouldn't have an ess for a bingo. I figured the chances were slim, and if not, I might just get a triple bingo. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EILNPTV 8K VE.IN +27 153
#note Kenji's Comments: And all this stuff about anti-complication goes out the window. No idea what to do really other than play for equity, which makes me kind of sick. Maybe this is an argument against TAME, but I mean... isn't that a little harsh?

Reid's Comments: #1 play.
>Reid: AAHIRST 15D SHARIAT +91 239
#note My gamble pays off. #1 play. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EGJLPTU F6 JULEP +50 203
#note #1 play.
>Reid: ?ADEILV O2 DIVALE.t +65 304
#note ANVILLED at O7 takes the top 2 spots (95.42%, 95.40%). AVAILED at I2 is #3 (95.33%). I saw AVAILED but figured my play would close up the board more. My play is #4 (95.31%). I agree with Quackle here, but this is a minor mistake at most. I figured I had the game in the bag at this point, but the tile fairy had other plans. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ADGGOOT 2J OGDOA. +22 225
#note Kenji's Comments: I don't know. I need lines. I'm about to lose again. This might be wrong, but I'm not playing well today. I'm still playing better than most people: do I really deserve this shit?

Reid's Comments: TOG and DOG at N1 are top two (1.43%, 1.42%). Kenji's play is #3 (1.33%).
>Reid: FNORRRY 1H FRY +32 336
#note #1 play. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CGMNSTT M1 T.NG +10 235
#note Kenji's Comments: I honestly have no idea. This is probably really wrong and a little tilty, but I need to score, take away the easy Z/X spot, and hope to hit a bingo.

Reid's Comments: Kenji has the opposite to my problem. Exchanging CGMNT, GMNT, GMNTT, CGMNT are top 3 (0.50, 0.46, 0.46, 0.42)%. I thought Kenji's play was odd when he played it. Makes a lot more sense now. It's tied for #4 (0.41%).
>Reid: NOOOORR G4 ROO +12 348
#note NOON at 3J is #1 (99.00%). ROO at D7 is #3 (98.80%). My play is #2 (98.81%). I agree with Quackle here. My play is a slight mistake. I was trying to plug up lanes and balance. YON accomplishes the same thing without opening up lane 4. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CMPQSTX 10L M.X +34 269
#note Kenji's Comments: Exchange? I don't know, all my options seem terrible.

Reid's Comments: Exchanging MPQT is #1 (0.93%). Exchanging CPQX is #3 (0.58%). Kenji's play is #2 (0.75%). I disagree with Quackle. I like Kenji's play here. Giving up 34 points is rarely a good idea.
>Reid: AELNOOR F1 ALOE +8 356
#note My rack is somewhat better finally. I'm just trying to plug up lanes here. There is still the more likely B lane, but not much I can do about it. Not sure why I played my E here. NOO or ONO at F2 are top two (97.77, 97.57)%. NOLO at D6 is #3 (97.33%). My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. This was the biggest mistake thus far. My play is #43 based on valuations of all plays. I completely agree with Quackle here. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ACNPQST B10 QA. +32 301
#note Exchanging PQ is #1 (2%). Exchanging CPQT is #3 (1.17%). Kenji's play is #2 (1.42%). I disagree with Quackle here. 
>Reid: EIKLNOR K2 .ROK +18 374
#note KINO at 3H is #1 (100%). KLONG, KLIEG at 4I are tied for #2 (99.67%). EKING is #3 (99.50%). I didn't like my play here and neither does Quackle. It's not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. My play is #8 based on valuations of all plays. I agree with Quackle here, this is a big mistake. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CEINPST 10D C.. +7 308
#note Kenji's Comments: I don't have a clue. Spent 8 minutes and went for this, hoping for EPISTERNA, but this should never work unless Reid is really awful. Should be obvious where I'm fishing even if he doesn't know it.

Reid's Comments: PE or PI at A14 are top 2. PIS at 13K is #3. Quackle gives Kenji no chance of winning.Kenji's play is #10. I'm really awful. I wasn't even thinking about a 9. In fact, I remember thinking that CUP blocked the OBE hook, even though I had tracked and there were no O left in the bag.
>Reid: AAEHILN J9 AH +27 401
#note #1 play. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EINPSTZ 4A ZESTI.. +52 360
#note #1 play.
>Reid: AEFILN 5B LIEF +30 431
#note #1 play.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: NP 4J P.N. +14 374
#note #1 play. Kenji saw PANFRY as well.
>Kenji_Matsumoto:  (AN) +4 378
#note No missed bingos here. 8 of 13 plays in the top 4. 11 of 13 in the top 8. ALOE and GROK were not very good plays. Overall, I give myself a B/B+. I do think that Kenji had better tiles than me. While he had a vowel drought late, I had a vowel flood. We split the esses and blanks. He had Q Z X J and was able to use them well. I drew 26 vowels. 

Kenji didn't miss any bingos. 9 of his 13 plays were in the top 4. 11 in the top 10. Overall, I give him a B+/A-.
