#note I really want to protect the bottom left quadrant a little bit, and greatly fear about the board long term after row 10 plays.  The cost of equity is relevant but I think it's worth it.

#note I don't know.  All options are abysmal: OVA 6a is too easy for opponent to outrun, although better technically.  Hoped for opponent to lose mind or not have an A.

#note I'm pretty sure this was my rack, though not 100% certain.  Anyway, I prefer PURIN in hindsight, but I think I took getting burned earlier by a similar play (in game 1) a little too far.

#note If I played purin this position would be a lot more tenable, even though I'm still a hefty underdog.  Now I'm just desperate and I honestly think he has the S a lot, but my options are abysmal.
