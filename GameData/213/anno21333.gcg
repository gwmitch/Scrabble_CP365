>Amalan_Iyengar: HILNPSS J4 HIP +26 154
#note Quackle says its a tossup between HIP and SHIP. I liked HIP because it leaves me open for the S hook, with both the Cs out of play, and doesn't telegraph my rack

#note Best play that isn't OSMOLES
>Kevin_Bowerman: AFLO C8 LOAF +21 223
>Amalan_Iyengar: EELRSSS 3G LESSERS +77 271
#note Wasn't sure on LESSERS*, but figured it was worth the shot, being 18 points more than RES(T)LESS O5. Didn't know (T)RESSELS
>Kevin_Bowerman: LUU I3 .ULU +17 240
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AEGNWZ H1 ZE. +36 307
#note AGNiZE might be better here, but they're pretty close. Champ likes AGNiZE by 0.05%. AGNiZE is a lot riskier, but it does score a ton more. Really a tossup though. 
>Kevin_Bowerman: Q 10B Q.. +32 272
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AAFGNW L1 WA.N +22 329
#note Not a very good play. Quackle likes F(L)AW, which looks good, and GNAW L11. I don't like GNAW, because with 4 Ns out of 28 tiles, he could hit that spot a lot
