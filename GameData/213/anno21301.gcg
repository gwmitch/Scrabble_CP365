#note exchange A ranks best at 52% to win.  
It's almost 100% evident to me that Quackle does not have the six no-point rule programmed in.  if I pass, exchange, or have an invalid play challenged off, by rule the game ends.   
The odds of her having all one-point tiles and a blank or two now are very slim.  if I pass, I'm probably well over 90% to win with a negative seven final score.
It's club.   I'm not doing that.  The play I made rated 4th best

#note YOWIE I9 best, mine 5th
YOWIE loos WAY to aggressive   QAID/QADI is a game-changer I'm not willing to make that kind of spot for.

Quackle just seems to be more aggressive than me.  I hold the case S, but the unseen blank makes this feel like an unnecessary risk

#note BAN 14F best, mine 2nd.   
Maybe I'm far enough behind to warrant it, but that BAN idea looks too aggressive

#note SOLO O8 best, mine outside top ten
It was vital that I block up both tws spots as best I could, and I just didn't catch on
SOLO is just 56% to win even so, though my choice was only 25%.  Game.

Quackle says 100% to win... ?
