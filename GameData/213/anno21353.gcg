#note This gives back a lot on row 3 - KENO is probably better for that reason.

>Mack: ADEELRT 11A RELATED +73 164
#note Given my lead, I clearly should have played for column J on 6 less to avoid opening the board so much. Definitely not playing well this game. But I do happen to be psychic and knew exactly what was about to transpire.

#note Somehow I totally missed YOKE. Yikes. BUOY 3D is obviously way better.

#note Seems as good as anything.
>Quackle: AEINRST J3 STAINER +65 136
#note While the difference in win % is approximately 0.000000% given the score, I simply can't understand why Quackle didn't play GANTRIES/GANISTER here. 
>Mack: AIOORSX K4 OX +38 459
#note 12H IXORA looks a bit better to avoid giving back a lot of points on column N, but I didn't play it for 2 reasons: 1) I didn't see it, and 2) Even if I had seen it, I wanted 700 at this point and playing fewer tiles increased my odds of getting that done.

#note Ironically, missing RESTROVE gets me 798 instead of 794 had I seen it. 

I hope you enjoyed this wholly undeserved show of (LUCK)^âˆž!
