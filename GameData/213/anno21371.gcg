#note I didn't see what a bad play this was until a few turns later.  I wanted to block after ZOO and give myself a chance, but this is a horrible way of doing it.  Instead I really need to play XED j6 but I just missed it entirely.  XED 8m doesn't really work.

#note I honestly have little clue.  AAHS is the best blocking play, but then he plays AHA or AH, and then what?  I have ILST, the board is dying and I'm a bingo behind on a horrible board.  Heck, I'd rather he play ISOTHERAL at this point: to be honest I don't think he should bingo.  That being said my play is pretty extreme, but I want to hope he misses ISOTHERAL and punish and that requires opening the board.  I don't know.

>Cesar: AAEIMNS 13B ANAEMI.S +82 439
#note Maybe if I weren't so tilty at this point he misses ANAEMIAS feeling rattled or nervous and I can take this game away.  But maybe I'd be less tilt-y if I could actually play decently.
