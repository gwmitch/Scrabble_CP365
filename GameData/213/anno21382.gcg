#note I was a little miffed to see BOTH blanks appear on my rack at the same time. I mean what are the chances of that? Couldn't I get one at a time? I overcome the shit I have to deal with and deftly make the #1 play upon simulation of all choices.
>Marty: AOR 13C ORA +17 52
#note CURVER is phony.
>Rafi: ??DOUUW 14A WUD +17 106
#note I was CERTAIN that OUTWOUND was good but didn't like the play. Maybe a little too cute with my placement of WUD... there are 22 possible triple triples I can draw!

#note One of my favorite sequences of the tournament. I know that if I can play ZAG next turn, Marty may NEVER be able to open the board.
>Marty: LNU 11D .ULN +14 165
>Rafi: BCFFIOZ G6 Z.. +13 265
#note I guess GROSZ is still available.

>Rafi: BCFFINO 10B FO. +23 288
#note Lockdown mode. Now I just have to deal with plays like MATIER or PRATIE.

#note The only bingo through TIE is ENTREATIES.

#note As soon as that second to last A came down, I decided that the best way to lock up the win was to race to the last A. If I draw the A, Marty LITERALLY cannot do anything to open the board. I guess I could play OXEN.

#note I should probably just play SIRS but I didn't need spread. Still somewhat silly though.
