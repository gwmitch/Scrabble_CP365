#note Not sure what he exchanged. He did say he had 7 consonants and made his choice fairly quickly.
>Toh_Weibin: ACILMNN I7 MNA +22 96
#note Don't remember MAL(O)NIC, but I have definitely seen the pair. This was a very costly miss. Third in this simulation is a very fishy N(O)M 7G.
>Goutham_Jayaraman: EGINRZ 5E ZER.ING +68 68
>Toh_Weibin: CCILNOR 6C CLON +23 119
#note Poor play - overlooked NICOL. Slightly sad that he blocked COLONIC but that was to be expected.
>Goutham_Jayaraman: AEGIMNO C6 .AMEOING +80 148
>Toh_Weibin: CHIOORW B8 HOW +39 158
#note Simulates the clear best, setting up for the O in hand. I hesitated, because of the possibility that he picked one up, but decided to take my chances.
>Goutham_Jayaraman: AOV A6 AVO +42 190
#note Ouch! At least I get my bingo.
>Toh_Weibin: CIIORST G8 SORITIC +69 227
>Goutham_Jayaraman: ?EEFNRT 11E RE.NFEcT +90 280
#note Good spot by Goutham.
>Toh_Weibin: AEEEFGR 12A FA.E +22 249
#note Poor play here - I need the extra 5 points by playing the same tiles at 4D. No need to keep the board so open when you're less than 60 behind.

>Toh_Weibin: DEGRSTT A5 G...T +12 294
#note D(E)G/G(E)D are incredibly good moves that I failed to consider. Although they probably work better than they simulate, they are thankfully a little deficient in terms of score.
>Goutham_Jayaraman: AILV 3B VIAL +35 346
>Toh_Weibin: DEEQRST 13F Q. +11 305
#note Goutham is pulling away, but I have little choice.
>Goutham_Jayaraman: ANO B12 .NOA +26 372
>Toh_Weibin: DEEHRST H13 SHE +37 342
#note I imagined needing a larger score (than a fish) to overtake Goutham, and the S did not seem to be extremely useful for bingos in row 2. In second place is the one tile H fish at J10, which I briefly considered.

>Goutham_Jayaraman: IW 14E WI.. +27 417
>Toh_Weibin: BEJRSTX D2 J.. +10 368
#note With the horror draw of BJX and 5 in the bag, I had to make a do-or-die play.
>Goutham_Jayaraman: ALU 1D ALU +16 433
#note Good choice by Goutham, deciding to block the danger spot while leaving one in the bag.
>Toh_Weibin: ABERSTX M5 BAXTERS +88 456
#note !!!
>Goutham_Jayaraman: BDEEIPU N2 BIPED +39 472
>Toh_Weibin: S E3 ....S +14 470
#note So I was super fortunate to pull the A, and then one of the two winning tiles (find the other!) to come back from behind! A memorable game all around.
