>Saint: AEGGIS K2 AGGIES +30 48
>JD: ?BMOORT 1K BROOM +41 70
#note I actually saw MOBOCRAT, but this is clearly better. he nearly challenged too.
>Saint: AK J2 KA +35 83
>JD: ?ILMNRT 6J M.L +24 94
#note I saw MIRLITION but figured there were some nice bingo lanes available if I play short.
>Saint: ITZ I3 ZIT +45 128
#note was it a setup?? probably...
>JD: ?GINPRT M3 PRaTING +80 174
>Saint: IQ H4 QI +44 172
#note ouch!
>JD: AHLRUVY 4K .U.RY +26 200
#note quackle loves LUV, thinking I will score a massive 13 points per turn extra next turn! OWLY and MELTY probably help with this. also this play just gets rid of junk.
>Saint: ?ADELOV L9 ALcOVED +77 249
>JD: ABHLNOV 13I VOL.A +30 230
#note HOB is a more open play, given that I'm trailing by 50, but I thought the board was likely to get tight and that BHN would be more useful than ALNV to score with
>Saint: HIRT 15H THIR. +27 276
#note he has YIRTH for 6 more here
>JD: BCDEFHN N11 CHEF +36 266
#note BED is tempting as a play because it sets up an -S bingo lane that would get me a long way to victory, but I thought this kept the score close enough to be worth trying (VOLVAE* is not actually good...)
>Saint: AENT 9G ETNA +29 305
>JD: BDDEIIN 10B BIDDEN +24 290
#note quackle kinda likes NIB, but I don't think saint is going to let me ever bingo on row 10. dunno if DIB has a chance at 10E
>Saint: ACLNRTU D10 .UCT +14 319
#note his actual rack! he said maybe DUCTAL would've been better.
>JD: AEEINPU 9C PEA +26 316
#note I wanted to avoid setting up a play on column A, but on a sim APE actually beats PEA, surprisingly. The bag is very heavy on vowels, so playing through vowels is a big priority - AUNTIE at 13A actually sims ok too
>Saint: AELNR O4 .EARN +24 343
>JD: DEINTUX 2N XU +40 356
#note fantastic draw of 3 consonants, including the X, putting me in great shape
>Saint: EILNRSS -EILNR +0 343
>JD: DEINSTU 13B UN.IE +10 366
#note I took his exchange as a warning sign that the bag was now full of vowels, and wanted to leave a very consonant-heavy leave. I was really hoping that he would play an F play on row 14 and then give me row 15 to play back on. we were both really low on time. I can also play DUAD here to open a bingo lane for my great tiles, but do I really need to open give that I'm already up?
>Saint: EF 14F FE +26 369
>JD: DEINSST 15A TEINDS +30 396
#note saint was really low on time, so I figured going up by so much and forcing him to play his endgame in 30 seconds was the best chance of winning the game.
>Saint: AAEELOS O14 AA +11 380
#note as it turns out, he probably would've won the game if he draws the R because it gives him RELOADS. I dodged a bullet.
>JD: IORS 11G SORI +11 407
