>Evans_Clinchy: GILOTUU 8D GLOUT +16 16
#note GUILT is better. Not much synergy in that IU leave, and GLOUT is also weaker defensively.

#note Had to keep scoring. This seemed as good as anything. Considering this board, bingoing isn't really part of the game plan.

#note Keeping the pressure on and leaving one in the bag...
>Orry_Swift: AAHNORR 4H HAR.A. +26 420
#note Orry trusts his instincts here and goes with the highest-scoring play, thinking he can pull this one out as long as the W's not in the bag. But BUTANES is far from the only thing that beats him here -- he basically has to threaten an out next turn to win. Only the A (multiple spots for ROAN) or the B (threatening BORN, forcing me to sacrifice points to block) leads to a winning endgame for Orry.
