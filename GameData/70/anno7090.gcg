>Ryan_Fischer: BEHMOOU 8E HOBO +18 18
#note Forgot to write down my leave.  This is an approximation which really made me to want to hold out for SEMI(HOBO).
>Larry_Gradus: AEX 9E AXE +30 30
#note Scored as 29.
>Ryan_Fischer: CELMNTU E8 ..ULM +20 38
>Larry_Gradus: AEGILOR 10G GLORIAE +66 96
>Larry_Gradus: AEGILOR --  -66 30
#note Okay.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDENTT H7 T.D +16 54
#note T(AXE)D is a bit better, tighter, I think.
>Larry_Gradus: GO 7F GO. +22 52
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEINT 12E .EDICANT +78 132
>Larry_Gradus: AEIILRS K7 AIRLI.ES +66 118
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CIMNPU H12 .MPI +24 156
#note No I or G for PUMICING, which is all I saw.  Missed PANICUM(S) in three places.  Passed on CLUMP and UMP for obvious reasons.  Still, (I)MPI is kinda weak.
>Larry_Gradus: BEGILNV 8J L.VING +42 160
#note I saw him check BELIVING* after the game, so I assumed this is his rack.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CJNOSU 14F JU.ON. +33 189
#note Best, yay.
>Larry_Gradus: EKW N7 K.EW +19 179
#note Well, that locks things down pretty nicely.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CERSST M12 SECT +26 215
#note Best again.  Though frustrating.
>Larry_Gradus: BUY 13C BUY +30 209
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EILORS O8 .LOsSIER +84 299
>Larry_Gradus: NOW 14B WON +18 227
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEGHRT 15A GET +22 321
#note Champ didn't find it, but it simmed 2nd.  I like it 'cause I want to keep the board tight, case H in tow.
>Larry_Gradus: EEN L6 NE.E +11 238
#note Well, that changes things a teeny bit.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAEHRS 10I AA. +5 326
>Larry_Gradus: F 9D F.... +16 254
#note Of note: IF/REFEL for 21.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHPRRS 15G H.P +17 343
#note If LIVING wasn't there I'd have SERAPHS for a bunch (SHAPERS/SHERPAS/PHRASES).  Perhaps I should've kept the H a bit longer, but in case he opened, I wanted to see if I could bingo.  Who knows if that's right as long as he doesn't bingo himself.
>Larry_Gradus: OQV -OQV +0 254
>Ryan_Fischer: AEORRRS I10 .R. +5 348
#note Not especially strong, but the best move I could make without opening anything.
>Larry_Gradus: EINZ M3 ZINE +28 282
>Ryan_Fischer: AEORRSU N2 RASE +23 371
#note Here's where I really mess up, blanking the THREE hooks for RASE! (EPU).  Luckily, it doesn't cost me too much.  Q likes OAR and UREA on row 2, which I don't quite understand.  I guess with UREA, he can't hook anything along the triple, but bingos are still possible.  Meh.
>Larry_Gradus: ?FY 1M FeY +28 310
#note He said he had a whole bunch of junk (vowels) along with these two consonants.
>Ryan_Fischer: DDEOQRU 4L Q.. +24 395
>Larry_Gradus: AIOV 11B VIO.A +10 320
>Ryan_Fischer: DDEORRU G6 R...D +8 403
#note DRO(V)E not yet!
>Larry_Gradus: AAITT B9 TA. +8 328
>Ryan_Fischer: DEORU A6 RUDE +17 420
>Larry_Gradus: AIT 6A .AT +5 333
>Ryan_Fischer: O 15M .O. +3 423
#note 6A (RAT)O 4
>Ryan_Fischer:  (I) +2 425
#note We agreed on 424-332.  Either we are bad at math or counting.  Not good.
