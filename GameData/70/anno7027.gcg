#note I didn't think Trip would fall for ODORIZER*, consider the way he scoffed at me for getting away with LOONISH* against somebody rated only 12 points lower than him entering this tournament.  Let's move on, shall we?

>Joey: EIIIKTY 2D .IKI +20 155
#note It's this or KYE 11J.  It's hard to pass up 18 points, but plodding through while keeping IIIT is tough.  "IIIT" sure sounds like a lyric to some famous song that I'm not thinking of.
>Trip: ?ABLOUW 1G OUtBAWL +97 226
#note However, KYE would not have allowed this bingo and it would have blocked OUTBRAWL as well.  That'll teach me.

>Joey: ABEELMT L4 BLAME +28 294
#note There are a dozen or so moves that are about equal to this.  I could have given up a few points for a better leave, but turnover seemed wise with a blank still out.
>Trip: ?AENRTU 14G .AUNTERs +68 338
#note He had the blank all along.  I should start working on studying people's blank expressions.  Not easy to do.

#note Going for EVACUATION.
>Trip: HM 15H HM +40 398
>Joey: AEINNOT F5 NA +23 341
#note I could have fished off just one letter again, but I would have fallen too far behind.  Plus, Trip had this knack of hoarding the letters I wanted so I sort of gave up going for that particular bingo.
