>Ryan_Fischer: EILNRSV H10 .IVERS +39 238
#note I'm in major command of this game.  Now watch me fuck it up!  Besides missing VERNI(X), I could've played V(E)ILER, but (R)IVERS *is* second best.  The board is tight and I blow it wide open for no reason, breaking up my rack in the process.  So bad.  Maybe I'm too focused on the disaster that ensued.  VERNI(X) might have lead to the same thing.
>Martin_Weisskopf: DEIIPST 14H .IPTIDES +84 204
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAEILN 13K ALAN +20 258
#note AA 6B?  Really, Q?  Really?!  What about that HUGE hotspot just opened?  I didn't play ALANE because I figured that'd make it easier to use the O column.  This way, I force him to have a D, G, T, S, or E too.

#note :(
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIIOQ F14 Q. +31 289
#note Yeah, you're right Q, he just drew 7.  There's no way I should play 1 and leave 6 vowels, even for 31 points.  Major error.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ADHT O11 HAD.T +36 320
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIIOT L10 AIO.. +10 299
#note Haha, TO(G)AE for 29 leaves III!  Well, that's something.  My play is creative, 4th, but still terrible.

>Martin_Weisskopf: DELW 1H DWEL. +27 371
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIKTW 6B WE +22 335
#note Well, after much deliberation, I played WE, which is what Champ picks as best.  The blank is STILL out, and turned out to be the last tile in the bag.  I might have hit something to win if I caught it, but misplaying the midgame as I did, I didn't deserve it.
