>Jason_Keller: AIJLV E7 J.VIAL +32 32
>Winter: DFNNNNT -FNNNT +0 18
#note Are you kidding me???
Obviously I don't expect to exch 5 or 6 and draw a bingo, so I keep the D for the hook.
>Jason_Keller: AGOT 12D G.OAT +14 46
>Winter: DEIKLNS 11G KINDLES +82 100
>Jason_Keller: AD I7 AD +13 59
>Winter: CENNOSW 10E .CON +22 122
#note I figure he's gonna bingo, so I want to score as much as I can. I'd rather keep CENS of course, but I don't see a way to score enough without opening the triple line, and I assume he has an S.
>Jason_Keller: AENOPRT 6F PROTEAN +71 130
>Winter: EENRSUW K5 W.UR +14 136
#note Dang, always forget UN(S)EW.
>Jason_Keller: EY 13G YE +28 158
>Winter: AAEENRS 14B ANEARS +28 164
#note On this tight board, I am not going to drop AE and hoping for a bingo. If Jason gets that hook for 30-40 and builds a lead, I'm going to be in trouble.

>Winter: EEHHITY 12L THEY +37 201
>Jason_Keller: ADIQS M2 QADIS +40 229
#note Dude is pressing me hard, not giving in.
>Winter: ?AEHIOR 13L HERO +39 240
#note Okay, the blank is nice, but where to bingo??? I go for the points. I'm expecting a tight board, and the possibility that I'll never bingo.
>Jason_Keller: LW O12 ..WL +30 259
>Winter: ?ABFIMT N1 FIB +42 282
#note I UNDERCOUNTED BY 10. THAT COULD HAVE MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!!
>Jason_Keller: EINOSZ O2 SOZIN +41 300
>Winter: ?AFMORT 5E FOAM +28 310
#note Hate to give up the vowels, but I don't see any good way to score, although FRO might have been better.
>Jason_Keller: DEIP 8K .EDIP +27 327
>Winter: ?ACIRTU 15H RUsTICA. +80 390
>Jason_Keller: EMNTTUX N7 M.NX +29 356
>Winter: ?BEEILO 4A OBELIsE +80 470
#note Whew--I've got the win, but I wasn't sure of OBELIsE. I had to do the math to make sure if I was challenged off I could still win, and because I had undercounted by 10, it was close. Had it been closer, I might have had to pass on the bingo, so that 10-point undercount would have turnned into nearly 100!!!
