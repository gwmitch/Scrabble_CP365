#note another one that almost seems a matter of style. it is very close between DOES, DOTE, DOSE and 5I DOE. DOTE ends up slightly winning, but maybe not in your quackle. actually now it's DOES. lol.

#note maddy told me she drew the other blank after this. i never had a shot.

#note just AX may be better. it's important to bingo immediately. time to take crazy chances. 14J AA sims slightly better probably cuz of my rack. -0.35%
