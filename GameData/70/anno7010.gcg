>Peter_Armstrong: AIOR 5J .ORIA +10 83
>Sam: AIIMOST 6N MI +20 54
#note PATIO sims better, but MI is better if I assume Peter is holding an S. I don't mind MI.

>Peter_Armstrong: FI G3 IF +15 115
>Sam: ABCINST 1G TIC +23 96
#note Sort of a weird play, but I had to make some implications from IF G3 instead of IF H1. 
>Peter_Armstrong: EIU 2I ..IEU +6 121
>Sam: ABNOPSU 3M PUB +22 118
#note Figured there was no way he kept the X, so I didn't mind setting up the big spot. Didn't notice BONUS 1K though which looks a lot better.
>Peter_Armstrong: AQT 7M QAT +29 150
>Sam: ?ALNOSS O1 LO.S +21 139
#note Didn't see OVALNeSS, but I might have chosen LOBS anyway.
>Peter_Armstrong: DY K1 Y.D +13 163
>Sam: ?ACENNS -N +0 139
#note If I knew CANTIC I would have played ANTIC. I was fishing for ITERANCES here. UN seems okay, but if he can bingo starting at 10I it could kill the board. 
>Peter_Armstrong: H I8 .H +9 172
>Sam: ?ACENST M1 T.. +5 144
#note Missed VESiCANT.
>Peter_Armstrong: OX F2 OX +20 192
>Sam: ?ACENSW G8 .AW +10 154
#note Time to finally give up on ITERANCES.

>Peter_Armstrong: ?EELNRT D5 ENTREs.L +66 258
>Sam: ADEFILW 12H FAILED +38 268
#note There were a bunch of good options here, but I was down to under 4 minutes on the clock after taking so much thinking time on the extremely long opening sequence. FECAL, FACED, FIELD, FILED, and DWARF all seem worth considering, but I saw a good play and slapped it down.
>Peter_Armstrong: EIZ 6B ZI.E +33 291
>Sam: EGNNOVW 8A OVE. +21 289
#note Figured I needed to block the A hook.
>Peter_Armstrong: GILT B2 GLIT. +30 321
>Sam: EGINNRW M9 WEN.ING +32 321
#note Perfect option to have when low on time, leaving just one in the bag.
>Peter_Armstrong: EKRS 14J KER.S +38 359
>Sam: ABEHNOR A7 H.NER +8 329
#note BEANO was the play I was looking for, scoring a lot and blocking his outplay. It fares 10 points better than my play, and complicates his endgame a bit. Peter had plenty of time, though, and surely would have won.
