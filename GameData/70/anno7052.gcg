>Winter: DENNOUW 8F UNOWNED +76 76
#note I was lucky to find what I did, after passing on UNENDOW*. Needless to say, this rack is way too deep for me.
>Kevin_Colosa: FI J6 FI. +14 14
>Winter: ?EINQSU K7 S.QUINEd +84 160
#note Knew QUINSIES but not with the D. Frustrated that I'm drawing so well now that Brad has knocked me out of contention (or so I think, not realize what would happen on the other boards).

#note Uh-uh. My mental grumbling caused the Tile Gods to turn my tiles around.

#note I'm far enuf ahead that I don't fear his bingo and decide to try for one myself.

>Winter: AACOSUY 6M AY +33 451
#note Here's where things got really interesting. I'm sure I win even if he trip-trips, and I'm trying to max out my spread to have a shot at cashing. Playing AY and leaving ACOSU and the two lines, I might have a shot at OU(T)CASTS or OU(T)CASTE or maybe another OU(T) word, or the N.
>Kevin_Colosa: L K3 L.. +5 261
>Winter: ACMMOSU 6A UM +22 473
#note ,Don't want to empty the bag, so I decide to block what seems the easiest line for the 3x3. Still hoping I can get something something myself with the ACMOS leave.

>Winter: AACMORS 15A OS.RACA +30 503
#note I love this play for all sorts of reasons. Gives me an out, the possibility of a challenge, and the possibility of what happened next. At this point Kevin was 3:55 over time, so I didn't even bother to look for a bing through the V or C. I doubted he would look there.
>Kevin_Colosa: ?ILNOST H14 OS +36 297
>Kevin_Colosa: ?ILNOST --  -36 261
#note The best I could hope for.
>Winter: ABM G2 BAM +18 521
#note Considered trying to play B(UN)A and letting Kevin go over time, but as I worked out the math I saw that he had three tiles ready, and I figured he would get them down before he went over on his clock another minute.
