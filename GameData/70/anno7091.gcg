>Paul_Avrin: EHOV 8E HOVE +20 20
#note I entered this game fully ready to lose.  I mean, being what, 0-6?  0-7?  Against this guy.  I forget.  Can't bode well.  Then again, I gotta pull it out sometime, right?
>Ryan_Fischer: AADHNOU E3 HOUDA. +26 26
#note Best by far.  But not even a hold.  Dammit.
>Paul_Avrin: IPTY 3B PIT.Y +26 46
>Ryan_Fischer: AADGINO 4A DANI. +26 52
#note Really Q?  Really?  A(P)OD for 14 leaving AGIN is that much better than a play scoring 10 more, more solidly defensive?  Okay, AGO isn't great, but there are other consideration.  Meh.
>Paul_Avrin: EINRV A4 .RIVEN +30 76
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGIMOW 2F MIAOW +37 89
#note Gotta take a risk.  Best by far.
>Paul_Avrin: CIL H1 L.IC +27 103
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEGTU B8 DUCTAGE +89 178
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEGTU --  -89 89
#note Horrible rack, and a horrible play.  I had to try it, but it seems I never get away with anything intentional.  Q says B8 DUG leaving ACET.  Of note is (V)UG and G(W)EDUC.  If PIPEAGE and SEEPAGE, why not this?  Blah.
>Paul_Avrin: DEEILNO B9 ELOINED +72 175
#note So of course he strikes first.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEGTU 15A E.UCT +33 122
#note A(D)DUCT is +.2, apparently.
>Paul_Avrin: AII 13A I.IA +8 183
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGGNOT C7 GAG +15 137
#note GOD C9 solves it.  (C)ANTDOG is a desperate grab for anything.  D(O)GGO is decent, as Kenji pointed out to me.  GAG is weak.
>Paul_Avrin: EKP 12D KEP +30 213
>Ryan_Fischer: ADENOTY 11D OY +27 164
>Paul_Avrin: BT 5D T.B +8 221
#note Oh, great, he's fishing again.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADENNRT 1J ARDENT +32 196
>Paul_Avrin: EEINOST N1 .ONETIES +70 291
>Paul_Avrin: EEINOST --  -70 221
#note Get that shit off the board.  -_-  Missed O1 (T)EOSINTE which I saw in like 2 seconds.  Of note: 15A (EDUCT)ION.  Needless to say, I'm pretty disgusted with the whole situation.  Egregious phonies aside.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEEGJN 10E AJEE +33 229
>Paul_Avrin: EEINOST 7H OE +5 226
#note Misscored as 7.  At this point I was really annoyed, staring down the barrel of another bingo with two blanks unseen.
>Ryan_Fischer: BGNRRTX 12A X. +34 263
#note Oh well.
>Paul_Avrin: EILNOST 13F ENTOILS +63 289
#note Of course.
>Ryan_Fischer: BGNRRRT 6G BRRR +13 276
#note Best, but laughable.
>Paul_Avrin: QUZ J11 QU.Z +42 331
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAGNST 14E AG +19 295
#note -_-  Despite the hopelessness of this position, it's quite interesting that (Q)ANAT gives me a chance.  I wouldn't bingo here even if I took the time to look for CATJANGS or TAGGANTS.  I took AG in the hopes of bingoing out.  But of course he'll have one in return.
>Paul_Avrin: ?EFRSSU L1 .EFUSeRS +74 405
#note O1 TURFlESS 92, although this makes it hard for me to bingo too.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ALNOST 11H LO.uATS +32 327
#note I HATE THIS GAME.  (Best.)
