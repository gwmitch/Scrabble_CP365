>Jim_Burlant: CEILPSS 8C SPLICES +78 78
#note Great start!  8H placement sims roughly 1 point down.
>Ricky_Sirois: DQU F6 QU.D +34 34
>Jim_Burlant: EEEORTW 5E WEE +27 105
#note Quackle prefers 5D placement by roughly 1 point.  Other choices worth considering are 5D WOE, 5D OWE, 5D EWE.
>Ricky_Sirois: FIMOT C3 MOTIF. +30 64
>Jim_Burlant: EJORRTT B2 JOT +26 131
#note Saw PROJET and chickened out on it; I couldn't remember if it was legit or if I was confusing it with OBJET.  I also considered 8A RESPLICES.   However, after a few hundered iterations, this play percolates to the top of the heap, with the runner up (PROJET) simming 3 points down.  And it certainly worked out quite nicely.
>Ricky_Sirois: ADEELMS 4G MEASLED +76 140
#note This would have played at 10C for 80...and this miss by Ricky turn this into a blowout in my favor.
>Jim_Burlant: EGNORRT I8 .TRONGER +62 193
#note Sometimes all it takes is a little mistake.  If Ricky plays MEASLED on row 10 instead of on row 4, what do I do with this?  Anyway, this is the only playable bingo and best play, winning 68%.
>Ricky_Sirois: BIV H1 VIB. +27 167
>Jim_Burlant: ILNORST 14H R.TINOLS +70 263
#note The 7 doesn't play anywhere, and the only bingos are either this choice or at L3 for 59.  This is best, and I'm now winning 85%.
>Ricky_Sirois: IIOT M3 I.IOT +14 181
>Jim_Burlant: ?ELOORU 15B cOLOURE. +80 343
#note Best bingo, as there are no bingos that play down the O column.  Other options are D8 PROLOgUE, 1G OVERsOUL, OVERfOUL, and OVERLOUd.
>Ricky_Sirois: IPW O12 WI.P +39 220
>Jim_Burlant: ADEENXY 11I .XY +26 369
#note Couldn't decide what to do here and was more interested in taking away bingo lines, which is why I didn't even look for J4 SEXY.  12G ANNEXED, which I didn't see, wins, and I agree, as it's much better than this.  I definitely needed to turn more tiles to end this game as soon as possible.  While it scores well, this play takes a 6-point hit.  But I wind up benefitting from this mistake later.
>Ricky_Sirois: AG 13L AG +14 234
>Jim_Burlant: ADEENNU K2 UN.ADEN +16 385
#note At this point I'm not worried about building a rack; I just want to take away as many lines as I can and turn tiles.  With X already out, there's no danger in slotting the U next to J2.  I like this play a lot, as it not only turns 6, but it also kills both the K column and any potential 8's from the V at H1.  This play sims as runner up, though it coughs up quite a bit of equity to 10G UNREAD, which wins.
>Ricky_Sirois: OY 15L YO +23 257
>Jim_Burlant: AEEINTV 12B VENETIA. +74 459
#note Luckbox!  Off my SIX-tile draw.  This is the only playable bingo.
>Ricky_Sirois: IK B6 KI +37 294
>Jim_Burlant: AABEGHR 11C BAH +32 491
#note REHAB 11C would have been cool if I would have thought of it.  This play sims pretty well, though - within 1 point after 1000+ iterations.
