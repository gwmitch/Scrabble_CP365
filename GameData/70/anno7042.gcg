#note Considered YEA J1 to block the QUIPU hook, but just didn't think it was worth it. Would have helped in this case.

#note Should have played it safer with NAOI 15H. This leave was a little too risky. Not a bad play, though, and easily the highest-scoring option.

#note Terrible, terrible play. This was a little complicated because there was a tile missing, so I couldn't just play BRAVO or BRAVI B11 as they would empty the bag. I also didn't know BIOVuLAR, which I probably would have played had I seen it. Still, emptying the bag was a terrible mistake.

#note Scored as 429-414 because the eighth O was missing.
