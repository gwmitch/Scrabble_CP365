>Magra: AFLOOSV D1 VOLOS. +26 124
#note I swear to good I didn't play VOLOST just to play it. It just seemed like the best move. but quackle says I should play AVO at 6I which looks right.

#note I wanted to hold onto the H for greater flexibility - for instance, it fits at 5E. However quackle says just to go for the points.

#note nobrainer
>Magra: HIKMNOP 5A KNI.H +34 276
#note a further battle to keep the right tiles for next turn. I didn't like any of the Q plays but quackle does. actually QOPH looks great, but IKON sims level with it, to my surprise. I guess there are lots of ways to score next turn. Putting the K in the triple lane actually gives xp more points per turn than any other play anyway.

#note a wretched play. TWEAKIER for 45. duh. my stee moment. this play almost certainly cost me the game. barf.
>Magra: ??AILOU B8 a.OULIAs +70 439
#note definitely the most important play in the game, and, according to quackle, I screwed it up BIG time. I missed a couple of plays that save both blanks - QUAI or QUAIL. QUAI in particular is devastating, setting up a hook with all of the case letters in hand. My play makes the game a coin flip when I had the option to make myself an 84% favorite.
>xp: AEIINPV N10 VIE. +16 430
#note xp: 
i have no idea why i did this.

jd: quackle claims that AVIDIN or VAPID win 1/8. VAPID is incorrect but AVIDIN is the real deal, giving XP PYE to go out for a jillion at the bottom-left. VAPID does block my big play (extension to DIRTYING) but I don't get why quackle thinks it can win.
