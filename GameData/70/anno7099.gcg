#note I really shouldn't be playing throuh racks like this (unless I can find C7 G(UN)D(O)GS 24 -- I was close with F(UN)G(O), but it's pretty bad.  At least it has a positive valuation.

#note It's pretty much goodbye vowels from this point forward.  Don't understand how I whiffed on DI(T)Z here.  I shouldn't have been concerned with killing that line when there's HIVE and me with an S.  I think at the time, I wanted to kill the hook because I figured he set it up for himself (flemish).
