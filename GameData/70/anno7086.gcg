>Jeremy: AEHJLOT 8G HAJ +26 26
#note Best, but this gives up a juicy I hook: (HAJ)I.  8G JO keeps a tidy leave AEHLT, but HAJ scores 8 more making it worth it.
>Matthew: CGGHINP J7 PINCH +32 32
#note Apparently CHIP is better. The N saves the GG.
>Jeremy: BELMOTV K11 MOB +28 54
#note K11 MOVE for 32 points would be a great play if it didn't open a triple lane.  MOVER, MOVED, MOVES.  It's a bit dangerous.  For that reason K11 MOB is a bit safer.
>Matthew: GGIIIOR 9F GIRO. +26 58
>Jeremy: EEILRTV K4 VILE +18 72
#note Blocked my H5 REL(A)TIVE / LEVIR(A)TE bingos. K4 VILE is the perfect mix of offense and defense.  ERT is a tidy leave.  I don't give up much scoring lanes on the board.  13H VER(B)ILE leaves an S hook wide open.  L12 RIVE strings an E in a triple lane as does 12K (O)LIVE.  I don't need to make any crazy plays just yet.
>Matthew: DFGIILS L12 FIG +28 86
>Jeremy: EIORRST 15F RIOTERS +83 155
#note If I were losing by a lot, I'd play 15I ROISTER, leaving a huge S hook.
>Matthew: DEILSSU 13K ..S +10 96
#note This doesn't sim too badly, but the top play blows up the rack with DIVULSE.
>Jeremy: ADDLMNO 14H DAM +27 182
#note Interesting last play by Matthew, I must assume he will bingo next.  I saw DOLMAN and ALMOND, but I didn't see 14E DOLMAN rests nicely above RIOTERS with 5 overlaps.  14H DAM sims 4.9 points worse.
>Matthew: DEILRSU 4I LU. +6 102
>Jeremy: ADLNOUY 7D UNLAY +22 204
#note Putting a vowel at 7D, leaving 8A to 8D open is usually a huge no-no.  If Matthew were to play 8A QUIP, it'd be a huge play.  But he's going to most likely bingo, so I can cash in this spot myself.
>Matthew: DEEINRS N9 DENIERS +76 178
>Jeremy: AACDIOR O4 CARDIO +39 243
#note I wrote ACAROID on my sheet, which plays at M4 for 69 points, but I didn't like it.  It's been a while since I've seen that bingo. I thought I had it mixed with ACARID or ACARIDAN. I played second best, O4 CARDIO.  A 31.4 point mistake.
>Matthew: ?AEKNUZ 13D KANZU +32 210
#note I was too keen on unloading the K and the Z. NEUK and AUK score well and open bingo lanes. No need to unload the Z now. ZEKs was an option, but I wasn't interested.
>Jeremy: AEERTTT 8A TEAT +18 261
#note keeps ERT, and I might bingo next.
>Matthew: ?GINSUW L1 WIGS +38 248
#note Saw OUTSWING, not UNSEWING. Neither is better than WIGS I don't think.
>Jeremy: EEFLRTX 1L .EFT +30 291
#note With both blanks still unseen, tile turnover is a good thing.  1G REFLE(W) sims ahead by 3 points.  3G FLEX is an intersting idea because it keeps only bingo prone tiles RET, but gambles on getting a bingo soon.  I thought keeping an X aboard reduced the gamble.
>Matthew: ?BENOQU 2I eQU.NE +80 328
>Jeremy: AELRTVX 14A RELAX +39 330
#note My play sims just 3.5 points below the optimal play which is sneaky.  1E LAVER for just 25 (sacrifice 14 points), sets up a huge potential X-bomb at F2 when I play next.  Quackle prefers RETAX to RELAX, probably because I can draw a duplicate T, but all the Ls are played.
>Matthew: ?ABDIOT 1C TABlOID +82 410
>Jeremy: EENOPTV 12A VETO +36 366
#note Matthew has A12 WA(R)Y for 30, or 12C YOW for 45.  Not much points elsewhere on the board.  My original plan was to play A12 PE(R)V  or A11 OVE(R)T, but that left YOW open.  Quackle likes 12A NETOP  instead- blocking Matthew's big plays, because my play sets up 10A WA(V)E(R)Y which we did not see.
>Matthew: AEEOOWY 2B YOWE +31 441
#note Matthew kind of misses the boat here, setting me up for some big points on my final turn, but he's got the win locked up.
>Jeremy: ENP 3C PEN +31 397
>Jeremy:  (AEO) +6 403
