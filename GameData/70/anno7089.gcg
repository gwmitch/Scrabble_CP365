>Ryan_Fischer: ACDFOUV E5 FAU. +28 28
#note For some reason I thought I was making up COUVAD(E).  Nope.  4v7.  In my dreams.
>Ian_Weinstein: BEEGT F2 BEGET +25 51
>Ryan_Fischer: CDDORTV 3C COV.D +26 54
#note Well, that worked out nicely.  But Q suggests DROV(E)D.
>Ian_Weinstein: TU G6 TU. +7 58
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGORTW D1 WO.D +24 78
#note Dammit, his fish blocked WAT(E)RDOG.
>Ian_Weinstein: U -U +0 58
>Ryan_Fischer: ACGIRRT 1A CRA. +27 105
>Ian_Weinstein: EINOPST I2 POINTES +74 132
#note Sigh.  I was in control until now.  Of course he had to hit his fish when my scores aren't getting me anywhere. And I don't know why I've convinced myself EXINE is an adjective.
>Ryan_Fischer: DGIINRT -  +0 105
#note Lost challenge.
>Ian_Weinstein: AEG J1 GAE +14 146

>Ian_Weinstein: IPTY 13H PITY +22 248
#note Well, that hurt.
>Ryan_Fischer: LNORRRS 2I ..RLOR +16 225
#note Saw LORR(Y) and (PA)RLOR.  The former pretty much destroys my chance of a comeback, so I've gotta take a risk.
>Ian_Weinstein: ELZ 1M LEZ +40 288
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: EINORSS 3L IONS +19 244
#note (TIP)IS is creative.  I saw the possibility a few minutes ago, but not over the board.  Of course not!
>Ian_Weinstein: ??AEEFN 14I FiANcEE +82 370
#note Double-damn.  Okay, so I've just drawn to ERS.  I can 3x3, right?  Right?!  Surprising, BTW, that there are only two bingos playable there ((S)AFENEss being the other).
>Ryan_Fischer: ELOQRSY 4H Q. +21 265
#note And OF COURSE I draw the Q!  Lesson learned.  Don't challenge EXINES.  I'd've been much more in it.  Though even that didn't kill me at the time -- it's doubtful he'd been holding onto the blanks for that long so I can't help but feel a little unlucky here.
>Ian_Weinstein: DEJRSUW 15F JEWS +53 423
>Ryan_Fischer: AELORSY O11 EYR.S +36 301
#note (S)LAYERS is a bit better staticly, but champ says LYRES or EYRES is fine.
