>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DDEEEMO -DDEE +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: AAIJRRU 8G JURA +22 22
#note Quackle prefers the 8E placement by roughly 1-1/2 points.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DEOTT 9F TOTED +26 26
>Jim_Burlant: AIORRTX K5 RIOT +20 42
#note The familiar refrain:  you gotta know the bingo to play it.  Had no clue that there was a 7, ORATRIX, in this rack, which plays at 7I.  As for non-bingo options, this sims best, though it coughs up tons of equity to the bingo.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EINNR 7I IR.NE +15 41
#note Sam had initially put down NINE L2 before picking it up and putting this down.  Too bad for me, as it foiled my X setup.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEPRVX 8M DEX +36 78
#note I gave M2 REPAVED serious consideration...but felt it gave up too many scoreboard points and the sim agrees.  This is best, with M1 PERVADE and M2 REPAVED simming roughly 5 points down.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: OY O7 O.Y +13 54
>Jim_Burlant: AGPQRSV 6M GAP +29 107
#note Close call - this choice and M3 GRAVED sim within 0.1 points of each other at 1300+ 2-ply iterations.  Nothing else (including exchanges) sims within 3-1/2 points of this.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EFORZ L1 FROZE +44 98
>Jim_Burlant: AAQRSVW 10E VAW +28 135
#note Best.  Only 10E VAWS sims within 2 points, but I wanted to hold the S.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: INNU 3I UNI.N +12 110
>Jim_Burlant: AMOQRSU 1L .OAM +27 162
#note This is one of 3 plays at 1L that stand out here, the other 2 being FROM and FORM.  I felt that, with only 1 R in the unseen pool, I felt I needed needed to hold the R despite the extra danger of slotting the A next to the double-word at 2N.  Quackle disagrees, docking me nearly 3 points, with this choice finishing as the bronze medalist.  Nothing else sims within 3 points of this.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AH 2N HA +24 134
>Jim_Burlant: IQRSSSU 4F SUQS +25 187
#note Frustrated when the last tile out of the bag was my *third*  S - I was really hoping for an E for SQUIRES.  Where are those 8 unseen E's?  Quackle rightly suggests that the 11G placement is best by barely 1 equity point.   2 turns from now, you'll see why I think  my play  is a bigger mistake than the sim says it is.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEO 4L .OEA +16 150
#note And if I make the right play on the previous turn, he only scores low 60's on rows 4 or 6.   Sam is now winning 55%.
>Jim_Burlant: BDIRSTY G3 B.Y +11 198
#note I seriusly considered 6J BI 23 (the sim winner) and this play, which Quackle doesn't like.  I felt that if I could land some high-prob combo like AE or EN, it would more than make up for the points I gave up.  Sim winner is BI, and this play sims nearly 10 points down.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ??EEILS 11F ELEgISt +77 227
#note Nice fit.  And if I play SUQS down on row 11 like Quackle said I should have a few turns back, he only scores in the mid 60's with this rack on row 6.
>Jim_Burlant: DIIRSTV H11 .DIT +7 205
#note Despite the scoreboard points given up this is best.  The blanks are played, I'm sitting on the case S, why not make him defend?  Nothing else sims within 7 points of this.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACL G13 LAC +11 238
#note Sam took a LOOOOONG time on this turn before putting this down.  It was enough to reduce my ability to hurt him on the next turn. 
>Jim_Burlant: ABIPRSV 15E VA.S +45 250
#note So much for my play of PAVIS.  Quackle prefers 6J BI, but I thought that if I waited, he might put down something like TEN I13 to seal off that triple.  6J BI wins the sim, with this play the runner up at 43% winning chances.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EF 14F F..E +28 266
#note Play incorrectly scored as 30.
>Jim_Burlant: BEIPRTU 6J B. +23 273
#note Best, I'm at 42%.  Nothing else sims within 6 points of this choice.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: LOW 12D OWL +16 282
>Jim_Burlant: DEIPRTU 13B DUPE +23 296
#note Quackle prefers 13C UP, but I thought that was pointless, as his last play made it clear he was either setting up a C or an H, and this board didn't have enough scoring to withstand a 40-point C or H bomb.  I figured I'd make him play through my D rather than give him an easy hook.   Not sure I agree with the sim here - against an inferred CH, this play sims with highest valuation but sacrifices 2% winning chances to 13C UP.  I'll take this play any day of the week.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CT C12 C.T +14 296
>Jim_Burlant: GHILMRT 12K HIM +23 319
#note Saw THIRL, which was my first choice...but was paranoid about giving him an opening down the O column.  THIRL wins the sim and this choice is kinda at the top of the middle of the pack.  I also figured that with all the vowels in this pool, a consonant heavy leave might not be a bad idea.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EEK 15A EKE +27 323
>Jim_Burlant: AGILRRT 14A RA. +24 343
#note FAIL!  The best play here is 13L TIRL, which I figured out post-mortem.  It would put the onus on him to block my upcoming play of RAT for all of 2 points, and he wouldn't be able to catch up to me.  What happened here:   I saw his rack and mistakenly thought that by opening up the N column I was giving him a play he would otherwise have not had, and I thought that this choice had given me enough margin that, after we crawled through the end racks, I would be able to dump enough of the rack that, by the time went out before me, I'd still have enough to win.  His next play left me in shock. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EGIINNO 13J GENII +28 351
>Jim_Burlant: GILNRT H7 G.. +11 354
>Jim_Burlant: GILNRT --  -11 343
#note 
Desperation to cut spread.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: NO 2I NO +11 362
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha:  (GILNRT) +14 376
#note I went over on time by 0:05, and final score recorded as 379 - 333.   A completely avoidable and entirely deserved loss, as I just didn't take enough tijme to really look for the 5-letter word in his final rack.
