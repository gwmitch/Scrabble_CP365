>J_Wapnick: DEINV 8D VINED +26 26
>Verbie: ADGOSXZ 9F OX +36 36
#note Interestingly, subbing in the A is only about 1 back.  Tacking on the S to either drops about a half-point.
>J_Wapnick: CELRST E5 REL.CTS +48 74
#note Of course, it would have defused this...
>Verbie: ADGRSTZ D3 TZAR +30 66
#note GAZED 6B wins this one (-5)
>J_Wapnick: ANV 7G VAN +31 105
>Verbie: DFGORST 6H FOG +20 86
#note umm... sure.  2 points clear of a lot of similar-looking plays.
>J_Wapnick: OT 10E .OT +24 129
>Verbie: ADMRRST 5I MAR +18 104
#note (-4) Why is adding the T 4 points better?  It's the 4th T with only 30 tiles played.  Must be for the added chance of vowels.
>J_Wapnick: INP C5 PIN +14 143
>Verbie: ?ADERST B2 DiASTER +82 186
#note Co-top with RoASTED or DAbSTER in the same lane.
>J_Wapnick: AQT A1 QAT +40 183
>Verbie: HIMNOUY A7 HOMINY +66 252
#note Missing this would have been embarassing.  Note that if the NW TWS  gives HOMY for 63.
>J_Wapnick: FOY 4J FOY +27 210
>Verbie: AEEHTUU F3 HUE +13 265
#note B12 EAU is better (not much though: -.7)
>J_Wapnick: BILNS G1 BLINS +24 234
#note Whoa, bogus.
>Verbie: AEEJOTU 1E JU.A +39 304
#note But I had no good way to play the J.  I should have noticed how many Es were lurking, and played JUBE instead.  (-4)
>J_Wapnick: ACDIIOU -II +0 234
>Verbie: EEGLOTU L2 GU. +7 311
#note Big miss.  3K TOGUE seems obvious now. (-20)
>J_Wapnick: ?AEPRSU M4 ScAUPER +70 304
#note The only bingo.  Nice find.
>Verbie: AEEILOT 8M .OI +15 326
#note Need to kick out Es with ETOILE H10.  (-6)
>J_Wapnick: ADEW 2J WA.ED +36 340
>Verbie: AEEIILT 1M AIL +14 340
#note At least this is on the first screen of suggestions, behind YETI 12A.  But why am I leaving myself vulnerable to drowning in Es?  (-5)
>J_Wapnick: CEEIIKL 12A .IRK +22 362
>J_Wapnick: CEEIIKL --  -22 340
#note Collins types let me know:  Is this #?
>Verbie: DEEILOT C1 DOL +18 358
#note Why am I trying to be cute here, instead of ETOILE again? (-25)
>J_Wapnick: EGIKNOR H10 ERINGO +28 368
#note Not best from Joel's side.  Strangely, the top choice is OAK 6L 17.
>Verbie: BEEEEIT 14F BE.ET +16 374
#note And this time I get punished for holding Es.  Top is L9 BEET. (-2)
>J_Wapnick: CEIKW J9 WICKE. +17 385
#note Sticky.
>J_Wapnick:  (EIE) +6 391
