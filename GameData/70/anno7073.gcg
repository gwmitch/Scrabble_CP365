>Rafi_Stern: CDHNQRV -DNQRV +0 0
#note Lots of exchanges that look pretty good. I can see why CHR could be better than CH, but CHNR or CDHR? No way am I keeping 4 consonants on a trade.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AEPSVW 8G VAW +18 18
#note Liked this better than WAVES, especially after Rafi trading to open. This is obviously better defensively.
>Rafi_Stern: BBCDHNY H7 B.BY +11 11
#note Or CABBY. I liked BABY because it takes away non-bingo scoring opportunities.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?CEIKPS J2 PICKEtS +82 100
#note Missed PECKISH, which is a little better.
>Rafi_Stern: ACDHNST 3I D.TCH +26 37
>Evans_Clinchy: EJPRRUX 10B PERJUR. +27 127
#note Rafi and I talked about this position a lot after the game, eventually agreeing that PERJURY is too open with the early lead. We agreed on JUKE... apparently both forgetting that CRUX was a word. That's a better play than either.
>Rafi_Stern: AEINNOS L3 .ANONISE +72 109
>Evans_Clinchy: DEGGIOX E10 .OGGED +32 159
#note Stupid. I played this because I wanted to get cute and set up the X. JIGGED is obviously far, far better for that.
>Rafi_Stern: AAEMNRS 12A MANA.ERS +80 189
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIOTUX 15E .OXIE +39 198
#note Missed TUXEDO.
>Rafi_Stern: AEFLNUY 14E .YE +36 225
#note During the game I thought it was closer, but EYE sims INSANELY better than FEY - 4% better. I figured 6 additional points was important, and I'm unlikely to bingo with AELNU anyway, so why not leave a scoring tile for my next turn? EYE also forces a bingo in row 14 to open the triple lane.
>Evans_Clinchy: EIOTTUZ 6L .UZO +33 231
#note I wish there was a way to score and keep a respectable leave without wildly opening triple-triple lanes. Shrug. Doesn't exist. The other reasonable option here is MUTT A12 to take out a hotspot and save the Z for later, but I didn't trust that. Gotta keep scoring.
>Rafi_Stern: AFLLNRU O4 FL.RAL +39 264
#note FLOUR is a little better, but I missed it.
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIORTT 5H TO.E. +18 249
#note Liked this better than MOTE A12 because I probably need to bingo again, and this gives me a new lane to work with.
>Rafi_Stern: ?HINOTU C3 OUTsHIN. +80 344
>Evans_Clinchy: EEEIMRT K9 EREMITE +72 321
>Rafi_Stern: AAGILRS N9 ARGALIS +72 416
#note Lucky lucky.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADDFINQ 8A QA.D +48 369
>Rafi_Stern: EILNOTV O12 LINO +28 444
#note Blocking WINO.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADFIINO D1 FOIN +28 397
#note Best, guaranteeing a decent-scoring out next turn.
>Rafi_Stern: ETTUVW A12 .UTT +18 462
#note Also best, blocking MAID.
