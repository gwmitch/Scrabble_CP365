#note Or POLITY, maybe. The double T's don't look that useful on this board.
>Scott_Jackson: ADEEEST H8 .ESEATED +80 108
>Evans_Clinchy: ABJTTUY E5 JAB.T +30 56
#note Um, just play JAY. I got carried away trying to find a play that would lead to a more open board. The one benefit is that this sets up the Y if I draw an O or an A, but it's still not worth it.

>Scott_Jackson: AQ K10 QA. +24 147
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEIMNO F5 OM +29 109
#note Thought this would be better than OE, for 12 more points and a situationally better bingo lane (since OM takes the N). Thought wrong. Pretty big mistake.
>Scott_Jackson: INW L9 WIN. +23 170
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEEINO 11C A.OE +13 122
#note Or ALEE, but there are only four E's left, so I don't mind holding two.

#note Quackle is suggesting INURE G1 with the full rack inference, which is crazy. The sim doesn't realize that Scott will just take the spot with SHINIER or INRUSH. I was just trying to unload tiles, keep a balanced leave and dig for those blanks. In retrospect, I wish I'd chosen a play that didn't block bingo lanes so much... although at the same time, all the open plays are a bit *too* open. This is a tough position for me.

#note Or ACAJOU, which forks open two separate lanes. I missed it.
>Scott_Jackson: INOR H1 NORI. +18 216
>Evans_Clinchy: AACDINO 10B CA. +15 157
#note Couldn't find a play that kept a balanced leave and helped create bingo lanes. ADO M7 is what I was looking for.

>Evans_Clinchy: ACDEFNS 1A DECAF +41 255
#note Or ENFACED, but I'm still behind, and this keeps things more open.
>Scott_Jackson: OSZ M7 Z.OS +42 305
>Evans_Clinchy: BGILNNS C9 B...S +28 283
#note Gotta keep scoring. With the pool still this promising, I want to stay in striking distance even if he bingos again.
>Scott_Jackson: F I9 F. +18 323
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EGILNN 3H .ELINiNG +68 351
#note As I see it, I have three options: CLING C1, which keeps the blank and leaves one in the bag, hoping to bingo out next turn and win; KNEELING O5, which bingos in the most promising lane; and this, which is the highest-scoring bingo and also blocks  a potential lane for him to bingo out. In retrospect, I really wish I'd chosen CLING, since the pool and board both look strong enough that bingoing out next turn looks viable. I didn't have time to think this through, and I think I chose the worst of the three plays. RELINING is basically just the "I'm praying you missed your fish" play. Doesn't seem likely to work.
>Scott_Jackson: ?INRSTT O5 INT.ReST +58 381
#note Yep, that looks about right.
