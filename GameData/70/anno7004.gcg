>Chuck_Armstrong: HIOPT 8D TOPHI +22 22
>Jason: ?ADFIIO 9C OIDIA +23 23
#note I debated between this and FIDO at 7C. CP gives a clear preference to OAF at 7G.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AX 10E AX +57 79
#note Yeah, FIDO or OAF would've been an improvement...
>Jason: ?ACFMST 11B MACS +26 49
#note Two racks, two close calls. Duck likes FACTS or FATS instead.
>Chuck_Armstrong: DIJNN H3 DJINN. +22 101
>Jason: ?FGOORT I2 GOOF +27 76
#note u(N)FORGOT. This only sims about 4-5 pts. behind, though.
>Chuck_Armstrong: MRU 4H ..RUM +28 129
>Jason: ?ENRTYZ K3 Y.TZ +32 108
>Chuck_Armstrong: PU 3K .UP +20 149
>Jason: ?EELNRW 10E ..EL +17 125
#note (C)LEW and (M)EWL seemed too risky, since I felt Chuck had an S.
>Chuck_Armstrong: DEI 12A DIE +12 161
>Jason: ?CEENRW A12 .REW +24 149

>Chuck_Armstrong: GNOT 11G TONG +14 258
>Jason: AEFILSY 8L .ILY +21 249
#note Not so good; not even on Speedy's radar. Don't know why fishing off AY at M8 or 10L never occurred to me ... given the pool, I can see why they're CP's clear picks.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AAENRTV 14H TAVERNA +87 345
#note Ruh-roh.
>Jason: AEFOSTW 12H WO +21 270
#note Taking the column O spot seemed like a bad idea. I felt like I needed to keep the N and O columns as open as possible; bingoing through the L wasn't that big a reach. Plus I wanted to prolong the game at this point. It is CP's pick, winning a little more than 3%.
>Chuck_Armstrong: BGU 2L BUG +23 368
#note Scored as 25. Fixed in the recount.
>Jason: ABEFKST O10 FAKEST +65 335
#note The FAKEST* 65 I've ever scored. Obviously given the situation Chuck was loathe to challenge.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EE N8 .EE +12 380
>Jason: ABEEORU 14E OE +10 345
#note I saw that I could execute a Q-stick by stopping QA(T). I hated that this didn't score, but Duck says my highest-scoring play is only 17 anyway. Since WO, my win chances have jumped from 3 to 30 percent. But CP says EURO in this spot wins 40%. Would like to be able to figure out if it would've won, but I never asked Chuck what the last two in the bag were.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EN 5F NE.. +7 387
#note Why must Chuck be so clever?
>Jason: ABDERRU 6B BARRE +19 364
#note I calculated that this tied if Chuck played QI off of this (would've won by two, but I wasn't going to recount a tie). I knew he had HAO up top, too, but I didn't have the time to calculate what that did.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AHILOQV 1M HAO +29 416
#note Chuck, also short on time, missed HAVIO(R). This makes BARRE at 4B instead of 6B my play on the previous turn.
>Jason: DU 11G ....U.D +18 382
#note Fun game. Asking for my sixth consecutive tourney win against Chuck was too much. :)
>Jason:  (ILQV) +32 414
