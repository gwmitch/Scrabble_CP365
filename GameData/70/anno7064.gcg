#note As Marlon noted, this sequence was hard to fuck up. The multiple X spots can wait, take this hotspot now.

#note This sets up POON for 40 next turn, which is pretty sick.

>Nigel: AGNOOOP 2J PA.GO +39 246
>Evans: ADMNRUZ D8 ZA +44 259
#note The sim recommends NURD 14B, presumably leaving the Z spot open to fish for MATZA. A cool play that I didn't think of over the board.
>Nigel: EINOOOU M2 .ENU +37 283
>Evans: CDMNORU 1F MUCRO +31 290
#note My thinking here was that Nigel would have a distinct tempo advantage no matter what I did here, so I needed to leave bingo lines open. This leaves line C open and gives me line 2 to work with. Hoping to make something happen here.

#note Wanted to keep scoring to put the pressure on. Would have been nice to block bingo lanes here, but there are two big ones open and I don't know which to block. If I guess wrong and he bingos and I haven't scored anything, I could be in trouble. Taking points while I still can seems like the best tactic.
>Nigel: ?BEGGNY M10 YEGG +26 427
#note Best. Nigel needs to fish AND keep scoring if he wants to have a chance.
>Evans: ADNORTT B10 DO +16 504
#note This leaves one in the bag and blocks his most plentiful lane -- BORNEOLS, BROOKITE, and BONTEBOK are all out of the picture now.
