#note Would seriously consider x1 if she hadn't played YETI.  I don't think DEMON is 2 pts better than DEMO considering the latter takes the TWS.

#note Kenji kinda laughed when we got back from the challenge machine.  I shoulda taken POND when it was there.  Just trying to get creative with my phonies.  Picked the wrong time to try one, when I didn't really need it.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?HILRST 11J H.LT +12 312
#note Yeah, I missed THRILLS.  I actually saw it, and don't know what I was thinking.  It's not reasonable to be scared of a 3x3 when up so much.  Blah.  Really bad play; my brain kind of short-circuited here.
