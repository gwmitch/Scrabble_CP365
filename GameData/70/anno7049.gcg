#note Not sure why Quack likes (Z)A so much, to leave two Rs on this board. I felt I needed to open a line in case John makes a parallel play to kill the ones that are open.

#note Torn between leaving AERT again and giving up 10 points, or throwing the M up there for points, turonver, and volatility.

#note Oh, come on.
>Winter: AAEEKNO N10 KEN.E +38 170
#note Yeah the leave sucks but I need the points and to keep creating lines. At this point I HAVE TO take the points and HOPE to just get lucky and draw into a bingo no matter what the leave.

>Winter: AAAEGIO O8 AGA +18 188
#note Ditto--have to take the points. Can't give up points for a leave, or trade, or I'll be down well more than a bingo and I'll need to bingo twice to catch up.

#note Can't win if John keeps hitting.
>Winter: AADEIOR C2 DEAR +25 213
#note 
Didn't see (Z)OA and felt I needed the points. Bag is running out of vowels, so my chances of drawing a bunch of consotants are getting better.

#note ,Have to create a second line, otherwise John will kill the easiest column, and the I and C lines are low-prob.

#note Good find, but I still wish I WEREN'T BEING OUTDRAWN BY THE STRONG PLAYERS!!!
