#note HOP J2 39, 2I PH(En)OL 43.  Figured this was weak, but didn't realize how weak.  Oops.

#note Neglected the merits of J2 WO 28, leaving EIQSU.  Oops.  And I should've played the E.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: IOSW N6 WI.OS +36 317
>Ryan_Fischer: CEEORSW 4B CREW +23 251
#note Still missing the J2 spot.  Figured it was time to take a risk.  But, I also overlooked how powerful CEERS or CEORS is here, apparently.

>Kenji_Matsumoto: ADFO 7B ADO +17 359
>Ryan_Fischer: CEFMOUV 2J V..OM +45 352
#note Lots of options here.  I can figure him for a setup here with the F or D, and take out the spot, or I can take V(En)OM now, and come back for the F in two spots.  FLOE, which I saw, or FLOC, which I didn't immediately, but might have if I considered that spot more.  I like the path I took, getting rid of the V first.  It sure worked out.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AFILO A7 FOLIA +32 391
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEFLTU B10 FECULA +53 405
#note Champ says FAULT is 38% to win. I can't begin to understand the reasoning behind that.  With an S and Y unseen, I really can't let him afford to have too much of a comeback.  Then again, I will need a little luck to win and not slotting the A might prove to be a little better.  At least I saw all the plays, but FECULA is only 3rd.  I just thought I'd score a lot, leave one in the bag, and hope to catch up to him.  Very happy with this play as is.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ABBST 15A B.BA +27 418
#note With an incomplete rack, Champ isn't much help.  Kenji started to play BAST O12, but then changeed it to BABA, figuring I'd have something there.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEMORTY 13B .DOMETRY +88 493
#note Close to (C)OMETARY too, had I pulled the A.  Let it rain!
>Ryan_Fischer:  (IOSTT) +10 503
#note Overscored one of Kenji's plays by 2 somewhere.
