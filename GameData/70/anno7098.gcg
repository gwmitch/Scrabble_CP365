>Scott_Garner: UU -UU +0 0
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AFLTVY G5 FLA.Y +19 33
#note Not exactly excited about leaving VT, but with a blank, and this highest score, it's okay, I guess.  VATF(U)L is another option.  But that leaves an S hook.
>Scott_Garner: EGINT H1 TINGE +29 29
>Ryan_Fischer: ??DETTV 3G u.VETTeD +78 111
#note Well, I saw (G)aVoTTED and V()DETTes, but I thought to myself, why NOT try a phony for 2 more points?  :)  I thought it was good, and definitely seemed more plausible than any of the other phonies I've played up until this point.

#note Sorry, and welcome to the bagging.

#note Yeah, really, welcome.
>Scott_Garner: AELNORU 15E .OUL +12 131
#note He told me his rack here.  Q suggests 8A ALON(G) 28.
>Ryan_Fischer: EENOOQW 8A WOO +22 340
#note ...but then I'd have ENOW(S) for 36.  12A WOOE(D) 26
>Scott_Garner: AEINNRS 13A RAIS.NNE +68 199
#note Unfortunate for him, because this only bingo...
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIINQ 12C QA.I +45 385
#note ...makes my Q play worth 17 more.  :/
>Scott_Garner: AHIT A11 AI.TH +27 226
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEEINZ I7 A.ZE +25 410
#note I saw ZA, but wanted a better leave.  7C BE 17 is Q's next choice.  'tev.  And then fishing off the A at B12 is 3rd, nd just loopy.  ZIBE(T) is reasonable.  B(R)AIZE, too.  This is fine, I think, even though the B is weak if I really want to bingo again.
>Scott_Garner: ASY N5 AYS +35 261
>Ryan_Fischer: BEILNRT H10 BIL. +11 421
#note 5J L(I)B is more along the lines of what I'd want if I really want to bingo again.  I wasn't too concerned about blocking because of my lead and the fact that there were two lanes.  With two Is unseen, I'm surprised my play doesn't fare better.
>Scott_Garner: AEK O4 KAE +22 283
>Ryan_Fischer: EFGJNRT 5E JE.. +28 449
#note Wow, hit three bricks, and missed JEF(E) 10B for 40.
>Scott_Garner: CEEIIMS 1E EME.IC +10 293
#note Champ says 14A (T)IS 22, leaving EME(T)IC to go out.  He did it the other way around.  Nice plays.
>Ryan_Fischer: FGNRT 11J F..NG +9 458
>Scott_Garner: IS 14A .IS +22 315
>Scott_Garner:  (RT) +4 319
#note And hey, we added right this game at least.
