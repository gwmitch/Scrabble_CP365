>Evans_Clinchy: FHOORRW 8D WHOOF +36 36
#note Interesting decision here -- W on the star, keeping a vowel away from the DLS, or F on the star, avoiding the -ING snapback? I don't think I thought this through very well. Worrying about -ING is kinda paranoid, the other WHOOF is fine.

>Scott_Appel: ACMO 10B CA.OM +21 80
>Evans_Clinchy: ENNQRUY C3 QUEY +41 190
#note Sim favors QUEAN 2B, but I'm not buying it. I know NNR isn't that strong, but my play seems much stronger defensively and makes it harder for Scott to open things.
>Scott_Appel: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 80
>Evans_Clinchy: BDGINNR J6 BRING +25 215
#note Seemed sensible to cut off a lane and keep scoring. Maybe that's silly with only two other R's still out. The other option is BAND 2D, which brings me closer to another bingo.
>Scott_Appel: BLOTU 9I U.BOLT +10 90
>Evans_Clinchy: ADILNSX 2D L.X +51 266
#note Statically, the optimal play is just dropping the X, but this didn't seem like a great board for playing through excess consonants. Sim likes LAX.

>Evans_Clinchy: EEEIIIR 15F EE.IER +6 497
#note Not sure why I bothered with this -- it's still not like I'm going out in two or anything. Scoring 19 with WERE 13H is best here.
