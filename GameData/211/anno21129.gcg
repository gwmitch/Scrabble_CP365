#note 6M BYE is the chalk play and if I'm scared of that I should probably do 11K BECK, but I'm really OK with my play too. Maybe EMYDE is better. After BYE the types of 9x plays available are -IEST and -NESS or -LESS, which are the sorts of things Vicki will see. Against other opponents, maybe I play BYE.

#note Wow, very bad. I even saw ODIC, but had visions of bingos through the E and D, and wanted to fix that now while my rack was poor. I suppose I didn't gauge the threat of the OXID hooking line.

#note Sigh.

#note Many close plays in this spot, but INCHED makes no sense given the W in there.

#note Really just trying to hang on here somehow and block -IER and -IES bingoes and make any potential fits very tough. I've been burning huge chunks of time and have less than a minute when I play this.

#note Don't even consider the possibility of an out bingo here...I'm honestly just lucky that my play squeaked it out. Not my finest hour.
