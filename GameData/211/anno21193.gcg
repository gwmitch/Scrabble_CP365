>Sandy_Nang: ?EESTUV 8D VErTUES +76 76
#note glad that I remember this being good (but I did forget the 3rd anagram in the set, VERSUTE#).
>JD: DEEGILO D8 .OGIE +18 18
>Sandy_Nang: CCHN 11C C.NCH +24 100
>JD: DEGHLRW E5 HEW.D +27 45
#note I wanted to save the VOGIER# hook because I didn't know if Sandy had thought of it - so didn't want to play there on this turn. HEWED does give back a lot of points though, Q suggests GREWED# instead.

>JD: AGLNRSX F4 LAX +61 106
>Sandy_Nang: ?AIRTTU I1 TAInTUR. +59 189
#note best here is TURISTA/VOGIER#. I am lucky she did not spot that one...
>JD: GINORSW 1H S.ROWING +194 300
#note I would've played ROWINGS/VOGIER# not knowing WORSING, so this is a big swing

>Sandy_Nang: EEILNRY --  -65 189
>JD: BGILNOZ C1 BIZ +50 350
#note dreadful play that allows her to play INBYE instead of a much tougher play. also, just wrong because there are so many bingo lanes, and BLING gets me way closer. This is like a 30 point-mistake!!

#note lots of As and Ns left, so quackle seems ok with taking the points for BACON at C9, which I saw. but again, I kind of wanted to keep the R for VOGIER.

#note not maximizing my pre-endgame, quackle loves JA at 14B to give me a shot at bingoing again (the only bingo she can have is UNOPENED, 1/36).
>Sandy_Nang: EEIIOPU 15K EPO.E +33 403
#note best is KIPE at M12 blocking DINTED and saving EUOI in many spots
