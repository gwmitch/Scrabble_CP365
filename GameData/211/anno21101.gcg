#note knowing the front E hook and the back D hook would have made this play better.

#note CARINATES*. I was super wary of keeping GP, but keeping good tiles and sacrificing points seemed odd on this board. WOG with all the consos on the board doesn't sit well with me. WORMY is an option I considered, but WORMS seemed to give back fewer easy options. Sims best, assuming it doesn't get challenged.

#note BUDI is one more. GINT seems nice with the open R and A. ABIDING was also considered.

>Jackson_Smylie: AIILLOU O1 ILIA +21 279
#note ILIAL sims best, N10. OCULI I considered as well, which mucks up a lot of lanes, although she can open it back up pretty easily. ILIA takes care of the top right, one more play at the top left and the upper part of the board is taken care of. ILIA prevents another play on the O column that slots a nicer tile at O1, I do like the play. ILIAL just handles a different part, as long as something gets dealt with it seems fine.

#note kind of a stupid play, I don't think I'm up by enough to run away with the equity. I am still leaving the C, A, and G open, and giving a nice spot to open the 14 and 15 rows. N10 LOU looks nice.

>Jackson_Smylie: EEEFITW 14D WIFE +26 326
#note Not a play I'd normally make, but I know she has ACJ, which makes putting an E there a lot less worrisome. RAJ or TAJ won't hurt very much, and the equity increase short term is very good. 20:6 C:V ratio, so quackle suggests WEFT. I like it.

#note didn't see the other 88 point bingo, which doesn't slot a vowel next to a bonus square. HERTZES.

#note HONKY is valid. Cost me 38 spread. After the third game, I was 47 points behind Tony in spread. Didn't end up mattering, but was very close.
