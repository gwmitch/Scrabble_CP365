#note Way inferior to NARWAL. I just wanted to fork things now before Paul could completely turtle up. Not a situation where fishing is going to work.

#note RPD once phonied me with this and I didn't hold. The sad thing is it was completely unnecessary, as GLOBED in the same spot is much better and BROCHE scores way better. I mostly wanted to do anything but CAB which plays into Paul's hands.

#note No PRATING after x1. The interesting thing about the blank tile is that you can make it ANY letter you choose! I had forgotten about that very cool aspect of the blank.

#note I saw HAMFAT! But it seemed unnecessary. Already I'm hoping that maybe I pick the case A for a setup play.
