>Joshua_Sokol: ABDDEUZ H8 ADZED +36 36
#note I would have preferred to have played DAUBED here, but I wasn't 100% sure of its validity. I did not want to start the tournament off by phonying. I assumed it was close between DAUBED, ZEBU and ADZED. Ultimately I felt the extra points and the lack of a duplicate made ADZED a bit better.

#note This was surprisingly defensive and also lucky. I am already in great shape.

#note This was a confusing position. How dangerous is lane 15? I thought it was pretty dangerous, so I decided to shut it down. The aggressive way to do that is D11 FAV(E), but I didn't think this was the time to fish and be agressive, so I didn't even consider FAV(E). It seems right to do something that blocks lane 15, though. My chances of bingo-ing after FAV(E) are around 1/4, which doesn't seem like a good enough number to me.

#note NEW(B) may be better in the same spot. here I started to get really baffled. WE(B) might be better cause I bingo so much more often after he plays down to the Y. I knew that Y was dangerous but I couldn't hit it, but if he hits it he gives me a bingo lane. I thought maybe LIEGE(WOMEN) could come down after this, but turns out it's phony and Joel would have challenged.
