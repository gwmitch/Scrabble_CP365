>Josh: AAAOTUX H7 TAXA +22 22
>Mack_Meller: DHNRSSU I8 HURDS +27 27
#note He took a while to play here, it seemed he was weak. This is why I decided to throw that S out there and favor myself over Mack. I stand by it, but other lines are reasonable, such as playing I8 DUH, or HUNS, or even keeping the H with DUNS.
>Josh: AAEFIOU -AAIOU +0 22
#note keeping FE for J10. I don't know i I agree, but I don't dislike this play.
>Mack_Meller: ELNRSSU 12G SU. +4 31
#note This was a very low point. I thought I knew what UNLESS took. I thought it was only a G, but I omitted to think about SUNLESS. If I had seen SUNLESS, I would have probably worked out that RUNLESS was good too. I didn't even think of baseball! I wanted to cripple the board here and leave room for my S bingo. Another route to take is playing something at G6, but I actually didn't remember if NAHS* is new or not. I would have worked it out if I thought about it longer, but I was spending a lot of time already, so I didn't remember NAES+. Because of that lack of knowledge at that point, I played this, to throw him off. It sort of did.
>Josh: BEEFGNR J10 FE +30 52
>Mack_Meller: ELLNRRS -LLR +0 31
#note Oops, I didn't shake the bag after his exchange. I thought these were two of the tiles he exhanged, so I thought this to be a bad mistake! Turns out no.
>Josh: ABEGLOR K11 BOG +24 76
>Mack_Meller: EFNRSSZ 14K SERF +21 52
>Josh: AEILNRU 13K .RAIL +23 99
>Mack_Meller: EEINOSZ 12K .E +10 62
#note Or do I want to score with 11E ZEE? I felt comfortable taking out the scoring and bingo spot, and making him think hard about next move because this seems like a regular fish. This could throw him off and make him think I have one-pointers! I also considered going for ZEST L15 after figuring that REZ for 22 didn't hit nearly enough to be worth fishing off, and also set up P(REZ) or later, which is annoying.
>Josh: EEGINTU O8 GENTI. +24 123
>Mack_Meller: EINORSZ G6 ZIN +22 84
#note Decided not to fish off the Z and give him a lot of points for (Z)A(S), and continue shutting down the board with my case S. I didn't want to play ZIN(G) for two more since it gave back too much, and I had thought NAHS* was invalid at this point.
>Josh: EEIIKLU 11D LIEU +10 133
>Mack_Meller: AELOORS N2 ROSEOLA +71 155
>Josh: EIIKTT 4H KITTIE. +32 165
>Mack_Meller: EILMOPT E6 IMPOL.TE +62 217
#note blocked POLEMI(S)T, but surprisingly I saw the more common, more difficult bingo.
>Josh: ?AHMOOQ J2 QA. +32 197
>Mack_Meller: ABDNNTY M3 Y.NTA +35 252
#note No!!! I thought I was making BENDAY up! That's my play at M3. Words words words... -20 to add to my earlier -50, and I'm in a commanding lead... BAY(E)D was the other consideration, but no need to keep duplicates that don't score.
>Josh: ?HMOORV D3 VROOM +28 225
#note setting up H(MM) which will reopen the board! Other possible play is 13A HOOV(E)R.
>Mack_Meller: ABDEENW O1 WEB +34 286
#note I chickened out of WA(L)ED here at D9! But I also missed BAW(K) for 39. Ugh Ugh Ugh.
>Josh: ?HJOPRV C6 PHO +31 256
>Mack_Meller: ADDEENW 10B WEA.D +30 316
>Josh: ?DIJRUV 13B JIV. +28 284
#note JIV(E)D looks a bit better cause of the consos in the bag, but... another option is to play JUn(K), blowing the play, leaving IMPOLITER+ open and hoping for the other blank, cause otherwise it's near impossible to win this game.
>Mack_Meller: ACDENNO K3 A.ONED +16 332
#note I have to block column K here and empty the bag, otherwise lots of bingos are available. It's possible that I lose without Mack bingoing, but that is extremely unlikely. The best outrunning play seems to be 9A COND(O)!
>Josh: ??DINRU H1 DUN. +27 311
#note Quackle finds H1 plays that keep DIN and believes them to be best. Can you find a more complicated endgame sequence that does better than a loss by 14?
>Mack_Meller: ACCEGNY 3B CA.Y +24 356
#note considered YAG and CA(V)Y, but was more worried about getting stuck with stuff in an out-in-three, so even though I saw C(E)C(AL), I thought I would lose more points in the rest of the endgame if I played YAG. -2.
>Josh: ??IR B1 nI.eR +10 321
#note Mack was unsure of IMPOLITER, so instead he played a word that better describes him :)
>Josh:  (CEGN) +14 335
