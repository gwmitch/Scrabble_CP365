#note CHINA takes an R, making this a worse play. I hated playing this, but there isn't any star play here. API(A)N looks pretty good, as does CHUFA. I think I like CUPI(D) best, I want a more closed board. That's what I was going for with CHINA, but the R hook worsens that. APIAN sims best.

#note after PUP I wanted to close the board some, and THEOREM does that more than plays like HOMER, but somehow I forgot about the first play I saw, OHM. Big mistake.

#note I wanted to keep the ILLATIVES hook alive in case 2J got blocked, but I have A5 as well, and 2J isn't likely to get taken. BRIG or BRIGS looks good to reach for the A's and O's.

#note WUS looks a bit better. Wasn't sure what I'd draw outside of the 1 row, but I was hoping for something. I saw IR? would bingo with UNIVERSE or GRIEVOUS, it turns out AR? also makes gravures.

#note Very solid performance on Tony's part - I played this game rather sloppily. 

MIXEN got the +5
