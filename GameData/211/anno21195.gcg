#note the ACIMO leave actually bingos 40% next turn, which is sweet

#note fun words!

>JD: DIRTVVW K4 VIV.D +24 203
#note DRW leave is a little better than RTW, apparently (so VIVAT)
>Sandy_Nang: MPU 15A UMP. +33 194
#note chickened out of GLIFT. the bag is extraordinarily vowel-heavy, so I was happy to play through, but exchanging is about even (lots of goodies in the bag
>JD: FGLRTTW 5I FL.TT +8 211
#note there are many vowels so I chose to play through. GLIFT# would've been an upgrade. GLIFT and keeping RT sim about even - exchanging is pretty tempting with three esses and the Z remaining.
>Sandy_Nang: AGH 8M HAG +34 228
>JD: AEGLNRW 9L NAW +26 237
#note even with 5 Ns out, GNR >> GLR, and the number of Es is enough that playing LEW actually wins.
>Sandy_Nang: DHO 14B HO. +32 260
>JD: EGLNRRS M7 ...NGER +26 263
#note CHARNEL actually sims about as well thanks to the large number of Is and Ns to complete the GRS leave.
>Sandy_Nang: ANNO L11 ANON +17 277
>JD: ELRRRSW 11K R..ER +12 275
#note needed to cover this spot, I think keeping the W is more valuable in the long run compared to playing WAGER now.

#note championship player likes RIFE at 15H - seems like it could be a real result, by allowing me to play on column C

#note low on time. best simming is LI at 11G saving spots for GURUS.
