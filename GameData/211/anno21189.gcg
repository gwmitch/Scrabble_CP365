#note I should keep EMSS? I think, since I bingo a bit less but score better on my bingos. Not a big difference.

>Josh: ?AERSSS 5E SASSiER +82 104
#note So many bingos, but I need to see ASSuRES, cause that's so much better.

#note Lloyd said he had TADPOLE here and nowhere to put it, and even saw (C)LODPATE through the C, but the opening came a turn too late. He probably should play 3L OD here, but stylistically this isn't terrible for him.

#note I blanked on what to do here. I knew I had to block the T, but IDIO(T) was better I think, although the pool might not be vowel-heavy enough. Hmm.
