#note If Joey had seen his bingo, this game would have been wholly different!

#note making my best play even better. Actually, my best play could have been 9J EEEW! Not that I would have seen that :(
>Joey_Mallick: BEIJMOR 8A JIB.. +42 98
>Josh: ?ADEIST A8 .ADEITeS +98 210
#note Had I looked for 20 more seconds for something else, I would have seen the new 8 here for 101...
>Joey_Mallick: EILMORW C3 WORM +33 131
>Josh: AADDEOV B2 DADO +28 238
#note My preference here was to give back a bit less to Joey with a reoverlap, so not to play AVO or OVA, since A(VOW) makes some overlaps score more than 50, bringing him well within striking distance. I preferred to keep the V for reoverlap scoring sometimes, but board control for other scenarios. Perhaps it's too much potential with my own reoverlaps (such as DEDAL if I draw an L, BEDAD with a B, etc., as well as my bingo potential.
>Joey_Mallick: EEILNQU L8 .IQUE +34 165
#note Joey said he wasn't thrilled with this play. Another option is either 14A (e)QUINE or 11A (E)QUINE, depending on how aggressive Joey wants to be.
>Josh: AEEOUVX B13 EX +36 274
#note played EX so as not to allow (S)E bingos. The leave isn't ideal, but I'm scoring so well here. (S)UAVE is another option! It just doesn't score that much, but that's fine for now. Dunno, EX leaves me less flexible, so I might want to play SUAVE. If only EXAE(Q)UO were a word...
>Joey_Mallick: AELNNNU B10 ANN.. +23 188
#note But I gave him a great play that annuls what I was trying to accomplish last turn!
>Josh: AAEOPUV 10I OPA.UE +25 299
#note This was tough. I'm ahead more than a bingo after this, but if Joey is able to hit any of the three huge hooks for OPAQUE, he'll be right back in the game... I'm giving him around 10 more points on average per bingo and more sevens as well with this play. I'm hoping he left something like he did (ELNU) and that he can't hit the hook, but that if he can, not with a bingo. This is by far the best play for my own sake, but it could go terribly wrong. I felt like I was more likely to be able to outrun a lot of things after OPAQUE, though, but not some of the bingos he could have... The other option is to play AVO or AVA at F9, for 20, leaving pretty terribly. That blocks a few 7s, doesn't increase his average score, keeps the board sort of closed for a lot of racks. I really don't know if my aggressiveness was merited here, but it ended up working out in my favor.
>Joey_Mallick: ?EELNOU 11D tOLUENE +68 256
#note If I hadn't given him a spot for this, would he have seen 15A (S)ELENOUs? I guess ANNEX was just autopilot, because seeing and liking that it reopens the possibility of bingos starting in (S)E would probably lead to seeing the 87-pointer. Joey's only other option is the 9, NONLE(AG)UE, which is an even tougher find. If I had played AVO or AVA, I wonder what would have happened?
>Josh: ADHLTUV O7 THUD +43 342
>Joey_Mallick: EGIIOST 13H EGOIST +36 292
>Josh: ABCLOVZ N3 COLZA +38 380
#note I could just keep trying to outrun by playing A1 VAC, but this scores more and blocks a big lane, so what could go wrong here that wouldn't go wrong after a play like A1 VAC? No need to be greedy after one huge thing worked in my favor.
>Joey_Mallick: IILRRST 9C IR. +25 317
>Josh: ABHORVY H11 .V.RY +45 425
#note I also longly considered 14H HOY to not give back any freak Y bingos, but I was ahead enough.
>Joey_Mallick: EGILRST A1 GEL +21 338
>Josh: ABCHIOT 14M AB +10 435
#note nowhere for my lucky natural. I think 3H CHAOTI(C) is the right play here, but I was afraid of possible Y bingos and I liked how this gave Joey the (wrong) choice of fishing. Probably an oversight
