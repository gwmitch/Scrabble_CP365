#note Interesting play here. I was choosing between 11B TOFU, FEOD, and L7 TUFOLI. At this score I wanted to do something board closing, and at the very least FEOD forces column K to end in a blank S, as opposed to several vowels. It also blocks the T, which wasn't the biggest threat to begin with, but it's something. TUFOLI blocks the L but gives back a line, and TOFU blocks nothing but keeps a good leave given the consonant heaviness of the pool. Quackle thinks by playing FEOD over TOFU, I reduce Larry's bingo% by less than one percent. Not a great savings. But I think maybe in the long term it will help me more to have that sevens lane closed off.

#note Another tricky one. The plays I considered here were OUTRIDE, VOLTI, and VITRIOL. Quackle also likes OUTVIE, which I didn't consider. OUTVIE could yield some nasty scores that bring Larry nearly even, so I'm not sure I like it that much. OUTRIDE nicely cripples row 5 and scores as well as I can here. On the other hand, leaving IV after OUTRIDE could go bad in a hurry with a lot of heavy consonants lurking and fewer vowels. VITRIOL is the blockiest play of all, preventing double-doubles and eliminating columns L and M, but leaving the lone U isn't ideal even though the Q is out. I felt that VOLTI best split the difference between scoring, vowels in leave, and blocking something.

#note Another tricky play here. What I was doing here is feinting a fish while going for QINTAR D1, which looks to score enough to win most endgames on this board. It's also kind of sneaky and might go unnoticed. Scoring only 6 points definitely hurts, though. Other options include 12F TUI, which scores well and retains the possibility of TRANQ, and 14C ANI, which is the highest score I can get here and retains a U for the Q, though it's hard to see how that would help without more vowels. I like my play because of the sneakiness element and also because it blocks a game-ending QUOTA play while preserving the case I to respond to C3 QUOTA.
