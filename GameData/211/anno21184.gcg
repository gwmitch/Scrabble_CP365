>Josh: AABIOTX L12 OBIA +34 365
#note No! I missed I(N)BOX! I considerd D1 TAXI and L12 OBIA here, and judged that scoring and threatening a nice X play as well as maybe a bingo would be the best route to take to win the game. OBIA accomplished that better than OBIT obviously, but for some reason the sim likes TAXI better. The win% increase is due to Quackle assuming Wally will open the board, so maybe that's why. Otherwise I don't see why TAXI would be better.

>Josh: ADRRTTX 15H TART.R +18 383
#note This is not only the best endgame, but if Wally missed X(E)D H11, it's likely I will gather even more spread since he will attempt to block the only out he sees, at 5B. Instead he just made the wrong play in the wrong spot, since he missed X(E)D.
