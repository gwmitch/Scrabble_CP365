#note Hmm. So I have to try and guess which of MOTLEYS, MOTLEYER, and TOMALLEY are best to block...this takes out two of those options and forces a triple to come open. I burned a boatload of time on this, of course.

#note HOGAN same spot I guess is better, but just playing OHO or HOLO down column F is the way to go. Keeping a consonant heavy leave with an S and an A in it looks pretty good here with the S hooks, MEGA, and row 14 open.

#note HAMATE opens a new line without getting me hit on the triple. It blocks WAULS but anything that plays there plays with MEGS too already. Error.

#note I ran my clock down very low trying to work out different scenarios and work out my tracking before ultimately screwing up completely. I was dead to optimal play here but this play was just giving up and realizing I had approximately 10 seconds left on my clock. It's funny, I frequently have this situation happen to me in games where I challenge a phony early in the game, but I don't seem to have any alarm bells go off during those games to speed up a little in the midgame to avoid time pressure.
