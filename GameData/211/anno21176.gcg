#note Should I really play through this? Even after the exchange?
>bnjy: ACHIJ 8F AJI +20 20
#note Benjy said he kept the H this turn cause he had the C too. Interesting!
>Josh: EHMNPRV E8 HEMP +36 36
>bnjy: CDEHNU 11E .UNCHED +30 50
>Josh: CEGINRV H11 .ERIC +30 66
#note I guess I really shouldn't be keeping such clunk. I really just wanted to score. I should play something like GI(V)E, V(E)G (which I prefer) or GRIEV(E) on column J.
>bnjy: AGRZ J7 GRAZ. +35 85
#note Benjy first laid down GAZ(E)R, then changed it to GRAZ(E). Not sure why he opted for the less optimal option! :P
>Josh: GIMNORV 12J ROVING +43 109
#note Close between this and 8J (R)OVING. I prefer this. Dunno why.

#note LEGAL(I)SE is better since it reduces my scoring and bingo chances.
>Josh: AEKNNOT 15K TOKEN +35 298
#note 15A NEKTON works, although that opens an annoying lane, so I prefer this.

>bnjy: ?EIOSTT 15A STEnOTI. +84 301
#note Nice! This is exactly what Benjy needed to have a chance of making a comeback. He can't take OSTEiTI(C) for 2 more, the S is necessary to keep open.
>Josh: BEIOOTU A9 BOOTIE. +10 382
#note I had to choose here between the outrunning route and the defensive route, and I think that being ahead 80 after this was enough to avoid the most losing scenarios. 
>bnjy: BF M11 F.B +16 317
>Josh: ADRRSUY N6 YA +28 410
#note I don't know what I was thinking! Leave two in the bag, and avoid him emptying it and scoring enough to bingo out and win...
>bnjy: OW B9 OW +32 349
>Josh: ADLRRSU 6C .UR. +5 415
#note Finally was able to track and was only worried about crazy possible 9s through the S and D. One day I will know enough words to make the right endgame play here. Oh wait, this was right anyway...
