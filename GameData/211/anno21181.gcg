#note I should probably play 2L (I)T, since there is literally no way to win this game. I can't make a move that draws into anything. So better just to block SLEEPIER. Maybe I have to attempt SLEEPMAT* or SLEEPART*, hoping Joel lets them go because of his unfamiliarity with new words? Dunno, looked hopeless.

#note -9 apparently, but since I may get stuck with some tiles it's hard to tell. Obviously this is wrong but how wrong is it?
>Josh: ALMRRT F2 ..R +5 296
#note -1 to LAM
>Joel_Horn: AGIIR 4L .RAI +12 399
#note This is his worst play. He has 9 plays that are better than this, but he has only 10 possible plays here.
>Josh: ALMRT N4 .RM +11 307
#note unfortunately I didn't punish him severely enough, as O3 M(I)TRAL, an adjective I was unfamiliar with, is the right play here. First I laid down AMR(I)T, then thought this was better. Could have easily done the math. -1 again if you don't count MITRAL, which you should! Still, at least this isn't my worst play besides passing.
