>Josh: CDEILOO 3C COOED +33 130
#note Nope, seems I just missed the SAME new bingo twice in a row!!! That is amazing... Unfortunately new bingos are not the only bingos I will miss this game.

#note Alright, I didn't "miss" this, I saw it and debated playing it for quite a long time. I just didn't know if I was confusing this word with FRISE or something. I really regretted not playing this afterwards, since I was convinced it was valid for the rest of the game. This is a bad fish anyways. If I draw another vowel I'm toast.
>Paul_Avrin: ABEEITU 9A BEAUTIE +67 182
>Paul_Avrin: ABEEITU --  -67 115
#note But I didn't draw a vowel, I drew a blank, and held this until I was convinced that a) I had no 3x3 to come back, and b) it was better to challenge even if I did have a 3x3.
>Josh: ?AEIRSS 9B bRAISES +66 227
#note And Quackle randomly draws the blank too! Ridiculous. I couldn't play any of the 74-pointers, since they all gave Paul an S to play his phony through, SAuRIES looks decent as well, since Paul is likely to exchange next turn instead of taking the spot it opens.
>Paul_Avrin: ABEEITU -BIEU +0 115
>Josh: EHIIINO D6 INI. +5 232
#note I think this sort of defense is merited here. I can always score with my H next turn. But perhaps I should counter-exchange.
>Paul_Avrin: AENRSTU 10H SAUNTER +64 179
#note B7 UR(b)ANEST could be right here. Hard find.
>Josh: ?EHIMOO 11I MHO +29 261
#note Hello undeserved blank number 2, and hello, common bingo miss. I will never miss HEI(R)lOOM again! :(

Also, I probably shouldn't keep three vowels here, even though this scores better than everything else. 
>Paul_Avrin: ABDEGZ M9 B.GAZED +46 225
>Josh: ?EIOPQX C6 QI +26 287
#note Now this turn was tough, and I didn't miss anything! I had a choice to either play for equity, fish for a humongous 3x3 by dropping just the Q (EPOXI(D)ES). Furthermore, I could have just spent my blank and pulled ahead a bunch. I could play 15H PIQuE(D), or, using the same tiles, N4 PIQuE, setting up my X, something that probably won't be blocked next turn. But I'm really not hitting the X-bomb often at all, and so playing PIQuED for 14 more is a better idea for sure. Maybe I didn't consider that long enough. This was possibly greedy. But I think it might be the right play anyway.
>Paul_Avrin: AEIIILV 15I IVIE. +10 235
#note Actual rack. Paul was mad he didn't draw into a bingo and instead his last tile was an I, which is fair enough, but he has to see VAILED or VIALED here.
>Josh: ?EOOPTX N4 POX +33 320
#note Ooh, I didn't actually know SEXPOT, but that plays at O10 for 73.

>Josh: EEHKNRS O12 .ERK +30 419
#note I missed 15A ESKER, but 14L H(E)N is best since it gives me that next turn. This is 5 points behind.
>Paul_Avrin: GNRT E8 T.NG +12 319
#note -1 to G(E)NT since this sets up TINGE. I think I chickened out? Dunno why I made my second best outplay.
