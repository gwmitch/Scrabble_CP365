>Jenn_Lee: EENORUW H7 WORE +14 14
#note third and last game of the triple round-robin. tricky choice between going long with ERENOW or short with WOE. At the very least, OWE must be better than WORE because the ENRU leave is much better balanced. 
>JD: DEIMNVV 10E VIV. +12 12
>Jenn_Lee: AEENNSU E9 A.ENUE +18 32
#note nice play
>JD: ?DEEIMN 15E sIDEMEN +86 98
#note jesus, why am I so lucky. at least I didn't know DESMINE#.
>Jenn_Lee: AEELNRS 9H .ELEARNS +60 92
#note jenn chickened out of LEANERS. renewals also available.
>JD: GILORRU O3 RIGOUR. +27 125
#note or GUIROS
>Jenn_Lee: AACMPST 14J PACTS +42 134
#note PACTA# would save the S. I didn't know that word (doesn't take the S).
>JD: ABLNOOT F4 BOLTON.A +66 191
>JD: CGLTUWY (challenge) +5 196
#note lucky
>Jenn_Lee: AEIMOST M2 ATOMISE. +72 206
>JD: CGLTUWY L8 W.GYU +41 237
>JD: ?CEEILT (challenge) +5 242
#note yum
>Jenn_Lee: DILORRT D4 TORRID +20 226
#note jenn needs to keep some lanes open here, since she likely won't catch me without bingoing - TIRLED at 14A would leave the valuable bingo lane on column D open.
>JD: ?CEEILT J2 LEnTICE. +63 305
#note playing it safe. leaves no bingo lanes on the board. LENTICLE# would be even safer if I'd known it.
>Jenn_Lee: AEFHJLO L4 JO +40 266
#note HAJ for 51 is a lot of points!
>JD: ADGHKPY D11 KAY +36 341
#note I blew this play pretty badly. A good play should block the X spot at 14F and not give any other cheap scoring plays back. HYPED at 14B is sick because it sets up GAK/KY for next turn.
>Jenn_Lee: AEFFHLO C12 HALF +38 304
#note sets up SHAN# and now all of a sudden she actually has a path to victory. should play HAFF# at C12 for more points though
>JD: AADGHPZ E3 PAH +33 374
#note several plays would be a little better: 1) EGAD at 14E to block the X play or 2) ZAP at G3, taking advantage of the fact that only one O is left to set up a big scoring spot on column H. I would do EGAD had I thought of it.
>Jenn_Lee: EFIIOQU N1 QI +26 330
#note can QUOIF at 2C win jenn the game? I think no - would only leave 1 tile in the bag, and I should be able to block SHAN and outrun her. Therefore, her best play could be actually keeping the Q and hoping to draw a big Q bingo. playing the O is pretty tough because it's the last one and it allows access to row 2. maybe INFO at N8? perhaps QI is the right play, allowing her to play QI next turn and possibly draw a bingo? tough call.
>JD: ADDGNXZ F14 X. +50 424
#note of course, my inaccurate play for the last two turns is rewarded by drawing the X and clinching the game. lol.
>Jenn_Lee: EFIIOTU 15A IF. +27 357
#note keeps her in range if she can draw a bingo...
>JD: ADDEGNZ 11K Z.GA +34 458
#note she can have 2 bingos: BONIEST or SUBTONE. However, I can't block both of the simultaneously. I took the safe win, but I can play GAZE at 3G to gain spread by blocking SUBTONE (and still outrunning BONIEST).
>Jenn_Lee: EINOSTU 1N .I +33 390
>JD: BDDEN 8A DEN. +15 473
#note my play gives her an out, should play ADDS at N11 saving BENI
>Jenn_Lee: ENOSTU O11 SOU +22 412
>Jenn_Lee: ENOSTU --  -22 390
#note best is SETON at 2B
>JD: BD 3I B.D +9 482
>JD:  (ENOSTU) +12 494
#note somehow I underscored Jenn's play by 22 points. Sorry Jenn!!
