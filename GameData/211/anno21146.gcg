>Joey: ABEEEGN 8D BEGAN +22 22
#note Or BEE.  I liked this a little better.
>Joshua: AEEKLNO 7E OAK +28 28
#note OAKEN is much better. I was not focused.
>Joey: EEEIMPT 9G TEPEE +21 43
#note Not so smart.  This sets up all kinds of mega plays that I don't currently have.  BETIME looks better, although that doesn't provide ideal defense either.
>Joshua: ADEEELN 8J ANELED +28 56
>Joey: CEIMRUY 6C MIRY +35 78
>Joshua: CEGLNOR N8 .RELONG +20 76
>Joey: ACEERUW 10F WAE +25 103
>Joshua: ACNOOSU M3 UNCOO. +18 94
#note I briefly considered (B)ACONOUS here.
>Joey: ACEIORU 4L U.AI +10 113
#note I didn't notice AREIC O11, although saving OU can lead to disaster.
>Joshua: ASX O10 SAX +39 133
>Joey: ACEORRW 13G CAREWOR. +84 197
>Joshua: DDEIRST H12 D.RT +21 154
>Joey: ?AIJOVZ 9B AVO +14 211
#note Going for a big Z play, which would not only score a ton but shut down that lower lane.
>Joshua: DEISSTT B7 ST.IDEST +72 226
#note Guess I'll have to rely on Plan B.
>Joey: ?IIJLNZ 12A Z.IN +46 257

>Joey: ?DIJLOU B1 JUDO +28 285
>Joshua: BGHRTVY L11 GR.VY +32 319
>Joey: ?EIILMS 3B .ELIMItS +74 359
#note Hard to resist the style points of LEMNISCI, but this left a more desirable board defensively.
>Joshua: BHIINOT 2E THO +33 352
>Joey: AFFHLTU 5J LAT.H +27 386
#note NUFF wins more comfortably, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing some new five with BIIN.
>Joshua: BIIN 15D BINI. +10 362
>Joshua:  (FFU) +18 380
#note Josh: OAKEN probably cost me at least 6 points :)
