>Josh: ILNNRTW H4 TWIRL +18 18
>Karl_Higby: JORU 7F JU.OR +14 14
>Josh: CEINNSY 5H .INCY +26 44
#note This looked weird, but who is anyonel to challenge this unless they know for sure? It's just WINCEY.
>Karl_Higby: EEZ F7 .EEZ +40 54
>Josh: EINORST 11E OESTRIN +99 143
#note Sometimes I get lucky.
>Karl_Higby: ?EEIPRT L9 PEsTIER +75 129
#note I think 4A PrETERI(T) is the play here. What a cool word, I doubt he saw it.
>Josh: AABDETU 4L BAUD +32 175
#note Aggressive, but the score was close.
>Karl_Higby: Q J10 Q. +31 160
>Josh: AEFIITU O4 .AUTIE +21 196
#note I also considered 15K F(R)UIT, but I preferred the scoring potential of FI to the disaster potential of AEI. It's an interesting choice between the two plays, ultimately I decided that since Karl didn't have an X last turn like 90% of the time, I should make myself the chief candidate to draw the bomb. 
>Karl_Higby: DENOY 15G YONDE. +30 190
>Josh: EEFGINS N9 FEEING +29 225
#note I don't think I would have had enough guts to attempt FEIGNE(R)S if it wasn't blocked. It's a word, good thing he blocked it. 
>Karl_Higby: IX -  +0 190
#note Karl challenged.
>Josh: ?AGHSST 3J GHAT +28 253
>Karl_Higby: IX N6 XI +52 242
>Josh: ?LMOSSV 9E L.VS +20 273
#note I don't know for sure if this was my rack, as it wasn't recorded, but I seem to remember also considering MOS at 14F. If this was my rack, I missed MOVEL(E)SS, even though I remember seeing it as a possibility? I don't know. 
>Karl_Higby: AAEIPRT 14A APTERIA +77 319
#note In any case, Karl would have played APTERIA/ATWIRL* if I hadn't pluralized TWIRL, and I would have snap challenged, giving me my second extra turn this game.
>Josh: ?DMOOSS 15A DOOM +52 325
#note I think I have to forgo the bingo here, otherwise the board is just way too easy to score on and maintain a lead. 
>Karl_Higby: ACEKW 12A WACKE +38 357
>Josh: ?DMOSSU O12 DUOS +31 356
>Karl_Higby: ABG 13G BAG +22 379
>Josh: ?FMNOSV 10L .V.S +15 371
#note I'm really in trouble now. It's going to be hard to win without a bingo. I think I have to hope for a quasi miracle draw here. I draw into FORMAN(T)S 3/8 of the time if I play (E)V(E), but I draw into FORAMIN(A) if I drop the S too, and I can likely outrun Karl in more scenarios if I play EVES too. I also saw and considered OV(A) and NOV(A). NOV(A) looked better at face value but it emptied the bag, making it way too easy for Karl not to mess up, so OV(A) looked better. I can draw into FANTASM, FANDOMS, FAMINES, FLAMENS, FIRMANS, FANTOMS, SURFMAN, FOMENTS, FRENUMS/SURFMEN, INFIRMS and INFORMS after OV(A), so that looks good, except I may lose to blocks? That might actually be the right play, I don't know. 
>Karl_Higby: AH 11A AH +15 394
>Josh: ?AFMNOR 4B FORMAN.s +75 446
#note This was like my best possible draw, but like I said, I outrun in a lot of scenarios too. I don't have to find or play my bingo here to win. 8A FORMe(E) and some other plays also do the job. So ultimately, for the sake of winning the game, I thing EVES was my play.
