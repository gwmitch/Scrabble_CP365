#note hmm, misvaluated that. thought scoring was more important but that's not enough points. LOOPER/POOLER but i don't like putting that O there though. (-8)

#note completely missed CLUMP. but look! quackle likes MULL a tiny bit better by win%. :D

#note i wasn't too horrified with my play because it kept the best leave i could with that rack, but 11H WHAT is much better. i forgot about SIMA. (-14.5)

#note after his BABOO block, i don't know what the hell to do. 1D BOOB is obviously wrong as they kill my only lane, but he's likely to go there anyway. i wish quackle would handle this better. so i just went for a random, very vaguely opening play that might distract him. what would you do here? i don't want to just give up on the game.

#note i think i was low on time in this game but i can't remember. i do remember not being able to come up with any word even with the incredibly easy SNAKIEsT basically looking up at me begging to be anagrammed. i'm really a quite bad anagrammer. -1000000
