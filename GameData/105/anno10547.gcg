#note Fishing for (C)LEVEITE. Robin is low on time, and a bit flustered, so my hope is that she has the S and tries to play for points.
>Robin_PD: EEIMOSU 9B .I +7 385
#note The N was in the bag. Robin didn't know what I had, but correctly deduced that the only way she would win was if I bingoed, and there was only one place to do that.

#note And I hit the fish, too! This is the top endgame by 18 points.
