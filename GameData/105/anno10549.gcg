#note I thought of, and then promptly forgot C(O)LONEL. NOEL 8A looks to be best, though.
>Ron_Howard: OW C12 OW +22 41
>dacrON: ?ADFILO 8A FLI. +29 75
#note So, I thought of NAILFOLD through the L, but not NAILFOLD FROM THE STUPID N. what an idiot. The best nonbingos sim only about a point or two behind. This play sims a surprising 7 points behind - ADO must be weak here!
>Ron_Howard: EIKNRTT 7H KNITTER +69 110
>dacrON: ?AADORS K5 mA.ADORS +82 157
#note Didn't take the time to look for (L)OADStAR, and chickened out of pARADOS. Why am I trying to make a shootout here?
>Ron_Howard: EEJP J10 JEEP +58 168
#note I absolutely deserved that.

>dacrON: DEEGMOY J6 Y.D +36 243
#note Debated between this play and GEOD(ES)Y. GEOD(ES)Y comes out half a point aheadm but YOGE(E) is the sim winner. On shootout boards, my main thought is, POINTS. This might be stupid of me, but I got myself into this mess...
