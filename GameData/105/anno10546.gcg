#note Simes 3.5 points behind HO N6. I just didn't like the vowelless leave.

#note I don't know what to say. I just didn't know (V)IBrONIC. I do know (V)INIC though.
>Trip_Payne: ?AEGLSU A4 .ALGUSEs +83 270
#note A very nice play.
>dacrON: ?BFILMN B10 FIB +30 225
#note Sims about a point behind FIN in the same spot - BLM goes together better than LMN, and opens a much nicer lane.

>Trip_Payne: AELPRTZ 12B .LAZER +34 334
#note I blocked PATZER. Quackle docks 17 points of equity here in favor of PL(O)TZ.

#note You have to see my next draw to believe it.
>Trip_Payne: ADNW 2D DAWN +23 357
#note I'd love to know what Trip's leave was here. Simply playing WAD neutralizes the bottom part of the board, and scores 26. I'm guessing his leave was all consonants...
>dacrON: EOQRSTU 14D ROQUETS +96 414
#note Yep, that really happened. I'm trying to learn to just accept the good fortune, rather than feeling unworthy of such a reward. Note that if this lane had been blocked, QUEST for 77 wouldve made for a closer game.
