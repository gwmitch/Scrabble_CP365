>Ryan_Fischer: AEKNNPV 8D KNAVE +34 34
>Ian_Weinstein: IJY G6 JI.Y +22 22
>Ryan_Fischer: CEHNOPS D8 .ENCH +28 62
#note Q static likes PHON(E) or H(I)P better.
>Ian_Weinstein: RY 8D .....RY +17 39
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IOOPSU H4 UPO +15 77
#note He blocked cOPIOUS, and I couldn't find IMPOROUS.  PO(Y)OU is next best.
>Ian_Weinstein: IIII -IIII +0 39
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IILOOS C12 OI +9 86
#note I could easily get whacked for 40 points after POLIO.  This is nice 'cause I have the hook and the blank.
>Ian_Weinstein: AEFZ B12 FAZE +43 82
#note Very surprising.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AILORS 15A S.RAgLIO +122 208
#note Or PELORIAS.  Was going to play CORDIALS before this.  Also of note: ROYALIST/ROYALISM.
>Ian_Weinstein: FGIT 14H GIFT +19 101
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIMNS 15K AMINE +32 240
#note More As than Is, hence this instead of IMINE.  Q static says AMI for 24 keeping EINS.  I guess that's a good idea for bingoing again fast if I'm concerned about spread.  Me, I'd rather secure the points.
>Ian_Weinstein: IO 10B IO. +5 106
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGIOSV 11D .OVE +18 258
#note EVASIO(N) for 36, VO(Y)AGE for 25, OGIVE for 18.  This is definitely a mistake 'cause of the score and the shape of the board.  Shoulda looked harder.
>Ian_Weinstein: AEEILRS 12G REALISE +68 174

>Ian_Weinstein: EGT M7 TEG +30 256
>Ryan_Fischer: ABDINPR I6 BI.D +22 406
#note A8 BAP 27.  Oops.  I chickened out on UPBRAID and UPBIND too, even though they aren't nearly as good according to Q static.
>Ian_Weinstein: ELTW A8 WELT +25 281
>Ryan_Fischer: AHNOPRU E3 ORPHA. +22 428
#note Best score, kills the U partially.
>Ian_Weinstein: CNTU 4H .NCUT +14 295
>Ryan_Fischer: ADDMNRU 4B MUD.A +16 444
#note Wanna kill column B.  He killed L for me.  Champ says 7A DAM.
>Ian_Weinstein: ?ELRSTW M1 ToWER +22 317
#note Champ says J6 ST(Y).
>Ryan_Fischer: DDENRT C3 T.NED +16 460
#note D(U)RED.  Champ says DEN(I) to block L(E)S.
