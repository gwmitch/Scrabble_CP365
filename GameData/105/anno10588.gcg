#note Spent a long time not liking any of my options here, but EGG 6I is fine.

#note Another toughie. I didn't like what EGO I13 did to the board, nor PONGEE what it did to my rack. I'm open to suggestions.
>Cesar: ABDHIIV B6 DIVA +15 210
#note i don't really like AVID 4I that much but i guess it's not as 'opening' as it seems. also it scores more. (-4.5)

#note mike: GODETIA O9 would've been sick. (And a marginal improvement.) cesar: eek, i wasn't expecting that, and now i'm in trouble
>Cesar: ?DHOOPT 14J HOD +33 272
#note i was bummed about no place for hoptoad, but photoed is also good.

#note I am STEE and STEE is me! This is phony. I don't even think I held. cesar: i remember you holding for a bit. i was not that sure of it myself but really needed something obviously before the board shut down. the best non bingo option looks like 12L MOB; that still gives me a good shot at winning.

#note enamour 3G kicks ass. quackle wants me to block and mike will not bingo very often thru the U. (-14%)
>Mike: ?AEISUY K7 AY +12 357
#note What, exactly, is my path to victory supposed to be after YEA A4 (or A5), or YA G14? Those three sim a few percentage points ahead (48-49% each,  compared to 46% after AY). I'm not sure I understand.
>Cesar: AEINNRU 3H RE.AIN +18 396
#note i chickened out on numina which wins 100% of the time, but remain has to also win 100%, right? it doesn't show up in championship player. i think it may lose sometimes. not sure. even with drawing another U i can usually score enough.
>Mike: ?ACEISU H1 SC.E. +33 390
#note NAStIC 14A is two better, but not enough to matter.
