#note conrad says: So I wasn't sure of this word, but it gave me ENRO(L)LED for 86 with an otherwise dead rack that would make for a tough beginning game. I decided that taking random racks for both of us with a 12 point lead was a better play than if the word came off. Am I overanalyzing this situation? Jesse disagrees, so maybe there is a discussion here. Or maybe I'm just a moron. jesse says: wow, that's a lot of analysis. I thought it was good so I played it.

#note conrad says: lol. jesse says: even though the tournament was a round-robin, it was also pseudo-king of the hill early so I had to play conrad earlier than I felt totally comfortable with. Any time I sit down to play conrad it usually ends up being one of the toughest games of the tournament. this would be no exception.

#note B(O)WMAN sims about 2 better. I can only wonder how this game would have turned out if I had played it instead.
>Jesse_Day: EGHINYZ A6 .YEZ +48 188
#note this is kind of a huge rack

#note conrad says: aiyah!
>dacrON: ABFIJRU 10B JUB. +29 195
#note Simming a point behind JABIR(U) B1, and 2 behind RAJ B8. I considered all of these plays, but decided JUBE was most conducive to bingoing the soonest.

#note conrad says: Challenged (HUMANE)R. jd says: I held for probably three or four minutes before challenging. if I challenge it off, I'm a very comfortable favorite to win the game (as long as I make sure to block the other spot for ratafia). if I don't challenge it off this one will be a shootout the rest of the way, especially after JIVIER/JOKIER. quackle suggests numbers of 70-75% win chances after accepting and 40% or so afer a lost challenge. That's about what I imagined, and I thought there was a greater than 50% chance it was no good. and that was that.

#note Huge swing in two turns...Jesse is an incredible player, so I'll take whatever I can get.
>Jesse_Day: EIIKORV B10 .OKIER +34 343
#note conrad says: Put down (J)IVER first.
>dacrON: ?CEGITW 15A C.EW +39 371
#note It's frustrating that I know G(R)EW is better than C(R)EW, yet I get nervous and take the three extra points anyway.

>Jesse_Day: EIIPRSV 6J PI. +25 368
#note I thought about trying privvies, but my feeling was that wouldn't stick too long.

#note argh all I need is an A for AVERSIVE and I'm back in the game. I fished for it here.
>dacrON: CINORST 4G CORNI.ST +61 500
#note was 99% sure of IN(FE)CTORS, but really didn't want to make a mistake. Also, wow luckbox.
>Jesse_Day: AEEIRSV 15J AVERSE +32 421
#note conrad says: AVERSI(V)E was blocked. jesse says: yes. yes it was. no point in fishing any more.
>dacrON: ADDEELT 10J DED.L +28 528
#note I wasn't sure of VENGED. This play is 17 or so back.
>Jesse_Day: AEIT 12A I.AT +18 439
#note I should literally play what his next play turned out to be.
>dacrON: AET 9I TEA +20 548

#note conrad and jesse both say: Quite a game.
