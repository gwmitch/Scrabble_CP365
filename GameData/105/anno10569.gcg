>Bob_Lipton: AEHTW 8K WHEAT +50 78
>Dave_Koenig: ADEGOQV O6 QA. +12 34
#note Too passive.  The leave isn't good enough to justify dumping off the Q for so little.  Better to keep scoring and play through it with GAVE 7H.

#note The star play here is MAAED# 11C.
>Bob_Lipton: KOPU E9 P.OUK +32 146
#note I liked playing Bob a lot because he taught me CSW-only words every game.  In retrospect, it seems a little silly to challenge such a low scoring word here, but he had played a phony five on me in the last game, and I knew POUK# was good, so I thought he might be getting confused.
>Dave_Koenig: ABDEENN 13B BAN.ED +30 116
#note I considered NABE K2, but I wanted to turn over the extra tile with both blanks unseen.  I also was angling to open the board more.
>Bob_Lipton: AAGST 14B AGAST +55 201
#note Ouch, 20 points lost on challenges on two turns, but AGAST# scored too much and took out my X spot.  Not knowing the word I felt obliged to challenge.

>Bob_Lipton: DEGU K2 GUDE +29 230
>Dave_Koenig: ?BIMNNS 12D M.NI +28 171
#note I realized I could come to regret playing off the only vowel, but there were a lot of I's left to draw.  Also, a bingo wasn't going to be enough to catch me up; I needed points too.
>Bob_Lipton: AIIL G4 ILIA. +18 248
>Dave_Koenig: ?BJLNST 1L Ja.N +54 225
#note Burning the blank is a must here.  I need points and bingos, and the leave is not bad at all.
>Bob_Lipton: CDRU H1 CURD +32 280
>Dave_Koenig: ?BELOST 1C OBSTa.LE +64 289
#note I spent a *long* time looking for an S or T starting bingo on row 15.  In fact, this is the only bingo that plays on the board.
>Bob_Lipton: IS O3 IS +21 301
#note This surprised me a lot, as I figured that taking out row 15 was more crucial than this.
>Dave_Koenig: DENORTY 15F TODY +28 317
#note I know he's got the other S and probably good bingo tiles, so hitting this spot first seemed crucial.
>Bob_Lipton: ESTY 15A TYES +43 344
>Dave_Koenig: EEFHLNR F5 EH +28 345
>Bob_Lipton: INTU E1 .UINT +16 360
#note A lucky break for me: he suffers death by vowels in this endgame.
>Dave_Koenig: EFILNRR I11 REFR. +15 360
#note This is good enough, with the threats of LIN 2A and LINN 4B.  But REFLY is better for a subtle reason: It gives me RUING 2G for an out.
>Bob_Lipton: IOOO D3 OO +10 370
#note Sadly for Bob, the blocking attempt BOO D1 doesn't actually block LINN.  This is actually one point worse than OI in the same spot if I find LINTEL 5B.
>Dave_Koenig: ILN 2A LIN +8 368
>Dave_Koenig:  (IO) +4 372
