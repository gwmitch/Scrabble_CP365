#note Maybe at 10C instead, to open a different area of the board?

#note Maybe RETTING A8. I don't know. I'm already less than 0.1% to win no matter what.

#note If you're scoring at home, that's six consecutive fishes to EINT or better that have missed. I finally gave up on it here, knowing I needed more space to operate.

>Ed: AACDELN 9G CANDELA +79 168
#note As opposed to CANALED because I want the hook open. Sim prefers DECANAL slightly for the same reason.

>Mike: BKNO 1L KNOB +60 393
#note Okay, now I am.
>Ed: AANOOUZ A4 ZOA +25 283
