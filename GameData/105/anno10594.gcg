>Ron: AJT 8G TAJ +20 20
>Mike: BCDIKLR H7 B.LDRICK +68 68
#note And the race begins...
>Ron: IIIIUUU -IIIIUUU +0 20
#note If you don't have an S or a bingo, this is absolutely the right play.
>Mike: DEEFIOS 15D FEEDS +93 161
#note FIDOS or FEODS, of course.
>Ron: AFUV E11 FAUV. +22 42
>Mike: ?AIMOQY 13B MAQ.I +32 193
#note Or QADI 10F.
>Ron: HITW 10F WI.TH +28 70
>Mike: ?AIOOUY 14G O.AY +22 215
>Ron: EIM 11H .IME +21 91
>Mike: ?AGIOTU 15J AGOUTI +29 244
#note No, I did not miss AGOUTIs L5; I pased it up because I didn't like what it did to the board. Quackle disagrees slightly (to the tune of 0.17% winning chances); thoughts?
>Ron: GIOZ B10 GIZ.O +42 133
>Mike: ?AINNRR N8 INeRRAN. +64 308
>Ron: ENY O6 YEN +24 157
>Mike: AEEILPU M8 LIPE +18 326
#note PILEA N2 is fine; don't know why I focused on the M line at the expense of row 5.
>Ron: ERX O11 REX +26 183
>Mike: AAABEOU A8 BAA +18 344
#note Slightly better at L8, but I'm still over 99% to win. Watch what happens, though...
>Ron: EEINRSV 5I INVERSE +77 260
>Mike: AELOOTU D8 AUTO +10 354
#note I'm suddenly running out of ways to close the board. OUTEAT G3 is an interesting idea.
>Ron: ?CDENNO B2 CoNDONE +76 336
>Mike: DELOOPT C3 POOD +28 382
#note POLEAX 13J wins about 88% (to 83% for my play); I guess him having a third bingo is unlikely, but having just watched a 175-point lead nearly vanish, I was getting paranoid.
>Ron: GHTU E5 THUG +19 355
>Mike: EELRSST D1 RESTS +27 409
#note SEERS is best, as it doesn't allow a bigger outplay.
>Ron: ELOW 1D .OWEL +24 379
#note Well, I certainly made that more exciting than I needed to.
>Ron:  (EL) +4 383
