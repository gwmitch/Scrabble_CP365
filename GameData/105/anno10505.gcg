#note 9I DOOB# may be a little bit better, but it's a small difference.

#note I knew I was being too friendly by giving the 8A-8D spot on an otherwise tight board, but I failed to find better plays and wanted to clean out this rack in a hurry.  Far and away the best play here is DIOTA# 9F.  Even IOTA would have been a better choice.

#note I saw that I had the unplayable WOWFEST# here.

#note Here was a big CSW vision failure.  FACES 11C making PAWA# was much better.  I forgot about that spelling of PAUA#.

#note Nice nine by Marsh!  There are three that fit in that spot.

#note I first put down SURAH L11 then changed my mind.  I thought that it was too easily met by plays from the H to O15, killing much of the board.  Here with a small number of E's unseen I thought it was likelier that she wouldn't have a play there and row 15 might stay open for a while.
>Marsh: BENT 15L BENT +39 293
#note Sigh.  No such luck.
>Dave_Koenig: AHIIRST B6 HI. +14 236
#note I did not want to play this at N5 because I wanted to keep the BADS hook open.  Also, I realized that bingos still might fit on column C and I could possibly distract her from thinking about them with this partial block.
>Marsh: DEZ 8L ZED. +24 317
>Dave_Koenig: AEILRST C1 LATERIS. +76 312
#note With no other E's left for 14I but still the possibility of -INE or -ITE bingos in this spot, maybe it's better to play SALTIRE 14E here.  Or if I'd seen LARDIEST N5 to keep them both open I probably would have done that.  But the way I drew I don't think there was any hope.

#note KIEV# would have been better.
