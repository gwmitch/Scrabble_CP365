#note i did something similar in a later game against conrad, played long and open rather than the more obvious 7G OBE. i don't know if it's fully warranted. i am scared of the board shutting down against conrad who i know has good board control. (-4)

#note (T)YPEAbLE and (T)ElEPLAY go down here. I saw both, but couldn't pull the trigger with the big plays I had.

#note TILD(E) is the best play. I am a moron.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DJORRSU O1 JURORS +53 179
#note apparently i have a tell when i'm going to challenge a word. i don't know what it is. someone enlighten me? took me a while but i knew telluric and didn't think i would have missed a similar, more probable word.
>dacrON: ?DILLRT J9 DILL +10 153
#note Still TILD(E).
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?CDILUY 12H CU.LY +26 205
#note could have sealed the game with 14I DULCIfY but that's too tough for a stee like me to find. (-26)
>dacrON: ?IMRTUZ L12 .UTZ +26 179
#note I didn't actually believe this was the best play, but I'm not sure what else. UM 9G?
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?DDIOTT 14J DI.TO +20 225
#note actually C10 DOT seems pretty good too.
>dacrON: ?IIMMRS 15N MI +16 195
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?ADQT 5G QAT +18 243
#note i probably should not be shutting down lanes while i have the blank, right? this is always tough for me. unfortunately i don't know what my other two tiles were, but C10 QAT scores more and looks better. however after MI i just don't know.
>dacrON: ?IMNRSS 7C NI. +11 206
#note I feel like I've got to get soehing going here, but Quackle says (G)RIN is 2.5 better.

#note Don't know MOSASAUR, but this sims best.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?CEGNOT A8 GO +20 287
#note sheesh, nice play. quackle says that G7 PING bingoes an absurd amount of times and that he NEVER bingoes no matter what, with any play. seems crazy with those unseen letters but i can't think of a bingo. i think if i did PING he might be better off blocking than taking the big A8 spot. anyway, that just seems too risky to me. interesting play. (-10%)

#note I was out of time, but I'm not winning at this point ever. 
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?CENRST 10G CaN.STER +72 359
#note He would've had to find CONSTR(U)E if I had blocked this spot. I think he'd do it. :)   cesar: i'm not that sure i'd find it, but i probably had something that scores like ERiCA. i had already been through CENORSTU and i always miss that one. whew.
