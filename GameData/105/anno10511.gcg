#note At this point I was getting really tired.  So much so that later in the game I would start dozing off while trying to find a bingo.  So, needless to say, I missed the A hook on MAYA.  Q static suggests RAFFIA or AFFAIR.  I like CAFF best.  FACIA is also an option.

#note Forgot to write my rack here too, really tired.  I think I had a blank here or next turn.  I remember being close to CRIBROUS.  If this is right I missed CIBOR(I)Um.

#note Due to a math error, I underscored my score by 100 by forgetting to carry the 1.  Wow.    Agreed to a score of 392-297 after subtracting 10 points for going over on time.  I wonder how much that 100 points of spread hurt me over the course of the tournament, subtly changing who I'd be paired with at every turn?
