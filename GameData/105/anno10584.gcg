#note Playing way too defensive here. LORICA N2 is fine; I just didn't see it.
>David: AORVY D11 OVARY +33 145
>Mike: BEIORRY 15A ORB. +27 229
#note YOB C13 wins the sim; I suppose EIRR isn't that much worse than EIRY. BERRY 14B and EYRY 15A also merit consideration.

#note Oops.
>Mike: DEEIRTY B6 .EREDITY +69 298
#note There's really no reason to block.

>Mike: HIILOOU H13 OHO +31 329
#note The leave's going to be ugly no matter what I do, so I may as well take out the most dangerous spot.
>David: WZ 2L W.Z +30 236
>Mike: EIILRUU -IIUU +0 329
#note Maybe keep an I or ditch the L. I'm not sure how much it matters--the board's pretty well dead at this point.
>David: ?AJRS 14H ..JiRAS +64 300
#note (Misscored as 66.)
>Mike: EIKLMRR L12 MI.K +30 359
#note Top five in the sim (all within 2% of each other): KIR 13M (don't want to leave the lane to the R), KELIM 13K (didn't see it, and RR does nothing here), PRIM 7E (nice find), KERRIA M9 (kills everything), this. I'd probably have played KERRIA had I seen it; however, like most everything else this game, this worked out.

#note Ooh, ATTAIN 3B threatening a monster X play. Didn't even think along those lines.
