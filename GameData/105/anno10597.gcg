>Mike: AILMPUU B10 .ILUM +20 116
#note I considered YAUP C10; it sims a couple of percent better. LUAU 9H (which I didn't see) is also worth looking at.
>Sam: DFILORS K1 FLORIDS +84 133
#note Phony. It didn't look right initially, but it seemed plausible, and I had a decent comeback.
>Mike: AABPRTU 1K .UBAR +33 149
>Sam: ABEEIST 4D BEASTIE. +72 205
>Sam: ABEEIST --  -72 133
#note I spent a good two minutes holding here, mostly trying to convince myself I wasn't going crazy. I think I'd seen this before in a Collins annotated game, so that was throwing me off. But I needed the spot. (Also note that BEASTIE plays as 12D.)
>Mike: AGIOPPT 4F AGITP.OP +78 227
>Sam: ABEEIST 12A B.AES +35 168
#note BLAES*. I'm fine with him shutting off that corner, though, especially given my rack.
>Mike: ?AIOOSS 5B ArIOSOS +69 296
#note APOdOSIS M3 would've been sweet. Didn't know it.

>Mike: AEEINTU 3H AE +13 365
#note Of the choices that finish ahead of this in the sim, I can live with AGUE J6 (didn't see it) and maybe UTE 11D. I can't stomack AUNTIE 11I, the sim winner.

#note MU 14B? Really? I'm still playing this.

>Mike: EHNNNOT N7 HENT +16 423
#note How is HO 6F the winningest play (99.2%, compared to 96.3% for this)? I can sort of see NONET in this spot (98.25%), though.
>Sam: V F3 V.. +6 331
>Mike: DNNORTW 11I DROWN +22 445
#note Quackle is recommending THE 7M, gunning for...what, exactly? This is still 100%, though. (Misscored as 21.)
