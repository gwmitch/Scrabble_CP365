>Cesar_Del_Solar: EFPQSTX -UUUU +0 0
#note i thought about keeping PEST but i think i'm not too good at these valuations. it seemed about even with EST, but it's actually 1.5 better.
>dacrON: ADINOTU 8H UDO +8 8
#note Not sure what is right here, but I got scared of trading the U, which may well be it.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ACEINST K3 CINEAST +73 73
>dacrON: AEINNNT 3I IN.ANT +18 26
#note Quackle likes L4 NAN but that can't be best. Not that I claim this play to be best. it sims 1.5 behind.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEORSUX 10K EAUX +37 110
#note i like playing aggressively but it's going to be my undoing. nothing else sims close though.
>dacrON: CEHLMNP M9 M.LCH +30 56
#note Mostly did this in hopes he didn't know MULCHY* (over PUNCH or MUNCH). Also, lots of Ns are out.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ANORRST 6D ANTRORS. +62 172
#note I lost my shit here.
>dacrON: EGNOOPS 11F PENGOS +40 96
#note I stand by this play over GOOPS 11G or SPONGE O3.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEEINUY 14L EYE +28 200
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEEINUY --  -28 172
#note conrad: !   me: shit, the best move here is ENNUYE even if mulchy was a word. this is so disappointing. (-44)
>dacrON: ALOQRYZ 2L ZOA +41 137
#note Going for one of the many Is.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEEINUY 12D EYE +16 188
#note the best move is still ennuye, but i also had some stupid reason for rejecting 5C EYE which i did see. i didn't want to give up a high-scoring overlap with the P or something silly like that. (-16)
>dacrON: ?EELQRY D4 LE.RY +24 161
#note Can't play QuEERLY/MULCHY now :P. This play is 2nd best to 13B LYRE, which sets up an additional Q spot. Sweet.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BEIINTU J10 B.UT +32 220
#note nope, boite. there is already a triple-lane S hook, and although this is easier to use, it scores more with a marginally better leave. (-5)
>dacrON: ?DEQTTU 8A QUE. +48 209
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEIINOS 4I NO.SE +41 261
#note (-3) 11M LIE is worth the fish. i wanted to keep scoring and put on pressure, but this is a critical move.
>dacrON: ?ADJKTT B6 JA.K +31 240
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DEIIORR 13C IRED +23 284
#note ugh, surprisingly does sim highest.
>dacrON: ?DEHTTW 2C WHETTeD +69 309
>Cesar_Del_Solar: FOOW 1B WOOF +27 311
#note woo 1A might be worth it for the F spot next turn
>dacrON: AEIMRVV N6 VARI. +27 336
#note VIVA 10C is good too, but this sets up one of the last 2 Es, leaving EM, as well as blocking the now annoying INCANTS hook.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ABGIILR 1G AB +23 334
#note i've basically lost the game here unless i can lose some i's. so B11 BIALI, as nuts as it looks, could be the best thing to do. (-7)
>dacrON: AEFIMOV 10F OF +21 357
#note Not really sure how to sim this play. This saves the EM fo a column O play, or NAEVI, if I have an II draw...I also considered adding the A in there for OAF, but decided to avoid the bag as much as possible. I like this play best. Also if Cesar has the other E for column O, his tiles may well suck, making (N)AEVI a reaasonable option next turn.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EGGIILR O7 LEG +26 360
#note K13 IGG makes me wonder actually. (-9%)
>dacrON: ADEIMPV B11 VAMP +30 387
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?GIIILR 15A GyRI +26 386
#note liri now for 2 more
>dacrON: DEII 3A DIE +20 407
#note Didn't think to block LI(R)I. Just wanted the win ASAP! :)
>Cesar_Del_Solar: IIL G4 LI.I +5 391
>Cesar_Del_Solar:  (I) +2 393
#note MULCHY gave me new life, and I decided to stop tilting. Salvaged third place, but still a very disappointing tournament.
