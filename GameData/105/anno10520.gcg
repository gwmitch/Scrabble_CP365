#note I looked at UNI- words and somehow missed UNICOLOR.  That's not the type of commentary I like to provide.
>Joel: AFK 5C KAF +32 188
>Joey: ?ACNOPU C2 PUC. +24 138
#note This looks much better than my previous rack, but there are no bingos to be had here.  No sevens, and OCCUPANT would be the only possible eight.
>Joel: AEHNSTY 2C .HYTANES +70 258
>Joey: ?AEENNO 1F ANEmONE +84 222
#note This time I find the best bingo.
>Joel: ADEG 5K AGED +22 280
>Joey: AAADHIM 4L AMAH +39 261
#note HAMADA would have been cool, but that would have left the possibility of a rack of all I's.  AMAH is safer.
>Joel: LOT O1 LOT. +21 301

>Joel: Q -Q +0 301
>Joey: ADIIIIZ -DIIII +0 281
#note This is one of those rare occasions in which an exchange is better than a 64 point play.  I'm actually hoping that Joel bingos, because it would leave my hotspot alone, and he could draw all of this junk back.

#note I could sure use those I's now.
>Joel: BIJ 5G JIB +27 400
>Joey: DINPQSV 14J QI +34 387
#note If I had saved IISTU, QV would have been a great draw, especially if it played somewhere.  Joel did mention that DII were the three letters I missed, so INSIPID was indeed possible.  As it turns out, Joel almost had it himself!
