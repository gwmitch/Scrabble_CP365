#note Frustrating rack. This play sims back 8 points because AINST is AINST. I would've maybe played the sim winner, DO(G), but I didnt see row 13 as a second bingo lane yet. This seems like a reasonable high-variance play though, as F(U)CK suggests a weak leave potentially.

#note This isn't a good play, but what is any good here? I've really gotta hope he doesnt have an I.

#note What would you play with my rack?

#note I thought for sure this was the best play, but Quackle prefers WANNE(R), my second choice. WANNER only fishes for one play that will be blocked a lot of the time. My play fishes for column B, as well as EI for WINZE for 95. I realize this play backfires a lot, but I'm also not in the best of shape here. Maybe the variance of my play is too high, and WANNE(R) is better.

#note I saw AAHED, which is better by four points, but didn't count it up, thinking it scored more than 3 points less than DEATH. Oops.

#note Sim has this 8.5 back of (R)EMOVE. I'm surprised Quackle wants me to open that up. I had him on the S because he played so quickly, but perhaps I'm not evaluating the situation correctly. I guess the lane(s) (R)EMOVE makes are less dangerous than the one already there.

#note Maybe WANNE(R) was better, but I do think I made something of nothing here.
