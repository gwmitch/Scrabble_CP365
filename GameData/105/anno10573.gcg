#note TAFIA 9F looks a lot better, but I guess this is probably better because...
>Ruben_Solis: AEY -  +0 10
#note He challenges.

>Matt_Canik: ?DIRRST J2 RITaRDS +77 127
#note I miscounted STRIDER/STRIDOR/STIRRED and thought this outscored them by two. But this does look cooler!

>Ruben_Solis: EX 5J .XE +18 74
>Matt_Canik: ABEEGIK D6 AG +10 169
#note And for the rest of this game, I play like complete shit. Here comes the fun. This was played to kill the C and D rows. 
>Ruben_Solis: EGNO 8A GONE +23 97
>Matt_Canik: BEEEIKL M2 B.ELIKE +28 197
#note This is too cool to not play!
>Ruben_Solis: AHT 8L H.AT +33 130
>Matt_Canik: CDEIPVZ B7 V.ICED +18 215
#note Everything here sucks. I don't want to open something obvious with plays like (A)DZE N8 or (A)DVICE. (H)IVED throws an E at the end of a 2x2 and hols CPZ, which has potential to backfire on me. After this play, he only bingos 4% less and scores on average about 2 points less than ADZ, so I guess I'm far too paranoid here. 
>Ruben_Solis: OOW A11 WOO +16 146
>Matt_Canik: ADENPPZ C11 DAP +23 238
#note Again, I just really don't want to open anything else up for him. 
>Ruben_Solis: OW 3B WO.. +20 166
>Matt_Canik: EEMNNPZ 6L N.P +13 251
#note Given his recent plays, I'm thinking he has the blank on his rack and is close to a bingo. So I want to hold onto the Z and force him to play in the 14 row or N column if he bings so I can hit him back. 
>Ruben_Solis: AGO O4 GOA +12 178
>Matt_Canik: EEEMNUZ -  +0 251
#note This is awesome. I just don't remember ever seeing the word NIPA. And I challenge. And lose a turn. I must be the worst 1800 player there ever was. 
>Ruben_Solis: IS D12 SI +18 196
>Matt_Canik: EEEMNUZ B5 UN...... +16 267
#note I know I have MEZE 14D, but can't talk myself into playing it- if he bingos in the 15 row, it could be as high as 100 points, and that basically ties us. I'm still stuck in this mindset of 'hold the z, hit him back after he bingos'. 
>Ruben_Solis: II -II +0 196
>Matt_Canik: BEEEMNZ N1 BE +16 283
>Ruben_Solis: AE O1 AE +23 219
>Matt_Canik: EEEMNUZ 14D MEZE +40 323
#note Seeing the unseen pool now, I'm fairly confident I can play MEZE without worrying about a bingo. He told me he was holding FAIREST last turn, played off the AE, and didn't draw anything good from there on. 
>Ruben_Solis: ?FIRRST 15G FIR +23 242
>Matt_Canik: DEINRTU L8 .UNTED +20 343
#note Spend a long time on this turn. I contemplated playing off one, but deduced that from the unseen pool I would win if I played this. But I mistracked and had the wrong stuff on his rack.
