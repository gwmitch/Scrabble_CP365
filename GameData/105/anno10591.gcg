>Aldo: ADOTY 8H TOADY +26 26
>Mike: EHNOTUU 7H UH +20 20
#note YOUTH L8 is probably a hair better, but this worked out.
>Aldo: ACW 9G CAW +31 57

>Aldo: IIUU -IIUU +0 57
>Mike: DEEGGJN 4J J.GGED +34 132
#note Virtually tied with JEED L1. The J on 1L is too easily hit, though, and GGN isn't my idea of a dynamic leave, especially on this board.
>Aldo: EPRX J11 PREX +33 90
>Mike: AEINNOP O1 PON. +21 153
#note I can't read my notes clearly, but if this is my actual rack, DIPNOAN O4 is a huge improvement.
>Aldo: EFU I13 FEU +28 118

>Aldo: AV 15G VA. +18 136
>Mike: EILNOST M11 TIN +18 186
#note In a straight sim, LOG M2 is best. Inferring EIRS on his rack (seems reasonable), it still wins (by a lesser margin). I'm not sure I agree.
>Aldo: DEINORS G1 ROSINED +70 206
>Mike: BELOOSY 1C SOBE.LY +39 225
#note Missed LOOEY F2, which not only scores better and plays better defense, it sets up the B!
>Aldo: EW F1 .WE +29 235

#note Or KOI/KOA N13, or OKA 2I. They're all pretty equal.

#note Or SI 8N.

#note I actually strongly considered passing here; whoever gets the Q appears to be stuck with it, twist and turn as they may. However, I was worried I could get counter-stuck with the C or V and be unable to win the endgame. As long as I don't draw the Q right here, the lead should be safe--and even if I do, I might be able to outrun the Q stick. Quackle suggests RIFE 13G, but why give him a bailout?

#note Quackle wants me to just play out with CERIC.

#note Now it's wrong to play out! FER 6B is thirteen better (proof left to the reader).
