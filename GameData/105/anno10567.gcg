>Alex!: ADGOORX 8G GOX +22 22
>Max: MOY 7H YOM +24 24
>Alex!: ADIKNOR 9H KOR +29 51
#note Quackle says KOA or KOI by about 2%. Against Max I'd rather not give away the easy scoring spot, although KOR does give him higher bingo chances so Quackle might be right.
>Max: AABEEGR -AABEEGR +0 24
>Alex!: ADINQST 10F QIS +43 94
#note Quackle likes QADI K8 because it doubles my bingo % over QIS. Again, I don't want to give Max an easy scoring spot.

#note WIT or WIN setting up COZ. Not sure how often that will work. BIZ didn't make the static list but it sims well enough.

>Alex!: CENOPTW B10 CO.PT +30 350
#note Considered POTENCY but I wanted to kill the board. CYTON is a little better but I didn't see it.
