#note cool play by chris.
>cesar: EELLORT K2 ROTL +17 46
#note this is a tough play. i actually had no idea what he kept, but i (maybe wrongly) assumed that he had a bingo leave and i wanted to try to limit his scoring. i'm not so sure ROTL does that though. CELLO is too aggressive, and if i had seen OGLER i definitely would have played it. doh. (-4)

#note doh... i should be able to see ensnared. this is a minor mistake but it really affects the shape of the board. it may be a bigger mistake than i think.

#note shoot - REG is a much better leave than AG (so 14E PUMA). UP 14F sims even better. i don't know what's right here, though. what would you do? (-5)

#note in this situation i have absolutely no idea what to do. (and the turn after this). this may be one of the things that separates me from the best players. any thoughts recommended? N6 OORIE sims at the top, which i actually didn't see, but i was more concerned with eliminating volatility. the 1A bingo lane seems like the worst one. however i think the problem is that any bingo would likely be too much to overcome so maybe i either want to go for a bingo of my own or a scoring spot of my own (which N6 OORIE does) or G3 OI. i also strongly considered L11 MOOED keeping II and killing some lanes, as well as MOODIER or DOOMIER. my play doesn't sim that well. (-8) another cool one is 14D IMIDO.

#note this was a total choke. yes i saw the DIVINER that scored 2 more points, but i thought he would be able to score more off of that for some reason (i saw stuff like JOT , QAT, whatever) and didn't see QI. VINIER? what to do here? no idea. (-3)

#note that's gotta be game over, but i think it was anyway with my draw.
