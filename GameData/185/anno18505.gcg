#note or TOPSAIl. Hard to see the difference between the two plays, long term.
>Mike_Frentz: DFJOR L1 FJORD +43 61
>Josh: BEIKLRT J10 KIBE +37 129
#note It was between this and playing my opponent's name, but I missed KERB in the same spot, which is undoubtedly a better play than either. Oh, and this is blank blindness at its finest. We both missed that this formed IL*
>Mike_Frentz: EEGTV 13I V.GETE +28 89
#note Starting to worry about what VEGETE might take
>Josh: IILORSZ O8 ZORILS +59 188
#note So as well as feeling the need to settle the VEGETE hook threats, even though I feared VEGETE may take nothing, I felt that this play had very good long term defense. But VEGETE is an adjective. That's two phoneys. I should have known VEGETE was invariable and played (F)RIZ.
>Mike_Frentz: AEGLPRS 3H PERG.LAS +74 163
#note Here I considered playing VENIN at 9D, playing (F)IVE and playing INV(E)NT for 9. This play isn't bad but the logic I remember applying to justify it seems terrible: i.e I'm ahead
>Josh: EINNNTV 1L .IVE +30 218
#note N2 N(A)TIVE is the best play, hands down. I considered other plays than this one that were contentious with it, but I completely missed N(A)TIVE. This leave is horrendous and I was too focused on this play's benefits, which are simply reducing Mike's options and scoring for next turn and keeping a commanding lead. 
>Mike_Frentz: TYY H1 TY.Y +48 211
#note I mean this kind of sucked but still
>Josh: ACNNNTW 4D CANN. +20 238
#note It's a good idea to keep a balanced leave here. So this play looks right. It gives back less than NANC(Y) but maybe what NANC(Y) opens is better for me. It's close.
>Mike_Frentz: EQRU E2 QU.RE +28 239
#note In trouble now
>Josh: AEINOTW J5 WO +20 258
#note F6 TOWIE is clear. I had already forgotten about W(HELMS). TOWIE kills the annoying X spot too
>Mike_Frentz: ADEINRT D6 DETRAIN +71 310
>Josh: AAGINRT 8A GAI. +15 273
#note now much too worried about the X spot that still exists that Mike chose not to make disappear. Nowhere for GRANITA. I didn't know what to do so I rid myself of the G while setting up a potential lane with it if I get lucky. I really need some of that luck for sure, but maybe fishing is the right option?
>Mike_Frentz: NOW F6 NOW +28 338
#note well, no more X to worry about as much...
>Josh: ABDELNT N9 BALE.N +32 305
#note I was still really confused as to what QU(A)RE was about if Mike didn't hold the S or the X, and it bothered me that my commanding lead had disintegrated into thin air. I need the S now for sure. This has god to be right.
>Mike_Frentz: CHIU C11 HUIC +25 363
>Josh: ADIMOOT B10 DATO +20 325
#note This turn really sucked. I can't keep a good leave, score well, open anything that will cause Mike trouble blocking, etc.

O(C)TAD fails if I don't bingo next turn, because any play underneath it takes out two lines simultaneously. So B10 DATO is better since it makes sure there are more than two lanes open for another turn at least. I didn't see G7 D(H)OOTI. That's a good play. It keeps a decent MA combo for scoring or bingoing, and leaves me a better shot at a bingo next turn. S? are very important so the turnover is also a good thing. Knowing Mike he likely might choose not to play a blocking game with multiple threats open, since in an offensive player's mind, it's better to just try and maximize your own points so that you outrun your opponent. There is something to be said about that; there is truth in it. Anyways I lost track here. It seems that my play was the best I could offer myself in terms of more than short term comeback opportunity, but D(H)OOTI might be better because of its short terms benefits and perhaps longer term ones too, depending on what Mike decides to do about the board.
>Mike_Frentz: ADEES 1A AEDES +36 399
#note There goes one lane and that S I really needed. Good move by Mike, where defense and outrunning come together to form a victorious bond.
>Josh: EFIMORU 12L FU.. +26 351
#note Didn't look like there was a bingo in the bag for either of us, so I just went for the equity/spread saving, or what that seemed to be. The best play now looks to be L12 M(E)OU, as I have outplays next turn a good portion of the time I think. 
>Mike_Frentz: ?AINOUX 15H ANXIOUs +100 499
#note Oh.
>Mike_Frentz:  (EIMORT) +16 515
#note </3
