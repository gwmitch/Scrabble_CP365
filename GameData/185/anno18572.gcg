#note This probably sacrifices too much in the way of points and leave volatility but playing short with a 4C1V leave and expecting everything to stay open is risky...

#note This is really a horrendous play for so many reasons, and maybe my worst of the tournament in terms of the lack of coherent logic behind it. N2 MOTLIER concedes some good X plays down Column O but is ideal here in all other ways. Columns M, N, and O are a much bigger collective threat than row 15, so my plan to cripple row 15 first and then address the others was completely backwards. But as if that wasn't enough, I noticed after my play that if Nigel has EMS? he can play EMYDS O11 for massive points, evening the game instantly without even requiring a bingo. In situations where he also has the X, he'll follow that play up with something at A1 a lot and run away from me. Ugly stuff.

#note I've seen EMYDS now and am upset with myself, but this is right to force Nigel to have that play (and see it) or bingo to win.
