#note I almost did just AERIE to retain the hook. Don't think there's a dominant option here. Sim likes 7G AIDE.

#note DANEGELT/DELATING are possible after this - 11/42 (including blanks) is pretty good in this situation.

#note Considered fishing again but 23 points seemed great in this situation. Simulation might assume Jim opens the board here more than he actually does, but then again maybe he will have to open it after this play a lot.

#note Pivotal move here. Waffled between CONGE and QI for a while and decided to force bingo specificity along row 12 instead of throw the board open. Sim *loves* CONGE which is quite surprising to me. I have a big enough lead that I can sacrifice some points to cut down on bingo%. CONGE yields 29% to QI's 9%, and given that Jim's leave strength is surely better than random those numbers are both a bit low. In fact, because bingoing is so much easier after CONGE with a good blank-containing leave post-DUCI, the difference between the two plays might be even larger than that. On the other hand, CONGE does take 3 more shots at the blanks and puts me in the lead such that a bingo merely makes the game even. Once I draw the blank, I'll still be saddled with the Q, but at least it should still play at 10I. I have a hard time seeing this as the mistake Quackle thinks it is.

#note I really tried my best to figure this endgame out and couldn't do it. Of course, the best play of 13L OF depends on seeing (A)CULE(U)S 6I, but I did note the possibility of CLOSEU(P) and still couldn't think of the second best play, M12 IF, which also gives me COLEUS and IFS as a second outplay.

#note This game really hurt. Thought I had things controlled so nicely and it just totally unraveled.
