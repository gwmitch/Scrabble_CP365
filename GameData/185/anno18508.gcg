#note I start off the game by taking way too long and missing KOINE! Congrats to me. I already deserve to lose :P
>Chris_Tallman: IQ G3 QI +23 23
>Joshua_Sokol: EINRSWY F4 WRY +23 45
#note I don't think I should sacrifice 10 points here and play WY(N) though, eliminating a good S hook for myself and such. So 1/2 on my self-judging test so far.
>Chris_Tallman: AHILLRT 9G I.THRALL +64 87
#note Instead of playing WY(N), I lose to this play. Underscored by 1.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABDERU D6 UnBA.RED +76 292
#note Not that DURABLE a play. C7 UnB(E)ARED scores 2 more, but B2, yeah, that.
>Chris_Tallman: EFZ C12 FEZ +41 314
>Joshua_Sokol: CISTTUV L3 CUT +12 304
#note I had no clue what to do here besides this. Looking grim in terms of outscoring without a bingo. F10 (E)VICT is the play I missed and the play I should have made. If I want to set up my S I should play E2 CUT over L3 too. Ugh, terrible mistakes everywhere.

#note 2J (J)ESUIT is a hard find but a good play by many means. I'm still in trouble though.

>Joshua_Sokol: ENRSTUV 14J UNV..T +18 380
#note Now it's really looking grim for me. He's too far ahead for me to be confident I can overcome my deficit without a bingo. So looking at the pool it seems I have to hope he has pretty bad stuff and that I can draw the good stuff, i.e S?. So I jump on the occasion to fork the board with one scoring spot and one bingo lane. 
>Chris_Tallman: AAEG O11 AGA.E +34 424
#note Chris in fact didn't have a good way to block this, as the score was too close for him to play AG(U)E or EA(U) to stop me. So now it was up to him to hope I didn't hit anything. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EPRSST 15D PoSTERS +85 465
#note And oh how the tides turn! I did notice the C in the pool but it looked like I couldn't make sure I could bingo next turn. I wonder if any scoring plays exist that make sure I win with any draw. Probably not.
>Chris_Tallman: AEIIIOR 10M .I +8 432
#note Chris was really mad that he couldn't stop me. He shook his head in a familiar way with a subliminal reference to another player in this community for a few minutes (lucky he had around 8 on his clock) and then decided to verify his tracking for some odd reason.

#note Chris lost two spread points this game from his mistakes, from what I see. He is such a bad player.
