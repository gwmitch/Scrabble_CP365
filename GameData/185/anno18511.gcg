>Alec_Sjoholm: ?DDEIOO 8D DIODE +18 18
#note I didn't know DOODIEs (-25.5). After that, Champ variably prefers different places for DIODE, this one being first after 2 Champ sims.
>Rafi_Stern: EEFIIRS D8 .EIFIERS +76 76
#note Champ prefers EDIFIERS and FIRESIDE. Rafi played DEIFIERS (-6.3) for the points and to block the upper left.
>Alec_Sjoholm: ?AADNOU 15D .OUDAN +21 39
#note Best.
>Rafi_Stern: AFGIILN 14H FAILING +83 159
#note Best.
>Alec_Sjoholm: ?AHISTW H1 InSWATH. +101 140
#note InSWATHE and WrAITHS are really close. Two champs prefer each other. (I saw WrAITHS but didn't know FAILINGS.)
>Rafi_Stern: ACENOST O8 OCTANES +92 251
#note Well, Rafi knew FAILINGS.
>Alec_Sjoholm: AELNRUW 11B AW.UL +22 162
#note Best by speedy player, 12th by champ. Champ prefers WE 13C (-11.8).
>Rafi_Stern: EEHKOTY 10B KO. +38 289
#note He talked himself out of playing HOKEYE(S)T*. This is best.
>Alec_Sjoholm: EGNNPRT 5C PREGN.NT +72 234
#note Best. Only bingo.
>Rafi_Stern: BCEEHTY 13B BE.CHY +40 329
#note THEBE 13I is best by win%; BEECHY by valuation, according to Champ. Also, BEECHY blocked REDUX.
>Alec_Sjoholm: DJLRUXZ J3 LU.Z +33 267
#note Best.
>Rafi_Stern: AEOPTU 2B AUTOPE. +28 357
>Alec_Sjoholm: AADEJRX L11 RAD.X +42 309
#note I missed RAXED 1A (-21)! I saw RAX (2nd) but my play was worth more points. My play is fifth. (Champ even prefers AJAR K6 and 12G to this!)
>Rafi_Stern: ABEE K11 ABE.E +34 391
#note Consequence of playing RADIX.
>Alec_Sjoholm: ?AEJLOO J10 JO +28 337
#note Best.
>Rafi_Stern: ENOV N5 OVEN +17 408
#note Champ, based on this rack, actually prefers this play to OVEN 9B by 4.5 win%! By this play, Rafi blocked SAvELOY, which I didn't even know.

Rafi though there was a C out and didn't want me to get a bingo ending in C after OVEN 9B. He seemed to forget that ROVEN is good and that there were 3 R's out...even though he probably had one!
>Alec_Sjoholm: ?AELOSY 9B OY.S +33 370
#note 3rd. Champ prefers 9G OS and 7G OH. This has best valuation, though.
>Rafi_Stern: IMV 3A VIM +26 434
>Alec_Sjoholm: ?AEILRT 1H .nERTIAL +74 444
#note Best. Rafi thought I had a very slim chance of a bingo from the I... until he drew the Q after playing VIM.

After this play, I could win only if I drew the I.
>Rafi_Stern: EGIQRRT 6B QI +35 469
#note The ONLY win for Rafi.
>Alec_Sjoholm: M 13J M.. +10 454
>Alec_Sjoholm:  (EGRRT) +12 466
