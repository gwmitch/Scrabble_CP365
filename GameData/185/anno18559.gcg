#note i thought this might actually be phoney but it's good. i didn't care because nothing else looks nearly as good.

#note i always hate doing plays like this because they're so easy to overlap. do i do it anyway? maybe K9 AXE is better. i don't know. K13 FOE is super interesting.

#note bad situation to be in here.. it seems like he's going to inevitably bingo. LONE jumps to the top when i inference ES. however it allows an unblockable setup. Does anyone have any ideas for what to do here? I strongly considered PENTONEL* but he told me it would be a forced challenge because he didn't have a bingo back. unfortunately i could not draw an S this game. :(

#note maybe this is one of the problems with LONE

>cesar: EGNORTT --  -72 302
#note unfortunately i decided here that the only way i could win this is hope his bingo also goes down and then try to win in the endgame. however if i wanted to do that i'd start it at N7. I guess I also had the small hope that maybe regotten* WAS good. GREET is the play here, but it didn't seem likely to me to win. i'd have to draw a bingo from the P basically because he's going to score a lot whenever he wants to. Any thoughts?

>cesar: EGNORTT -  +0 302
#note i challenged as it was my only realistic chance at victory.  i don't think i can draw anything from the P and he's going to block next turn. I was almost 100% sure that BEERIEST was good because I even saw it in an anagrams game a couple days before but *shrug*.
