#note Not having the case S, I wanted to take this opportunity to block it and score nicely in the process. I guess K7 BOW does score reasonably well and keeps a dynamite leave but rack grooming shouldn't be my top objective here. ABET is a much lower standard dev. play and I like that.

#note Debated for a while between HEXONE and WHEEL - I liked WHEEL better because it scored almost as well and threatened another similar score on the next turn with the right vowel.

#note Sim and CP both like EXERT here and I will admit that it is a pretty genius play, threatening EXERTION for a very solid score with one of the three remaining I's as well as not offering nearly as much counterplay as XYST. Not spotting that play I had to decide between XYST and OXY. I liked the extra draws for the U and I's afforded by XYST and there aren't that many plays that crush me from O1 after XYST either (PLIE stands out as a worst case scenario).
