#note 9F CIAO is nicer than this. By a good margin. I missed the nice fit, maybe even the whole word. It screws up the left quadrant almost as well as IO(N)IC screws up the bottom right. He also probably doesn't know PIONIC, which is a small plus. But yeah, CIAO

#note no reason not to play REREADS here I don't think. What was I thinking?

#note C6 gLAZI(E)RS for 104
>Josh: BEIRUVW 12A VERB +38 146
#note This seemed automatic but I somehow missed H1 WIVE(d), which seems like a better play.

>Win_Inthara: EO 9F EO. +16 163

>Josh: ?EGNOUU C2 UNG.UE +16 234
#note this looked like the best play but also looked like it could draw a challenge.

#note lots of TIDED plays are good here. Think I might have chickened out.
>Win_Inthara: BJ 3G J.B +23 255
>Josh: ALOOSTY 2M OY +22 361
#note 2L TOY looks better now that I notice it sets up my case (TOY)O and just scores 4 more points as well.
>Win_Inthara: LLL -LLL +0 255
>Josh: AILNOST 10J .LO. +7 368
#note I don't remember why I played this. Perhaps I was running out of time looking for so long. I should play 15A OSTIA. SQU plays forming (WREAK)S are very worrisome here.

#note Missing PST. TSKTSK for me. Was running out of time with these quasi bingo racks
