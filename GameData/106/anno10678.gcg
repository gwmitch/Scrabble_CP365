#note Looking at the board upside down, I almost played LINT H7, but I caught it just in time.

#note Beautiful!

#note I don't remember if I missed LING H7 here or just wanted to open up the board more.

#note I had been set to bingo at K2 before this, but when he gave me this spot, I jumped at it.  If I had taken some more time, I might have noticed that for one point less INTERNS 15I is a lot safer.  It would have made a huge difference here.

#note Not sure if I could have done things any differently here.  I thought of MUDDIERS, BUDDIERS, and RUDDIES here, and I was sure that every one of them was phony in TWL.  I thought they might have had a chance in CSW, and if I had to pick one, RUDDIES was probably the most likely.  (Turns out it's the only good one.)  But I couldn't bring myself to try it at 10 point challenge when I had a 60 point play I knew was good.

#note Ouch.  Matt just won himself a tournament.
