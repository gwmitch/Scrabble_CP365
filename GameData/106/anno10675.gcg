#note This can be kindly called unorthodox, but I felt blocking his 2x2 setup was crucial.  I like HUED K10 in hindsight, but this worked out.
>Ian: AEE G7 A.EE +13 19
#note I think he said he kept EINS on this rack, or something similar.  He kicked himself for not playing AE 7L after my next play.
>Matt: AEEGHOR L1 GHERAOE. +80 134
>Ian: AINTV 10B NATIV. +19 38
>Matt: FIKLMRU 12L MURK +38 172
#note Yeah, FLUKIER is bette, got to focused on the hot spot, but ditching the F and K is more critical on this board.
>Ian: III -III +0 38
>Matt: FHILNNZ 9A FIZ +48 220
#note So focused on parallel plays I missed HAFIZ.  Yeah, that's best.  Playing FIZ at 10L doesn't give so much back either.
>Ian: OR 8A OR +24 62
>Matt: ?HLNNOW O12 .NOW +33 253
>Ian: EFILRST E7 FIL.STER +72 134
#note Going for more volatility at this point, it looks like.  TRIFLES is 11 more at 13G.
>Matt: ?HLNOQX M2 OX +41 294
#note pHLOX for 69?  Didn't see it, but I like being able to dump the Q next turn there for 21.

>Matt: ?AALLNT O8 LA +10 362
#note Blocking the triple and fishing for an ING bingo at this point.
>Ian: IPY 6H YIP +35 329
>Matt: ?AIILNT 1H INTA.LIo +132 494
#note This is why you go through the alphabet when you have a blank.  I was content to play something pLAITING until I made the blank an O and found this.  My favorite play from the early bird.
>Ian: ABEPTU 2C UPBEAT +14 343
>Matt: ?ADENSS D2 .ANDiES +28 522
#note I played this, hit my clock, then saw SPADoNES.  
>Ian: RTY 14D T.Y +16 359
>Matt: S 10B ......S +21 543
#note My first rated win over a current 2000 player.  Glad I didn't have to play him in the main event, considering the run he went on.
