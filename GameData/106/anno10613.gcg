>Matt_Canik: ?EIIITT -II +0 0
#note Exchanging II yields a bingo 86% of the time, exchanging IIT yields a bingo 82%, and exchanging IIIT yields a bingo 75.6% of the time. TITI yields a bingo just 62% of the time. With these facts on the table, I don't understand why exchanging II sims below all three of the other options. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: DEINOST -O +0 0
>Matt_Canik: ?AEIOTT -O +0 0
#note Given that he has just exchanged, I want him to bingo first so I can hit the 2x2. Is this logic flawed?

#note Don't know the whole rack, but I wonder if (JO)TA for 39 may have been a better option. 
>Matt_Canik: EGGLOTU 4B GOUG. +14 362
#note This shuts down a whole lot of lines at once and cleans off this ugly rack. I'm a little worried about the 2J spot, but the only thing that will hit hard there is QAIDS, and given that he just played off that U, it's unlikely he has the Q. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ABK 3A KAB +29 327
>Matt_Canik: ADELNTW 2J WA.LED +36 398
#note This makes it easier for him to bingo but harder to bingo for a lot of points. The only real easy spot is N1, which will net like 65 points. Anything from the D will be equally devastating in either spot. So while it scores 4 less than WAWLED, I like it. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ADQS D3 S.Q +22 349
#note He said he had QAIDS and I blocked it. 
>Matt_Canik: EILNPST N1 P.NLITES +62 460
#note LI(EF)EST scores 51, and static actually likes (EF)T better than the bingo. And I guess given the possibility he bingos out with FORBADE or FORBIDs or something, maybe I should hold off on pulling the trigger. 1N PE sims best on many ply.
