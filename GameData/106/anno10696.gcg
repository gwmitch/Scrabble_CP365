#note d'oh, LIFTGATE 89... also for 77, FAGOTTI#
>Quackle: EGJMOSU 15D JOU.S +63 145
#note JOUGS# - a punishment using an iron collar (sticky S)

#note VIDAME#
>Bill: EHINORW A13 HOW +51 276
>Quackle: AAGKNOP 4C KOAP +30 215
#note KOAP# (and OU, of course). Scoring best is KANGA# (4A, 38).
>Bill: EINNRUV 11I UNRIVEN +72 348
#note UNRIVEN# (yay, Collins bingo!)
>Quackle: AEGNRYY 7H .ANEGYRY +69 284
#note PANEGYRY# (too bad NI* isn't a word, sucka)
>Bill: DEOQSTU O4 QUE.S +81 429
#note Possible extension: LACQUEYS, which is certainly a threat with both cees and two ells out (from one side of the table, at least... I didn't know it). Second best is QUYTE#.
>Quackle: ABGORTZ N10 Z.BRA +72 356
#note I love playing Quackle; normally the outcome wouldn't be in doubt with 429 through six turns. Quackle still wagers it wins only one in 80 games, but I'm away from my home turf (TWL), so anything's possible.
>Bill: ADFIOOT N6 F.O +29 458
>Quackle: EGINOTW C1 GOW. +24 380
#note interesting choice -- 6F WEM is best statically, about ten points better than this, and 3E WO wins the sim
>Bill: ADIILOT 1A DI.LOT +27 485
#note Not terrible; ALGOID sims best.
>Quackle: CEHINOT 2E HENOTIC +75 455
#note HENOTIC# (and TE)
>Bill: AEINORX 1H NIX +47 532
#note The bag is good, but I'll take the chance that Quackle just drew a bingo from the D and take the extra 11 points over XI bottom right, though I overlooked EXO# in that spot which I like best.
>Quackle: AEEILNR 6D REN +18 473
#note REN#
>Bill: ABCDEOR F10 BE.D +30 562
#note blocking the higher scoring out is better for spread by two, but I'm just hoarding points... too bad I can't invoke the backwards play clause and get to 635 (BROCADED, and also BARCODED#+ which I sure as heck didn't know)
