>Carl: ALRSXYZ 8G ZAX +38 38
#note If I wanted to get fancy, LAZY H8 is also an option. It sets up the X at 9I. Additionally, if opp has an A, he might play something parallel to LAZY forming ZA, in which case I might get to hook ZAX for more than 60 points.
>Opp: ENOP 7H PONE +21 21
>Carl: BFLRSUY 8K FUBSY +47 85
#note I was torn between this play and FUB I6, which doesn't give the opponent much to work with, and keeps the Y for FOXY, or BEY. After 10,000 sims, the two run exactly even. Also of note: FUBS 8K, boldly setting up the Y for next turn, which sims next best.
>Opp: AMN 9F NAM +25 46
>Carl: EEFJLQR 6I FER +31 116
#note There are no reasonable plays involving the J, and none at all involving the Q. Instead of burning the J for cheap, look to score with your other letters. FER 6I scores well. Maybe an opportunity will arise for the power tiles next turn. Something like QIS or SUQ down column N is a reasonable possibility.
>Opp: EHISV 10C HIVES +29 75
#note Worry about the C hook. Also takes an S.
>Carl: AEJLNQR D8 JA.LER +42 158
#note Badda bing! And now I have five shots at the I or U I need for a solid Q play. Of course, I would have been prepared to exchange or play off the J or Q for cheap if the situation didn't improve. 
>Opp: ?DEINOT M7 O.TaINED +74 149
>Carl: AEINOQS 14J QAI.S +70 228
#note I got the letter I needed, and was all set to play QIS N6. Then I noticed that QI L11 scores a little better and is more defensive, whereas the N6 placement allows an unblockable -ILY play down column O and leaves the bingo lanes down south untouched. And THEN I noticed this monster. The moral of the story: ALWAYS look for a better play.
>Opp: GIPR 15H PRIG +35 184
>Carl: EHNOOTU 5K THOU +28 256
#note I was kind of hoping for PUT(REF)IED or RA(REF)IED or something like that down column K, but with the last P gone and the T hook waiting to be used, I had to burn my rancid OU combo and score. THOU sims best by 9 points.
>Opp: DOT L2 DOT. +16 200
>Carl: AEEIINO E10 .INE +22 278
#note Quackle disagrees with me on this play. I saw sim winners IODINE and OIDIA 2J, both of which unload lots of vowels. I also noticed that such plays allowed big comeback plays if opp has the right letters. Meanwhile, VINE scores more, takes out two lanes, devalues a third, and draws to RIOJA 8A. It may be premature to start closing down lanes at this point, so I'll accept the duck's ruling. (-5)
>Opp: DKU 12K DU.K +18 218
>Carl: AADEIOY N8 .AY +28 306
#note This looks fine-- score well, unload a duplicate and a semi-vowel. Again draws to RIOJA 8A and also GADJO. However, Quackle prefers to sacrifice 4 points for YEA C12, burning another vowel, devaluing the C(HIVES) threat, and offering one more chance at RIOJA/GADJO. Of course YEA also opens up YEAN, YEAR, and YEAS, hooks I don't have. SAY and YEA sim very close together-- less than a tenth of a point apart.
>Opp: EELT 11H TELE +14 232
>Carl: ADEIIOO M2 OI +11 317
#note (-14.5?) Quackle really hates this play. I'm lost as to why. There's no better situation than to be up by a bingo with no bingo lanes open. My play forces him to hook HIVES or find a bingo ending in O, making JO.  Next turn, I intend to do what I can to devalue the 10B hotspot, or perhaps play RIOJA/ GADJO. Quackle strongly prefers IODIDE or OIDIA J2, which in my opinion give too many opportunities away.
>Opp: BEW C12 WEB +28 260
>Carl: ADEGIOO 8A GAD.O +42 359
#note Well, that couldn't have worked out better. He took out the CHIVES threat, and I devalued the SHIVES threat. I had to open some lanes to do it, but hopefully I can close them down next turn.
>Opp: AGINNRT A1 GRANTIN. +83 343
>Carl: EIORRTW C1 WORRITE. +76 435
#note A non-blank bingo is NOT what I wanted to see at this point because now he might well have a blank bingo-- lots of good tiles unseen. Fortunately, my own bingo makes this rack an easy choice. If I didn't know WORRITED, WORRIED would be fine because it draws for the blank myself and is somewhat more difficult to bingo off of. (Note-- I want the blank mostly so opp can't use it. I don't need another bingo to win; he does.)
>Opp: ACLLMOU -  +0 343
#note (Lost challenge). At this point, down by so much with good letters unseen, opponent should challenge if he has the slightest doubt-- he is sure to lose unless WORRITED turns out to be phony.
>Carl: ?ACEEIS 1C .ISEACrE +89 524
#note A lucky break-- but now I am stuck with the V.
>Opp: ACLLMOU B13 MAC +28 371
#note This cannot possibly be right. Opp can get 20 points for CHIVES, but only scores 6 more points for MAC over MA. Similarly, he can get more for the M with MU N6, which additionally sets up one of his Ls. If I brought this up to my opponent, it would be within his rights to kick my lucky ass. At this point, he probably didn't care much about maximizing his score. You should, however.
>Carl: V -  +0 524
>Opp: LLOU 2L ..L +8 379
>Carl: V -  +0 524
>Opp: LOU O8 .O +8 387
#note In most endgames, it's best to play out before the opponent so you get points from his rack. In this situation, it's better to milk your rack for all the points possible. 
>Carl: V -  +0 524
>Opp: LU H14 U. +4 391
#note NURL 4A scores at points, but UP (4) and LAY 10L (5) is one point more.
