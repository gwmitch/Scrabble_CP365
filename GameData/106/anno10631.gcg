>JD: EIJNRRT D9 J.ER +22 411
#note I'm pretty close to some kind of big j play on column D. If I hit something on row 14 he'll get a comeback. I thought about playing N(EX)T to fish for JEERS/JEERER/JEERIER, but it just seemed too likely he would play on column D and then I would be in trouble. one advantage of next is that it blocks some high scoring plays at that spot. ultimately I figured I needed to save time for the endgame and I cashed in jeer.

>JD: GINORST D9 ....ING +17 428
#note he blocked trigons! that would've made things a lot easier. I had about three minutes to think this pre-endgame through. my first thought was ROTI at C2, giving me an out if I draw a vowel (I thought there was a U instead of the second P). then I realized that if I kept RO I would possibly give myself a spot to go out next turn if I played elsewhere, so I came up with JEERING to save ORST and outs with the E, I, L and O and a fighting chance if I draw the P.
>Isaac: EIILNPP H14 PI +20 434
#note isaac drew both of the Ps on his last draw. the best play is extremely hard to find but doesn't win anyway.
>JD: OORST 2C ROTOS +18 446
#note a quick look with quackle reveals that my play actually wins all the endgames. Drawing the N I play DENI and then go out next turn. the hairiest is drawing a P - I have to play POST at N9 and then find the best spot for my R for a 1 point win. Of course, I had also underscored myself by 11, so I may not even have recounted if that had happened.
