#note I like this better than Quackle's preference of GOV.  It can be hard to fit bingos on this board, especially without an S.  Scoring well and getting to those S's is at a premium here.

#note I was fairly certain PHONAL didn't take an S in TWL, but who knew if it was good in Collins?  I figured there was a good chance this might get challenged off, but if the S hook was no good, losing the turn here wasn't that big a deal.  On the other hand, I could get into big trouble if the S hook was good and I left the spot open for him.  So I thought it best to clarify things once and for all.

#note John was already out of time or about to be.  Perhaps he mistracked my tiles or didn't think about my possible comebacks clearly in his rush.
