#note First off, it's FAUCALS and FACULAE.  If I want to end in -AS, I should play FLAUTAS.  Somewhere in the recesses of my mind, I already knew all that, because this exact rack has come up before.  But this is even more ridiculous than that, because SES* is also phony.  Just before the tournament, I had looked over the list of CSW 3's and seen one that started and ended with S that I'd already forgotten.  That word was SUS#, but clearly the review didn't cement it.  Matt held for a long while, but chickened out on challenging.  Oddly, while he was holding I was sitting there pretty sure that FACULAS was phony but not questioning SES at all, and he was thinking the reverse.
