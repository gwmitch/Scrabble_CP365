>jesse: ?BIKOOR 8D BROOKIe +80 80
#note cesar says: against a player of my awesomeness, i would have doubled the K to volatilize the board a tad.
>cesar: ENQSSSX I7 Q.S +23 23
#note possibly the most irritating opening rack ever
>jesse: ?ADEERZ D8 .lAZERED +92 172
#note cesar says: my, that's rather unfortunate
>cesar: EGNSSTX 9F EX +36 59
#note SEXT or GOX are considerably better. bad move. (-7)
>jesse: AAELNUW E10 WALE +45 217
#note jesse says: any comments on my side without my name in front of them will be mine from here on out. WANE is better by a hair. apparently ALU works better than ANU.
>cesar: AGNSSTW K3 TWANGS +33 92
#note dawts, probably (-0.5%)
>jesse: ACDIINU 15D .IACID +30 247
#note I was going to try DUADIC* but I figured he would know because it came up in a nationals final.
>cesar: DHLNSTU 13B LU..D +12 104
#note i had no idea what to do here. quackle likes 3K THUD which looks cooler than my move, yes. (-3)
>jesse: EEINOUU -IIIII +0 247
#note quackle doesn't mind playing through with ETUI or UNTIE but I would rather exchange. I can keep EIN if I want.
>cesar: EEHNSTT H8 .ENT +19 123
#note i THINK this was my rack. i remember having the E hook and i think i remember having TEENTHS*. WHET is better if so.
>jesse: CEFLLNP 12G PELF +20 267
>cesar: DEHISTV G7 V.. +17 140
#note maybe VIED L2
>jesse: CEMNNOY 14H MONY +18 285
#note it doesn't score a ton of points but I'm fine with it. maybe CYTON instead
>cesar: DEHISTT B8 THIST.ED +78 218
#note jesse says: cesar del phoney! I held him but he got this one past me. SHITTED looks weird to me but is good. though I accept I am still a big favorite.
>jesse: CEEEIMN A5 EMCEE +38 323
#note worth sacrificing the points I think
>cesar: AGIJORY L1 JIAO +50 268
#note thistled* is not a word!?
>jesse: BEINOOV 1L .IVE +42 365
#note cesar says: never has anyone NOT had three tiles from a J in this position. jesse says: yeah, but I was going to score many points anyway.
>cesar: GGNOORY M3 GORY +30 298
#note i can't be doing this when i'm losing, there's always a chance to come back, i really need the points from B2 GOONY. (-18)
>jesse: ABFNOOU 15K ABOON +35 400
>cesar: GNORRTU 13K RUNG +16 314
#note might as well go for it
>jesse: AFLNSTU O7 FLAUNTS +89 489
#note lucky me
>cesar: AEIIORT A14 OI +17 331
#note and i blow the endgame
>jesse: AHIPRU B2 PRAHU +35 524
