#note Wasn't sure what to do here. Maybe I'm giving too much back with this play. I probably would have done 7C WAP in hindsight. That and F7 GNAW sim best about 3pts ahead of this.

#note I think Quackle's win% numbers are optimistic. But the best is apparently AXIOM. Adam will always be able to kill the M, but then I may have something with VERTUS. I picked IXIA since I thought it would be the hardest to deal with if he didn't have S or ?. But really, MEOO isn't ever going to work out. I think I like my second over-the-board choice best: MOXIE. Just because the leave seems more optimistic.
