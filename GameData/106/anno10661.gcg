>Winter: GIIMNTT 8D MITTING +76 76
>Winter: GIIMNTT --  -76 0
>Rafi_: ?EEJMNR -J +0 0
#note I can't play the E because it gives back EMITTING, so I have to trade. Not 100% sure which trade is best, but suspected that EEMNR? would hit enough to make it worth trading just the J. Funnily, I could have played MIJNhEER through the phony opening.
>Winter: GIIMNTT -  +0 0
#note While it's correct to assume I'm very likely to bingo with an E (or an O), it's unlikely I'll actually play it knowing that I'm giving a bingo back. Trading MIT or playing TIMING (or maybe GITTIN for defense?) seem like the best options.
>Rafi_: ?AEEMNR -  +0 0
#note Any bingo gives back EMITTING, so passing is best.
>Winter: GIIMNTT -  +0 0
#note Oops
>Rafi_: ?AEEMNR -  +0 0
#note Didn't even think of the idea of playing some ridiculous phoney down the O-column, which can't be challenged if Winter wants a chance to win. Should have thought a little outside the box! Either way, 6 zeros in a row ends the game, and I have fewer points to subtract than Winter.
#note Game over, -8 to -10.
