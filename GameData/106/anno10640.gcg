>Marsh_Richards: AAOTW 8D AWATO +18 18
#note A nice example of the cleanup of the S hooks on the Maori words in CSW 12.  AWATO, AWETO, AWHATO, AWHETO are all good, but previously only AWETO took the -S.  Now they all do.
>Dave_Koenig: ABIMNOO 9E OBO +18 18
#note Hehe, WABOOM# is a cool word, but my play is pretty good too.

#note Static evaluator ranks a bunch of plays close together here, but it wouldn't surprise me if this is one of the better ones, though I haven't taken the time to run a sim.  It keeps the board tighter than most of the alternative scoring plays.  And it's difficult for her to score off the X in a way that's not going to give something good back to me.

#note I missed FUSIONAL for a bingo.  It's good in TWL, but the alphagram doesn't look that familiar to me, even though I must have seen it before.  FILLO in the same spot is also better than my play.
>Marsh_Richards: EILSZ 11G SIZEL +42 211
#note Whoops, forgot about that one and made a bad challenge.

#note I remembered pretty quickly that IRONERS had an anagram, but it took a while to figure out what it was.  Very glad that I managed to scrape this one out of the recesses of my brain.  Marsh challenged and gave me back the 10 points that I had donated to her.

#note An interesting moment when burning the ES is definitely worth it.  With both blanks still unseen, I want to dive as far into the bag as possible.  Also, it is likely that J2 will still be available for my J next turn.

#note I wanted to share with Chris Lipe that I had CriCKET on my rack.  John Van Pelt was standing nearby and thought that I wanted to play COCKIEST.
