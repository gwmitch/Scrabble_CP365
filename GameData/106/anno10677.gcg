#note Round 3, Game 6 of Jesse Day is Matchplay 2012. Historically, when I have to take 1 of 3 games, I have always done so in game 2. Would this streak continue? If not, we go to game 7, with momentum in superji's favor.

#note Tunneled on the V plays, failed to notice TOYED. oops. Mistakes like this don't win you games.

>dacrON: AAEERRV D10 .EAVER +26 124
#note I stand behind this play, despite how awfully it worked out short turn.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEIMNOW 15B AI.WOMEN +89 194
>dacrON: ADERSTU 14F DURA +24 148
#note I can take AI(R)WOMEN, but my draw pissed me off. Fortunately, we were help JD with his Game-Ready leg cooler thing, so I got some tme to settle down after this play - all is not lost.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: BOY 13G YOB +38 232
>dacrON: ?DEELST N1 LEwDEST +72 220
#note I'm still going to be losing after this play, so I've got to do something that makes Kenji have to deal with tough-to-work-with parts of the board, hence this placement.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: FIO 1L FI.O +33 265
>dacrON: IIIPPQZ 9A PIP +19 239
#note I like that this play sets up ZI(P), or even QUI(P) if I draw the U. I am really worrying abou how I'm going to ditch this Q, though. There's a lot of draws I'm going for here - a U, the B for BIZ, EL for LEZ, U for QUI(P). Maybe I can get one of them. Seemed about all I could do with this rack.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DIIO 4J IODI. +14 279
>dacrON: FIINQSZ A7 ZI. +42 281
#note I snag an S for TEATS, and ironically draw the F for FIZ, the one Z spit I felt was easiest to sacrifice. Fortunately ZIP stayed there, and Kenji's rack didn't look too great, either.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?AEINRU 3F RUINAtE +64 343
#note oh...
>dacrON: FINOQSS 2H QI +24 305
#note Not all hope is lost yet - I've got to bingo fast, though. He will have to sacrifice a turn to block TEATS though.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: H 6N .H +5 348
#note  I needed that.

>Kenji_Matsumoto: BCNO F2 B.ONC +21 369
>dacrON: ALMNSST 11C M.ALS +31 360
#note This play is second to 4E T(O)MS. I considered T(O)MS, but I figured he could block, hooking OIL. But if he does, then I can still score a bunch. I was low on time, so I went with M(E)ALS. Hm.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CEHKRRT 5C KER. +16 385
#note Kenji mistracked the G as a second N. Championship Player freezes when I try to sim here. wha?
>dacrON: EGLNSTU C2 GUN. +18 378
#note This gets the job done by 2 - GL(E)ETS wins by 17. I had very little time to find a win, so once I saw one, I went for it.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CEHJRT 3B J.T +10 395
#note JET is best.
#note Moving on to round 4! 4-2 final!
