#note i didn't want to complain to ed that my last 4 opps opened with a bingo because i always get absurdly lucky against him. and to lower my chances of missing it, this is the same bingo bruce played on me the first game! i played it in the same spot even though i extended it to READOPTED in that game. 2 points is 2 points. quackle slightly agrees.
>ed: MY 7H MY +24 24
>cesar: EGHRRSX 9I HER +28 104
#note i do not quite understand whatever sleep-addled insane reasoning i had for this move; i doubt i missed HEX, but i think i wanted to keep scoring with READOPTS/SEX/SAX/XIS/whatever. HEX is still better because, you know, it's 42 points right now with a promising leave. dumb cesar. (-10)
>ed: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 24
>cesar: GIRSX N8 SIX +37 141
#note didn't write down the full rack but XIS must have been obvious or SIX. i am pretty sure this kept 4 consonants.
>ed: EF 10J FE +31 55
>cesar: AGGHLNR L10 HANG +25 166
#note i wrote a question mark beside this play because i have no concept of defense. GARTH looks a little bit less crazy and sure enough it sims better (-1)
>ed: EIILNOT 12E LENITIO. +59 114
#note that's why HANG didn't seem right. teach me defense someone?
>cesar: AGLORRT 6I ALGOR +18 184
#note my thought for the rest of the game is to keep scoring and try to end the game early.
