#note What would you do here. Quackle suggests DEAD 8G, maybe because it isn't overlapped as easily?

#note Phony.

>Noah: EEISTUV 11C UVE. +18 142
#note Perhaps I should have played UVEA J7, since RETRIALS might indicate that he didn't see PRETRIALS. As it happens, he did see PRETRIALS, but played it anyway.

#note Do you know what I am supposed to here? I thought I should try to block some lanes off, but the leave for this was not that strong. Everything here is pretty mediocre. Thoughts?

#note Should I do this here, or something else? I didn't really see a good way to try to open up, hm.

>Noah: ?AGOTUW 15L WAG. +12 325
#note My best idea was to try to draw some sort of OUT word  to the K (e.g. OUTFlANK), and it seemed like I needed to ditch the W and G to do that.
