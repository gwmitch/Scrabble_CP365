>Donna_Balkan: FRY 8H FRY +18 18
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: GIIILNQ 7G QI +26 26
#note In the six years I've been playing club, I have never once failed to get at least three bingos in a night. With only one bingo going into this game, I had my work cut out for me to keep the streak alive.
>Donna_Balkan: INV J5 VIN. +12 30
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: GIILNOT 5H LO.ING +20 46
#note VOLTI is really close. I just felt like ING wasn't going to fit anywhere.
>Donna_Balkan: AABC H1 CABA. +30 60
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DHIRTTY M3 RI.HTY +28 74
>Donna_Balkan: TU 4K TU. +12 72
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADOOOST 8M .OD +21 95
#note This or ADOBO. Decided to kill the Y, as it was the only decent scoring spot. ADOBO wins the sim by a couple points. Alright.
>Donna_Balkan: FLT 2F FL.T +15 87
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AMOOSTW N6 MO.T +27 122
#note 1D WOO and N6 MOO are close. I valued this a bit higher since I thought she may not know the S hook.
>Donna_Balkan: AW 1H .AW +10 97
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEKOSW 3C WOKE +27 149
#note Geez, after AVOIDED was apparently wrong vs. VOIDED in my last game, it seems I never know when to tack on the hook or keep it back. Though AWOKE sims about even with this.
>Donna_Balkan: ENP D1 PE.N +18 115
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADIIRSS 1A DRI. +21 170
#note She shuffled a long time on her last play, so I decided to kill AWOKE. I didn't like B2 RADII inferring a bingo leave.  DRIPS is probably a little bit better, but I planned to hook MOOTS for points next turn.
>Donna_Balkan: EU E3 .UE +16 131
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEINSS B1 .IA +18 188
#note I have to say, I am not feeling confident about keeping the streak alive at this point.
>Donna_Balkan: GU I8 .UG +5 136
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AENSSX 11H lAXNESS +81 269
#note @$#! I missed SEXTANS. Boy did I ever STEE it up tonight.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CDEIORT O12 C.ED +30 350
#note I knew CRIT was the play, but I figured the D would be a little easier to bingo to. And I really wanted that 3rd bingo of the night.
>Donna_Balkan: ADH 11C DAH +28 267
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIOORTZ B9 ZOOTIER +94 444
#note A miracle! The streak lives on!
