>Joe: CDEORST J7 CORD +18 98
#note After he played, with the board upside-down, I decided that ESCORTED didn't play, looked around a bit more, but didn't know SEDUCTOR or EDUCTORS.  Of course, best is (4H ESCORTED -38.9)
>Kevin: GMP D4 G.MP +18 48
>Joe: ?EORSTY 11D sTOREYS +76 174
#note Saw CORSETRY, but wasn't sure of it. Missed a number of other better bonuses, quackle even prefers 6D MOY over my move (1H CORSETRY -20.5)

#note was pleased to spot this
>Kevin: FIN B11 F..IN +18 133
>Joe: EEEEIRS 15A E.E +9 255
#note Quackle wouldn't have closed the 9x - I guess he doesn't know Kevin.  (6D MEE -10.9 - though winningness is marginal)
>Kevin: AJ 6B JA. +28 161
>Joe: EEGIORS 1E GRI.E +8 263
#note At this point, I was sure Kevin was ready to pounce, so Quackle's preferred play of (10J DOGIE -20.9) doesn't add up for me)
>Kevin: ANOP H10 ..APON +36 197
>Joe: EEEIORS 13H .EERIE +18 281
#note I guess I was pleased to turn over some tiles to bring on the end, but this is too volatile (A10 EEK -12.6)

#note my lucky day
>Kevin: BOO B1 .OOB +28 258
>Joe: ADEIOQS 12L QAID +56 376
#note QADI has 8 points more equity, but mine is marginally winningest, so screw that!
