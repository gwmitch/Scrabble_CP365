>Yvonne: EMN 8G MEN +10 10
#note No wonder I had a headache throughout the tournament. Having to play Captain Whiney McWhines A Lot would give anyone migraines. All throughout the game I hear about how I always draw all the tiles against her, etc.
>Geoff: ADEEFGY 7F FAYED +27 27
#note Mis-scored as 26. Whoops.

#note Figured FLATTEN, FLATTER, FLATTED were all decent chances.
>Yvonne: EH 10A EH +26 82
>Geoff: AEFLLTT N2 FLATLET +80 227
#note Alas!
>Yvonne: ?ENOORS O7 mOONERS +78 160

#note Took RYOT over YORES. I figure it worked out just fine.
>Yvonne: K F5 K.. +10 264
>Geoff: AEIOPSU 15L PESO +43 513
#note Champ takes a little while here then spits out UPO, OUT, WUD, UPSOAR, PESO. Simming them for a bit agrees with my choice, however.
