#note The first thing that occurred to me was the new CSW addition NANOWIRE#.  I didn't even remember that this one was CSW only.

#note I liked this way of playing OPIUM better than the other to take out more bingo lines, but 9I EUOI# does an even better job of that and probably would have been a smarter choice.

#note After this bingo, I figured there was a good chance he would have the X.  It seemed like the moment to take out J2.

#note I had plenty of time here and wrote out every bingo I could find.  I saw every single seven, both TWL and CSW, except for the one that fit at 13I.  But my play was enough to win anyway, and I got ten points for the challenge.
>Bob_Lipton: ACLORRS 13I ROARS +26 431
#note Best is K2 SOAR.  After the game, Bob pointed out to me that if I had not taken out row 11 his bingo RACLOIRS# would not have fit anyway.
