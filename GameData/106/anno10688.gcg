#note ugh, bad. 2J OI is much better, but exchanging keeping E is best. i don't get it, i even wrote that down on my sheet but i think i was frazzled by verdin. (-13.5)

#note you can tell how frazzled i was by this stupid game that i thought 1N AE was less points or something. i wasn't quite playing scrabble here. i do this a lot still... that's bad. 3M AE is better, quackle likes M2 TITANATE which is freaking cool. (-8)

>cesar: AAEINST 12E TAENIAS +66 326
#note ok, at this point i focused again. 12F ENTASIA is two more points, but i wanted to make it slightly harder for him to bingo back. quackle says i'm dumb and it doesn't matter. also, taenias gives back more bingos; good job cesar. it must be the S. (-2)
