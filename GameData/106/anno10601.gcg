#note I think this is what I always guess in Zyzzyva as well.
>David: ACDORSU K5 CRUSADO +97 130
>Mike: AEGLNTU 10E LAG +19 44
#note GENU L9 sims best; don't like it. I can live with GLUTEN 10B, though, trying to destroy the information David has.

#note Is this where I'm supposed to say "None of this would have happened without LANGUET"? :)
>David: BIN 15A BIN +22 271
>Mike: DEENRTT B2 TENTER.D +72 173
#note Yeah, it plays for four more at 14B, but I wanted to open more space.

#note The best bingo here would be a nice find.
>Mike: AHIKPRZ L1 PH.Z +42 312
#note ZEK J2 sims best, for some mysterious reason. ZIP 2F, threathing a big 1H play, is an interesting idea, but it's unlikely to work.

>Mike: AEEIKLR 1L .EAK +30 342
#note How exactly am I supposed to win after KINE 15L or AKEE 14A? Those two plays, PEAK and PIKE are all within the 8-9% range--which is a far cry from where I was after JEHU. However...
>David: AAGIMSS 15H AMASSI.G +158 554
#note ...that's part of the other 91-92%. (Two point addition mistake gives David 552 here.)
>Mike: EIILNRR 5B .IRL +16 358
#note RIEL 5D is two better.
>David: OU C8 .O +11 565
