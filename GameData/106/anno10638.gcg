#note (-4) ROTIFER. i saw it, and i guess i misvalued it a little bit. i was reasonably sure that ERRST would result in a bingo. it seems to 60% of the time. i guess that's a bit low.

#note after drawing ire he overdrew and i think rst were shown so i threw in the S. he had a bingo no matter what i threw in
>cesar: ?DFGOST N11 FOGS +38 242
#note then i drew the S after throwing it in. he somewhat bemusedly asked me how'd i get the S.. then realized i must have drawn it after waged. maybe i threw in the S without mixing it and then it was near the top of the pile where i drew or whatever, or maybe i just got really lucky. in any case, i was worried for the rest of the game that he may have thought i cheated or something.

#note O1 EYED for the points mainly, even though my move will result in a bingo much more of the time. kind of weird, i don't understand this position that much. (-6)

#note wow, i held tannic FOREVER until i realized that i could maybe still win. i almost challenged it twice. CAKY MAYBE to block high scores a little bit, i don't know.. i only have a 12% chance of winning after quick or so.
