>Alex: ?AACITU 8F AqUATIC +72 72
>Joe: BCLORSZ K5 ZOR.L +28 28
#note C(A)Z sims best, This is -11.7 equity points.
>Alex: NOX L4 NOX +40 112
>Joe: BCDGIMS J3 BIDS +34 62
#note Quack prefers GIDS in the same spot - keeping the B would combine nicely with our M. - Slightly better again would be C(OX)IB -  which I didn't even come close to seeing.
>Alex: AEGY L8 .AGEY +24 136
>Joe: ACGKLMO K11 MOCK +37 99
#note COMAL is a bit better - not a word I knew, my play is next best
>Alex: ADIT 9F DITA +17 153
>Joe: AEGILLN M11 GEL +20 119
#note AL has better equity, but this is the winningest move.  I didn't know either of the (unplayable) 7s in this rack.
>Alex: ?AINORT 15E RATIONs +80 233
>Joe: AIILLNU 10H ALU +11 130
#note Quackle dislikes this - It favours plays like ILIAL from 14B - presumably keeping the board a bit more open.
>Alex: HI 14F HI +28 261
>Joe: EIIJLMN H12 MIN. +15 145
#note best 
>Alex: FN 13G F.N +21 282
>Joe: EEIIJLT 7C JEEL +23 168
#note I had looked for extensions of RATIONS, but didn't think of any. Quackle gets very creative here, and plays ITE(RATIONS), keeping the case L for L(ITERATIONS later on).  There are lots of other simple plays that are better than my choice.

>Alex: NNSUY 10B SUNNY +34 316
>Joe: IIORTUW N13 IWI +14 182
#note IWI is almost the winningest play, but I think Q has given up on winning (what a wimp!), it prefers RIOT for 27.
>Alex: AEPRS O11 RAPES +40 356
>Joe: AEFORTU M1 TUFA +16 198
#note Again, my play is the 2nd winningest, but Q favours the more obvious FEAT for 36 points - 
>Alex: EEQR C9 Q.EER +48 404
>Joe: DDEGOOR D12 REDO +26 224
#note Q says I've lost the game at this point, but it reckons DOG at 6D is 10 full equity points better than my play here.
>Alex: EHP N2 PEH +35 439
>Joe: GOV B12 GOV +21 245
#note Same word hooking G(LADY) would obviously have been better.  I had noticed this hook earlier, but I'd forgotten about it by this stage.

#note under time pressure, missed BRIBE - and thought this bloked Alex from an out-in-one.
