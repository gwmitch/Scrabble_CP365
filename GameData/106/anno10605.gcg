#note This is an interesting rack. I could also play OX, EQUIP or DEX. OX doesn't seem as conducive to the EIQU? leave as DEX, since the E is still open after that. I didn't like EQUIP that much because the QUE could yield a high-scoring play, and it still gives up a reasonable scoring spot. But I guess I should've played EQUIP or OX, since they don't give Robin as many options.

#note I thought about YOU, but I thought the points of this would be worth it, specially since since YOU lets Robin score well.

#note Someone just posted a game with this phony on cross-tables, but I needed something like this pretty badly at this point.

#note Considered IMPI, but didn't like the drek that it left. Furthermore, it seemed like she might be oblivious to the spot on row 11, since she just missed MAIL there, so I don't think I need to be concerned about blocking it.
>Robin_Levin: DN 11E D.N +22 395
#note Guess she saw it now.

>Robin_Levin: IL H1 LI. +15 410
>Noah: AAAIKOR I5 OAK +26 381
#note Is there anything here that gives me a chance? She surely has at least one S or blank, and probably more than that. I could draw something like STRIATA and she could have drek, though it's not too likely. Not sure.

>Noah: AAIORVV L9 V.VARIA +28 409
#note Thought I was blocking FISC, but then realized I opened it. Didn't really think this through since spread doesn't matter in this match, so I'm fine with this. VIVA looks best.
>Robin_Levin: CFS K2 .....S +24 494
#note Luckily she missed FISC.
