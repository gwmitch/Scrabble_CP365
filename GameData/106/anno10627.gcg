#note Thought MELL was phony. yikes. Kenji would've challenged MELL too. JILT would have been my choice. JA(I)L 14J sims best, even with the obvious S infernce, but I can't possibly play that.

#note Yeah that was a good draw. Kenji resigned after this play, even though he had ACDENRS. Wouldn't have mattered.
#note I've got a 3-1 lead now, and need to win one of the last three to advance to the fourth round. Can I hold on?
