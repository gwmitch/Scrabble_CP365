>Matt_Canik: AACEENQ -AEQ +0 47
#note I don't really want to throw this board open with this Q on my rack. This actually wins the sim.

>Matt_Canik: ADIIIRR 11K IRID +14 139
#note For obvious reasons, I don't play this at 11B, and for myserious reasons, I don't see this at 11C. 
>Becky_Dyer: EEEOOOO -EEEOOOO +0 148
>Matt_Canik: ADEEIQR 10M QI +29 168
#note Over the next 4 turns, I do what appears to building towards a bingo and somehow end up doing the opposite. Leave: ADEER
>Becky_Dyer: AN 9F NA +16 164
>Matt_Canik: ADEEORS N7 OE +9 177
#note Leave: ADERS
>Becky_Dyer: ALNORST 7D TONAL +20 184
#note She told me this was the rack. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEGHRS 11D HAG +22 199
#note Whiff GERAH 8A and see (A)GHA E10 but not AGH(A) H1. Not good. I passed SHARD/SHADE 011 intentionally.

>Becky_Dyer: BERW 5E BREW +23 233

#note Wussed out on SPIRY, which is just sad. Bad bingoboy. 
>Becky_Dyer: ?DENNOS 12I DONE +17 250
#note Set down NODES/TID, then realized it was collins, set down NONES, then picked it up and played this. Told me after the game that she had the blank, but thought DONNEeS might be collins or something. 
>Matt_Canik: BGHPRSV -BGHV +0 254
#note And somehow, my rack went from ADEEORS to this.

>Becky_Dyer: ?HINOSS 13H HOISiNS +82 344
#note I mean, this has to be a word, right! Apparently not. SIpHONS/HMM
>Matt_Canik: AEGIORS H13 .OG +21 301
#note Spent seemingly forever on this turn. I don't like what I played, but I didn't like any other options. Don't want to do something hyperaggressive like 13B GO, at least not yet. 
>Becky_Dyer: AUV B10 VAU +21 365
>Matt_Canik: ABEIRSU L2 I.. +3 304
#note Spent over 10 minutes on this turn, then decided the only way I could win was to distract her with this, hope I pull AUBER(G)ES, and catch her with a lot of those clunkers on her rack. 
>Becky_Dyer: EEPW 1L WEEP +50 415
>Matt_Canik: ABERSTU C2 .RUB +14 318
#note BAR(G)EST doesn't score enough to win anyway, but I didn't know it.
