>cesar: CDGIIPU 9H PUDIC +18 18
#note seriously? J6 PUG sims 4.5 points better than this? explanation please. nevermind, the details window tells me that i will score about the same score after both plays, but that PUDIC will give back more points. 
>cree: II -II +0 8
>cesar: DGIORTT 7I GRIOT +15 33
#note quackle prefers 10I TOD by a significant margin. GRIOT to me looks like it'll give me a comeback if he takes that bingo spot; it did not seem feasible to block. that's really about the only reason i chose it. TOD is better. (-4.5)
>cree: I -I +0 8
>cesar: ADFNSTT 8M AFT +20 53
#note well, whatever. let the bingo come down, i can't really do much else here.
>cree: I -I +0 8
#note chris said something about "sometimes the fish don't bite"

>cesar: ABDIINS E5 BANDI.S +40 129
#note of course basined is a little better. i actually honestly chickened out on it. FIB sims best though. take the pts? (-1.3)
>cree: ELY F4 LEY +31 108
>cesar: AEEGIIO 8A GEOI. +24 153
#note debbie stegman once played TEMPTING when i did something similar for like a million points. i hate scrabble.
>cree: IQ L4 QI +24 132
>cesar: AABEEII O8 .IBIAE +9 162
#note vibe is too ugly of a leave. i didn't use to make plays like this too. so much of scrabble is just about trying to outrun the opponent and hoping disaster doesn't strike. like TEMPTING.
>cree: JO B6 JO. +26 158
>cesar: AEEOVWZ D3 AVOW +34 196
>cree: EEINNRW M1 REWIN +30 188
#note this was actually chris's rack, you can imagine what he said after playing JOE and drawing :) that is a surprising move though. i would just play WIN - i'm not sure the board needs to be blown up just yet. but REWIN does sim higher by a point.
>cesar: EEEETUZ 2L Z.E +24 220
#note this is a really bad play :( i do this kind of stuff with the Z a lot. i keep forgetting that the Z is worth a lot on my rack; that's not the case for the other high point tiles! TRUE is much better. (-12.5)
>cree: AFLM N8 .LAM +23 211
>cesar: EEELOTU 12L TOE. +18 238
#note the rest of this game is way too tense. quackle of course likes the pure equity D10 VOLUTE. please raise your hand if you would play that. (-8)

#note that was a good draw!!
>cree: ADEF H1 FADE +41 286
>cesar: ?EEKLNU 2H .UK +17 293
#note now now quackle! neuk c10? if he bingoes to row 14 i don't give myself the chance to bingo back on row 13 if i do that! ugh, this is a really hard move. (-4)
>cree: ?EHLORY 14F HELOtRY +76 362
#note note this wins more games than placing it at 14G. 14J HOY seems best, but who passes up the bingo here?
>cesar: ?EELMNN 15A LENsMEN +81 374
#note dumb. i actually picked the 4TH best bingo; linemen and lensmen both overlap at 13C !! i was more sure of lensmen than linemen because i'm dumb. (-10)
