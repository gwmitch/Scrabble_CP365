#note Ooh, I had a big play of HURL 6F here, if only I had known/remembered ROOFY#.

>Dave_Koenig: ELPRSTU 12F PEL +21 272
#note I missed a lot of stuff here, mostly from not thinking about row 6 plays enough and not knowing enough CSW.  There are various good choices.  My favorites are PURL or PUR at 6F.  Setting up the hook for the case S might be worth the 7 point sacrifice here.  It also would have been good to hit the L12-13 spot, both for points and to take out a good scoring zone for him.  I wanted to play PERT, but was afraid I was misremembering PRE#.  UPTER# would have been even better there.

#note Here I totally chickened out of SUTURAL, thinking I might be confusing it with FUTURAL.  I'm pretty sure I've played it before.  Sigh.  I've blown too many opportunities in this one, and pretty soon it looks like Matt is going to win easily, until something crazy happens.
