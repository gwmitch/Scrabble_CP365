#note Round 3, Game 5 of Jesse Day is Lying in a Gigantic Splint After his ACL Surgery Next to us while we play...wait that's not right. It's round 3, game 5 of Jesse Day is Matchplay 2012! When Kenji and I last left off, I was up 3-1. Could I defeat superji one more time?

#note It goes downhill from here. I was set to play 14B YE, but the EOTY? leave doesnt seem too conducive to work with the lane I've just opened. I figured I could go with YO next turn. Kenji has to stop scoring on this board at some point, right?

#note That's EOYYAEIOOUU the last three turns if you're paying attention. I probably could've held onto an I here. Kenji also exposed the blank when he drew his tiles.

#note I frustratedly resigned here. Probably should've taken BL(E)T and kept going. Silly me. Just got way frustrated here. 3-2, my lead, but one chance is used up.
