>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACEEIU H7 EAU +6 6
#note I gave Matt Canik this rack as a quiz, since I thought the options were interesting. They aren't. I missed another one... I should have had a few beers before this one. 
>Chris_Kulig: DEEMPRT 7B TEMPER.D +67 67
#note Positionally, looks like 7G for 68 makes the most sense. Perhaps PERM(U)TED even. This looks like the worst bingo to play, just by what it gives back. Although I played EAU, so I usually can't hit 8A...
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACEEEI E4 EAr.IECE +94 100
#note I didn't know the other bingo here, SEAPIECE.
>Chris_Kulig: EHY 8A YEH +34 101
>Joshua_Sokol: ACELLNR D1 CLEAN +26 126
#note I wondered if NACELLAR* were valid. I was thinking of NUCELLAR, which plays. CANALLER is the word in NACELLAR. Tsk.
>Chris_Kulig: BGNU D11 BUNG +18 119
>Joshua_Sokol: ILNPRSV 15A VINS +33 159
>Chris_Kulig: GIIJNU 1A JUI.ING +51 170
>Joshua_Sokol: DFLNOPR I9 PROF +19 178
#note Missing plays at B7. TENFOLD or TELFORD so as not to duplicate the R look significantly better than this. 
>Chris_Kulig: HOW G9 HOW +25 195
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DELNOR 14D .OLDeNER +63 241
#note Missing 12G EN(F)OLDeR. This was unsuccessfully challenged.
>Chris_Kulig: ADEEKOY -  +0 195
>Joshua_Sokol: FILRSVX H13 V.X +36 277
#note I thought it could be costly to leave the big hotspot alone and go for a huge X play next turn. Makes more sense to reduce the variables.
>Chris_Kulig: ADEIT 15K EDITA +26 221
>Chris_Kulig: ADEIT --  -26 195
>Joshua_Sokol: FIILRST 13A FLI.T +18 295
#note I was sort of distracted here. Missed 12C F(U)SIL for 30, which makes the most sense. The S isn't too good here. But it's good to get rid of the T, even though Chris has one or two of them, I think. Maybe not, maybe it's fine to keep RIST or RIT.
>Chris_Kulig: ADEITY 6E .YE +28 223
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIRSSU K11 URA.I +10 305
#note hmm... should have played FUSIL or LIF(E) or something.
>Chris_Kulig: DIOT 15K .DIOT +24 247
>Joshua_Sokol: AABIOSS 14M OBA +22 327
>Chris_Kulig: AMW 13M MAW +37 284
>Joshua_Sokol: AAILSST 6I ALS +8 335
#note dunno what this was!!! Super paranoid defense!
>Chris_Kulig: DIK K3 KID. +18 302
>Joshua_Sokol: AAINQST L2 QAT +34 369
#note The puzzle falls into place, despite many wrong turns.
>Chris_Kulig: OO 15G O.O +15 317
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINRST M4 STEARIN +62 431
#note Best play!
>Joshua_Sokol:  (EGORSTZ) +34 465
