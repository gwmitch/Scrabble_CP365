#note Quackle prefers to only keep an R. I guess this is just one of those things that you have to remember the marginality of and strive to make the right exchange next time. I bingo around 2% more often with R?

#note This was an interesting turn to analyze. The three plays that are to be considered seem to be H1 WITH(E) for 45, AW(E)IGH at L3 for 34, and 4L WAAH for 38. 11 points is a lot to give up here, but AT was by far the best leave to keep here. AAG after WITHE was pretty bad, but WITH(E) seemed better positionally. After OBOE Chris is unlikely to have a big play down H1, but that spot isn't only problematic immediately. It might be left open for a few turns, especially if I play WAAH. That's why I didn't want to play WAAH: it left Chris with too many easy options to get back into the game in the form of scoring spots. Also, GIT wasn't going anywhere either. So it was between WITHE and AWEIGH. I liked AT a lot more than AGA, since it allows for more flexible options for me next turn. But as previously stated WITHE takes away an important spot on the board when I am not too far ahead that I don't need to worry about those. But I figured I could take the spot next turn if need be, and AW(E)IGH also restricted the right side of the board to cliffhanger 7s that began with a vowel. With the lead I had, in the end, I felt most comfortable with the points sacrifice for the far superior leave, hoping to force the game quicker.

Quackle has AW(E)IGH simulating .3% higher than WITH(E), and values AWEIGH .1 higher than WITHE.

#note another issue with that H1 hotspot is that some of the time my opponent can put a dangerous tile on H1 as well as score.

#note Unbelievably, I missed TRAUMAS, twice, since I decided to play this phony instead. It made sense, although it looked funny. STRUMAE and STRUMAS are good, and STROMATA.
