#note I'm very trigger-happy with challenges in Collins

#note VIAM(E)TER 
>Tim_Weiss: AFH D3 FAH +31 68
>Amalan_Iyengar: CEJNRRT -JNR +0 20
#note This is a very bad play. I wasn't 100% sure on TAM :(, and I didn't like keeping JNRT on this board. JET is clearly right here.
>Tim_Weiss: ELX F8 .EX +26 94
>Amalan_Iyengar: BCEIRTT C1 CRIB +33 53
#note Quackle likes the fish with CIT# C2, or BIT F3. 
>Tim_Weiss: DEILN D8 .INDLE +20 114
>Amalan_Iyengar: ADEEETT 1A TE. +15 68
#note DE(C)TET# and (C)ATTED sim best, neither of which I knew. I also didn't know that WINDLE was a verb. TA(C)E does look better than TE(C)#, however
>Tim_Weiss: BEILRST 14A BLISTER +83 197
#note (T)RIBLETS#
>Amalan_Iyengar: ADEEEOT A12 DE.E +27 95
#note Thought about ADO(B)E, wasn't sure of it
>Tim_Weiss: ?AAGINO 13G AGNOsIA +71 268
>Amalan_Iyengar: ADEMOOT 14J MOOED +43 138
#note Quackle likes MOOTED more than MOOED, but he's probably just going to score there for a bunch, and it leaves the 15 lane open for bigger scoring

>Tim_Weiss: OOZ B10 ZOO +35 332
>Amalan_Iyengar: ACEENRT 12M TEC +11 175
#note Fishing is a better play here than TEC#, I'm just not sure of the right fish that will open the board. Quackle suggests 11D D(E), but ideally I'd like to open more than that.
>Tim_Weiss: UV H11 VU. +8 340
>Amalan_Iyengar: AENNQRR 9C Q. +21 196
>Tim_Weiss: ?AFINSW H1 FAWNIeS. +92 432
#note The E in BLISTeR should be the blank, not the one here
>Amalan_Iyengar: AENNORR 3H .ORN +8 204
#note Looking at the play in postmortem, Quackle suggests WORN, but IRON seems decently strong here as well. It leave me open for bingoes through the A, and opens up the E hook. However, I could get easily burned there. However, WORN probably minimizes spread damage
>Tim_Weiss: EGIIORU -EG +0 432
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEGNRSY 2G Y.G +10 214
#note 4K ANGRY or YAGER is the play here
>Tim_Weiss: EEJ N10 JE. +26 458
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEGNPRS 11H .ANG +16 230
#note (T)REPANGS, which I think I've seen before, and (R)ESPRANG bingo
