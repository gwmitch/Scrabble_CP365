#note Is 12C D(I)TZ worth playing? Apparently so. I guess I hit a few things like CONEPATE with all vowel draws.

#note I must have played this word more than anybody. This is at least the 4th time in a tournament. That being said, I should play ZAI(R)E E5 for the same score. I missed it.

#note Was tough to choose here between bad plays. B13 (A)WE was up there, but I felt I should leave as few vowels as I can on my rack for maximum flexibility. Apparently I bingo 1/4 times next turn, which isn't enough to risk the game over, in my opinion. I guess I can still dump my vowels next turn with 4J EAU, so AWE is fine.

#note this was bad. What was I doing? 6F PO(O)RI or 8M PIU are more sensible here

#note This is what I recorded my rack as. It doesn't make any sense that I would have missed bingos here, so I'll give myself the benefit of the doubt that this was not my rack. If it was, I don't know what to say.

#note I was going for GUNGIES(T) in two spots, hoping to outrun that way, but we figured in the end that it would tie if he played FEME at 2A. But 6K ENEMY and E5 EME(R)Y clinch it for him in that case. He would probably see one or the other.
