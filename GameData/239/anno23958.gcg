#note weird draw of AAAE though. I'll cut the crap: Nothing I could have reasonably done here could have saved me from his next play. He could be weak, he could be strong. My thought process was: do I really let him bingo almost half of the time that he was weak after DA with a play at J4 (ALANE looks best there)? Do I really let him get maximum flexibility if he was strong by playing something through the Z (AZALEA or AZAN)? In these cases, keeping the Q is disastrous as well, for the most part. It seemed like, beyond a shadow of a doubt, it made the most sense to get rid of my Q now and retain the most flexible leave possible. I'm not in terrible shape if he bingos here. I may even get to bingo myself, depending on his options. But especially, I don't have to drag the Q behind me while fighting what appears to be a monster rack. ALANE would likely have worked out best for me, in the end. But that bails far too many racks out. Is Jason just too good to play on a closed board with no power tiles to flaunt?

#note He first played INFESTS, and that gave me HARDLINE! But he changed it, last minute. What a wizard. Hats off.

To answer my question: Is Jason too good to play a closed board on with nothing to show for?

Yes. I should not have done this. I should have played K11 HARL to leave the bottom of the board accessible and to keep the pressure on my opponent. This was one of these plays that I make far too often: Score as much as possible and open a few threats. I have to be more pragmatic against the best of the best.

HALED at K2 is another interesting option, but I MUST NOT PLAY THERE!

#note Super awful play, fishing for some crazy stuff. I have to play 10C JINGL(Y) I fear, and hope for a U and some other Letters Usually Called Killers. Quackle enjoys my play thoroughly, computing that after drawing an O or an A, I can score 29 points and keep a bingo-prone leave, while Jason blissfully opens up the board for my bingo.

I guess 11C GLUON. That would have done it for me, for sure. Whee!!

#note Oh my god, what? I have a nonzero chance of a bingo next turn? Perhaps I should maximize that change with 13D VL(O)G. Is that also better for spread? I don't think so. Of course, this empties the bag, but that doesn't really matter much
>Jason_Li: BOTTUVW A13 VU. +7 509
#note Jason knows how to exploit me. This is -1 to TUTO(R), but he wants to minimize the chances of me bingo-ing out. It's not out of the realm of possibility that I will--- you'll see.
