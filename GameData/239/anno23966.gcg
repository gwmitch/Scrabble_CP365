#note weird placement, I asked Sal what he had here, what he answered surprised me, but I don't remember.

#note Didn't look at the damn C he gave me. I should have taken 10 more points, despite the extra givebacks. I. Will. Never. Miss. LAITANCE. Ever. Again! (cue to ten years from now when I still miss stuff like TAILRACE.

#note Hilarious draw of LIENATE after ALIENATE.

This is the play that gave me a chance to win this game against my Scrabble daddy. I smelled something was up, for some reason, although Sal's recent plays were relatively innocent, I could tell from his demeanor that he was ready to go.
>Sal_Piro: ?DEENTT 3F NETTlED +61 239
#note I was unhappy to block my own lane last turn, but I figured I didn't need to bingo to win here, and Sal could easily open something up. Nope, he just bingos starting in N after I had just blocked a 2x2 that would have had to start with S N-T-P-H or something even more ridiculous like RH, TH or PH! Fortunately for me, Sal missed (K)iTTENED.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINORT H1 RO.I +15 210
#note Ouch. This was a painful rack. I didn't miss anything this time, at least. This seems like the best I can do, but I'm in double trouble with all of those heavy consonants out. Mostly worried about the Z, as one should be at all stages of the game. 
>Sal_Piro: JOW 13C JOW +31 270
#note Sal said this was his only vowel.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINOTV 14A AVO +21 231
#note This was pivotal. Against a human player I can't really expect for everything to stay open for the rest of the game, so 11C TAV will not work unless I get a very fortuitous draw. After JOW, 11A AVION seems like a very bad idea as well, since if Sal manages to score with his heavy-pointers, he can easily outrun a bingo of mine. I think I definitely need to fork the board here.
>Sal_Piro: RX A13 R.X +30 300
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIINOT 15C ETHION +40 271
#note Quackle likes 11D OH a lot! Apparently I have a very strong chance of a bingo next turn. I don't know what OH will accomplish if I do not draw into anything next turn, though. Seems I will just lose. ETHION opens a lane less likely to get blocked, allowing me to continue to open things on the left side if I don't hit, and also allowing me to outscore if Sal decides to play paranoid. I am in disagreement with Quackle here, but that's probably because of what happened next.

#note There is no use trying to prevent my Q-bomb here. This is the best endgame play, kudos to Sal. He always plays well against me.

#note After beating Sal 3 years ago, I have, with much luck on my side, overcome the 0-7 drought that ensued.
