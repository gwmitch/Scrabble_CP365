#note OCREATE COCREATE! I see that instantly now :D

#note I knew FELSITIC. Did not know FILISTER. Lloyd would have seen both instantly.

#note barely worth playing it seems.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADEEIY B10 YEA +28 251
#note I played this because he was fishy. I should be able to score well next turn if I cannot bingo, in the spot I created. Sometimes, inference-based playing works.

>Lloyd_Mills: EHLM A12 HELM +48 324
>Joshua_Sokol: CEOPTUW N2 COUPE +36 400
#note Given the vowel/consonant ratio here, I knew it was relatively close between COUP and COUPE. I wanted to be able to defend the rest of the board after my play, but 10 points seemed like too many to give up. I outrun most things after COUPE, I guess.
>Lloyd_Mills: IQ M7 QI +24 348
#note Scored as 25. I believe Lloyd immediately noticed his mistake of not playing 5 spots down. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AINRRTW L9 W.RN +20 420
#note It was hard to decide between WORN and WORT here. I chose WORN because there were more N's in the pool than T's, but a simluation still prefers WORT, citing an impressive 4% bingo increase over WORN. The T goes kess well with the other tiles in the pool.
>Lloyd_Mills: DJO 3K DOJ.. +24 372
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEILRT H10 DETAIL +32 452
#note On the flip side, a simulation tells me it's better to keep the T here than to keep the R this time. But this was definitely the right idea, blocking the M finally, the ROUES lane, and the RESTINGS* lane... Little did I know of the asterisk on the word RESTINGS*

>Joshua_Sokol: AILMORS 15L MISO +35 487
>Joshua_Sokol: AILMORS --  -35 452
#note And to make sure this was indeed a game vs. Lloyd Mills, I had to phony. TRIGNESS, STINGERS and TRESSING. I can never get that right. What am I going to do with myself? This is the correct endgame if RESTINGS* stays, at least...
