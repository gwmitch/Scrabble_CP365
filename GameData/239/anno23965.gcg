#note Good thing I didn't have an open T here, since I have yet to learn that CADGY does not compare.

>Joshua_Sokol: EFILNRS C13 FIN +25 209
#note ENRS is better than ELRS, so FIL is the play here. I know this rack because I wrote down several alphagrams, to make sure I wasn't missing anything.

#note This is the beginning of scariness. There are two blanks out still, and now well over half of the tiles are gone. 
>Wes_Eddings: DEEFIIS L9 DEIFIES +79 256
#note Smart choice of opening another 3x3 here by Wes instead of taking the points at I7. Now I am extremely scared.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEJR 15H JEER. +36 321
#note No rack info here, but I did not have a blank and I really hoped I could withstand what Wes had in store here.

#note Phew!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEHIN 14J HA. +29 350
#note I imagine my rack was something like this. I missed 3I H(UM)AN and 3I H(UM)ANE(R).

#note I figured that I wanted to block one spot at least, and that this would yield positive results a lot of the time. It gives back a lot, but Wes then has to decide if he is going to still go for a bingo, or just take the points with two in the bag. He also might miss AQUA, that is a slight possibility. And he is likely to drain a lot of time deciding what to do. That's why I did this. It seemed it would be good for spread most of the time. J9 PAWL is the gutsy play here, and seems to do best. Although Wes can bingo, he is quite unlikely to, and I will give him no more chances to do so.

#note -8 to J9 PALP, setting up W(ID)eN at 14B for 20.
>Wes_Eddings: EORSTU I10 SOUR +16 382
#note Worked out for me to play PAWN, as this is 13 points off I3 T(I)RES or T(I)ROS. Wes was out of time.
