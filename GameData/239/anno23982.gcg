#note Embarrassing.  IMIGO*.  Best plays were exchanges.

#note front hooks, anyone?   Equally embarrassing.

#note NONCOM just not one I knew.    MON comes close though for value.

#note Saw NEARISH, never thought of the front hook spot.   SHERWANI I'm guessing is new, just don't have those in hand yet.

#note VEX rates okay from Speedy, but bottoms out on sim.   I overvalued saving the X for fourther spread mitigation later.

#note FISH 12 L Q says gives me 7% chance to win versus 4% for my play.  not sure why.   Suppose it could be on some chance of getting a particular tws nine-letter bingo in column O...

#note Joe jumped out to such an early lead, it's hard to give this MUCH credibility.  But in a vacuum, I think better plays from me plus me getting that last blank and maybe Z-sticking him instead of him bingo-ing and maybe I could've actually won this.
