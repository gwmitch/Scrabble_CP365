#note There were so many I's left, I had to maximize my score and leave, it seemed I was in a rut if I couldn't bingo. In that sense I might have wanted to play TOYI(N)G, but I didn't want to score so few and set up a scoring spot. But this also sets up huge spots... I should have considered TOYING more.

#note AX was OK I guess, but it sucked for me. I just needed to find and play NATANTLY. Tough miss for 78. I also missed NATAL for 27 somehow. Wow. This was absolutely horrid.

#note With an E I can pull INTEGRAL and EGLATERE, both of which I missed whilst debating if I should drop my J at 4H. That is probably worth it, and there might be more that I can hit that I wouldn't immediately see. Is JAGR(A) for less a good play? I didn't want to block the 2x2 for myself. J(O) is probably the play, but this is OK as an alternative.

#note Here's where misscoring Steve screwed my whole thinking process. I thought he had 312, so I made this desperate-ish play to set up a hard-to-access line for myself. Dropping the P at L13 makes sense, if there weren't SS to score and block my lane next turn. 4G (U)P(O) makes sense in that case, as I can draw into a lot of stuff at 13A. Quackle likes 6D TIPS for some reason. That won't work. Scored as 20
>Steve_Tier: EOW 15H WOE +24 306
#note he had to have an O :(
>Choke_Artist: ?ABEHRS 6A BREAtHS +79 306
#note This was a great draw, but he blocked my best lane. I still think I'm down over 100 here, so isntead of taking the points, I decided to play here to leave the board more prone to a comeback. I thought I had needed to bingo twice. I blewit, twice!

#note The last tile I turned over was the I, which was just crushing. I have no wins. E2 TENU(t)I is better, and might win the game if he messes up.
