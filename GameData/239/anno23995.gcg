#note I know for a fact CAWINGS# is good, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't. Let's see if we can use that to my advantage

>Amalan_Iyengar: DEOORSZ 6D ZOO +20 224
#note DOOZERS.. Also whiffed on the l6 ADZ spot, and that OOP is a word. I chose against (A)ZO because I know I can score there with CAWINGS#

#note Missed (A)NIs and IoN because of time pressure. Originally, he was up by 2 after this. He recounted on his time, and realizes that ENTAsES is 78. Therefore, we are tied. He decides to challenge for spread, so I win. Thanks Stefan Rau
