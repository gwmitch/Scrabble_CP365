>Joshua_Sokol: ADGISUW 15A WADIS +41 168
#note Perhaps 13A WUD to be aggressive, or WAG(E)D, keeping the S. GUIDS is probably better than WADIS as UG combo is awful
>Joel_Horn: ?CERRTV H7 C.VoRTER +63 180
#note Keeping the S would have really helped here!
>Joshua_Sokol: EFGIMOU G13 FOU +21 189
#note ugh

>Joshua_Sokol: EEGIIMO -GIIOE +0 189
#note Impatient here. Dunno, this may be fine. Probably play 5C GEO(d)E though
>Joel_Horn: AENT J12 NEAT +26 227
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIIMOU 1A .UOMI +11 200
#note ouch. O(d)IUM with the same tiles, or just 14A AMI

#note -16 to the bizarred B10 NA(N), setting up my G and leave him to blow his or let me have 37
>Joel_Horn: EGIIOS M8 GIES +17 420
>Joshua_Sokol: AINN D9 IN +19 332
>Joel_Horn: IO -  +0 420
#note we didn't record Joel's last play for some reason. I guess he passed, challenged, or something, because I recorded getting 4 from his rack. Maybe he challenged UNBE!
>Joshua_Sokol: AN 8M .AN +12 344
>Joshua_Sokol:  (IO) +4 348
#note In any sense, Joel seemingly lost 25 points in this bizarre endgame.
