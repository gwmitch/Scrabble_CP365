#note I missed my 8s through the Y. One of them played prior to his play and another plays because of his play. I was too busy scratching my head wondering if there could really be no bingo with LOUTERS*!!! Wally does not recognize this word, freshly added to the dictionary, and challenges.
>Wallace_Schultz: EFGMNNS -  +0 34
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHLOSZ 6A OH +26 109
#note I don't remember what I remember Wally having here, but he played a 4 at I5 starting in W and then rethought his decision, ultimately playing CAW. I think given what I knew he had I opted not to open the triple with the Z. Even so, I could play C3 SL(E)AZO for 50.

#note This time I might want to play D1 ZEALS. This seemed better to secure the win. Scored as 77

#note pretty sure I had bingos here, but instead decided to prevent the top right from being accessed easily?
>Wallace_Schultz: IIII -IIII +0 90
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DENRTU 12C UN....TED +28 267
#note being super defensive and fancy here. Thought UNKNOT was new and that that would get Wallace to challenge as he did OESTRUAL.

#note missing a bunch of racks here.

#note not worried at all about him bingo-ing. I feel like I will keep him under 300!
>Wallace_Schultz: AEHNRST M8 THENARS +89 291
#note oh, oops, guess that's a word. But wait, the Q is unfortunately Wallace's last draw in this awful game for him, so I get a free challenge... Wasn't 100% on MOVABLES.
