>Joshua_Sokol: AILMNTZ H8 NIZAM +38 38
#note This game was a determining factor in my performance for the rest of the tournament. 
>Marlon_Hill: IPY G7 YIP +24 24
>Joshua_Sokol: BILNOTV 11H .BVOLT +22 60
>Marlon_Hill: AGJ F6 JAG +36 60
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEINSY I10 A.YE +28 88
#note It was an interesting choice between A(B)Y and A(B)YE. I chose the safer option, as I didn't want to draw two vowels and have nowhere to score next turn. The downside was that ABYE gave me less for most bingos, as hooking NIZAM was no longer likely. This may have been a mistake.
>Marlon_Hill: ?DILRRS L7 DRIL.eRS +68 128
#note Marlon opts not to open the 3x3. ReDRI(L)LS looks a bit better.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADFGINS E7 FADING +36 124
#note I decided here that I wasn't sure enough of FADINGS that I would risk the game over it. I looked to be in decent shape after FADING keeping an S. Seemed to be anyone's game after FADING. This play set a precedent for me. I thought I might be confusing FADINGS with FARINGS*. You will see how blatantly obvious it was to me that I had messed up after this. 
>Marlon_Hill: AET H8 .....ATE +59 187
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDEEQS 14F QA. +32 156
#note It was tempting to take the 11 extra points here, but I needed to keep my S for AGINS. BDEES seemed better than BEES for bingos, so I opted to play QAT over QAD(I) 10B. Positionally, I didn't care to leave the bottom rows open. If Marlon tries to block other lanes, I can score myself back into the game.

>Marlon_Hill: HOT C12 HOT +31 240
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEOORS 13L .OE +13 197
#note Now I started to realize that FADINGS had to have been good. 
>Marlon_Hill: ?INRSTU O7 NUTRIaS +72 312
#note Marlon had too good of a rack to see a better bingo than this. Many 75-point options.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEOORRS D5 ROO +13 210
#note Sinking deeper and deeper, I was. This seemed like my best play: I can bingo in two spots, and I can open the board by playing over or under ROO in the future. And this was the most I could score while retaining a reasonable leave.
>Marlon_Hill: CHIOR M3 CHIRO +26 338

#note Time to get desperate.

#note wowee!
>Marlon_Hill: P 15A P. +12 410
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILLNO 3C EL.IN +18 343
#note Was unsure of LIENAL here, which scores the most at 3A. But the play has to be B8 LINO. I go out with the most stuff. I think I had no time left, though.
>Marlon_Hill: CDGMOSU 4L C.UG +24 434
>Joshua_Sokol: ILOX B6 XI +27 370
#note -2 to 15D (E)XIL(E)
>Marlon_Hill: DMOS 15G D.MOS +17 451
#note I even saw DEMOS, so I should have seen how to block it.

EDIT: I screwed a lot of this game up because I thought AGINS* was a word! My thought processes were flawed because of that factor as well!
