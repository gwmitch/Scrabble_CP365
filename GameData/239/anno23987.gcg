#note BIG MN5 sims best. Zyzzyva says there are 5 bingoes there (RUGELACH, CUDGELED, CUDGELER, LEDGERED, and GRUELLED), whereas there are no bingoes with the K. I do like BEG 12G better, since there are no O's or S's out
>Sharon_Sorensen: ADD 4K ADD +12 269
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?BEEGRT G12 BEG +14 373
#note Quackle really likes 3I BEG, to stop her from bingoing with big parallel plays, if she has both the E's. I missed that. BEG, however, does set up an almost-assured outplay for me
