#note seems like a decent-sized error here to not play off more consonants with FLOP or FLOG. Probably FLOG because of synergy. I had a tell that Karl didn't have an S with AHOY, but he may have one now, so JOG may backfire. JOGS might even be better than JOG. The S isn't too useful, and there are many places to bingo for Karl.  :/

#note Well, that's a huge swing! I had to hold this play out of sheer frustration. I can't even hit the huge spot he opened, and the game is almost at a tie. I can either open another big spot for myself while keeping relatively well, or I can fish somewhere, it seems. I noticed this play immediately, but thought nothing of it until I saw I couldn't really do much. It scores only 9, but it cuts Karl's average score by at least 12 points compared to plays that don't block the spot. Obviously that's not enough to account for the immediate 17-point sacrifice over 4E (F)RIZ, or the 22-point sacrifice over 11C ZITS or ZINS, but my play has a cool quirk to it. If I draw an A, I can hit (A)TRAZINS for 131, or TRIAZ(I)NS as a back up if somehow ATRAZINS is blocked and TRIAZINS is not. But I don't only hit with an A. I also saw that if I drew a P, I could play SPR(I)TZIN(G) 10C! This fact made this position a bit less unfortunate and a bit more fantastic! EXCEPT ATRAZINS* IS PHONY!!!!! IT'S ONLY TZARINAS!!! WOW!
>Karl_Higby: BDOTU D6 DOUBT +17 142
>Joshua_Sokol: IINRSTZ 10B ZI. +32 173
#note The trouble with this play on the other hand, was that my INRST wasn't going anywhere, so sacrificing a whole 24 points for defensive purposes at a tie was not really that great. Although there are many E's left, so I'm at around 40% to hit something next turn. I should have played D1 ZITI.
>Karl_Higby: AEGKW L3 GAWKE. +32 174
#note lost a lot of ground for being paranoid.
>Joshua_Sokol: CINRSTW M1 WRIT +22 195
#note Played this too fast. It's OK to set up my T with M2 WIN here, since it bingos most and only gives 6 more back compared to WRIT. Just much better for me and the game is too close to not take a calculated risk.

#note He played this against me in Lake George!! Gah!
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDEMOV 1K VO.ED +39 323
#note AVO(W)ED is better. Realized after I played that there were many vowels left. and this didn't give much more back, even though the X is a threat. I give 6 more back on average, but score 3 more myself, and AVOWED is 3 more than VOWED, but longer term it seems I win out. 
>Karl_Higby: AEEL J1 ALEE +19 293
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEIMNO 12D COMI. +22 345
#note I got super paranoid about bingos here, but there are still places he can go, and he can even fish for certain things. I shouldn't have worried about a bingo through a C and should have just scored. 14E AMI(N) looks the most balance.

#note With the game seemingly locked up, I fall victim to Karl's voodoo magic and challenge a word I would never have challenged, except that he just played PREAVOWED*. I felt so stupid...
>Karl_Higby: S 3B S. +2 340
#note Great play here, not obvious how to block
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIINRX D3 XI +40 420
#note He was going for PRENA(M)ES at O3 as well! SPIRE(M)ES also plays if I had a different rack. So technically I could have lost. I didn't consider everything before challenging REAVOWED. This came to me quickly and I jumped at it, but it's an endgame and I shouldn't have been so hasty. This is 20 points worse than 2A RA(V)INE
