#note very close between ALS and AILS
>Saint: EIORU 8H OURIE +12 12
>JD: AAIJLSY 9F JAY +19 19
#note apparently I suck at playing off the J correctly (see last game). should just take the 7 extra points. at least I correctly played JAY at 9F instead of 7F to keep the SOY hook available.
>Saint: GOR 10E GOR +19 31
>JD: AEFILSW 7E WAIF +20 39
#note underestimating the fishing strength of this rack. correct play is JOW keeping AEFILS. If I do draw the bingo, I often get to play JOWL/my bingo for a lot of points. tricky play. also maybe I should test saint by playing ALEWIFES*??
>Saint: ?ADDERS 11G SADDlER +69 100
#note oops, he saw SARDINED after
>JD: EIILMNS H11 .MINE +30 69
>Saint: HO 6F HO +28 128
#note nice defensive play choice
>JD: ILMRSTX L10 R.MIXT +32 101
#note could also just play XI, but I wanted to leave those bingo lanes open for now.
>Saint: ADET 14J TA.ED +30 158
>JD: KLLNSWY N10 WYN +29 130
#note he held for a second or two
>Saint: DEIOV O6 VIDEO +32 190
#note again, passing up points to keep the board closed.

#note umm...ahh...I missed AGLOW...and thought the phony had a good chance of staying...uhh...
>Saint: Q 13G Q. +42 264
>JD: ?ACENTU 3F ACUT.NcE +76 294
#note he just blocked UNCREATE. I liked this because it gives no bingos back and blocks all the lanes, and makes the top-left difficult to access. I blocked INCREATE actually.
>Saint: ACEEINT H1 AC.TE +24 288
>JD: ABHLPTU 13K H.P +29 323
#note Q likes PUB at 2D which keeps more useful letters for future turns. I'm not quite sure why quackle has me scoring 38 poitns a turn next turn after PUB...seems too high
>Saint: FI 2E IF +26 314
>JD: ABGLSTU 1A TUBAL +26 349
>Saint: ENO 2A ONE +16 330
#note saint said he was kind of stumped here. seems like he should try to find some way of leaving this open just so I have more to worry about
>JD: AGNRSTU I1 GU. +12 361
#note I'm up enough that I should be able to outrun him if he plays something and GLOWS. however, if I open the board he might bingo. my play sneakily gives me spare scoring options, like maybe STERNA at the bottom.
>Saint: BEEILSV 8A VIBES +42 372
#note his actual rack. fair try
>JD: AEINRST C8 .ARNIEST +72 433
#note gratuitous phony aside, I did decently here
