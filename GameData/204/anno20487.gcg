>Jim_Burlant: AGJNRSV H7 J.G +11 11
#note In case you're counting, this is the third time in 4 games my opening rack contained 6 consonants.  I considered this or exchanging JGV.  What made me play through?  If he doesn't have an S, JIG isn't airtight, but it does limit him to 7's starting in RA or DA instead of having an open run down the G column.  And J and G extensions aren't wide open either.  This tops a sim, but exchanging JV (or GJV) looks equally viable.  Depends on how close you think your opponent is to the bingo.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: O 7H .O +16 26
>Jim_Burlant: ANNORSV 10D NOVAS +28 39
#note Right idea, wrong execution. With Sam obviously close to something, I thought NOVAS would make it harder for him to bingo than SOVRAN 10H.  Q says SOVRAN was the play, and this is the silver medalist, winning 2.4% less often and simming a little more than 3 points down.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADQU 11B QUAD +36 62
>Jim_Burlant: ABENOOR 12D BARON +30 69
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Couldn't think of BEANO in the same location.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IP 12A PI +18 80
>Jim_Burlant: BEEOPTU A12 .OPE +24 93
#note Don't know if I agree with Quackle here.  Q wants me to play in the J column with TUBE , TOUPEE, or BUTE.  I'm still pretty sure at this point that he's got an S and I don't want to see him hit a 5 like SPARK, etc., for huge points.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEEGINU 13G EUGENIA +77 157
>Jim_Burlant: BEIRSTU N8 RUBIEST +89 182
#note Yes, the placement is dangerous.  But, this scores 89, and neither of the J column placements scores more than 77.  This is best, and it's 52% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADEL O5 DALE +21 178
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEEII J5 ICE +21 203
#note The only 8 in ths rack (which I never saw) is EPICEDIA, and it doesn't play.  I saw N6, and that spot drove me  crazy. One the one hand, something like TROOZ could ruin my day in a hurry.  And if I had so much as a 4 that scored even 15 - 18 points that reached from N2, I'd play it in a second.  Unfortunately, I don't have that.  As early as  this is and as close as this game is, it's too early to play defense with something like ICE M6 for 11. The sim agrees with me - it's either 14A PIECE (never saw it, as I didn't consider plays that burned all my E's), or this, which are indistinguishable from each other at the top of the sim. PIE 14A is also good, but again, that doesn't score enough and I want to keep the pressure on. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EFZ N4 FEZ +69 247
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEISTU K7 SAUTEI.g +75 278
#note The play I couldn't think of was AcUITIES 5E.  While he doesn't hit any huge plays on the row 5 2x2, this still factored into how the game played out.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: NVY 5I V.NY +20 267
>Jim_Burlant: DEENOTT 14A .OTTED +26 304
#note Not much to work with here.  This is best - 64% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: HLOW 15E HOWL +38 305
>Jim_Burlant: ENNORST M7 TON +11 315
#note The bingo doesn't play, and knowing Sam, this board isn't going to open up.  I was worried about the X, and I put this down to take away AX/OX/EX (I hadn't noticed 12L yet).  This doesn't even make the kibbitzer's original choices...but within a couple hundred iterations it percolates its way towards the top.  The sim likes this best; Championship Player says I should keep the T and play for 9 with ON M8.  Whatever, this game was soon going to become problematic.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IMR 4J RIM +32 337
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINRS K2 CA.. +6 321
#note No clue what to do.  I'm in a bind.  This is my second straight no-go, and the onus is now on me to open.  AIN K3 opens row 2, but that is so easy for him to defend that it doesn't help me.  Q likes J10 IN, presumably to block something like MIX.  I don't know what's right here and I don't think Q is of much help on this turn.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: GL 12M L.G +8 345
>Jim_Burlant: EEINRRS 2H SIN.ERER +74 395
#note Reluctant to put this down (WAX for 54 is his almost certain comeback), but really...do I have a choice?  Not on this board.  Q says it's 67% to win.  Unfortunately for me, my next rack ensures that I can't win this game.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?EKLOTY 1G YOK +42 387
#note Actual rack; he whiffed on TOYL(i)KE.  Adding insult to injury, he initially put down YO and was about to hit his clock when he thought about it and put down the K.  If he plays YO for cheap just to leave one in the bag, he loses.
>Jim_Burlant: AADHMWX O14 AX +29 424
#note I'm screwed.  This or 1L HAW are my best plays.  They both lose by 9 points.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?EILRT 3D fILTER +18 405
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha:  (ADHMW) +28 433
#note This one was an absolute killer to lose.
