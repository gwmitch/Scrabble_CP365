#note A simulation here would put my play and 5G P(R)IVY in a tight race for first. This is one of Quackle's main flaws. It assumes that a play from which I achieve higher equity on future turns is better. P(R)IVY will very likely have me playing at 4K next turn with something like MOUNT, putting the T at O4 and keeping a very balanced leave, by playing one of the N's I am leaving this turn. I do not like making plays like MOUNT, especially not against similarly rated players, so I would likely adjust to that and sacrifice equity, and therefore the assumption Quackle makes is wrong, and PRIVY does not do too well on future turns. MNN is really not something I want to keep here.

#note After a play like ROOFIE, I can assume that Ross usually has two more vowels, or at least one. I think that makes 6G L(A)MP a good play. If he has a C, which is quite unlikely, it's not a huge problem, and AELN is a much better leave than ELN. I also don't really want to open a 3x3 here. I think I had tunnel vision here, and I didn't consider L(A)MP or anything safer such as LEMAN 4J. This still might be the right play.

#note What a ridiculous draw
>Ross_Brown: WZ 15F W.Z +45 161
>Joshua_Sokol: CCEIOOR 11F C.OICE +26 204
#note This turn baffled me. I had no idea what to play. I saw COOCHIER* and was around 40% sure it was valid, so I couldn't play it. I saw CHOICE, a safe play that settles the left side of the board down, and I saw CICORE(E) 12A and CICOR(E)E 12B. The 12A play seemed like an aggressive play, and I wasn't sure if I should be aggressive at this stage of the game. After WIZ it seems aggressiveness is a good idea, cause Ross could have virtually anything. Unfortunately I missed some other good plays, such as C(H)OREIC and EC(H)OIC, which I didn't know at the time. I also didn't know CHOICER. But the best play of all is 2H COERCIO(N) for 78. I obviously missed that one, a hard find with CCEIOOR and a random N to end with. Still, unforgivable to miss a bingo at this stage!
>Ross_Brown: HIOST L8 HOIST +38 199
>Joshua_Sokol: NORSTTV 1L VOT. +11 215
#note knowing CHOICEST is huge here, as I don't need to score next to nothing and rather play M11 TORN for 25. I really hated playing this, too.
>Ross_Brown: AABLS 13I BALSA +29 228
>Joshua_Sokol: KNOORST 6F KO.N +20 235
#note Now anyone is a favorite to win this one. Not what I was thinking when laying down ENAMELER!

>Joshua_Sokol: ENRSTUU 4B UN..... +14 270
>Joshua_Sokol: ENRSTUU --  -14 256
#note Still seemingly unable to score at the level of my opponent, I decide that the best way to win here is to play a blatant phony, cause, you know, that's how I lose games all of the time. I decide the win is unreachable and make a huge blunder!
>Ross_Brown: DE 3F DE +16 300
>Joshua_Sokol: ENRSTUU 13E NU. +5 261
>Ross_Brown: AIRTU 9D TRU.. +6 306
#note I don't know what Ross' other choices were here, but I feel like he could have done better to block me and not open up a big scoring spot. Then again, I am most likely holding 5 one-pointers, so it doesn't seem like I can really profit from the opening. The real issue is that someone will likely score there in the next few plays, thereby opening up two bingo lanes. Ross is kind of asking for me to play at 8A, score 25-ish and get him worried about losing to a bingo but also losing without me having a bingo, since blocking that opening will usually not score a lot and get rid of the tiles Ross wants to get rid of.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIRSTU 12D AUR.I +22 283
#note Ross said in game that he wanted to play "something like this" but wasn't sure enough that CRU was valid! By "something like this" I assume he wanted to make the exact same move. In that case it would have been a far better play than TRUED.
>Ross_Brown: ADEILN 15J NAILED +30 336
#note And yet, due to my earlier blunders mostly, Ross is still very much in the driver's seat, having hit the less accessible and more worthwhile scoring spot on the board.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEFMST 8A FAME +33 316
#note Seems to be between FAME and FADE here. I thought that the 3 points were worth it. Apparently they may not be. I don't know, not a huge difference it would seem. The M goes better with the rest of the pool though, so this may be a minor error.
>Ross_Brown: EX 9A EX +23 359
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGJST 7B TAJES +48 364
#note My only chance is hope that I can win with a certain draw.
>Ross_Brown: GINRSTT 10A TITS +36 395
#note I can actually tie if I draw the S, unless he sees and knows CHOICEST! Otherwise, this is 3 points off of RIGS.
