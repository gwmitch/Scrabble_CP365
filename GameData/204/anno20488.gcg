>Jim_Burlant: ?AIRSYZ 8G SIZY +32 32
#note There are no bingos in this rack.  I normally wouldn't burn the S for only 6 more points than the next best play (IZAR), but I've got AR?, so the S is expendable.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Chris_Cree: AJKU 7E JAUK +25 25
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADNRST 6H STANDeR +68 100
#note  The 9B placement scores 67 but I didn't like slotting the A at 9D, which is why I chose this.  That said, the word I couldn't think of was sTRANDS, which would have been a smidgen better.
>Chris_Cree: TTUY E7 .UTTY +30 55
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEMOQU 10B QUO.A +36 136
#note Thought I might have missed something, but the only 8 these tiles make is SQUAMOSE, which doesn't play.  I also considered burning the blank for 64 with MOSQUE O4 for 64 but thought that might be shortchanging myself.  Q agrees - this or QUOTE in the same place is the play.  Either one is as good as the other.

>Jim_Burlant: ?BEEIIM 1L .IBE +21 157
#note Was looking for him to float a C or L for IMBECILE, and gave up on the rack afterwards.  Good thing I did - that's the only 8 in this combination of letters.  I didn't look very hard for much after that and slapped this down on autopilot.  This or 2J BIREME/BERIME are all equally strong plays in the sim.  91% to win.
>Chris_Cree: OX 2N OX +35 116
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEIMOT N4 fO.ETIME +65 222
#note Or TI(R)EsOME in the same location.  91% to win.
>Chris_Cree: CEO 8L CO.E +27 143
>Jim_Burlant: DEEGIOR O10 EDGIER +37 259
#note At this piont the strategy is simple:  turn the tiles as quickly as possible and hasten the end of the game.    I saw this, saw that it scored 37 and took out the triple, and that was that.  DOGIE O11 scores 27 and leaves a better ER, but that's a little too much to give up given the score snd stage of the game.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Chris_Cree: AGHMO 14J HOMAG. +40 183
>Jim_Burlant: AAAILNO 15G ALOIN +22 281
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Couldn't thik of LANAI or LIANA.  LIANA 15H is definitely best here, mainly for the extra 8 points.   While the AO leave is better than the AA leave with my choice, this pool only has one A left in it, so I'm not as worried about keeping dlupicated A's as I'd otherwise be.  
>Chris_Cree: EELV 11J LEVE.. +20 203
>Jim_Burlant: AAACEIN 13L AA +12 293
#note Board vision failure.  These tiles score 20 at 9I.  That said, 13H AECIA would have been a much better choice, both to score more points and turn 3 more tiles.  The only surprise to me is that this only concedes 1% winning chances and not even 1/2 pont of equity to AECIA. I need to keep the tiles turning and I'm not doing that.
>Chris_Cree: INOU B10 .UOIN +28 231
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEIIN A13 BIN +21 314
#note Trading points for defense.  The pure equity play is NIOBIC D8, but I didn't know the word.  And I wanted to prevent something like WOES for 46 at A12.  If you miss NIOBIC, this is the best of the rest.
>Chris_Cree: ENPRS C8 PR.NES +32 263
>Jim_Burlant: ACEFHIS 8A CA. +21 335
#note I'm not as worried about equity as Quackle is at this point.   The pool isn't particularly bingo prone and I'm less worried about his bingoing with an 8 than I am with his hitting cheap points at 8A.  With only 3 vowels in the pool, I didn't see this as opening any bingo threats.  Q wants me to play HAAF on row 3 for 20.  Maybe HIP if I'm going to play here.  But at this point the only thing I concede is equity, as everything wins over 98%.
>Chris_Cree: OW J8 .OW. +18 281
>Jim_Burlant: EFHISTW 3K H.W +18 353
#note AT least I get this one right.  
>Chris_Cree: LR H6 ...RL +9 290
>Jim_Burlant: DEFILST 12H FIST +24 377
#note At this point, I was waaaay down on time.  Q wants me to fish for the bingo that won't play.  I just figured I'd set up an out in 2. or attempt to.  Play incorrectly scored as 22.
>Chris_Cree: DEEFNRT 13F TREF +26 316
