#note A crapshoot as to what to do.  This?  Exchange EAU?  ELUATE?  I rejected ELUATE becasue it felt wrong to blow this rack up for 14 points.  While front and back hooks with EAU are limited, it does have numerous vowel placement issues.  If, for argument's sake, he's got HAM in his rack I'm trading 6 for 33 instead of 0 for 18.  This tops the sim, but if I had it to do again I might be more inclined to exchange AEU, as it will be easier to bingo with 1 word on the board instead of two.

>Jim_Burlant: ?EFNOQR -FQ +0 77
#note I saw the obvious 7I plays and didn't like them because they still saddled me with a Q that might hang around for a few turns; better to exchange now and hit for sure on the next turn rather than possibly be looking at that blank 5 turns later.  Quackle says exchanging was the right idea; that said, Q indicates I should have only thrown the Q in so I can bingo with the F at 7I on the next turn.  Exchanging the Q wins 69.7% and tops the sim.  8A FRO is runner up, winning 1/2% less often and simming 1/2 point down on exchanging the Q.  This is in the top 5, winning 2% less often than exchanging the Q, and it sims 5 poihnts down.  Suboptimal play?  Yes.  A blunder?  No.

#note I spent a long while looking for row 5 bingos and couldn't find BRONzERS.  SORNERS also eluded me; I never recognized it, which ruled out other decent options.  Whle this is only a 12-point dog in the sim, for this game this was probably a 70 or 80-point mistake and it cost me whatever chance I had at the game.  
>Siddarth_Murali: ?AEIINV O1 VINIfE.A +149 228
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: AELOTUW N5 OW. +28 166
#note Couldn't think of OWLET, which plays at H11 for 41.  That said, this is an equally strong play in Quackle's eyes, as it still scorse well and keeps more of the rack together.  Unfortunately for me, I wasn't going to get the help I needed from the tile gods.

>Jim_Burlant: AEELLTU H11 ELUTE +23 189
#note Best - opens lthe southern half of the board and unloads the U.  That said, it's getting bleaker by the turn:  7% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: AAEGLMR B1 GAMEL. +24 213
#note An annoying rack that looks like it has something but doesn't even make an 8 with any letter in the alphabet.  In this position I have a bunch of reasonable options but nothing truly spectacular.  13J MARGE scoers 29 and tops a sim but I need the bottom to stay open.  D4 GAM is nice but might leave me limited if he blocks with something like HI N2.  
>Siddarth_Murali: DHI C2 HID +30 320
>Jim_Burlant: ABDHINR K10 BAH +29 242
#note Not that I expected the northwest to stay open, but HAIRBAND would have been nice.  While ADHIBIT 14B scores 38 (I didn't know it), I don't need turnover here.  I need to score while I don't make it easy for him to shut things down.  But this is bleaker by the turn:  this or ADHIBIT top the sim, they barely win 2-1/2%.
>Siddarth_Murali: AIV 10B VAI. +22 342
>Jim_Burlant: DEIMNPR 13L DIP +26 268
#note While the game is probably not winnable by this point, an 80-point bingo will still do a good job closing spread, and I cant hit that if I block my bingo opportunatites.  This is simply me just trying to score poinits and keep things open.

#note Q likes A2 NAM since it is find of keeping the CK combo together.  Not that it would have mattered, mind you:
>Siddarth_Murali: AERZ A2 RAZE +59 420
#note And if I play NAM per the duck on the last turn, he has ZA for 63 this turn.  When it's not your game, it really isn't your game.

>Jim_Burlant: CDEIIOO N2 OI +10 338
#note I initially put down CODEIN on row 3 but realized that gave him a cheap 44-point QI, which ruled that out.  I thought I could at least salvage a Q stick and get some spread back that way.  Watch what happens:

>Jim_Burlant: CDEEIOQ J5 CO. +7 345
#note Got to at least *try* to see if I can play the Q, and it took him a whle to figure out how to block.
