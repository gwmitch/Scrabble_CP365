#note ooh, a blank!
>Morris_Greenberg: AEIRU 9B URAEI +22 62
>JD: AEEFOOY G2 AYE +23 100
#note I saw FORAY, which wins the sim by a point, but I felt that AYE forced Morris to make harder plays to come back in the game. I think I'm fine with my choice.
>Morris_Greenberg: ABCIR 2F B..IC +21 83
>JD: EEEFOOW F4 FOE +14 114
#note I am not shocked that COOEE wins a sim - I saw it, but I was too paranoid about opening a new bingo lane. In fact, FOE and COOEE both lead to him averaging a 10% bingo chance next turn with a random rack. this could be because I block the E on row 7 and C bingos on column J. I was trying to save some way to score next turn, hence not playing FEW now - they all sim close.
>Morris_Greenberg: AGNORSU -AGNORSU +0 83
>JD: AEEEOOW E5 WO +22 136
#note bad! must play COOEE or exchange. COOEE is perfectly fine here, especially against a completely random rack.
>Morris_Greenberg: EWY 7G Y.W +26 109
>JD: ABDEEEO 1C ODEA +11 147
#note again, no plays are any good, but ODEA is as not-bad as any.
>Morris_Greenberg: AORZ C9 .AZOR +28 137
>JD: BEEGNOT 11C .ONE +26 173
#note I was completely stumped on this move. the clock had already eaten up a fair portion of my time, and again I have no stellar options. nonetheless, this is not a great choice. some plays that sim well are BEGUN at B6 and BONG at B12, each of which score decently and leave more tractable tiles than my choice.
>Morris_Greenberg: M 10B M. +20 157
>JD: BEGKOTV -BGKOTV +0 173
#note this play was also a pain in the ass. this is not the kind of rack that normally indicates an exchange, given the lack of good tiles to keep. but I could find no play I liked that put tiles on the board. The only 3 that beat an exchange are VET at D3 and BOG/GOB at B12. But Morris's last play signals a powerful rack and all four esses remain, which makes me reluctant to open row 15. In the knowledge that Morris is likely close to bingoing, given the option of keeping BGOK or going hunting for good tiles in the bag, I like my exchange.
>Morris_Greenberg: DITU D1 .UIT +10 167
#note stay of execution
>JD: EPQRRST 3C Q. +22 195
#note I remember the Q being the final tile I drew out of the bag...fortunately I bingo frequently next turn with a vowel draw...
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ILRSTU 14A LUSTIeR +77 244
#note he has RUSTILY for 4 more which also makes it tougher for me to play on row 15.
>JD: EPRRSTT 12A TR.P +22 217
#note unfortunately I missed the vowel I needed, but still a good leave.
>Morris_Greenberg: AAADJMN -AAAD +0 244
>JD: AEGKRST A12 .A.K +24 241
#note I welcome the GK combo back to my rack. the pool is critically short of vowels, such that quackle recommends sacrificing 17-18 points to play KEG or just KI - my play sims a point or two worse...
>Morris_Greenberg: DEGIMNP 5H .MPEDING +78 322
#note noo
>JD: EGHRSTV K4 V.G +7 248
#note I really needed a bingo response on this turn. Amusingly, if I'd played KEG last turn then I would now have nowhere to play HARVEST. actually all I could've drawn given HV as next 2 tiles is VIRGATES for 60-some. my idea of playing VG at K4 was to make it harder for morris to make a play blocking the G, since I need a high-scoring bingo (and also leaving row 15).
>Morris_Greenberg: DEOTUV 15F DEVOUT +34 356
#note he also has VOGUED on this turn
>JD: EHNNRST M3 TH.NNERS +76 324
#note too little too late
>Morris_Greenberg: HILLS N10 HILLS +45 401
>JD: ACGILNO 8L O. +3 327
#note quackle says not to even bother fishing for a bingo, but surely I need to try something, right? the only way I can win is if morris makes a huge blunder, but the board is complex enough that it's not out of the realm of possibility. if I can fish an L somewhere I can go for ANAGOGIC, but he will just score too much with the J. I figured this blocked most of the obvious J plays and at least draws some bingos for morris to worry about.
>Morris_Greenberg: AABEEJT 12J JEBE. +28 429
#note correct play is TABLA at 12K to save JEE, but good enough!
>JD: ACGILNS O8 CLANS +48 375

#note out of time. big congrats to morris!
