#note 2nd game, racks on both sides. I will add detailed commentary for this one also. For Jim's version of this game, go to /20238.

#note Warning: I played this game much worse than the first one, though I won this and lost that! This was a pretty yucky turn for me. DAVENED is better than this to not provide a hook, but I forgot that DAVEN was a verb. Same thing with HAVENED, but I was only 90% sure of havened's validity and like 40% that it didn't take any hooks. I saw AVENGED, which scores 73, but I didn't realize it doubled the V! I would have played that for 3 extra knowing he doesn't have an X. Luckily, I get bailed out for not playing AVENGED.
>Jim: EEIIRTT D8 E.ITE +18 30
#note If I played AVENGED, Jim scores 82 instead of 18. I get rewarded for making a suboptimal play.
>Sid: AADIRRY 8A RAY.D +36 106
#note Not a fan of slotting an R that will only be blocked for a low score, but no othher options come close.
>Jim: IJLMORT H4 JOLT.. +22 52
>Sid: AIMRSTU J2 ATRIUMS +70 176
#note I like the way this shapes the board, but the immediate defense is pretty poor because of the N hook. STRIATUM is a safer alternative that I missed.
>Jim: EEIMNOR 1F MERINO +34 86
>Sid: BBGLOOO 2C GOBO +15 191
#note Spent 5+ minutes on this rack. This looks better than anything else besides BOOBO(O), which I didn't spot despite looking hard. Medium error here.

#note I played this in 2 seconds thinking it was super obvious, but didn't see COL(O)N(I)AL! This gives Jim fewer bingos next turn, but COLONIAL may be better regardless for board control of the top right of the board. This is because if I play CLUB, MERINO(S) is going to stick around forever, and even if I draw an S, hooking MERINO going downwards will provide Jim with new bingo lanes. However, if I play COLONIAL, drawing an S will allow me to hook COLONIALS going upward, permanently damaging the top right quadrant. And I also have more shots at drawing an S. I would consider this a smallish mistake in terms of board dynamics.

#note This doesn't even show up on static, but jumps right to the top of the sim! Go me :p Definitely prefer giving up points to not open.
>Jim: AEINRST L1 STAINER +76 202
>Sid: CEGHLLO 5E HO +25 277
#note Scoring is always important on a tight board, but CEGLL is so ugly here. (B)ELG(A) is the play that I looked and looked for but couldn't see. This is second, but still an error. The errors are adding up this game.
>Jim: EFINORZ 12A FIN. +24 226
>Sid: CEGLLNO A12 .LOG +24 301
#note Don't care about the sim here, I'm definitely slotting the G instead of the C.

#note After the game, we both concluded that this was a bad play, and Jim points out in his version of the anno that LINTED for 33 is the play for placement. However, upon review, this isn't really the case. I actually did see LINTED, but I wasn't sure and I wasn't going to risk it because of ZA/AX being available anyways. But the truth is that LINTED doesn't have to be the sole solution. Quackle says that CITED, LINTED, TILED, and a plethora of other plays all result in a similar average score for Jim. (~36-38 ppt). This is probably because Jim is likely to have at least one A for AX. Therefore, I'm in similar shape no matter what I play. My verdict is that LINTED is the correct play, not because it avoids vowel placement issues, but because it digs deep for the final S to respond to a potential ZA/AX play. Letting XI play isn't actually a big deal. Medium error here.
>Jim: IIOPRVX 10J XI +52 314
#note Since Jim had this particular rack, I think we were both biased towards LINTED for the wrong reasons.
>Sid: ALNSUUY N1 YULANS +30 366
#note UNLAYS here. But right idea
>Jim: ?IOOPRV O1 OP +31 345
#note As Jim pointed out in his version, a V fish is correct here.
>Sid: AEIRTUW 14A .UTWEAR +24 390
>Jim: ?DIORV 4D VaR +21 366
>Sid: I 3L .I. +6 396
#note I made several smallish & medium mistakes that added up this game. In my defense, this game was harder to perfect than the first game against Jim, but it doesn't change the fact that I made mistakes. Nice to have a win though.
