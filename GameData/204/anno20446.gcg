>Matthew_Larocque: ?CCLNOO 8D COLONiC +76 76
#note Worth playing for 72 at 8C? Sim says no.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ABG F7 B.AG +11 11
#note Erm, this isn't a word, but he could have scored 24 with GAB.
>Matthew_Larocque: DIINPTV D4 VINI. +20 96
>Siri_Tillekeratne: KT 5C K.T +14 25
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIIJPT J2 JADITI. +35 131
#note I'm making good use of the cees this game. Held but no challenge.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BT 5I B.T +10 35
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIPRTZ 3H TR.IPZED +92 223
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIPRTZ --  -92 131
#note I thought this might be phony; I even saw PRIZED or ZAIRE for 48. ZI(N) for 38 would be good too, but probably better to block BIT hooks and score more points. Siri felt like he would be giving the game away by not challenging this.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?ADEGRT 3H GR.DuATE +70 105
#note Lucky for me, Siri picked the worst bingo, giving me PR(E)Z for 75. He had forgotten about BITT, and missed the other bingos that did not give me the huge play.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIPRTZ O1 PR.Z +75 206
>Siri_Tillekeratne: OWY G7 Y.W +37 142
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEINTW M3 .NTIWEED +67 273
#note This was also a guess, but this time I was correct.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ARU -  +0 142
>Matthew_Larocque: ELLLRTU 8L T.LL +15 288
#note Surely I have to do this, get real Quackle.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ARU H1 RU.A +18 160
>Matthew_Larocque: EELNRSU 10D LU.E +15 303
#note Whoops, but at least it was only a 59 point bingo I missed. Still, this is a word I'm capable of seeing.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AEEINRS L8 .RAINEES +73 233
>Matthew_Larocque: EEENORS 15L .ONE +12 315
#note 59 points becomes a bigger deal when you only score 12 next turn. Once again Quackle doesn't seem to see the S as a threat - Siri doesn't need an easy chance to catch up to me.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EOV D10 .OVE +14 247
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHMRRS M13 MH. +29 344
#note Wasn't sure about HERM, and I didn't know REHEMS which plays for 51. The doubled R leave hurts this play, and K10 HM sims better. I figured MH(O) was better to block stuff, although it leaves a potential overlap at K11.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AIO 6H IO.A +10 257
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIRRS 14B GERRIES +78 422
#note I could have sworn I saw this word on another board, guess they got away with the phony too.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IOOOU -IOOOU +0 257
>Matthew_Larocque: FHNOOSY 15G FOY +38 460
#note I got lucky to have drawn the Os here, allowing me to keep hitting big scores. I played here first, keeping HONS for the other TWS.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: QU 10J QU.. +34 291
>Matthew_Larocque: HNOOS 15A OOHS +42 502
#note Missed rack, might have had the X but I needed an E for (K)EX.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: FP 11C F.P +24 315
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIMNX C5 .EX +41 543
#note Playing ANIM(I) now sets up AXE to go out, netting me 4 extra points assuming he makes the same play.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ADESU N8 .ES +25 340
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIMN 11H ANIM. +33 576
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ADU O6 AU.D +10 350
#note His only out.
>Siri_Tillekeratne:  (A) +2 352
#note Current best in a tournament - I need better word knowledge to get to 600.
