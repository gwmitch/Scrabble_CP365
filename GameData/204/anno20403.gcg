#note aggro Josh should have played OUT(L)IE at 14J. 
>Joshua_Castellano: AEENRSW 13A WEANERS +88 186
#note I actually could not remember that this was a word, so I held and released. Joe Edley then spoke from one game over: "Well, at least I can say that at this tournament, someone held WEANERS!"... Needless to say, Castellano was surprised that this pun came out of the mouth of a man he idolizes!

#note It's great to have someone challenge normal words. Usually I'm the one that does that.

#note That last comment is very apropos to this turn.

#note "You'd better block REJIGG(E)R!", I said jokingly. Little did I know REJIGGER is a normal word and it is valid in Scrabble.

#note 1A plays like GRAAL, ARGAL and CRAAL are better, although I was quite afraid of the Z. ZO(W)IE seems much less likely than plays at K1 such as AZOTE, but I need to start blocking those.
>Joshua_Castellano: IZ D2 .IZ +28 338
#note relieved to see this come down. It means I blocked a huge 48 points at 13A. I think Josh needs to keep his Z and try for a huge score at K1 or maybe A1.

#note Oh, earlier I should have fished for m(A)G(N)IF(I)CAL at 11A. I did spend a lot of time looking for crazy 9s and 10s that either I or my opponent could have. A7 C(O)RIA seems right in retrospect. No reason to leave that line open. But this should outrun anything anyway? Maybe not. I think CORIA is right. Don't believe I saw it.

#note I knew 99.9% that IMMINENTS* and ESPECIALS* were phony. I wanted to outrun all bingos on lane A he could possibly have. Quackle wants me to play F2 (T)OP. That does not make any sense. Scored as 30.
