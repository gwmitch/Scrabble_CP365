>Randi: ACEIKNT -K +0 0
#note Didn't know ANTICK (or CATKIN for that matter). Don't know that I would have gone with them if I had known them. Would, however, have played KI if I had thought of it.
>kit: BEEGR 8D GREBE +20 20
>Randi: ACEINTY E8 .ACY +18 18
#note Didn't think of TAC(R)INE - I oft have issues seeing non-bingo double doubles. That being said, I don't think I would have played if I had thought of it. I like the fishier plays a lot better - (B)Y and Y(E) in particular (They, along with AY, are simming above my play). I played (R)ACY to play off the Y, to block the double double (though I don't know why I was worried about that because I had a good rack) and to ditch the Y. 
>kit: DIM D11 MID +19 39
>Randi: EINRSTT 14B STINTER +75 93
#note Don't know why I didn't play STERNIT(E). I wrote it down. Its obviously better. Though (spoiler alert!), she challenges STINTER, so it's okay. 
>kit: EIOOORU -  +0 39
>Randi: BDENNOT 15G DEBT +30 123
#note Okay fine so I didn't know BONNETED. Hmph. Apparently I didn't know TENDON or BO(R)N either? 
>kit: FGI 13G FIG +27 66
>Randi: AINNPST 7F PAN +17 140
#note Woo. Q wants me to be fishier and play F8 (E)N instead or F7 N(E) instead... what do you think? They score roughly no points, but do keep a better leave.
>kit: IIIIUUU -IIIIU +0 66
>Randi: IINPSTU C12 PI. +20 160
#note This is simming the best by 5 points, but 14J INPUT is also simming fairly well. Thoughts? I knew I was keeping the U, but the rack was balanced and the U goes well with what I had, I thought. 
>kit: ADEINOR 12I ANEROID +73 139
>Randi: EINSTUU O5 UNSUITE. +77 237
#note Oh no I got another U. Oh wait a second...
>kit: GLU D6 LU. +4 143
#note This appears to be the second play that she has over-counted that I missed. I should probably start recounting my oppnents' plays. 
>Randi: EHJMORT 11I HEM +33 270
#note Okay so I found the spot but forgot the words HOME and THEM? HER(I)OT is definitely sexier than this (HERIOT is simming at the top and HOME is number 2. THEM is #4, after 15A JO). 
Good thing I was 95% or better to win by this point, I guess. 
>kit: ?AAEIOR 6H AERAtIO. +64 207
>Randi: AJOOQRT K5 Q.T +24 294
#note Didn't really consider JO at this point. It is simming above my play... wanted to get rid of the Q, but I guess since I could have played JO and kept QAT I shouldn't have worried about it?
>kit: DLLO 5E DOLL +14 221
>Randi: AGJOORW 4D JOW +34 328
#note Hey give me a hot spot, two tiles to get rid of, and a vowel that goes between them and I'll find the best play!
>kit: ELOV 6B VO.E +19 240
>Randi: AAGIORT L3 GAI. +19 347
#note Ughh fine I'll miss the bingo if you insist. Though at least this wasn't a totally obvious line? Except I clearly found the spot. Drat.
>kit: HNO 15A NOH +29 269
>Randi: AEOORTW M3 OW +21 368
#note WEAR is way better, for sure, as is WOOE(R)... and as are all of the plays that triple the W in multiple directions. Did I just forget to look in that box?
>kit: ELX 13K LEX +45 314
#note Oh hey remember when I played WEAR last turn and took this out? Ohh right...
>Randi: ACENORT 14L TORC +25 393
#note Well this time I played in the right spot, but I still missed the right plays.
>kit: ?IKRSVZ M2 V.. +9 323
>Randi: AEFIKNS 1L KAIF +58 451
#note Woo! Once again, give me a really obvious hot spot and some high point tiles and I have a semi-decent shot of findking the right play :)
>kit: AZ K2 ZA +15 338
>Randi: EENRS 9H SNEER +11 462
#note Give me an obvious outplay that starts with an S and I might find it too. Maybe. :)
