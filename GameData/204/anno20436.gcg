#note E11 AWN and 9H NAW are simming best but i wanted to be a little more defensive.. AWN is preferred by 4 pts.

#note what do you guys do there? I think H13 PAM may actually be the right move, but this simmed so close. I bingo a lot of the time next turn, but he can also play much more defensively.

#note M4 TONGERs blocks almost everything and may be the right thing for him to do after my move.
