#note (P)USLEY in the same spot to set up my S.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: EX K5 EX +31 71
>Charles_Reinke: AGIOSST 13K .OGI +16 68
#note AGIOSST is seemingly a good rack, but it bears no fruit on this board, and actually only makes two bingos. Setting up my S is reasonable; setting up one of five N's that I don't have is not. (Y)OGA is better.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: AEMNORT 9B TONEARM +65 136
>Charles_Reinke: ANSSSTU O11 AUNTS +27 95
#note N8 SUSTA(I)NS. That would have helped.

#note Peter had NARDINE on his rack.

#note Exchange? A10 GL(A)RED? This? I would rather that Peter not score thirty points somewhere near H1.

>Peter_Schmiedicke: AEIINRS H2 .I +5 281
#note Again, Peter's real rack.
>Charles_Reinke: CCDHLRW E1 W.RLD +18 280
#note Peter would only fish the I if he was extremely close to a bingo. I had him for an AEIRST, AEINST, or AEINRS leave. Blocking row 4 is the obvious choice.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: AEILNRS N2 ALINERS +75 356
#note Underscored by two.
>Charles_Reinke: CCEGHIK O8 HI +30 310
#note I don't see any two-tile play that would let me bingo even if I drew both blanks. If I could play off KH, CG, or CC, I could bingo through the L at E4 assuming Peter didn't block.

I saw 4A CHIC(L)E, but wasn't totally sure on the word.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: ??AIOOT 6A IOTAs +15 371

#note Final: 386-334. Peter wins his first-ever NASPA tournament and receives a shiny 2000+ rating in reward!
