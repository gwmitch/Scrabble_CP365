>Andrew_Fisher: ?DDETTV 8G DEV +14 14
#note Exch DTV is slightly ahead on a sim. I liked that either the E or hooks to DEV would virtually always be available
>Naween_Fernando: ADMW J6 DWAM +22 22
>Andrew_Fisher: ?CDQRTT -CDQT +0 14
#note Again marginal, but Quackle seems to prefer keeping CR? or CRT?
>Naween_Fernando: ABEINRS 6F BRAN.IES +67 89
>Andrew_Fisher: ?ANRSTT 10D RaTTANS +73 87
>Naween_Fernando: EJLY L4 JE.LY +38 127
>Andrew_Fisher: EOOQTUW D8 TO.QUE +32 119
#note Cunning - WO/JO nets just 19, but sets up a probable QUOTE/TWO for 74, hence advances in the sim
>Naween_Fernando: CEEIRU M8 ECURIE +27 154
>Andrew_Fisher: FILOSTW M3 WOF. +34 153
#note Better than WAIT/QI despite sacrificing 7 points
>Naween_Fernando: EHIMORZ C2 RHIZOME +100 254
>Andrew_Fisher: AEFILST B8 FETIALS +80 233
#note Many choices here, and being about a 25% shot to win at this stage I decided to inhibit the easy scoring B-column while leaving several bingo lanes open. SEALIFT/TORQUES also scores 80 but kills the lower part of the board
>Naween_Fernando: EIPR E7 PER.I +43 297
>Andrew_Fisher: ?DDGNOP 12H PlODD.NG +84 317
#note Lucky pickup, and it does seem that colonising this lane is preferable (rather than PRODDING 2B)
>Naween_Fernando: BGHU 2B B.UGH +38 335
>Andrew_Fisher: AAEGLLO 5A GA.AL +30 347
#note Tossed up GAZAL and GENAL/UG for 31, picking the former because of the E retention. Quackle also suggests GAOL N1 - reckoning that the L hook to JOL could prove remunerative - but GAZAL also restricts the plays parallel to RHIZOME
>Naween_Fernando: AEINOOR 1F ONIE +17 352
>Andrew_Fisher: ELNOOTY O7 ENOLO.Y +33 380
#note Interesting...BOOAY at B2 scores 38, but leaves seven in the bag which gives Naween much more flexibility in the endgame. On the other hand it also prevents good plays with the K or X in that area, and keeps a pleasant ELNT. I preferred to inhibit the G, leaving just four in the bag which meant Naween would usually be restricted to a three-tile play while trying to catch up
>Naween_Fernando: K 5K K.. +32 384
>Andrew_Fisher: AAIIOST 11K AI. +15 395
#note Eliminating duplicates and leaving one unseen looks good here, though Quackle seems to prefer emptying the bag with AIA A13. I think that's unwise as it gives Naween a chance to plot the endgame from only 9 in arrears.
>Naween_Fernando: ERX H12 .REX +39 423
>Andrew_Fisher: AAIOSTV 14J OVIST +29 424
#note Overlooked a play netting four more points here - SOVIET/TORQUES. Every point counts in this endgame! But I reckoned that Naween could not play out so was feeling confident
>Naween_Fernando: CINTU 13A C.I.NT +16 439
#note Naween did see the best play, TUINA D1, but knew it would lose by 1. He hoped I would overlook the 17-point play that his choice created.
