>Matthew: ?AEUWYY H4 YAWEY +36 36
#note I included my racks too, in addition to Matthew's.
>Avery: ABGIJNR G3 JAB +29 29
>Matthew: ?AABEIU -AABEIU +0 36
#note Assuming this is his rack, I still would have done BAA.
>Avery: EGHINOR G7 HONG +27 56
#note Figured I could go for the I hook here.
>Matthew: ?AGNOUU 10G .AUN +7 43
#note Matthew: GUANO F8 - solid. My play - booBOOO!
>Avery: EEGINQR I9 Q.IRE +25 81
#note QUINCE, maybe?
>Matthew: ?EGIOOU 12I .OUE +8 51
#note Matthew: E(R)UGO 12H


Avery: 12D GOOIER also an option
>Avery: ACDEGNS F4 CAD +23 104
#note I forgot QUIRE took a D.
>Matthew: ?EEGIOO 11F OI +11 62
#note Matthew: OG(E)E for 8, really? I know I've burned through a lot of vowels already, but not saving my only consonant and scoring a mite more seemed better

Avery: I like GEOID. Opens the board and keeps a decent leave. This kills a lane and blocks him in more.
>Avery: AEEGLNS K11 L.GE +10 114
#note this sucks
>Matthew: ?EEEGOR 6H .OE +8 70
#note Matthew: EGER 15H

Avery: OGEE 12C if you don't see that
>Avery: AEEILNS 7G ..EL +13 127
#note Is a 60 point bingo worth it, opening a triple triple lane when he's likely sitting on a blank?
>Matthew: ?BEEGOR E5 BE +27 97
#note Matthew: My play sims in the middle of several possibilities from E5. I was still in favor of saving consonants.

Avery: I think the former is a better strategy than saving consonants, since a lot of the vowels are gone.
>Avery: AEIINOS J6 ..OI. +16 143
>Matthew: ?EGLOPR D6 PERGOLa +76 173
#note Matthew: Hadn't known GOsPEL(E)r. Hadn't been sure of LUGER. Flat out missed PLEdGOR.

Avery: and PROLEGs
>Avery: AEIMNRS M7 REMAINS +81 224
#note I tunnel visioned into ROUEN. Costly mistake.
>Matthew: DEFHKNP 8L K.EP +45 218
#note KEEF
>Avery: AEFISTV 10L F.VA +18 242
#note With an S, I think this is correct.
>Matthew: ADEFHLN 15H HANDLE +40 258
#note Matthew: Same word at 14G simmed much better, I guess HANDLERS was too big a possible fire back
>Avery: EIORSTV 13G VO. +10 252
>Matthew: ADFIOST C3 FIDO +23 281
#note Matthew: DOAT C7 My play is just too volatile I guess

Avery: My suggestion of FIORD post game is the top static play. I don't like this.
>Avery: EINRSTU B2 NITER +34 286
#note Wasn't sure of TOPED, and as much as I know I'm capable of it, I will not find B1 UNITERS. This play isn't too far off, but still. 
>Matthew: AAINRST A6 TSARINA +83 364
#note I held this for about 10 minutes. I know what a trope is, but I didn't know if it could be a verb. With a blank unseen, I figured I had a decent chance at catching up if I played on the K column. But that's far fetched, since I didn't notice ZITI. I should have challenged.
>Avery: MSTTUWX K2 MUTTS +21 307
#note UNITER hook
>Matthew: ?CDITTZ L1 ZITi +52 416
#note Matthew: AZoTIC O10, though even my subpar play was 100% to win
>Avery: IRSUWX A1 XU +29 336
#note -4
>Matthew: CDT 15H ......D +12 428
#note blocking HANDLERS
>Avery: IRSW B12 WIS +17 353
#note Ooh, find my out here! - was low on time, so I played this
>Matthew: CT O10 .CT +6 434
