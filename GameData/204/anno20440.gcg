>Joshua_Sokol: ADINNOR H2 ANDIRON +70 70
#note I have an abysmal record against this man. It felt like it was time to beat him. We were randomly paired for game 1! So without further ado, I told Matthew that I was going to beat him. I wrote down that I won on my sheet, and told him not to worry, that I was only going to score in the 400s. His backtalk was that he was going to phony me. Game on!
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEGSTU 5E AUG.TES +32 32
>Joshua_Sokol: HILMOUV 6J HILUM +39 109
#note After this play, I wrote "CHALLENGE HILUMS*!" on my sheet just so I wouldn't let him get away with adding that S. Matthew always has around 12 tricks up his sleeve, so I didn't want to take any chances. It was still clear to me that my pregame cockiness managed to rattle him a bit.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: OO I3 OO. +10 42
#note I think he said his leave was AEITT or something crazy. Maybe it wasn't that bad.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIILOV 8C OLIVI.E +11 120
#note in any case he blocked a nice play of mine. I felt forced to play it for 11 instead of 24, but it was OK with me, since it blocked a whole lot of stuff, and kind of forced his 7s to be played for very few at I9 if at all. Is there anything to be discussed about this move? Is N6 (M)OVIE a thing some of you would do?
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEIRTT L6 .ITERATE +68 110
#note For some reason, when he played this, I didn't see LATERITE/LITERATE, a pair I am very familiar with. I knew this was a word, obviously, but for some reason its anagram didn't click. It didn't really matter though.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEERSVY 4A VEERY +35 155
#note What did matter is missing (O)VEREASY, to deliver a large blow.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACEOT A3 A.OCET +33 143
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAJSTX M11 TAXA +44 199
#note I played this over TAX in the same spot because I didn't want TAXI to be played later in the game to fork the board. I also knew this didn't take any hooks, and that he might try TAXAL* or TAXAS* later.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EKOS K10 OKES +45 188
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIJMOS 7C JAM +43 242
#note I missed G7 J(I)AO here, which is a decent candidate as well. Though I liked how many lanes this took out.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEE 9B DEE +19 207
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ILOQSU 2H .LIQUOtS +90 332
#note I was really scared Matthew was going to bingo in this spot last turn. Whew!
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BCDEIRS 10C SCRIBED +81 288
#note I don't know if he missed I7 D(E)SCRIBE here, but this seems better anyway. I was very surprised he managed to bingo here and was still in the game. What a formidable opponent!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?FNNORU 3C FOR +30 362
#note It seemed correct here to just score as much as possible so as to try and run away with the game.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: PW 7G P.W +31 319
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADLNNU 13I UN... +13 375
#note It seemed like I was in a very good position to set up a potential lane here. Even if Matthew hits a bingo I am in good shape to win, and with the pool I was looking at, he is extremely unlikely to.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: PW 9K P.W +23 342
#note How we both scored this as 31, I really have no idea, but, scored as 31. Seemed like we both tripled the P...
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADFILN L1 F.ND +24 399
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: NR 14L R.N +15 357
#note And here is where seeing LITERATE/LATERITE would have been extremely useful! Matthew makes his move! It was so ridiculous at the time that I couldn't help but laugh in game... I couldn't contain myself here, and I couldn't regain control. I held, started laughing, and said "you're awesome". But I didn't alphabetize AEELIRTT to see LITERATE and LATERITE, and remember A(LITERATE) and E(LATERITE), and the fact that they both take S's. Very basic knowledge that I would normally have. But alas, I figured out that I would win if I let it go. 

Before Matthew played this, I was trying to find bingos with my rack. I saw WAGTAIL and wasn't sure of it, so I decided I wouldn't play it if he left me a spot for it. Very early on I saw OTALGIA, and saw it didn't play. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAGILT O12 GAIT +25 424
#note and yet I managed to forget all about OTALGIA and the fact that it played now. But wait, that's not the funniest part of this whole thing. 
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEGHINY I12 H.N +6 363
#note The funniest thing is that I made what seems to be the 3rd best play, GAIT, after WAGTAIL and OTALGIA. I saw that I would win handily with a Z draw. And I drew the Z, even though Matthew's play of RAN made me fear ZEIN/RANI the most out of anything else. I drew the Z, and that is the only draw I could have made that makes GAIT a better play than OTALGIA or WAGTAIL. If I had played a bingo, I would have won by less, since I would have been stuck with the Z. THAT, indeed, is the funniest part about this comedic pre-endgame.

In other news Matthew missed my out.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ALZ G10 .LAZe +25 449
#note He also missed the superior out he was giving me. But since I also missed it, let's just say it didn't exist. (This isn't the first time AZLON is going to appear this tournament!)
>Joshua_Sokol:  (BEIGY) +22 471
#note The final score was recorded as 471-371. I indeed beat Matthew and scored in the 400s like I predicted before the game, and Matthew indeed phonied me. True story, I swear. Not like Matthew's fake annos against Nigel! :P
