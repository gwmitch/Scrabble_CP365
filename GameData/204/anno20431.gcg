#note HELP!   Why iis SODA in same area for a point less trumping my play?  (5 plies, 1000+ iterations)

#note HELP!    At 5 plies and 1000+ iterations, BUR B13 is simming best.   Far fewer points than ZITI, duplicate I-leave... how?

#note HELP!   DUFF F12 is simming best here.  If it's because the U is so terrible for the leave, ok.  But for 9 fewer points?

(Im even dreaming of an ER draw for BURROWE(R) on row B.)

#note HELP!    Is DOW the play here strictly because I have the case S?  An N unseen to me is what makes me wonder.
>Mike_Johnson: LL L12 ..LL +8 342
>Matthew_Ridout: BOORSWY 15K B.OWY +39 365
#note HELP!   DOW from F12 simming best yet again.   A round later, the N is that much more likely to be in his rack.  Taking the extra -24- points with a fine ORS leave seemed a no-brainer to me.

>Matthew_Ridout: AEGHORS M8 AH +23 388
#note HELP!   OK, I get that (O)OH D12 once again sets up my case S.    if I land something like HAGS 15A next turn, I've scored 46 for the two plays.   Perhaps this late taking the AH points and thinking I can score at least as well next turn is overly optimistic... I may be answering my own question here.
