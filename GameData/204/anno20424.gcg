>Cesar: AEGINQS 8G QI +22 22
>JD: AABDOPT 7H BAP +12 12
#note JD: I would not have picked DAB at 9H to sim so well, but it makes sense...prevent cesar from picking up cheap points by underlapping the Q, keep decent leave. beats my play by 1 point
>Cesar: AEGMNSU 6I MUG +18 40
#note Cesar: or MU? (-1)
>JD: ADEFIOT 9F FIDO +28 40
>Cesar: AEENSSW 10B WAENESS +96 136
#note yurgh
>JD: AEEIITT B8 TA.IE +8 48
#note JD: too psycho? a play with colossal variance, but I'm already 100 points down - why not go for it? I certainly like it better than TAE at 11D.
>Cesar: DEELRTZ A7 LEZ +53 189
#note cesar counted this as 49 for some reason
>JD: ?EFHIJT A11 THIEF +56 104
>Cesar: DEORRTV D9 R.VOTED +26 215
#note nice play
>JD: ?AJNSTY 5H JAY +26 130
#note JD: why do I keep playing this damn word?! I can burn the blank for SEJANT or score with TAJ. I liked JAY because it saves a place to bingo that isn't really blockable with MUGS.
>Cesar: ?GHMRSU L6 SoRGHUM +83 298
#note Cesar: better to be lucky than good. yes I saw the L3 positioning and thought it was not defensive enough, but quackle still likes it a little more. (-1)  JD: I lose
>JD: ?KNNRST 11J TR.NK +18 148
#note I thought about playing RUNT to save the K for bingoing, but doesn't really matter
>Cesar: LNOPRTY 8L .OPY +27 325
#note Cesar: my main goal here is to minimize the effect of Jesse's Law, so I should be playing something like 15D DRYLOT, but I missed it. (-4)
>JD: ?AEENRS 13G RENnASE +79 227
#note would've been nice to bingo to the Y. should play arenose probably
>Cesar: LLOR 15D .ROLL +18 343
#note Cesar: missed the cool C12 LINO which somehow sims... 10 pts better? WTF?
>JD: ABEGLVW 12F VAW +24 251
#note I'm not bingoing next turn anyway, so I might as well take more points with VAW/NA/FEW and then fish next turn.
>Cesar: DEIINNT 14F DIE +26 369
#note Cesar: it might be wise here to play something like TINNY to try to stop Jesse's Law, but DIE was just too many points to give up.
>JD: BCEEGIL I4 G... +7 258
#note should just mail it in and take the points for LIB. trying to distract cesar I guess
>Cesar: CIINNOT N5 NIT.IC. +23 392
#note cool
>JD: BCDEEIL O1 DEICE +35 293
>Cesar: AANOTUX N2 AX +31 423
>JD: BEILNRU 5D BLUE... +38 331
#note cutting spread, I guess I could fish for NEBULAR but surely he will block
>Cesar: AANOOTU 3I AUTO +14 437
#note JD: I can't block the AGAMA hook, so he should play OBA now and save TAUON  Cesar: I meant to play TAUON and then forgot
>JD: INOOR 6D ION +15 346
#note RIN for 4 more
>Cesar: ANO K1 NO.A +4 441
>Cesar:  (OR) +4 445
