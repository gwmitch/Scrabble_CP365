#note Woo!
>Moe: QT K7 Q.T +12 12
>Randi: ABDIOOR 7G BOO +16 44
#note (F)ORBID is simming just as well as BOO. It is worth 10 more, so there is that. The leave is terrible, though. Thoughts?
>Moe: AELNSTT M2 LATENTS +77 89
#note I know I know I kept the G. Please don't leave me :)
>Randi: ACDGIIR L8 .ARCI +22 66
#note Okay so I didn't think to take out the potential hotspot in row 2 by making a sexy parallel play. I also kept the G. Don't break up with me!
>Moe: AEIMNRR 2J MED.Y +34 123
>Moe: AEIMNRR --  -34 89
#note Annnnd besides, if I had taken that out with a sexy parallel play, I wouldn't have gotten to challenge off this play :)
>Randi: ADGIIOS 5I DOGI. +14 80
#note Didn't think of DIA(L)OG... sometimes I have trouble seeing bingos I've studied out of context. Still didn't think of sexy parallel plays. Also I like my doggie.
>Moe: FOX J4 F.X +29 118
>Randi: AEEEIRS J8 .EE +8 88
#note Over valued the S here. Other than that, Q seems to enjoy the fishyosity. I wasn't sure about this, and still am not. Q likes 13K AE as much or more... this confuses me.
>Moe: AEOTUVY 2L P.Y +16 134
>Randi: ABEINRS 1N BI +19 107
#note OMG why do I study if I'm not going to play the words? Though I may have actually decided there were no 7s and moved on - actually forgot to look for 8s. Ugh. At least I made the best fishy play? Sigh. 
>Moe: AEORTUV 13I HYMEN +45 179
>Randi: AENNRSU G5 NU. +5 112
#note Q seems to like NU in row 1 better. 
>Moe: EILOU 12E LOUIE +11 190
>Randi: AENORRS 1F SERRANO +79 191
#note Good thing I didn't know that then! 
>Moe: DEJOW 11B JOWED +39 229
>Randi: DEEEIOT 12A DOE +17 208
#note Okay I totes didn't know what to do here. Q likes JEED, which I think I was nervous about because of potential plays down to the triple. I can see how it would have been better though. Q also likes JETE, which I understand not at all because of parallels to the triple and because of the S that I don't have. But I didn't know what to do all the same.
>Moe: AAAEEHO C9 CO..D +22 251
>Randi: AEEEINT A12 .INE +15 223
#note DEET is clearly better here.
>Moe: AAEETTV 2B MULTI +22 273
>Randi: AAEETTV 3A VAT +20 243
#note Oookay so ignore that pesky MULTI. I didn't know TECTA. Didn't think of (C)AVEAT. 
>Moe: AGH 1A HAG +30 303
>Randi: AAEETUV -VAEU +0 243
#note Okay okay I get it, all of the words are better. Here are my thoughts: I like none of the plays. I am an underdog already. There are two blanks and two S's unseen. There are lines. Let's go for it. 

(Though I do realize that playing would probably have been better)
>Moe: IK 11K I.K +18 321
>Randi: ?AAEIST A3 .ArIATES +83 326
#note WABAM!

Though okay, fine, perhaps I should have waited and bingoed out. But I was not convinced this would work because he could block. 
>Moe: ERSV 4D REVS +20 341
>Randi: ?AERRUZ 6A .ZARs +33 359
#note Shoulda kept the blank.
>Moe: GNW C5 N.W +10 351
>Randi: ERU F8 URE.. +8 367
#note Awww man I missed a point. But my play was more exciting. I don't know why, other than because it was the Scrabble word.
>Randi:  (G) +4 371
