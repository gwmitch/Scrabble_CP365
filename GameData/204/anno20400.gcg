>Joshua_Sokol: ?AISTYZ 10G TI.Y +18 48
#note I should just drop the Y. I probably also missed SIZY. At least this should keep things under control.
>Tim_Weiss: BEI 5H .IBE +26 35
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AMNRSZ 6G Z.NA +23 71
#note Again trying to keep things contained. Playing L4 ARM would normally be a good idea, but not against Tim. There is no need to be so aggressive. Also, after TAV and JIBE it seems Tim very often has an A, and given that I did not want to play L3 ZAS. Again, being aggressive is not what I want to do against Tim.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIMPRS O3 .EMPIRaS +86 190
#note Patience pays off. Although I wasted a lot of time trying to find the inexistent 3x3 here. Now the top of the board is pretty much dead and I have an 120 point lead.
>Tim_Weiss: ?AHNSTU N9 NAUgHTS +77 143
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIOORT O14 OI +14 204
#note I don't think there's any rush to play more tiles here with ARIOSO or OTIOSE. Don't think I even gave those plays a chance in my thought process here, so I completely missed them. Given my loss of time last turn there is really no need to look for ARIOSO or OTIOSE at all, and I'm much better off playing this.
>Tim_Weiss: FGIOU 11C FUGIO +20 163
>Joshua_Sokol: AELORTT 12D TOTER +24 228
#note I really want the action to stay as contained as possible here. This is really the only play.
>Tim_Weiss: BCIR 13J BIRC. +24 187
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILORW L11 AR.OW +24 252
#note BIRCH was a good play. It's quite troublesome that I can't completely block the lane he opened. I can do my best though. I choose this over WAILER or WARIER cause it prevents more bingos, and Tim is very good at seeing those, and also it seems like my leave is actually a tad better than OR or LO considering the pool. Even if it isn't, which it very well might not be, I still prefer my play for the first reason.
>Tim_Weiss: EY 10B YE +18 205
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILQUX A8 ILEX +39 291
#note This is very weird, but it actually might be correct to play LUXE instead of ILEX. Not cause it sets up QI, which is a potential and real benefit, but also since it is much less likely for Tim to have a playable bingo after LUXE. Given YE, it seems he is at least relatively close to one. This may have been a costly error.

#note meh, chose the standard route
>Tim_Weiss: MR E3 R.M +10 267
#note not realizing he was emptying
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDEOSS H12 .OD +4 433
#note this looks like the best play, but there may be a better one. The engine cannot find it, but if I play everything right I win by 195, 2 better than the suggested 11I SOC(A), although Tim is far more likely to allow me more points in the endgame after SOC(A), so that is probably correct anyway. It's very complicated for Tim after SOC(A), whereas if he has tracked correctly, it's easy after ROD.

#note 7A S(E)C looks like the best play here.
