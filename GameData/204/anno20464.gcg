#note I guess if I play 7I MUT I might score 70 next turn. I don't really like what it does to the board otherwise. I would much prefer to play MOUNT here

#note Ugh. I saw TIEWRAPS* and didn't like it. I didn't search for the actual word in there... For what it's worth though, this isn't much worse if worse at all. Although I understand that I'm always bingoing next turn unless I draw the X and the E is blocked or I draw the Q, I can't really intuitively understand why I shouldn't bingo here. The number make sense though.
>Deen_Hergott: AN 11I NA +13 64
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HIPRST 5D HaRPIST +78 144
#note This time I miss TRIPHaS(E). That is much worse of a miss, unless I assume this will be challenged. I think I inferred that Deen did not have an S, which would be why I chose to play this instead of the safer HIPSTER, but anyways, TRIPHASE.
>Deen_Hergott: ABDDEN H10 BANDED +36 100
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEOTU 13C AUTOE. +16 160
#note Not sure if this is better than 4C AUTO, but three E's vs two E's is a remarkable difference, so I chose the safer play imo.
>Deen_Hergott: IQ 4H QI +44 144
#note Hmm, perhaps I should play at 4A here. That seems like a good idea. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEFIOR 14E OF +28 188
#note Playing at A4 seems like a good idea strategically here, but I was intent on scoring and keeping a decent leave as well that I could bingo with often enough. I think I should have played FORE/EH. There are just too many scoring spots on this board to be afraid of opening another
>Deen_Hergott: KNOSW 3I KNOWS +46 190
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILRR 4K REI +20 208
#note I considered DERAILER*, and was convinced it was invalid. After the game, Deen claimed it was valid, so I think I would have gotten away with it. 4A ARIEL looks like a good play here too. Not sure if I am content with this play. I wanted to reduce the value of the S he is likely to have, but without an S draw of my own, I am in trouble.

>Deen_Hergott: HP C2 PH. +16 254
>Joshua_Sokol: CILLRRU O3 CURLI.R +10 257
#note I seem to remember Deen taking a very long while to play PHT. I inferred the blank. I therefore wanted to take out the easiest lane. I really don't know if that was the right thing to do. It's also very likely he's quite clunky, with or without the blank, and perhaps he won't have a bingo. There just really aren't many situations where CURLIER is the right play. The E and the D at H14/15 will almost always play a definite role in deciding the game. Why leave only one area potent for bingos? It would seem that if I am going for the blank, this is a good play, but I don't think that was my mindset at all. I think the correct play has to be C9 CURI(A)L. It scores just as well as CURLIER, it keeps a relatively good leave (I have a decent chance at a bingo to the E next turn), and in my opinion most importantly, it blocks the huge scoring spot at 15A, which could decide who wins if it's responsible for a 45-point play. This seems like it was a very significant tactical mistake.
>Deen_Hergott: ?ACGIRV C8 VICAR.Ge +64 318
#note A great find by Deen (took him a while). I wonder if he would have seen it at O1 had I not played CURLIER. In any case, keeping the blank and just playing VICAR, Deen's original candidate play, might be better here. There are still lanes to hit, but most importantly, keeping the blank is great for blocking setups and causing me trouble later on in the game due to me not knowing if I can draw it out of the bag or not. It's a huge factor in my decision-making. Still, Deen is now in great shape.
>Joshua_Sokol: AELNOOS L2 O.. +6 263
#note It seemed drawing into a bingo was necessary here. The problem is that I can't hit two areas of the board with my leave. The only other fish I can hit is for 2B O(P)ALINES. The idea is hoping Deen doesn't have the last L/can't really block otherwise. It's also possible this will stay open more than one turn. It's also possible this play is too premature, and that it's fine to just play B6 OLEO or M10 SOON. I'm not sure what is the best against Deen. I feel like this play will induce the most mistakes.
>Deen_Hergott: AITV N8 .AVIT +19 337
>Joshua_Sokol: AAELNOS 3C .AO +12 275
#note I missed, unfortunately. Now I am in trouble. Or maybe I can attempt A(P)NOEALS*. This is bad. I should never block a lane in this situation. B6 OLEA might be correct this time around. Actually I really like 9E AEON. I missed (U)N(BANNED), which might make Deen hold. It would simultaneously fish for the X and for a bingo. Seems like a formidable play. But maybe not, since if I hit a bingo Deen might still win after an X-bomb.
>Deen_Hergott: BEFILM 1H FIMBLE +50 387
#note Scored as 49, forced challenge. Really bad that I blocked my own DE(P)LANES with my last play. Also sucks that Deen drew the L. I knew this word but I had to make sure...
