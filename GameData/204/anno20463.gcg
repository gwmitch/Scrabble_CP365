>Philio_Waldron: EIPRZ 8D PRIZE +38 38
>Joshua_Sokol: GGHLOSV 9H HOGG +15 15
#note I don't think I considered playing my S here. I wonder if it's a good thing to just score with I4 HOGGS and stay within range of Phil this early, or if I should try to control the board  and try to strike first... I think on a redo I should play HOGGS. I chose this instead of the one 2 spots up because I wanted a better lane for my S and I wanted to start trying to restrict the bottom half.

>Joshua_Sokol: AALOQSV 7F Q. +22 37
>Philio_Waldron: ?EIINRT K5 sTIN.IER +82 136
#note well there goes that idea
>Joshua_Sokol: AADLOSV I7 AD. +23 60
#note I think I missed 8K (N)AVAL. That seems like a better play on all fronts, but perhaps this is fine. I don't doubt that Phil will open the board up by himself.
>Philio_Waldron: EO H5 OE +7 143
#note maybe it's just the results orientation speaking here
>Joshua_Sokol: ADELOSV 4B SALVOED +82 142

>Joshua_Sokol: AACENOU 11B CANOE +23 165
#note back to my original plan I guess? I think OUNCE is a good counteroption here even though it sets up phantom hooks. Perhaps not
>Philio_Waldron: ?AEINST 12F SANTE.Ia +68 219
#note lucky I drew into this. I wanted him to challenge so I took a bit longer than normal to see if there were other options.
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNOUV B6 UNIVO.AL +67 232
#note I was lucky to be able to get this down. I was pretty sure Phil didn't know it, but not insta-playing this didn't garner the challenge I hoped for. Perhaps I could have gotten away with things against him!
>Philio_Waldron: OY 10F YO +27 246
>Joshua_Sokol: AEORRSY A12 YARE +44 276
#note And in reality I would have instachallenged if Philip had pluralized UNIVOCAL! In fact UNIVOCALS is a word and SORRY plays at 14B for a whopping 60 points! Given how long it took Phil to play YO I can assume he isn't holding all that well, so SORRY may indeed be the correct play. Chose this ever so slightly over YEAR in the same spot since it seemed the R at 15A was more dangerous to leave than the E
>Philio_Waldron: DEUU H11 U.DUE +18 264
#note As I would have expected Phil isn't holding well after YO. Another reason I had played YARE is I assumed UNIVOCALS was invalid so I didn't want to tempt myself into playing there. 
>Joshua_Sokol: HKOPRRS A7 OH +32 308
#note another beautiful play I missed, D8 (PAWN)SHOP, although I wouldn't be confident it was one word. I was really set on playing J11 P(E)RK for the defense and for the prospects for next turn with my flexible leave, but I just really didn't want to leave that X hotspot open at A8. Even though Phil just drew 4, it might be staying there for the whole game. That's unnecessary variance. Given that this saved P(E)RK or P(A)RK for next turn, I wasn't all that worried about my leave.
>Philio_Waldron: UX 13M XU +34 298
#note as I had thought, Phil drew the X.
>Joshua_Sokol: IKPRRRS J11 P.RK +24 332
>Philio_Waldron: JW C3 J.W +26 324
#note Now that the last easy lanes are impeded on, I am in great shape to win this game.
>Joshua_Sokol: IMORRST 12A ..MS +42 374
#note (PAWN)OR at D8 is a good rack-balancer, but on this board, scoring points is a very good thing. Of course, against someone that would know to make good use of the case S, it might be wise to keep mine. In any case it's very hard to set up an unblockable lane that's worth a damn on this board, and I stand by my play.
>Philio_Waldron: EI E4 .IE +12 336
#note scored as 14
>Joshua_Sokol: BILORRT C11 ..BIT +28 402
>Philio_Waldron: ACIM J2 MICA +15 351
>Joshua_Sokol: ELORRTT 14G T.R. +8 410
#note This isn't a very good play. I wanted to totally eliminate that E lane as a possible bingo lane and keep well enough to escape sure losses if Philip bingoes through the M, but 11J (PE)TROL outruns a lot more, leaves one in the bag, which is fine with it being almost impossible to make a fish that would hit two areas of the board; and finally, PETROL scores well and leaves well.
>Philio_Waldron: T 7K .T +2 353
>Joshua_Sokol: DEELORT 3I L.ROT +12 422
#note So he could hit multiple things but this blocked all of them for certain. BANGLES, FLANGES, BEFLAGS (didn't know that one). I almost played O(I)LED in the same spot, but I was worried FLAGS(M)EN* was valid. It's only FLAGMEN, but better safe than sorry. I supposed D(I)ETER works too, among other things. This was held and released by Philip.
>Philio_Waldron: ABEGLNS L1 GL.B +18 371
#note and indeed he had BANGLES. This seems to be 11 points off of 14L GENS. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEFN M11 F..ED +15 437
#note I think we both kept missing aX(E)! This is 16 points off of the now blatantly obvious 14L FEND... with this play I hoped he would attempt SANE/LIROTS* for 12 and lose his turn
>Philio_Waldron: AENS N8 SANE +11 382
#note Not knowing I gave him a spot for SE(D)AN and that 6J S(T)ANE was playable as well. Oh well.
>Philio_Waldron:  (EN) +4 386
