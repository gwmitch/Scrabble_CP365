>Ross_Brown: ?AGNOST H3 AGONiST +68 68
#note Ottawa Matchplay Tournament, Round 4, Game 4. I'm leading the best-of-5 match 2-1. Winner of this match clinches #1 seed going into the knockout rounds.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEENPR G3 PANE +23 23
#note I had some silly blank blindness this turn and completely failed to see plays making PI. Sooo... I missed the best plays like EPEE, PEE, etc. Okay time to start focusing!

>Ross_Brown: CEEJOTT F4 JOT +31 111
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EFRSUWY 2J FEW +37 88
#note YEW, FEW, FEY. FEY is cheeky for setting up my W in two spots, but there is a zero percent chance of that working. I went with FEW to minimize the odds of him scoring too well on the triple lane.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EGIOUVW M12 VOE +30 239
#note Might have misevaluated the leaves here. GWIU looks gross, but I thought the W would at least be a flexible scoring tile. GVIU actually has a bit more "synergy". It's not far off, though.

#note This was a tough turn. I knew WO(K) was probably good enough to play through the rack. But after two plays which score low and also show rather clearly that he's not holding an S, I thought I could seize the chance to dig for an S. Because a play hooking VOES would be pretty game breaking for whoever gets it first. Unsurprisingly, Quackle likes the sane WOK play, but the exchange is not doing awfully... just 3-4 points back. Maybe my no-S-for-Ross inference is worth the difference?
>Ross_Brown: EGLMNOU 10I GUN. +11 277
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABEIRSY 15H BARYES +43 321
#note Got it! Finally an obvious play, right? No!! ABERSY bingos with half of the unseen pool! (Though ROSEBAY likely won't play.) Fishing off the I gives me a shot at closing this game out. I'm sticking with the no-S inference, and my lane is nearly impossible to block without an S. And some of the time, my bingo still plays on the new E column lane. So yeah, QI is golden. I wasted time on a lot of racks that didn't need it this game, but blew right past the turn that could've really used more thought.
>Ross_Brown: DELMNOT 11E MELTON +21 298
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADIIIUW 10D DAW +32 353
#note Tricky turn. With this draw, it's no longer a sure thing that I can outrun a decent Z or X play. DAW grabs precious points and gums up the easiest lane for him to score with those tiles. That's why WADI wasn't really an option on my radar. The leave is atrocious going into a close-ish pre-endgame, but I reasoned that leaving 10 tiles in the bag gave me a decent shot at being able to exchange next turn if I had to.
>Ross_Brown: DIOV 12C VOID +28 326
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIIILOU B11 LOUIE +19 372
#note My heart sank when he grabbed four tiles from his rack. I was looking forward to an exchange 7. But at least he gave me a play. It's something. It gives me a shot at the unseen power tiles. I'm hoping to draw at least one of X or Z, but wasn't really thinking about the potential danger of drawing both. Despite the score lead, I'm only winning about 55% after this play. Any ideas for something better?
>Ross_Brown: AABHLRS A14 AH +32 358
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AHIIIXZ 14I ZA +28 400
#note I was pretty low on time. ~4 minutes. Too slow on previous turns. It looked like I could play IXIA and outrun a Z stick, but I was not positive. Felt more comfortable with this threatening XI and HI, and was pretty sure it couldn't be beaten. With more time I could have been positive.
