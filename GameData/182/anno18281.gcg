#note After Joshua Sokol uploaded his unprecented detailed blitz anno (right before this one), a buddy of mine said, 'Why not do a spazzable annotated game!' So here it is!
For those of you who don't know what Spazzable is, it's an even more agressive version of blitz where each side only gets 1 minute- not 3. Crazy things happen during these games- phonies, excruciatingly bad plays, etc.
On ISC, however, since the minimum time setting is 3, whoever goes below 2:00 must resign- so I'll only indicate seconds remaining to avoid confusion.
So let's start... 
QAT is rated 3.4 better statically, but QI is around 6 points better on defense- not like this matters much in spaz, but it's interesting and good to know!
I spent 2 seconds on this move (58 seconds remaining)
>Tiansa: CDTTUUV H5 DUC. +7 7
#note Matthew only added brief commentary, but I'll separate them with 'M' (S' is me) from here on out.
S: Matthew spent 6 seconds (54 seconds left). He should exchange here.
M: This is awful, but it's Spazzble.
>insidious: AAEIKOT 5H .AKOIT +22 44
#note S: This is best! Spent 3 seconds, 55 remaining.
>Tiansa: AAEGTUV M3 VA. +12 19
#note S: 4 seconds here, 50 seconds left.
M: See previous comment

>insidious: AAAEOOU -AAAOOU +0 44
#note S: The obvious exchange, which is best. Spent 1 second here, 54 seconds left. Note that on ISC you can simply spam the command line for exchanges, hence the 1 second! Only on these kind of racks though, where it doesn't matter what the opponent plays (of course, he could phony and we just exchanged, but he wouldn't know that he could get away with a blatant phony on this turn)
>Tiansa: EEGTTUW 4L T.W +16 35
#note S: -4s, 46s left
M: TUG is best.

>insidious: EEEEFLR J5 .EEF +13 57
#note S: Best again, to my surprise! -1s, 53s remaining: I didn't spam this move though, must have typed super fast :p
>Tiansa: EEEGOTU G8 .UOTE +15 50
#note M: Finally I make the best play (Sid has failed to not make the best play thus far)
S: -3s, 43s left... of course if we want to be technical, exchanging sims better by a good margin because of the hotspot, but this a good play in spaz- inducing me to make large errors :p
>insidious: AEELNOR H12 LONE +18 75
#note S: -3s, 50 seconds left- of course I wanted to block the spot, but too fixated on going downwards- LOANER/QUOTER is the play, -10.
>Tiansa: EEEGIMS I11 GEM +19 69
#note M: This isn't great, neither is ELE, but it's Spazzble.
S: Hehe, went unnoticed, SIEGE is probably the play- -3s, 40s left
>insidious: AAEIMNR F10 MA +22 97
#note S: (F)AMINE is about 13 points better. -4s, 46s left.
>Tiansa: AEEHIOS O1 HOES +32 101
#note M: HOISE
S: -3s, 37s left.
-7 statically to HOISE (Fwiw, static loss is more important as Josh said, but QI and QUOTE were exceptions)
>insidious: AEINRTT 11E T.. +6 103
#note M: I'm going to assume he missed the lane, not the words
S: Yup, missed the lane. Spent a long 7 seconds here (39 seconds left). -36 statically.
>Tiansa: AEEGIVY N2 YE. +34 135
#note S: Best my a large margin. -5s, 32s left.
>insidious: AEINNRT K8 ENTRAIN +69 172
#note S: Spent another 7 seconds (finding the lane, hehe). 32 seconds remaining.
>Tiansa: AEGIRSV 8J ..VERS +48 183
#note M: I missed the S hook
S: STAT, yep. -3s, 29s left, -27 statically
>insidious: AGIORWZ 14F ZI. +32 204
#note S: ZO(R)I is 2 points better statically. -1s, 31s left.
>Tiansa: ?AAEGII 15D AGA +16 199
#note M: This is decent
S: TAIGA is hard to see in spaz. -3s, 26s left, -3 statically
>insidious: ADGORUW 7M WO +20 224
#note S: -0.8 statically to UNDRAW, hehe. -1s, 30 seconds left.
>Tiansa: ?EEIIJO 12D JO +20 219
#note M: I missed JEU
S: -2s, 24s left, -8 static
>insidious: ADGIRRU C13 RUG +14 238
#note S: -2.8 static to UNGIRD (pretty questionable defense though? although recklessness could be a positive in spaz)
-2s, 28s left.
>Tiansa: ?EHIIIX B12 HEX +46 265
#note S: Disgustingly best. -3s, 21s left.
>insidious: ADILNRS A6 ALDRINS +83 321
#note S: -3s, 25s left.
>Tiansa: ?IIILNO 14J I.ION +14 279
#note M: Best
S; -6s, 15s left.
>insidious: ABNRRTU B4 RUB +21 342
#note S: Best statically. -2s, 23s left.
>Tiansa: ?ADFILY 15M FAY +34 313
#note M: I only had 15 seconds, so meh on DAFfILY
S: Very difficult find. This is otherwise best. -6s, 9 seconds left
>insidious: ALNPPRT 12K .PP +14 356
#note M: I'm lucky that he doesn't have a decent blocking play
S: I actually missed DRUB. So, BRUNT may have been better the other turn, even if it gives floaters to work with- so I can block this turn. Q can't come up with anything good here. APPAL sims best. -10s, 13s left.
>Tiansa: ?DDEILS 3B DILDoES +75 388
#note S: -2s, 7s left. I facepalmed for missing this lane.
>insidious: ?ACLNRT F2 C.RN +11 367
#note M: Sid, you suck, because you missed CRAp(U)L(E)NT
S: The only win is a disconnected, 3 way overlap nine!!!
This was a pretty pointless setup. -4s, 9 seconds remaining.
>Tiansa: BEIO H1 BO. +15 403
#note M: Meh, it wins
S: -19 to the only out, DOBIE, but it gets the job done. -2s, 5s left.
>insidious: ?ALT 1C TALa +9 376
#note S: Couldn't switch the blank in time. -6 to E3 (D)eALT.
-9 seconds, 0 seconds left exactly.
>insidious:  (EI) +4 380
#note S: Great game! Hope this was enjoyable, and as crazy as it sounds, we'd like to see others do this as well :)
