>Will: CEEIMNN 8D MINCE +24 24
>Joey: EFIINQY 9C QI +25 25
#note 0:32.
>Will: EILNOST I2 ENTOILS +69 93
>Joey: AEFINOY J2 FOIN +34 59
#note 1:05.  I wasn't crazy about what this did to the board or keeping AEY, but nothing else scored nearly as well.
>Will: ADO H1 ADO +22 115
>Joey: ADEGSTY K5 EDGY +24 83
#note 1:53.  Lots of so-so choices here.  This seems alright.
>Will: AJR 10D RAJ +31 146
>Joey: AAEGSTT L8 AGATE +20 103
#note 1:20.  STAGNATE was plan A.  Plan B wasn't as clear.
>Will: ?EEIRST 13F vERITES +65 211
>Joey: GNOSTTW 11D SWOT +39 142
#note 0:17.  Finally a more obvious choice.  No sense in keeping the S, since it doesn't function well on this board.
>Will: DEK H12 D.EK +33 244
>Joey: DEGNTUY M4 DUNGY +21 163
#note 4:13.  I wish something more dynamic could be done, but I wasn't seeing anything.
>Will: AIMP L1 PIMA +28 272
>Joey: CEFHRRT 10J CR.FT +18 181
#note 1:03.
>Will: AH N5 HA +16 288
>Joey: EHRRUVX 1L .ERV +27 208
#note 0:44.  PREX scores 12 more, but keeping HRUV was pretty hopeless.
>Will: IWZ O6 WIZ +51 339
#note That makes it hopelesser.  Very methodical two turn block by Will.
>Joey: EHLORUX 7A LUREX +29 237
#note 2:52.  I took that long because I had forgotten all about the E/MIR hook.
>Will: BIL A5 BI.L +18 357
>Joey: ?ABHORU 1A BROUHAh. +89 326
#note 0:18. I wasn't expecting to hit that spot.  There's still hope!
>Will: LOOP 5A .LOOP +18 375
>Joey: AEENSTV F1 .VENS +26 352
#note 4:32. Close, but not quite.  I almost have KISTVAEN#.
>Will: AEINOU G8 .OA.E. +23 398
>Joey: AET 11L .EAT +11 363
#note I had 6:11 remaining before this play.  Will's time was not documented.
>Joey:  (INU) +6 369
