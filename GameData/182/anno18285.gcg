>Noah_Walton: AEW 8G WAE +12 12
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEEHIOO 7G OHO +22 22
#note Everything was set for Q's top, HOODIE 9I, but I played shorter with OHO which is 6.4 worse.
>Noah_Walton: EGGT F8 TEGG +17 29
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEEEIPU -EEIPU +0 22
#note I couldn't make a play like EP(E)E 9D or (G)UIDE 10F, hence exchange all but ED, which Q says is slightly worse than exchanging all but PED.
>Noah_Walton: IR 11D RI. +8 37
>Gunther_Jacobi: BDEEIVZ 12A VIBE +30 52
#note It was a hard decision between this and BIZE, which Q prefers by a point over VIBE. I also looked at VE(R)BID D9...
>Noah_Walton: AEIQRU A8 AQUI.ER +57 94
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADEJLMZ B6 JAM +32 84
#note I discounted ADZ plays for two reasons: if he has an E his comeback plays will negate my play most likely, plus I wanted to rid myself of the J while scoring decently, so I could use both power tiles to gain some ground. Quackle says to play ADZ 6H, a play I missed, or MAZED B4, another play I failed to consider. Yet JAM is still only 1.5 worse than ADZ 6H.
>Noah_Walton: UX C7 XU +39 133
>Gunther_Jacobi: DDELOTZ D3 ZLOTE +38 122
#note This is 1.3 worse than DOZE in the same spot. TODDLE D2 is an interesting option too.
>Noah_Walton: DFI E5 FID +38 171
>Gunther_Jacobi: AADDRVY 6G DAVY +38 160
>Noah_Walton: BOW 5J BOW +23 194
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADEILOR 13D DARIOLE +62 222
>Noah_Walton: AHNST 14J HANTS +45 239
>Gunther_Jacobi: ACNOSSU H12 C.ON +27 249
#note Yeah, I looked at CO(Z), Q's top for a bit, but felt H12 needed clarification first. Maybe even C(O)OS instead. My play registers 4.6 behind.
>Noah_Walton: NNY L5 .YNN +11 250
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEFISSU 3B FU.ES +34 283
#note Q thinks keeping the S is slightly better.
>Noah_Walton: COR J2 COR.. +18 268
>Gunther_Jacobi: AIINPSS M1 PAINS +23 306
#note I looked at his C for quite some time and couldn't find this great play, PISCINAS. I give up and make an unlisted choice. The only upside is that I turn over some tiles in hopes of drawing a blank. I know Noah wouldn't have missed the bingo here, yet I can't say that I new the word although it does look familiar.
>Noah_Walton: AEILNOR 10F .ERANIOL +61 329
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?IKLRSU 8K K.URL +27 333
#note Q very much likes this play, although I almost played KI 2A, which 12pts behind KNURL.
>Noah_Walton: PT F2 P.T +11 340
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?EGIIST O5 GIr.IEST +59 392
#note G(R)ISlIE(S)T is absurd, multifunctional and just totally the star play. It scores more than any other bingo, takes possession of the most threatening lane and gets fabulous style points.
>Noah_Walton: ?ADEEET 1K TA.ED +27 367
#note Q likes (R)EcEDE 14A, but Noah was the red zone.
>Gunther_Jacobi: M N1 .M +16 408
>Gunther_Jacobi:  (EE?) +4 412
