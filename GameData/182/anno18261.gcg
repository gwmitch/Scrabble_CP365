>Goutham: BDEINRW E2 BRIDE +45 81
#note DWINE scores the same 45 but i believe BRIDE is better because it maintains the N for EXON. I preferred BRIDE to WIDE because i get to draw an extra tile.
>Taewan: DEEI 10E IDEE +22 86
#note Not sure why Taewan did not position idee differently. It closes out possible EXON and ING plays. Possibly he had a D in his rack for AXED (No he didnt actually)?

#note Strong dump
>Goutham: ?AEGLNS J4 SEALiNG +74 171
#note Played sealng over leasing because of the added possibility of front hooks (PLEASING). Unfortunately that didnt work out lol
>Taewan: AEGILOR 4H GA.OLIER +74 181
#note Leasing would have denied the bingo but how am i to know sigh

#note 3 in a row... :(
Would be better to play clothier over chlorite.
>Goutham: AELMRSV M9 MARVELS +87 327
#note Completely didnt see 2B VERBALISM... So then i would have been able to respond even if he played clothier.

#note This rack definitely scared me a little bit, having no vowels. I wasnt sure of SNECK or would have just played that. Felt like PICKS was a decent move to keep the momentum on my side

#note Kinda stupid i know but REALLY didnt want to risk INDUVIAL not being valid (INDUVIA* as a matter of fact is invalid.)

At this point, i knew Taewan had ELOUTR on his rack. I was thinking i should just be safe and play VISA for 41 leaving dun on my rack to go out with TED/DUN at B13. I thought he couldnt score enough by blocking that spot as i would go out with BUND and him playing elsewhere results in an autoloss for him. 
WHAT I DIDNT REALIZE at that time was that
HE COULD PLAY A WORD WITH THE K to score 20 and block my outplay

>Goutham: DNU 11K DU.N +19 450
#note Thank god i spotted the other strong outplay AT THE LAST MINUTE... I wasnt even 100% sure of POWN although i sort of knew it should be good (Yes i know my word knowledge sucks). Would have been pretty upset if pown wasnt good as losing this game would cost me $80 and ALSO i had a simple induvial on my rack.
