>Sinke: ACDMRUW 8G WUD +14 14
#note Cleverly passing up on CWM, or rather missing it. But - haha - this is superior. 
>Smylie: AILOZ I3 OZALI. +18 18
>Sinke: ACFMNNR 5G FR.NC +20 34
#note This and 3H NONFARM are about equivalent. I did not consider NONFARM. 
>Smylie: GINOSST 9F TOSSING +86 104
>Sinke: AEMNOPT H1 POM +25 59
#note An important principle for playing with a deficit is to leave good floating consonants in triple lanes. 
>Smylie: GHOTU 7C OUGHT +18 122
>Sinke: ADEEKNT 8A KEET +32 91
#note The possibility of hooking OUGHT to form DOUGHT or NOUGHT and play TANKED or KNEAD escaped me. But never fear, this is better anyhow. 
>Smylie: AEH 6D HAE +24 146
>Sinke: ADINQRX 4D QADI +33 124
#note A sim prefers QINDAR K7, which I considered and eschewed. With only a small deficit I have no desire to create so many openings, none of which favor the X. Plus QADI scores an extra point. 
>Smylie: ABI J3 BA.I +30 176
>Sinke: ??NNORX B7 N.uRaXON +90 214
#note I saw the only two bingos. The other one is only worth 65 but is possibly more glamorous. 
>Smylie: AEGIILT A11 LEGIT +37 213
>Sinke: AAPTUUY K7 AU.TY +16 230
#note A sim recommends UNAU K8, which I did not consider. As I expected, this is a better play than EXPAT 12A.  -2
>Smylie: ORY 10K .ORY +18 231
>Sinke: AEFLNPU 12A ..PEL +28 258
#note A sim likes FUD F2 here. I disagree - on a board with no good lines it is impossible to fish confidently. The sim assumes Jackson will open up, which is unlikely. 
>Smylie: EIOR L9 ..OIER +19 250
>Sinke: AFNNSTU 13F UNFAST.N +76 334
#note I catch a lucky break here. 
>Smylie: AERW H11 WA.ER +36 286
>Sinke: BDEEIIS L1 BIDES +33 367
#note It is now necessary to obstruct the bingo line I set up back when I had a deficit. Sims inexplicably favor BEDEW 11D.
>Smylie: EJV 2K J.VE +28 314
>Sinke: ACDEIIO O1 ODIC +46 413
#note I looked for an out in two unsuccessfully. CP believes this to be best.
