>Dean: JMOO 8E MOJO +26 26
#note This is the game where it all fell apart. If I won this one I would be very close to being Gibsonized already at 10-0 vs what would have been Dean's 7-3. I lost my mojo, fittingly, starting with his first move lol. This placement is interesting and not completely orthodox; it probably leads to a more closed board in the long term though. 
>Chris: LQRRTUY F7 L.RY +15 15
#note There nowhere to use my QU yet. This is simming best despite the G hook on LORY and it not making the board conducive to my QU. Already getting the uneasy feeling that this game isn't going the right way.
>Dean: BKOO E10 BOOK +27 53
>Chris: IINNQTU 12C QU.IN +28 43
>Dean: BCDEEIL 7H DECIBEL +67 120
#note I really would prefer to play with the lead against Dean but nope :(
>Chris: ?ALNNST M3 LANT.rNS +66 109
#note A bunch of bingoes play here - LANTERNS does fork the board, but opens the L4 spot and makes it hard to use the L and N columnns for bingoes; and I still want to keep the board open here since I'm down a tempo. 
>Dean: AIORSTY O6 OSTIARY +105 225
#note Le sigh
>Chris: ACEIITT 13B TI +26 135
#note Using the QI spot and hoping for a miracle; 6% to win already
>Dean: ADDGNW K3 WADD.NG +26 251
#note Blocking a bunch of lines and expediting the end of the game rather than being greedy with something like GNAW F6
>Chris: ACEEHIT N10 HEAT +36 171
#note I thought about just HE for 29 here, but I figured I have to get lucky, so I might as well take this gamble and hope to draw an S and something nice to go along with it.
>Dean: AMRU 13G ARUM +11 262
#note Shutting down the QUOINS/BOOKS/ and largely HEATS spots simultaneously. I can't let myself get into situations where my opponents can afford to do this very often; OSTIARY was just unlucky though to be fair.
>Chris: CEGIITZ M12 CIG +24 195
#note Even though I'm setting up an S I don't have again here, I feel like this sort of desperation is needed here 90 points down. I was hoping to get a big Z bingo and get back into the game rather than using it for 31 at N2 and probably getting hit with a reparallel at 01 or more points. ZIG/CIG F4 also don't make much sense to me.
>Dean: EF H13 .EF +18 280
#note At least I'm getting him to think I have the S hehe
>Chris: AEEITZ 14F ZE. +35 230
#note Don't have the last tile here.
>Dean: AO J6 O.A +14 294
#note Shutting down the lane to the D at K5
>Chris: DEIILOT 9F .OTI +20 250
#note Decided to wait a turn to try to open because every desperation opening play, like IDOL J1/TIOLE N1 are very easily blocked.
>Dean: IPS 14K PI.S +30 324
#note Now I really have to bingo; if I had gotten that spot instead, I could have considered keeping the board closed and trying to outscore.
>Chris: DEEEILS 10C DE..E +21 271
#note I was happy to see this; it breathes some life into the game and sims 2.5% ahead of the next best plays.
>Dean: ARV 9B VAR +13 337
#note He had the perfect way to block again though. It's looking really bleak at this point.
>Chris: EIILNRS L4 LI +14 285
#note This blocks the A at K4, but I didn't really know what to do. Simming best by 2%
>Dean: EERV 7B REVE. +13 350
#note I guess to block bingoes ending in M at E8 or 9's ending in AD? This did at least allow me to make one last attempt at opening this board though.
>Chris: ?EINRSU C3 URIN. +10 295
#note I drew the blank, so I had a little bit of hope. I played this to try to fork with 8 lanes through URI and the threat of hooking PURINE, either by drawing the P or using my blank as a P. This jumps to near the top of the sim, behind WADDINGS/US, which I don't understand. 
>Dean: EH D3 HE +19 369
#note Dean decided to block PURINE and the 8's lanes, but opened a 7's lane at D2-J2. He said he couldn't do any better than this, meaning he likely had a pretty ugly rack. This is the first time all game the door has cracked open a bit and I could see the sunlight of 10-0 on the other side haha.
>Chris: ?AEOSTW 2D TOWAgES +75 370
#note Q says ON 6b wins 26.5% and my play of immediately bingoing wins only 12.4%. With ON, it looks like i have unblockable bingos if I draw the G or the N. If I draw the A or the E, he can block the bingoes by playing HEN D3, since none of those bingoes start with the T required to make THEN. 
>Dean: EFGNPUX 3F EX +39 408
#note Only EX or EXING A5 wins for him - too bad this isn't exactly hard to find lolz. I can't find a tile for him to draw that loses if he finds the winning play, so I guess I should've played ON - tough to calculate in-game though.
>Chris: A F14 .A +11 381
#note I needed 5 more points to tie and 6 to win, but this is the best I could do. Almost made the heroic comeback - not upset at all about my play in this one, just wish that things had broken my way just a little more in this one, because if they did, I'd be the champion of Vancouver 2014 right now - but c'est la vie. Dean did a great job defensively and overall as usual.
>Chris:  (FGPUN) +22 403
