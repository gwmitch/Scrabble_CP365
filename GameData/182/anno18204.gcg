>Will: EEK I8 EEK +19 19
>Mack_: BIOORXY J6 BOX +31 55
#note I chose this over G9 BOXY since, should Will bingo, he will be forced to slot a tile in the triple lane, and I figured IORY>IOR as a leave.

>Mack_: EEIIJLR 4H JEE. +20 114
#note A very awkward rack for this position. I was debating between JEED and JERID, and ultimately decided the 6 points and avoidance of the cheap S spot was barely worth playing JEED. IILR is pretty ugly though, and in hindsight I kind of think JERID, which wins the sim by 2.5%, would have been better.

#note Couldn't decide between this and DOULA, but ultimately chose this to score a few more and unduplicate my vowels. Quackle agrees by 2%.
>Will: DNOUV 14D VODUN +15 242
>Mack_: AEGNORZ N6 ZA +36 272
#note I considered ZA, ZOA, AZON, ZONED, and 5E ZERO. I decided against AZON due to the O1 spot, and decided that ZA was superior to ZOA to keep the case O for a potential ORGANZA. ZA also keeps the O for plays underlapping JO next turn, which may be useful for closing the board. As it turned out, Will had SPARTAN ready to go at N2 so ZA worked well.
>Will: ANPRT E10 TARP.N +16 258
>Mack_: EEGINOR 5D REGION +25 297
#note This play scores, ends the game more quickly, goes for the blank and esses, and forces Will to bingo with a tile in a specific spot, so looks good.
>Will: AS 12K .A..S +16 274
>Mack_: ?ELQSTV N2 QuET..L +50 347
#note This puts me up 73, a deficit that will be very hard for Will to overcome with a single bingo especially since I preserve an S. With only 6 in the bag, Will will be unable to bingo twice and I will have full rack knowledge if he bingos now. After 11D QAT, I could potentially lose if Will bingos and leaves me little to work with, so this seemed best for sure. Quackle concurs, with QuETZAL winning the sim comfortably.
>Will: AI O1 AI +17 291
>Mack_: AGPRSUV F2 VUG. +17 364
#note I also thought about G9 PUG to obstruct a few more lanes, but figured the P was more flexible in an endgame if Will bingoed so decided to unload the V. Either way, it will be virtually impossible for Will to come back at this point.
