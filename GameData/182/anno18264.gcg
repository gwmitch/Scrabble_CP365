>Goutham: BELNOOY G4 BYE +26 286
#note Thought of either BLOONEY or BOLONEY being valid.
Wish i was 100% sure of BOLONEY. Really wish.
Either way i mistracked and thought there were only 2 As left so played BYE to block the easy OX hook. Probably wasnt the smartest idea considering Peter can just whack the triple spot at H1.
Like i said i wish i was 100% sure of boloney sigh.
>Peter_Shaw: ACFT 3F FACT +21 263
#note Can see how dangerous my horrible play was.
>Goutham: FHLNOOS I11 HOL. +22 308
#note Trying the block the T. Completely forgetting that DHOLE is valid.
Kids, dont play like me. Or atleast play like me but think more carefully about the moves u make.

Could have played FLOSH too. But yeah didnt really know that.
>Peter_Shaw: AMT J11 MAT.. +30 293
#note Well he helped me block off the DHOLE hook and the T atleast
>Goutham: DFINOSW 3F ....OIDS +28 336
#note Could have played FICOS but FACTOIDS closes off all the bingo lines for good. Plus it feels cool to extend words like that.
>Peter_Shaw: DUW N12 WUD. +16 309
#note I'll be completely honest. If he played something at H1, i would have been at a bad position given the rack i picked up.
