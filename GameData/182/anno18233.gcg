#note Never been so happy to draw AAIMO. 

I think my placement of this is correct as opposed to I8. I8 is much weaker to H12 plays and S plays, whereas G8 gives up the J.

#note I can use the same tiles to play (U)NGLUE. That almost has to be better because I'm opening up the bottom-left portion. Q suggests the aggro-as-hell LU(N)GEE and the "I'm going to score 12 or 74 next turn" EGG H13.

This was a very interesting turn to me. The club was giving away two prizes: a toonie for the highest-scoring X play and a toonie for the longest X word. So I can take a guaranteed $4 by playing here. BUT

If I fish off the R, I can draw UT into QUIXOTES for 100. The odds that I pull it are significantly higher than 2/11 because Mark's last play seemed quite strongly to indicate that he didn't have a U. But looking at QUIXOTES, it's only 100 and even if I bingo out with it, I will likely lose the game. So I took my guaranteed $4 and passed the chance to maybe win the game.
