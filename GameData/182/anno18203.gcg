>Mack_: ADGILNV 4J LAVING +28 50
#note I was somewhat reluctant to blow up my rack, but this looks fine.
>Joey: BDEY O4 .YBED +36 54
#note Scored as 39.
>Mack_: ACDFRST M3 D.SFRACT +86 136
>Mack_: ACDFRST --  -86 50
#note Wow. I really thought this was good. A smart and good challenge by Joey.
>Joey: EEE -EEE +0 54
>Mack_: ACDFRST M3 F.D +14 64
#note Thought about DRIFT to set up ADRIFT, but given that Joey knows I have an A and that he ay very well have an A this seems better.
>Joey: LR 8G L.R +3 57
>Mack_: ACJORST G3 JO. +25 89
#note Also considered CAJON, but given that Joey fished off two consonants didn't want to give him the A in the double double lane.
>Joey: AEIRSTT N8 ARTIEST +71 128

>Joey: AEO M11 .OEA +16 171
>Mack_: ?EFKSTV L9 VE.T +20 216
#note As awkward as this play looks, there isn't much else. K10 KIF, the other move I debated, sims about 3% worse.
>Joey: AHL 10I HAL. +20 191
>Mack_: ?FIKQSU 14G K.FI +13 229
#note I figured that, being down 40 on a closed board, Joey will often open the board and give me a good spot for my Q. 
>Joey: DIINR 9C INDRI +11 202
>Mack_: ?EOQRSU 8A ROQUE +62 291
#note I saw pIROQUES (missed cONQUERS but that is barely better), but this is clearly better than the bingoes here.
>Joey: ENNOPU E2 UNOPEN.. +22 224
>Mack_: ?EIIMSU F6 MU +22 313
#note Tough call here. I wanted to leave the R open so that I could have a shot at a counterbingo if Joey bingoed. This play is not bad, but D3 EMU looks better to unload the extra vowel.
>Joey: ?BEERTT A1 BaTTERE. +80 304
>Mack_: ?EEIISS 10B IS +16 329
#note I hated maing this play, but I was down to about a minute on my clock and had to play something. Apparently I should play 3A TIE, which wins 73% to IS's 60%.
>Joey: ACEIOXZ 12D ZOEA. +28 332
#note Actual rack. Joey said after the game that he wanted to block the possibility of AIrHOLES, and was considering a number of plays such as this, COXAL, A10 AZOIC, and ZOECIAL*. Given that I have B2 HOISE at a bare minimum and probably A10 ASHIEr, it will be very difficult for Joey to outrun me as he needs to make up about 70 points on two turns. It seems very difficult for Joey to win with a valid play, so might forcing me to challenge off the phoney ZOECIAL* be the way to go? Given that I am in severe time pressure, I may incorrectly assume I can still win without challenging it off. As it turns out I was pretty sure it was phoney so almost definitely would have challenged, but given my time pressure I could definitely see it working sometimes. This is a very tough call though, and no move seems clearcut.

>Mack_: E 3M .E +7 375
#note -11 to L4 VEE, but this is enough. Final score recorded as 383-373.
>Mack_:  (CI) +8 383
