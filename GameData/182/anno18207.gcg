>Chris_: AEEGMQU 8F QUAG +28 28
>Mike: KSY J8 SKY +33 33
#note Scored as 25? I usualy don't pay enough attention to my opponent's scores. I guess it helped me here...
>Chris_: EEMNOPW 9H WO. +20 48
#note I wanted to shut down the board against Mike because I anticipated him getting into time trouble on a closed board (he spent 7 min on SKY), but after WOK, if he gets a play at F10 that doesn't give much back, he's going to have a big scoreboard advantage and I'm the one that's going to be forced to open the board and give him something in the process.
>Mike: AER K9 EAR +22 55
>Chris_: EELMNPT L10 MELT +22 70
#note Bad bad bad... chickened out of PELMET. Thought about it for like 2 minutes too. L10 PENT is simming best actually, so I made a leave evaluation mistake too lol
>Mike: V H7 V.. +9 64
>Chris_: DEENPXY 14L YEN +22 92
#note EN(SKY)ED, keeping and setting up PYX K4, is sick and simming best. I picked YEN over YEP because i momentarily confused that YENS was the phony and not EYENS* (lol). I remembered after I played it at least. It looks like both MELT and YEN were somehow scored as 23 too hehe
>Mike: DIU 15M DUI +17 81
>Chris_: EILOPTX M11 XI +21 113
#note Tried to figure out how to exploit this situation. Hated giving up my X for 21, but there aren't any good X spots on this board anyway. This is simming best.
>Mike: BLO 13I BOL. +9 90
#note My plan to limit Mike's options seem to be working, and he's already under 10 minutes here.
>Chris_: CDEOPST 14H COP +27 140
#note Well, that's pretty perfect lol. Already just one lane left (VAWS), and my lead is magnified because of the dearth of scoring spots on this board, so I actually have a good chance of riding this out.
>Mike: EGT 15I GET +15 105
>Chris_: ADEFNST 10F FAS +24 164
#note Interesting move here. I could exchange the F and go for a bingo, but with such a clear path to winning, I figured that keeping up the scoring and preparing to block the final lane was more valuable. (Q)AT for 14 is an interesting option too - both moves function as threats to completely shut down the board on my next moe.
>Mike: DEZ 11E ZED +34 139
>Chris_: AADENRT 12D RAND +32 196
#note RAND makes it harder to parallel underneath than NARD in the same spot, but RAND takes B and G front hooks and NARD takes none. The sim likes RAND, but I think the danger in being outscored on this boar isn't that great, so I prefer NARD now. Fishing with something like AD for 21 seems nonsensical.
>Mike: ACR 11B CRA... +20 159
#note Nice opening move here, kinda hard to block everything without sacrificing.
>Chris_: ADEFNTU 10C EF +13 209
#note Maybe this goes too far, idk. I saw FECUND, but decided to go into full defensive shell mode here. Mike was down to like 3 minutes, so I figured he'd waste more time trying to figure out how to open this board.
>Mike: BOR 13B BRO +17 176
#note He's like: why you closing the board on me, bro? (He didn't actually say that hehe)
>Chris_: ADELNNU F10 ...NEL +11 220
#note Slapped this down quickly due to his time pressure. Couldn't see any moves that didn't open at least some scoring spots, but didn't want to exchange either. 
>Mike: EN J6 EN... +14 190
#note He opened the board! Damn, I didn't think that was possible haha
>Chris_: ADLNRUW -WUR +0 220
#note I changed 3, didn't record my rack. There weren't any good blocks of ENSKY or I'd have made them.
>Mike: IP 14A PI +16 206
#note He likely had the blank/other bingo stuff at this point. Something to remember is that because of the messed up scoring, I thought my lead was abot 15 more than it actually was here. Also, I knew I'd probably get at least 50 points from Mike's overtime. Therefore, I try to outscore in what looks like weird game situations to do so from hereon.
>Chris_: AILNRST 15A INSTA.L +41 261
#note RATLINS doesn't play, but I was very happy to see him play PI and give me another decent option :). This is simming better than ANIL keeping RST by about 3%
>Mike: ?DEIORS K1 SORDInE +67 273
#note Oh no! I need to turn in my defensive player of the year trophy i guess :(
>Chris_: EGJNORV J2 JO +52 313
#note Actually, it's all good :)
>Mike: IU 4K .UI +8 281
#note He's fishing in a polluted river now :P
>Chris_: EGINRV M3 R.VING +22 335
#note Don't have the 7th tile here. Obv shutting everything down now.
>Mike: IT 8M .IT +12 293
>Chris_: EHOTU 1K .HOUT +36 371
#note Don't have leaves from now on. This might look weird, leaving the T open for a bingo, but I had a 60 point overtime cushion at this point.
>Mike: EEEW O7 E.WEE +8 301
>Chris_: AAAHMT 2N HA +22 393
#note -11 to MATH I3, which I remember seeing. I don't even...
>Mike: ?IO C7 OIl.. +5 306
#note -1 to OsIER C7
>Mike:  (TAMA) +12 318
#note Final score recorded as 396-226. -80 to Mike for overtime and scoring errors lol. I felt guilty employing the clock against Mike in this game (he has dementia), but I rationalized that it was a tourney and I had to try to win. I wouldn't do it in a club game though. What do people think about this?
