>Thomas_Lackaff: LORRY H8 LORRY +24 24
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADDEIRT 11E TAR.IED +32 32
#note Q agrees with this but ID I8 is only 3.7 worse.
>Thomas_Lackaff: AGHN 10J HANG +32 56
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEGHIOP 12J HOG +27 59
#note 12J HOPED or HOP are apparently 1.0 better.

>Thomas_Lackaff: ?ACEQRU 8G C.AQUERs +69 125
#note Tom recognized his miss directly after playing this.
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEEIOPV 10D VIPE. +30 89
#note This appears to be best by just under a point over VIDEO 10D, although I do like the board a bit more after VIDEO.
>Thomas_Lackaff: IMNRU L3 MURIN. +16 141
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEOSTVZ 6K D.TZ +34 123
#note Q likes VOTED M2, scoring 33 leaving SZ. I think I'd play that if this game were to be repeated. Q secondly recommends ZE(s)TS N6, which is apparently 6.5 worse, then my play clocking in about 8pts worse.
>Thomas_Lackaff: MW I7 M.W +24 165
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABEFOSV 5H FAVO. +28 151
#note This stands out as Q's top, 7pts ahead of BEVOR in the same spot, and 8pts ahead of  FAVES 12A. I really had a difficult time here trying to choose over FAVES and FAVOR. In many ways I think FAVES is better because it turns over an extra tile, scores 5 more, and burns the first S, maximizing a draw for a second. If I could play this game again, I'd play FAVES , even though its technically worse.
>Thomas_Lackaff: AKO 6F KOA +22 187
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABEIOOS 3I BIO.E +18 169
#note Q says BOO M1, the play I was largely set on, yet I got convinced row A was to easy to cash in on for easy points, and I'm already down thirty. I figured with BIOME I'm turning over an extra tile and making the board a bit more volatile. BIOME is 2.6 worse than BOO.
>Thomas_Lackaff: LU D8 LU. +7 194
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEFOSTU 8A FOU. +21 190
#note I played this, Q's top instantly, based on its decent score and dynamite leave, yet LUV may be opening lane for the second blank. Regardless, whether he has it or not, I have to open the board here, although I did consider the crazy FOU 2M before LUV went down. Besides, maybe later in the game the Y may be useful from O1 to O6!
>Thomas_Lackaff: ?ADEERT A8 .EDERATe +86 280
#note FoREDATE for 3 more.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABEESTX 2H TAX +55 245
#note Speaking of Y's, I needed an available one for EXABYTES. But that's beside the point. I miss an available bingo here that would have turned around the initiative. TEAB(O)XES.
