>Kevin: CEIJNT 8D INJECT +32 32
#note He passed up 4 more points at H8 to avoid easy extensions. Little did he know what was to come..
>Chris: AEFMOSU J4 FUMES +32 32
#note OF 9F seems pretty clear here; and Q like the purer fish FOU C7 too. I was clearly fuming from finally losing last round. I actually told Kevin before the game that he had a tilted opponent lolz. FUMES is -4%
>Kevin: IX 4J .IX +26 58
#note I'm fixin' to phony I think!
>Chris: AEOPRY 8A PRE....... +63 95
#note Only have 6 tiles here but I'm not going to make a real play, so why do I need a real rack? Scored as 60 :(
>Kevin: BLW G6 BL.W +14 72
#note He held it and then blew any chances he had of challenging it by playing this :P
>Chris: AADEIOY F8 .AY +26 121
#note This is simming close to the top with AUDIO I5, but I missed that and like it better for sure.
>Kevin: ?ENRSTV A8 .ReVENTS +89 161
#note STRiVEN M3 is 92
>Chris: ABDEIIO E10 OBIA +17 138
#note A(U)DIO again! C'mon, snap out of it, past self!
>Kevin: EOOZ 3K OOZE +37 198
#note A train containing very volatile chemicals just arrived at the station
>Chris: ADEEIIK O1 KADI +45 183
#note Can I manage to leave one good leave this game? Guess not...
>Kevin: EI H7 I.E +13 211
#note Ice ice baby
>Chris: DEEGIMN 10H DEEMING +74 257
#note ICE ICE BABY
>Kevin: EILORST 12C RO.LIEST +68 279
#note I think I like L6 a little better but one of those is certainly the safest and best play.
>Chris: AAFPQRU N2 F.AR +26 283
#note In order to lose to you, they must respect you. And to respect you, they must fear you. I trusted that maxim blindly and missed FAQUIR D4, which beats this in the sim by 3.5%. yikes lol. I was hoping to draw QAT at D12 too though.
>Kevin: AL F5 LA +10 289
#note La la la keeping scoring 10 points and I'll sing you any lullaby you want as your game goes to sleep... zzz
>Chris: APQUUUW L8 QU.PU +52 335
#note I felt really good here, considering I'm going up by 45 and am keeping the last U for L8-O8. I was so happy he didn't block the spot, or I'd be in big trouble.
>Kevin: ADEGINR D3 DEAIR.NG +77 366
#note Nice fit. I indulged in a little internal rage here, since I thought that I'd turned it around and was in control after QUIPU hehe
>Chris: AOOTTUW C2 TOW +23 358
#note Pretty ridic that I can't get anything down at L8 - doing so would still leave me with a small advantage here. I didn't want to play B3 OUTWAR here, because I wanted to keep my U for l8. I can draw QUAI, QUOD, QUAY, QATS, QUAD, or QUAG there and i'm drawing 3, so I should hit one of them here
>Kevin: NVY H12 .NVY +30 396
#note What i drew instead is not exactly envious...
>Chris: AAAHOTU B2 AHA +29 387
#note Let's try that again, shall we?
>Kevin: CO N8 CO. +6 402
#note Kevin wisely blocks the spot, just in time.
>Chris: AEGLOTU 14H .OLTAGE +26 413
#note Here, I go completely off the reservation and throw away about 14% win according to Q. My logic was that the pool is so scary that I'd rather score and dig for S? and H (to score) and try to win that way. But it's extremely likely that Kevin has at least one of those tiles, in which case he'll either use the H at L15 or hook the S or ? to make voltages and i'm pretty much screwed. Q is liking GO A1 for 12 best - i'dk if I agree with that sine Kevin will block the lanes at the bottom if he doesn't have a bingo himself. 11K UPO looks like the best combination of fishing and scoring and leaves one in the bag. It's 3rd on Q with 14.9% win, but I'd play it given another chance here.
>Kevin: ?DHINOS 15L HODS +51 453
#note GG
>Chris: ERTU C11 T.UER +10 423
#note The only outplay, +13 to ET M13.
>Chris:  (IN?) +4 427
#note Final score recorded as 452-424. It felt like I was outplaying him and deserved the win in-game, but as usual looking at i now I can see that I deserve nothing and should revert to relying on the luckbox to win games hehe
