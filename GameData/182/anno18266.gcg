#note I felt like ADMIXT would give me the game seeing the tiles in the bag. And also a bingo would be really easy to make with the open AR hook available so i felt like i needed to block.

Probably could have just fished off the XI by playing PIX and hoping to pull MANDRELS (3 Es left so its possible) and also threaten a bingo with AR. But like i said these risks are not really worth taking when you have a nice safe option to win.
