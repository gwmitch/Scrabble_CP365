>Jim_Burlant: AAEIKMW 8G WEKA +22 22
#note Best play here, which I didn't know, is 8H WAKAME.  AWAKE is the best non-WAKAME option, but I didn't like giving him the easy N back hook.
>Stephen_Sneed: AIOT 9F IOTA +21 21
>Jim_Burlant: ABIIMSY E6 IAMBI +16 38
#note This play is about knowing what you can get away with against whom.  My gut told me that Stephen didn't know the back-hook to IAMBI, so I figured I'd get cute and set myself up to score there later.  I would not even consider this play against anyone else in this field.  Don't ask me how, but this play was incorrectly scored as 25.  WTF?
>Stephen_Sneed: DO F5 OD +14 35
>Jim_Burlant: EGIQSVY D10 QIS +35 73
#note Maybe if I'd looked harder, I'd have found K4 GYVES, the sim winner; this play sims a close second.  Regardless, on this turn I started getting a bad feeling about how this game was progressing; I'd continually have to play off the handful of bingo-prone tiles (i.e., my S) I was getting in order to get rid of the crud while he was continually dumping his one and two-point tiles.
>Stephen_Sneed: CEIT 4C ETIC +18 53
#note My gamble pays off; ETIC 11B scores 36.  Now, can I land the other C and score with it?
>Jim_Burlant: EEGVWYY 3B WYE +30 103
#note Best, nothing else sims within 5 points.
>Stephen_Sneed: GHINPRS J5 PHR.SING +82 135
#note Stephen has a definite edge here and he's winning 58%.
>Jim_Burlant: EGVY K2 GYVE +30 133
#note I didn't write this rack down correctly - whoops.   As clunky as these racks have been, at least I'm still in the game.
>Stephen_Sneed: MU 4K .UM +16 151
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHIRT 2E HERITA.E +66 199
#note Missing HERNIATE 11G for 72.  HERNIATE is definitely the better play, and this choice not surprisingly sims as a 9-point runner up.
>Stephen_Sneed: ILN 1H LIN +19 170
>Jim_Burlant: EEGNSUV 1A VENUE +32 231
#note 1A VENGE is the sim winner, with this choice the runner-up.  I didn't see VENGE; I wanted to clear out the U.
>Stephen_Sneed: DENR 1L REND +21 191
>Jim_Burlant: BDGNOSU C11 BUG +18 249
#note Didn't know most of the choices, here. Sim winner is 12 DUGONG (OK, I know it but never would find it), 13J SUNDOG and 12J GUNDOG.
>Stephen_Sneed: EJR 6B JER.. +29 220
>Jim_Burlant: ACDNOST 7H TO.C +18 267
#note Quackle likes a bunch of uber-dangerous plays on row 7 - NOD 7A, 7B OD...no thanks.  I  didn't think of 13I ASCOT, which is probably the best of the lot - most likely didn't occur to me to back-hook PHRASING with an S.
>Stephen_Sneed: LOOT K10 TOOL +17 237
>Jim_Burlant: AADNRSX 12J ..X +22 289
#note Sim prefers 3M AX - uh...not with ??EE still unseen, thank you very much.  L12 RAX would have been a solid play had I seen it.  I was preoccupied with keeping my R since only 1 was in the pool.
>Stephen_Sneed: ?AFLRSU 14E jARFULS +68 305
#note 14H jARSFUL would have scored 77 and I'd be in a much worse position.  
>Jim_Burlant: AADNRSZ H11 ZAR.S +54 343
#note No brainer here, nothing else sims within 9 points.
>Stephen_Sneed: IP 13K .IP +19 324
>Jim_Burlant: ADFNOOT N13 ADO +14 357
#note The sim said ZARFS won approximately 55%, but the unseen pool made me feel anything but secure.  And his play of LIP was terrific.  Not only did it generate another threat for me to have to defend, but given that he had just drawn 7 from this pool I had to assume he was sitting on the blank and that he had probably drawn another blank bingo.  I figured that the best I could do would be to take away his easy hooks and force him to find an 8 either from the D or through/from the M.   Most of Quackle's suggestions here make sense...but only if your opponent is a computer.  Quackle says I should let him have the easy back-hooks to LIP and instead put down 3M OF or OFT.  But that's because Quackle is guaranteed to never miss the out bingo, which means my best play is to concede the loss and minimize spread.  But this is the difference between playing a human and playing a machine.  And this determined how the game played out as you'll soon see.
>Stephen_Sneed: ?AADLNO M4 .ADrONAL +61 385
>Stephen_Sneed: ?AADLNO --  -61 324
#note Several nervous minutes for me as Stephen burned his clock to under 00:05  before putting this down, as my play of ADO had blocked his planned bingo of vANLOAD.   Lucky for me he couldn't think of MANDOLAS, which is the only playable bingo.   For the record, the 7's in this rack are CALANDO, GONADAL, MANDOLA/MONADAL, DALAPON, VANLOAD, and DANAZOL.  I wouldn't have found any of them.
>Jim_Burlant: EEFNOT 15L FO.T +33 390
#note If I know he has MANDOLAS, I probably make a blocking play at M3.  I didn't know he had bingos and it was obvious by his resigned expression as we walked back from the adjudicator that he didn't know he had any, either.
>Stephen_Sneed: ?AADLNO 7A NOD +20 344
#note He was down under 5 seconds and understandably playing quite rushed here.
>Jim_Burlant: EEN O1 .ENE +6 396
#note Missing A7 NENE for 12.  Final score recorded as 413 - 343.
>Jim_Burlant:  (?AAL) +6 402
