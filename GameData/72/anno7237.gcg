>Pat_Barrett: ADFO 8E FADO +16 16
#note I don't know her entire rack, but Pat wasn't sure which was the better placement; she initially put this down at 8G, picked it up, and put this back down at 8E.  The sim says there's not a whole lot of difference between the two; at 1000 2-ply iterations the 8G placement leads 8E by barely 1  point - style preference.  But for this game, it cost Pat an awful lot.
>Jim_Burlant: EEFOORR E5 REO.FER +52 52
#note Saw REROOFED and thought it was phony.  This play is the second best choice.  
>Pat_Barrett: AEU D11 EAU +8 24
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEIOO D2 OBOE +14 66
#note Sim winner is G8 DOOBIE; this choice finishes 3rd, roughly 1 pt behind the runner up, 7G OBOE which I rejected.
>Pat_Barrett: EQY 13C Q.EY +32 56
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIIT 3B TI.IAE +18 84
#note Best, nothing else comes within 5 points in the sim.
>Pat_Barrett: IORZ 2F ZORI +66 122
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGNRV 10E .NGRAVED +73 157
#note I'm surprised that the sim thinks my choice is the better placement; after I hit the clock, I realized that the open spot at 6F could allow an unseen X to burn me for 50+.  But the difference in the sim is nominal, with this choice winning by barely 0.3 pts at 800+ iterations.
>Pat_Barrett: AGLNO 1H ALONG +32 154
>Jim_Burlant: AACDEII L7 ACE.IA +24 181
#note Yuck.  I initially studied this word as a 7, but once I studied the 4-vowel sixes it seemed to make me forget that there's a legitimate 7.  This is a solid non-bingo option.

#note ENWINDS!
>Pat_Barrett: EHW 8L .HEW +36 218
>Jim_Burlant: ?ENSTTU N1 UNSETTl. +76 299
#note Amazed I found this given how many other bingos I've missed.  There are any number of strong choices here, and this is one of them.  Other options include 15A UNSTATED or UNTESTED, I6 UNSTATES.   Despite doing my utmost to give this game away, I'm winning 89%.  
>Pat_Barrett: GM 11K M.G +20 238
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEJMOS I9 J.M +24 323
#note Wasn't entirely sure if  this (JETSOM B1 scores 42), but this sims best.  Nothing else sims within 10 points.  
>Pat_Barrett: PRY K5 PRY +21 259
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEIOSU 15G E.aCIOUS +61 384
#note DIECIOUS, which I didn't know, is clearly the best play.  Though this gives up a huge amount of equity, it's still enough to clinch the game.  The sim confirms this is now over except for the final score.
>Pat_Barrett: IKNS B2 S.INK +38 297
>Jim_Burlant: ALORTVX F5 AX +53 437
#note Best - too many points to pass up, regardless of the leave.
