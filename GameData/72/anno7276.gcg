#note Only, but it plays for 1 more at J3.  Oops.
>Matt_Hopkins: IMPSS D9 MIPS +23 54
#note Giving him credit for another S.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGNOUU D1 GENUA +26 205
#note Very happy to see this in that mess.  Best.
>Matt_Hopkins: ENOORSW 12D .WOONERS +62 116
#note Or SWOON(I)ER J3 65.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEOUV H12 .EVE +21 226
#note E11 A(W)EE 22.  This is down a ways.
>Matt_Hopkins: HO 9B HO.. +13 129
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEORUW 11I WAUR +25 251
#note I was debating between WAUR and WA(XI)ER, but didn't want to open the 3x3 after that fish.  U(P)O or (P)OW is still pretty strong.  Q's still out, which makes the U not as worrisome, but still, there's two other Us to deal with.  WAUR is so far down, I guess, 'cause of the three-vowel leave.
>Matt_Hopkins: ?ACILOR 15H .ROtICAL +80 209
#note WA(XI)ER would've given him CARRIOLE or CORRIVAL.  Of note: 15A bRACIOL(E) 86.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEFNOT 10H DEF +35 286
#note Don't get why I should keep the D, but okay.  Maybe for a play at 14F?
>Matt_Hopkins: IQ 5C Q..I +14 223
>Ryan_Fischer: DEHNOTV 8A VET +25 311
#note No Ses or blanks left; DEVON 13J 29 is fine.  POH is okay, but I wanted to lose the V first.  Hence, VET.
>Matt_Hopkins: FITY 5J FI..T +30 253
#note Excellent setup play; he told me he had the Y.  I could never be sure.  It wasn't too long ago that I first realized this doesn't take an S, only a Y.
>Ryan_Fischer: HILMNOP 2A INM..H +38 349
#note INMESH is best, but I was worried about him hitting DITZ in response.  Although, DITZY is possible, too, which would be 104 points worth of disaster!
>Matt_Hopkins: BEGIY O1 BEIGY +58 311
#note Very very nice.
>Ryan_Fischer: DELNOOP A1 P.NOLE +27 376
#note D(I)POLE/D(I)PLOE is the only thing better than P(I)NOLE.  Feel like I really dodged a bullet.
>Matt_Hopkins: AERUZ 1F AZURE +47 358
#note Reason I didn't block is he'd have at least ZA for 46 down low, too.  And of course DITZ was still in play.  I created that monster on my own.  I have to wonder if I'd just block FIXITY with (LA)IN or something, how things would be different?
>Ryan_Fischer: DEKNOTU F10 KN.UT +21 397
#note 6G TOKED 25
>Matt_Hopkins: BDEO 4G BODE +13 371
#note He really made a great comeback.  Way too close for comfort, and I got kind of sloppy 'cause it was the end of the tourney and I was nowhere near in competition and spread didn't matter.  Yeah, sloppy, but a win is a win.
