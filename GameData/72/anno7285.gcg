>Verbie: EIIIILT -III +0 0
#note Top.  Exchanging all four Is is next, .6 back.
>M_Gabriel: AHIO 8F OHIA +14 14
>Verbie: CEILNST J2 CLIENTS +75 75
#note 9D for 1 less, but improved defense, is interesting.
>M_Gabriel: AADLNRS 4G LAN.ARDS +70 84
#note Especially given this.
>Verbie: ADIILSX H1 IXI. +33 108
#note Got panicked by the double-I return.  AXIAL splits the vowel structure for more points.  Strangely, this is trumped by just plopping the X at K5. (-2.3)
>M_Gabriel: DEMN 9F MEND +27 111
>Verbie: ADILSTY 10I STAIDLY +69 177
#note The only way to bingo.
>M_Gabriel: ADIQ 7C QAID +30 141
>Verbie: AEFOOUW O7 OFA. +30 207
#note Next best is the drek-clearing WOFUL N6.  But that's 4 back.
>M_Gabriel: CEGOTT D3 COTT.GE +24 165
>Verbie: AEHIOUW 8A WHI. +44 251
>M_Gabriel: GZ K9 Z.G +26 191
>Verbie: AEEFOOU K3 O.F +24 275
#note This was just a choice of evils.  3L EAU is best of a bad lot.  (-6.5)  This was even 2.5 behind the Grand Punt (meaning exchange 7).
>M_Gabriel: OV 2F VO. +21 212
>Verbie: AEEOPUU 3M EAU +14 289
#note Best of another list of horrid choices.  When Grand Punt is only 3.6 back...
>M_Gabriel: KOR 3B RO.K +20 232
>Verbie: EELOPUV B2 P.OVE +24 313
#note Second best, but 13 behind UPDOVE M8.  Somehow UPDIVE seems like a contradiction, just like "meteoric rise."  Meteors FALL.
>M_Gabriel: BMO A1 MOB +38 270
>Verbie: BELPRUU 2L URP +24 337
#note CLUB 2J scores 3 less, but the P is a better keep than the B.  Strangely, though, URB in this spot is half a point back.  Maybe keeping BLE with ??AAII unseen has its advantages?
>M_Gabriel: ?EEGINR 12G GREIsEN +79 349
#note Oh.  That's where they were.  <<Misscored as 77.>>
>Verbie: AABELUU 13L LUAU +14 351
#note -4 to VATU 5B.  I almost suckered myself into TUBAL 5D (IXIA-L*)... which Nigel Richards could probably get away with.
>M_Gabriel: EJT O12 J.TE +57 406
>Verbie: ABEISTY 10D STEY +38 389
#note -14 to the fish of COTTAGEY.  Um, assume Marty blocks line 14.  What then?
>M_Gabriel: EENNRRW B8 .EWER +19 425
#note Imagine my surprise when the useless blank shows up.
>Verbie: ?ABEI E10 .ErBIA +14 403
#note Best is BAIzE A11 28.
