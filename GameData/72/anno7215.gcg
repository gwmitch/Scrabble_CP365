>Matthew_Larocque: ??DEJRY I1 JoYRiDE. +72 72
#note JERSEYED is the killer play as a double-double, but I didn't know it.
>Mike_Ryan: ACEIOST G5 ACO.ITES +62 128
#note Surprised he didn't find COA(l)IEST.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEMOOR 1G MO.O +39 111

>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEORU 10E OU.BARED +65 176
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEORU --  -65 111
#note Really stupid play. I knew it wasn't acceptable, and most phonies starting with the OUT prefix won't fly. I saw (T)ABOURED but thought tabour was only a noun. I know I thought about ARBOURED, and I don't know why I didn't try it. (L)ABOURED totally eluded me.
>Mike_Ryan: ACINRST 11E CR.ATINS +90 243
#note And, this should have been blocked last turn.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEORU 10J BAUD +27 138
#note ARBOURED still available. 
>Mike_Ryan: AINV D4 VINA. +16 259
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIORRS 6G .O.ER +10 148
#note What do you do if you don't know ORRERIES? Besides study more words...
>Mike_Ryan: EW 2F WE +17 276
#note I had been looking at this spot a little too hard, and I think he suspected I was going to score big here. Not really, actually.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIORSVY 12J OYER +31 179
#note I should probably be fishing for a bingo here, but I usually end up netting more points simply getting 25 - 35 point plays.
>Mike_Ryan: AEHP H11 .HAPE +51 327
#note Well, I held here. I'm not sure why it seemed familiar, because it's invalid. Damn it. If I hadn't had a bingo, I likely would have challenged.
>Matthew_Larocque: BIOOSUV N4 OBVIOUS +82 261
>Mike_Ryan: GHIN O1 NIGH +45 372
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEGNQW 3E NEW +27 288
#note I was wanting to keep qd here in case I grabbed a U, but the chances of that triple staying open were next to impossible.
>Mike_Ryan: IPT O7 TIP +27 399
>Matthew_Larocque: DEFGLOQ 13L DELF +25 313
#note Silly play, not sure why I'm hanging onto the Q. GOLFED would have been nice, but somehow I stopped thinking about LEANER hooks at this point.
>Mike_Ryan: OX N1 OX +38 437
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIMNQR C5 QI +24 337
#note I basically needed to draw the Z and cash it for 60-something, but Mike wasn't about to let that happen.
>Mike_Ryan: AIKL B6 KAIL +35 472
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGMNRZ A5 GAMA +39 376
#note ZA(P) for 34 gives me an abnormally large change to win compared to any other play. Some kind of longshot bingo down the A column? Anyways, I thought I could maximize my score by taking 39 here, and then play the Z in another hotspot. GRAMA for 48 is even better, if I knew that.
>Mike_Ryan: DGLTTU 15C GUTTL.D +10 482
#note Seeing this play, ZA(P) would have really put him in a bind. Hm.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINRUZ O13 .IZ +45 421
>Mike_Ryan: T F2 ..T +6 488
>Mike_Ryan:  (EENRU) +10 498
#note Enough stupid plays to cost me. My draws were good, I just don't know enough words to take full advantage of it.
