#note Best.
>Pat_Barrett: ?DOORRT H1 ReDROOT. +77 117
#note Best bingo for Pat, and she's winning 78% or thereabouts.
>Jim_Burlant: ELRSTUV 10D R.VULETS +71 105
#note Glad she didn't take the I away.  This is the only playable bingo.  While I'm in the game, I'm still winning only 35%.
>Pat_Barrett: UV H10 .UV +10 127
>Jim_Burlant: AKLMNQU K5 QUALM. +34 139
#note 2C MANQUE wins the sim, with this choice the runner up by 1 point.  Nothing else sims within 3 points of this.
>Pat_Barrett: ADEPY 8J P.AYED +39 166
>Jim_Burlant: EEFKLNT F6 KE. +22 161
#note Any number of better options here; my mind blanked and I couldn't think of any of them.   M7 FYKE wins the sim, and N5 KEEF is the runner up. 
>Pat_Barrett: EEILOSS 3B OILSEE.S +72 238
#note Best bingo, and Pat is  now winning 85%.
>Jim_Burlant: EFLNNRT B2 F.NT +14 175
#note None of the options here are especially good, but this play percolates towards the top of the heap after not much time.  Quackle prefers F2 FEN for 14, with this play simming roughly 1-1/2 points down.  2F FREE also worth consideration.
>Pat_Barrett: AW 9C WA. +27 265
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILNR N7 R.NAILED +72 247
#note Quackle prefers this placement by a hair over N2.  
>Pat_Barrett: CMO O13 MOC +28 293
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABCDIT L4 BIT +23 270
#note The only bingo I saw was the no-go ABDICATE.  CATBIRDS and TRIBADIC play on row 1 for low 60's, but I would have passed on those even if I had seen them.  The sim agrees with this choice - this play wins the sim and is the only play simming above 50%.

>Jim_Burlant: ?ACDENO 1C CONEl.AD +61 331
#note FAIL.   I spent nearly 6 minutes on this rack and this lame airball was the only thing I could come up with.  I was not at all happy with this when I put it down.  The star play is O1 DEACONED, and I'll give myself a pass for missing that - I never knew DEACON was a verb.  But there's no excuse for missing R(O)mANCED.  This mistake left me no margin for error for the rest of this game.
>Pat_Barrett: OPTU 3K POUT +18 331
>Jim_Burlant: ABEHHIR M11 BAH +38 369
#note Quackle prefers HEH to this choice - I wanted to keep the H so I could play at either O4 to block possible Y hooks, or at 9J.
>Pat_Barrett: AOZ D12 AZO +30 361
>Jim_Burlant: EEGHIIR 9I HI. +26 395
#note The sim likes this play best; Championship Player prefers GEEZ.   I had initially put down GEEZ, but pulled it up because I didn't like my prospects if I kept duplicated I's.  According to championship player, both this play and GEEZ win 75%, though GEEZ has better valuation. 
>Pat_Barrett: EFIIIRY 13B FI. +30 391
>Jim_Burlant: EEEGIR O4 GREE. +11 406
#note This end game is going to be incredibly close no matter how I play it.  Three plays win outright and a 4th ties in this position.  The outright winners are B11 RIFE, B13 FIE, and O5 GIED, and RIFE does the best job preserving spread. F12 EGER ties.   My thinking was too inflexible here.  Ever since she put down POUT, I had been preoccupied with defending the Y hook at O3; so much so that I didn't sufficiently think the end game through and realize that I could let her have RAY O1 for 28 and still win if I set myself up correctly.    
>Pat_Barrett: AEIRY B10 REI.Y +26 417
#note When I put down GREED, Pat's comment was, "Well, so much for that plan."  But it didn't take her long to make me realize I hadn't made my best play when I put down GREED.
>Jim_Burlant: EI I3 .EI +7 413
#note Best, but 2 points too short.  Too many mistakes.
>Jim_Burlant:  (A) +2 415
