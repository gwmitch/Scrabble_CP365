#note FEE opens the 3x3 with him exchanging 6.  How lucky do I feel?  Figured with this lead, why chance anything?  F(R)EEBIE I didn't see, but wouldn't play it either.  Prefered just killing the hook.

#note CHEES(E)?  Really?  CHEG(O)E is a decent option.

#note Yeah, GITS is better, I guess.

#note Saw (E)GO, didn't want to leave two As.  I've been told it's bad for bingoing, okay for scoring.  (H)AG is weak, but couldn't think of anything else.  I also saw OAST 6E. Showy, scores, but bingo prospects aren't as great.  G(E)NOA is cool, as is GA(Z)O(O).  HAG at least gives me both hooks for the G.

#note MIN(N)OW would have been fun had DELE not been there.  I saw INDOW but not the spot.  8A again for 47!  DOW(N) for 23 or AM(N)IO for 30 are next.

#note D1 plays are better as it's harder to reach the triple to counter.
