#note Um... sure. 
>M_Milkent: IT 9G IT +21 43
>Verbie: ?DEFHKU 8L FEUD +50 72
#note So far, looking good.
>M_Milkent: ?AIRRSU 10D RAIS +18 61
>Verbie: ?DHKTVY F9 K.TH +18 90
#note I underestimate the negativity of the V.  Even TIVY here is better... but I plain don't see DAVY E9.  (-12)
>M_Milkent: EINOPSS O8 .OPINESS +86 147
#note That would have happened anyway...
>Verbie: ?DEORVY 13D OVERDrY +76 166
#note Missing OVERDYe, but more tellingly miss same into the new S in the corner. (-22)
>M_Milkent: ERTV 12A VERT +26 173
>Verbie: BEFINRY B10 FI.RY +38 204
#note Second best to BEEFY in the same spot.  (-3)
>M_Milkent: AEGRSTU A7 URGE +20 193
#note Why Marlene told me about this rack in particular, I'm no longer certain.  Best here is DUG H13, keeping a lights-out AERST.
>Verbie: BCEEENN N11 BENE +24 228
#note Can't do a thing about line 6...
>M_Milkent: AESTU H13 .UE +12 205
#note Should I assume something powerful?  (besides the AST from before which I couldn't have known at the time)  This was likely on the order of AEENSTU, but that's just guessing.
>Verbie: ACEGMNO J6 C.ANG +18 246
#note Self-descriptive.  A bad miss, best is COMA M10. (-20)
>M_Milkent: AEINOST 6B ATONIES +68 273
#note Playing defense here, sacrificing 2 points vs B1.
>Verbie: DEMNOOT M12 MOOD +28 274
#note Still anybody's game...
>M_Milkent: AAPT L10 ATAP +30 303
>Verbie: ?BELNRT M7 ..B +11 285
#note Is it really better to drop the only vowel with BEL 5D 20?  Apparently yes (-3.5)
>M_Milkent: AAM 7C AMA +15 318
>Verbie: ?DELNRT 15D aNTL.RED +58 343
#note (-1) to either TENDERLy, RoNDELET, REDoLENT through the same E.  Now if I can just get a couple of JXZ and avoid all those Is I can pull this off...
>M_Milkent: CGIJLOU C6 ..J +10 328
>Verbie: IIILUXZ B5 Z. +11 354
#note This is where I imagine Nigel Richards would get away with IXIAL* again.  The actual best is to drop the third I at E11.  (-13)
