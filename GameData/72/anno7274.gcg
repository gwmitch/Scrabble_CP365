>Mitchell_Brook: CEFLT 8D CLEFT +26 26
>Ryan_Fischer: EJNRVVX -JVVX +0 0
#note F7 V(E)RVE 19.  I was going with the wisdom not to play through this crap early on.
>Mitchell_Brook: AMPR D8 .RAMP +22 48
>Ryan_Fischer: BENQRRW 10B BR.WN +18 18
>Mitchell_Brook: EZ F6 ZE. +32 80
>Ryan_Fischer: DEJQRTT -DJQT +0 18
#note Ugh.  And apparently DERT is better, but I don't like keeping Ds.
>Mitchell_Brook: EOU 11D .OUE +24 104
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEEGRT 12G DETERGE +73 91
#note Finally a break.
>Mitchell_Brook: AIKN G3 KINA +24 128
>Ryan_Fischer: AAIILOT H1 ALIT +24 115
#note 9G AIOLI or AALII 15.  I guess it's better, but I wanted to kill the H1 spot.  It could've been worse.
>Mitchell_Brook: AMOR 11J ROAM +25 153
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIOOVY 13I OVA +19 134
#note CRAMPY IS good!  13C OY looks kay.  Or IVY, but too many vowels.  Either way I proceed it's gonna be ugly, but I need the points.  I opted for something that got rid of another vowel and the V.
>Mitchell_Brook: GIT I1 GIT +18 171
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIOSUY J2 DEY +27 161
#note CRAMPY/YOU is the winner.
>Mitchell_Brook: AILNV K4 ANVIL +21 192
>Ryan_Fischer: FIIORSU L1 FOUR +34 195
>Mitchell_Brook: EW 10L WE +17 209
>Ryan_Fischer: BIIJOST N6 JOIST +38 233
#note JIB is kinda ballsy.  I'm figuring him for a bingo after WE, but how likely is it it'll end in O_(_)?  I figured I'd take the right column, and then if he bingos down low, at least I have some comebacks, as it'll be subpar.  I didn't want to play JOIST hooking CRAMPS 'cause that'd give too much back.  But who knows, maybe it's better.
>Mitchell_Brook: ?AEINSU 14C INUlASE +59 268
#note Lucky for me, he missed the higher scoring plays.
>Ryan_Fischer: BINOQRY O5 BORN +35 268
#note Best, but it sure took me a long time to arrive at that conclusion on my own!
>Mitchell_Brook: HS 15G SH +32 300
>Ryan_Fischer: EHIIQSY 15A QIS +38 306
>Mitchell_Brook: OPX 13A POX +44 344
#note Aw, shucks.  But lucky for me, he missed shifting it two to the right to play PIS/CRAMPON/POX/XU for 56(!).
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEHIY M3 HEY +35 341
#note If SH wasn't there, I'd have HAYRIDE for 111!  Yet another best eval'ed play, but champ says EDH is second.  I'm actually inclined to take EDH in hindsight, because the Y would be valued for scoring, and with that leave I might be able to hit O10 for something substantial.
>Mitchell_Brook: CDEO N12 DECO +25 369
#note He saw the threat and blocked, guessing rightly that DETERGE takes a D.  I think I'm sunk.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AADIIT 15L DI.l +18 359
#note I was so fixated on TRUE(BORN) that I forgot LAST(BORN) (not that I had it).  Low on time, I slapped down the only thing I could find, surrendering.  Champ suggests DIs(C)I, then A(P)T, which loses by like 21.
>Mitchell_Brook: EGLNU 1L .LUE +21 390
#note Champ's suggestion of DIs(C)I, it turns out, was to block GLE(EME)N M7 42 (!!).
