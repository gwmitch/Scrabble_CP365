>Mike_Lean: CINNOSW M3 IN +28 166
#note i strongly considered WIN, but was too scared of TWIN.  strongly coinsidered COIN, but didn't think it was worth the extra 8 points if i'm already up, i really don't want to give her easy points on that triple.  i don't see quackle's thought process in using the S here if there's only 1 left
>Lorraine_Burton: IKNS N3 SINK +33 135
#note k now i really have the last S

#note according to our score, it was 365-371.  i was thinking LI, but where the hell am i putting the U if i play it?  i thought for like 7 minutes about this.   i thought somehow there would be a SLIGHT chance of winning if i played TUI then YELL.  bleh i dunno
