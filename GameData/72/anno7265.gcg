>Clay: EEINOT D7 E.ONITE +18 18
#note (As C lays down tiles) D: I see what's coming.
#note C: No, not quite, only 18.
#note D: That's a 1980's play, going for turnover, man.
>Dave: CEGILOT 13D .CLOGITE +63 89
>Clay: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 18
#note D: That's what you get for giving away all those good tiles before.
>Dave: GRRSTTT F7 T.RT +6 95
#note GIRT might be better, but I was trying to take away as many of the open vowels he could play through at once.

#note Turning over more tiles to help the Q is more important than saving the S here.
>Clay: CIJNT K10 INJ.CT +30 78
#note If he hadn't gone there I was seriously considering MURDER K9 to set up the Q at 10J.

#note Maybe MATURE, but it makes the O column much easier to use for him.
>Clay: AMNOW C3 WOMAN +25 151
>Dave: ABDGHMR B5 HM +30 215
#note BAH scores seven more and turns over another tile with blanks unseen, but it also makes it easier for him to hit a big play on the A line.  But there's no good excuse for playing HM here instead of at D4 for the same score.

#note A funny common in English but uncommon in Scrabble unplayable bingo.  I laid down DIEHARD for a moment here, but with two S's, two blanks unseen and his last moving hinting at a strong rack it would be suicide.  Maybe HADED, which I couldn't remember for sure, but playing an extra vowel is good here, as the bag is rife with blanks and vowels.
>Clay: DEEFIRS L4 DEFIERS +86 315
>Dave: ADDILRS K2 LAID +19 319
#note Another tricky choice here.  Turnover seemed crucial, but I could come to regret setting up the PLAID hook.  Or it might help.  Who knows?
>Clay: NUY 2K .UNY +14 329
#note Makes a lot of sense.  He simultaneously blocks the most likely bingo lane (column N) and takes away P plays from row 1.
>Dave: ?DEPRSU 5E PERSUa..D +74 393
#note Surprisingly, if he had left column N open, I did not have a bingo there.  I did have one other bingo.
