>Jeffrey: GINORRZ H7 Z.RO +13 37
#note (sigh) a couple of really good plays here, GINZO D1 and GRO(S)Z C5, but I wasn't looking hard enough to find either, -11.7
>KFC: BGILNUU C2 BLUING. +24 135
>Jeffrey: EGINQRR 5B Q. +11 48
#note liking my fishing leave too much, Q says make it Q(I)/QI -3.1
>KFC: ADEIMSU D8 .UMID +22 157
>Jeffrey: ?EGINRR J2 RINGERs +71 119
#note I would have preferred to draw a regular letter but a blank works.  I thought about (F)INGeRER, didn't see (F)RINGiER but preferred to roll my dice with the front-hooks and 7 chances to draw them, -3
>KFC: ABEY 2B A.BEY +40 197
>Jeffrey: AACEELT 1H LACE +28 147
#note Hmm, TACE is .7 better?  I was sad to take the hook out with such bingo-prone letters, but it had to be done
>KFC: ALPRSST 11H SPLAT +28 225
>Jeffrey: AEIMNNT 3G ANT.MINE +74 221
#note So we meet again, old friend ANTI-
>KFC: LNORSUW N2 R.NOW +32 257
#note J: I held this, didn't recognize it even having drilled all the 5s, but was still enthused from the binger and let it slide.  Sigh.
>Jeffrey: AEIITVW 6A WI. +21 242
#note I liked the leave for WI(N) but WAIVE 12K better, -8
>KFC: CDLOOSU A6 .OULD +27 284
>Jeffrey: AAEIITV L7 AVIA.E +26 268
#note ah, so close to VITIATE, but I'll settle for this

>Jeffrey: EFINOTX E11 FOX +39 307
>KFC: DEGIORS 13I GRIDE +29 333
>Jeffrey: EIKNPTT N8 KEPT +22 329
#note -6.6 for the first of many turns which both of us would continue to miss E(RENOW)!!!!
>KFC: AEIOSSY 10N .I +4 337
>Jeffrey: ?EINTTV 14B VINy +25 354
#note I didn't like all the Y-hooking she could do- extremely short on time here and I felt this gave the the best chance for an out next turn.  somehow Q says TIT F12 us worth it but I wouldn't have liked my odds with SS out there
>KFC: AEEOSSY 3A EE.Y +16 353
#note J:  really any complex play here would have won by getting me to go over on time, but the best combo is threatens out in two.  The best move we post-mortemed, J11 (L)O(R)E has panache.
>Jeffrey: AETT 4J .ET +14 368
#note she threatened SA(G)OS here so I had to play this, ample chances to go out next turn
>KFC: AOSS D1 A..S +24 377
>Jeffrey: AT M6 TA +12 380
#note my clock was down to 00:00, (RENOW)NOW!  Whew, exciting finish to the tourney, especially since this got me into STEEland.  
>Jeffrey:  (OS) +4 384
