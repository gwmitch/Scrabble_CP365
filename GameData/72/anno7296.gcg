>Ricky_Sirois: BCCEISU -BCCEI +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: IMOOSTT 8D MOTTO +20 20
#note Best.  Other plays that keep a T, like MOOT or TOOM, give up a few too many scoreboard points.
>Ricky_Sirois: ADDERTU H8 .UTDARED +83 83
>Jim_Burlant: IIORSUV F5 VIR.UOSI +65 85
#note WOW - while this looked nice at the time, I missed an even cooler play I didn't know:  VIRUSOID, which would have played at 15A for  89.  
>Ricky_Sirois: AAIJ 5C AJI.A +30 113
>Jim_Burlant: LORTUVW 11A VROUW. +24 109
#note Best - nothing else within 5 points in the sim.
>Ricky_Sirois: IQ 6B QI +33 146
>Jim_Burlant: DEGLOST I3 GOLDEST +74 183
#note The only bingo, no 8's available.
>Ricky_Sirois: EX J9 EX +28 174
>Jim_Burlant: EEFLORW 15A FLOWERE. +107 290
#note I was feeling quite good at this point, as this game was looking to be a repeat of my round 2 matchup with Ricky.  But momentum was about to shift.
>Ricky_Sirois: AY H3 AY +21 195
>Jim_Burlant: DHHLLNN C10 H.LD +16 306
#note Yuck. Since I couldn't address row 2 the question was whether to play or exchange?   Ultimately, I felt that, since I could turn 3 tiles, I didn't need to exchange.  Quackle agrees, though it likes this choice the least out of the available non-exchanges.  Q's first choice is HUNH D10, and this play sims 6 pts down, though at much lower valuation (but higher winning percentage) than any of the available exchanges.
>Ricky_Sirois: BIZ G1 BIZ +47 242
>Jim_Burlant: EHILNNP 1G .LIN +18 324
#note No really good options here.  2D LIPIN and 1G BENNI are the winners, and this choice is another 5-point dog.
>Ricky_Sirois: ??EMNST 14G M.ETiNgS +74 316
>Jim_Burlant: EGHNNPP -GNPP +0 324
#note If you can't think of GENIP, is it worth playing through this dreck for the third straight turn?  While missing GENIP was not good, this was the 3rd straight turn without a play that could score decently.  My winning chances are under 50%, and GENIP K11 sims at 57% - unthinkable just 3 turns ago when I was winning just under 94%.
>Ricky_Sirois: ACEEIU L9 EUCAI.E +20 336
>Jim_Burlant: CEEEHNO B9 CO.E +17 341
#note I simmed this against an inferred rack of AEPY because, with Ricky having just drawn 6, I was concerned about his hitting me with a possible death blow of PEAVY at A8.   Against that inference, this play sims quite well, coming in 3rd to B9 HERE and B8 CHORE.  I wanted to score with the H on the next  turn and felt I should get more than face value for it.  As an aside - against a random rack, the star play here, which I never would have found, is 13F CERO.  How many of us rated under 2000 know that VIRTUOSI takes a back C?  Nice find, Quackle!
>Ricky_Sirois: NRT C3 TR..N +12 348
>Jim_Burlant: AEFHNPY 15N HE +20 361
#note Of course, now that I defended against something like PEAVY A8, I draw  PY.  Don't you just love this game?  For whatever reason, I was paranoid about his bingoing up to the S, even though, in retrospect, that wasn't his most dangerous line.  This is poor, as I needed to clear out another one of my counters.  Apparently an M7 PLAY is the ticket, with FEH, PAH, or any number of 3's ending in H being the star plays.
>Ricky_Sirois: AFGNO M5 GANOF +23 371
>Jim_Burlant: AEKNNPY L3 KNAP +27 388
#note Championship Player prefers 9B CAY.  I saw that, but rejected it due to the EKNNP leave. I also rejected N6 YEN and N6 YEP because I thought it was crazy to give him an unobstructed run at the O column.  I thought I was cleverly generating a threat with my Y tht he was going to have to address.  This I did...but I potentially set myself up to lose by doing this.
>Ricky_Sirois: AABGIIS N3 BIAS +19 390
#note And I catch a huge break here.  If he finds SAIGA N1 (something I failed to consider before I made my play of KNAP), I'm dead.  Fortunately for me, he doesn't, and now he can't win.
>Jim_Burlant: EENPRY O1 PRY +31 419
#note Best.
>Ricky_Sirois: AGI 7A GI. +15 405
#note K4 AG scores 20.
>Jim_Burlant: EEN B2 NEE +10 429
#note Missing ERNE 13G for 17.
>Jim_Burlant:  (A) +2 431
