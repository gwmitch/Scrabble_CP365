#note adam...
>Mike_Lean: ?AGNRRR 8F GNAR +10 10
#note whoa gnarr is a word.  shit, why did i play horizontal?  that's not like me

>Adam_Ginzberg: ?ANRSTU K7 SAUNTeR +72 90
#note he missed unsmart and unstrap
>Mike_Lean: ?EHLRTW 11G WHiT.LER +63 87
#note only playable bingo.  thought for a while about whether to put the R in the TWS lane or not, decided not to.  strongly considered not playing this because i had some 30 point plays, but i decided not to be cute
>Adam_Ginzberg: DFNO N10 F.OND +34 124
>Mike_Lean: EEGIMOT O12 MEET +39 126
#note 2nd to amigo for 33

#note didn't even see 5D
>Adam_Ginzberg: ABCDEFG -ABCDEFG +0 144
>Mike_Lean: EEIMOPU 10E MEOU +18 163
#note missed homie H11.  for some reason that was in my head earlier but i forgot it
>Adam_Ginzberg: EFU 11C FEU +20 164
>Mike_Lean: DEEIOPX 12B DEX +45 208
#note saw epoxied and that i had no spot for it, would have played it if i did.  i played dex instead of EX so he couldn't make a big comeback play B12
>Adam_Ginzberg: AAQ 9I AQ.A +18 182
>Mike_Lean: EIOOPTU 13A POT +25 233
#note i knew how absolutely god awful this was when i played it, but i didn't even think of aquae so i missed pie, and this scored best.  again, just awful
>Adam_Ginzberg: BEIKL 4C KI.BLE +30 212
>Mike_Lean: AEIINOU 14B EAU +21 254
#note just like with quackle, it was a tossup between NAOI and EAU.  it was pretty much do or die at this point for me, with this rack. i just need to keep scoring.  in hindsight, PIU would have been much smarter.
>Adam_Ginzberg: CDO H1 COD. +21 233
>Mike_Lean: AIIINOT C3 I.ON +16 270
#note i can't even complain about my rack, i did this to myself.  ani 10J is a nice find, gj quackle.  tiki is much smarter than ikon, boy do you suck
>Adam_Ginzberg: AEGLRSS 1H .RAGLESS +86 319
>Adam_Ginzberg: AEGLRSS --  -86 233
#note well at least we both know we'll never miss largess ever
>Mike_Lean: AIILRTV -AIILRTV +0 270
#note i had some shit (not this rack) and saw this as a perfect opportunity to exchange
>Adam_Ginzberg: AEGLRSS 5B G. +3 236
>Mike_Lean: AERSTYZ A4 ZESTY +85 355
#note adam...... i already knew i had zesty 2B for 59 or TZARS 15D for 48, but this was just a gift
>Adam_Ginzberg: AELORSS 15D SEROSAL +77 313
#note oarless M3 would have given him more of a chance at a comeback if he could score on the bottom lane next turn
>Mike_Lean: CR 2H .RC +11 366
#note i stopped writing my racks for some reason
>Adam_Ginzberg: AHIL 9B HILA +13 326
>Mike_Lean: IJN 14G JIN +23 389
>Adam_Ginzberg: EIV 8A .E +10 336
#note damn, i messed up a while ago.  i think he played aquae, then he played vie here for 10.  stupid me.  i'll just give him a 10 point play
>Mike_Lean: ANV K1 VAN +12 401
#note actual final score 407-345.  i really don't feel like going back and fixing this
