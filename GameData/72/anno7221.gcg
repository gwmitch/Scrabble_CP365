>Jim_Burlant: ALOSSTV 8D VOLTS +24 24
#note Interesting sim result - both the sim and Championship Player prefer VOLTA, keeping SS.  I'd rather unload the dupe S, especially since VOLTA would seemingly devalue my S's.  Championship player favors VOLTA by 1/2 point with this choice the runner up.  Nothing else comes close.
>Chris_Cree: BDDELU E7 D.UBLED +22 22
>Jim_Burlant: AEKOSVW D11 AWOKE +41 65
#note Sim winner is 13C VODKA, but there are any number of strong D12 and D11 plays that sim within 2 points of that.  This is one of them, and it sims 1/2 point down on vodka.
>Chris_Cree: PPRU 15A UPP.R +27 49
>Jim_Burlant: ?CCENSV G2 CoNVEC.S +68 133
#note The only playable bingo.  Chris held this for nearly 6 minutes before accepting.
>Chris_Cree: ANN F12 NAN +15 64
>Jim_Burlant: AEFGIOO 4D FOI. +14 147
#note This play felt wrong when I put it down, but I was so fixated on unloading the F that I didn't let myself look for plays that kept it.  4D GOONIE or 4G NOOGIE are clearly better, with GOONIE the winner by one point over NOOGIE and 5D OGIVE.
>Chris_Cree: ?DDINRT 6F D.NDRITe +65 129
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGINO 3C OE +9 156
#note Another weak play.  7E DECO and 5B OGEE are the standouts.  I'd have gone with DECO had I seen it, as I liked the AEGIN leave and didn't think this rack needed to be turned.  But this choice was too reckless.
>Chris_Cree: FIRTUY B2 FRUITY +31 160
#note Well, that could have been a lot worse.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGINT J4 AE.ATING +61 217
#note The only playable bingo and best play.
>Chris_Cree: IMX A7 MIX +43 203
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIOOU -AAIOOU +0 217
#note Best play is apparently to exchange 7.  I see 6 E's in the pool but duplicated E's aren't the worst thing in the world.
>Chris_Cree: EELMT L3 MET.LE +18 221
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEGJO A1 JO +32 249
#note Best, M1 JOE also worth consideration.  I'm winning 50%.
>Chris_Cree: IQ I9 QI +44 265
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEGHS M2 BAH +29 278
#note Best play, winning 49%.  A5 BEMIX and N2 GHEES also worth consideration.
>Chris_Cree: EORTWY H10 TOWERY +51 316
#note Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: EEEEGNS N1 GEE +21 299
#note Best, and I'm winning 36%.  Nothing else worth consideration here.
>Chris_Cree: AHR B12 HAR. +18 334
>Jim_Burlant: EENOOSZ O3 SNOOZE +54 353
#note Pretty appropriate choice, considering that I must be snoozing if I miss REZONES 14H.  Kids, this is what happens when you don't look at the whole board; don't do this at home!  I was too fixated on the O column to bother to look at the board.  The sim says I win 67% with this choice...but in reality my next rack makes this zero.  If I find REZONES I win this game running away.  Instead I get what I deserve.
>Chris_Cree: AIS 9M AIS +20 354
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIU 11J .AUGE +14 367
#note Now I get to dig my own grave.  He has outs all over the board, I can't block them, and my best play still sets him up to win.
>Chris_Cree: AILR M11 .RAIL +12 366
#note Chris put down GAUGER/RAIL, then picked it up as he had a smidgen of doubt about GAUGER.  
>Chris_Cree:  (I) +2 368
