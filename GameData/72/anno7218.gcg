#note I thought KREWE was only British.  I must have been thinking of KNAWE, which became good in 2006 like KREWE.
>Jere: EEHIR K9 HIREE +27 72
>Joey: CCDLRRX 12F C.RCL.D +26 116
#note That E was a godsend for this bleak looking rack.
>Jere: EOV K5 VOE +17 89
>Joey: FIJRTVX 7G .X +18 134
#note Probably the worst 6 tile leave I've saved with more than 7 in the bag.  The board was getting ugly, so exchanging didn't seem necessary.
>Jere: BE F6 EB. +21 110
>Joey: FGIJRTV 6C JIV. +14 148
#note Still hoping to draw an O for COFT F12.
>Jere: ADI 15J AID +17 127
>Joey: EFGIMRT F14 FE +38 186
#note Guess an E will have to do.

>Jere: AELMOPU C8 AMPOULE +81 217
#note Well, I should have seen that coming based on my previous play.

>Joey: DEGNRTT A9 TREND +11 264
#note I saw TETH D12, but this lane scared me.  Plus, this gave me two more chances at the increasingly elusive blanks.
>Jere: AA B9 AA +16 257
>Joey: AGINQSU 3A QUI. +26 290
#note Not positive that this rack is right, but I know I had the S.  SUQ C2 should be fine/

#note CAGINESS N2 leaves a little more breathing room in case Jere has a bingo of his own.
>Jere: AEFNOTY O6 YEAN +33 310
>Joey: ?IS E1 qIS +16 395
#note Doesn't matter what the blank is, but I've always wanted to play two Q words on the same move, especially when it's at least tied for the best play.
