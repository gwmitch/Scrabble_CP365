>monkey: ADEEWWX F1 WAXWEED. +76 146
#note It was awesome to see this come out of the bag. Thankfully I managed to refrain from playing STOMATED* or ASTOMATE*.
>olaugh: BIRRTUY 6I BRUIT +24 57
#note Oops, obviously didn't look hard enough this turn. Chose BRUIT over BUR, but plain missed BUY, WIRY, and others.
>monkey: AADEKNR 1F .ANKED +42 188
>olaugh: ?EFIRTY L8 .ThERIFY +84 141
#note Oops again. FERITY would have been better.
>monkey: AELRRTU 15H TRUL. +24 212
#note Umm yes I missed RURALITE, URETHRAL and URETERAL. I think I was petting the cat and forgot to look for a bingo.

>monkey: ?AEGNPR 13G cAPER.NG +76 288
>olaugh: CFILOUV 11H VOIC.FUL +82 252
#note Thought this might be #, but had to try it anyway at this score. It's good.
>monkey: AEGINOQ O8 NOI. +12 300
>olaugh: EGILRRS N10 L.G.ER +24 276
>monkey: AAEEGQS J10 Q. +31 331
#note Well that was a bummer. QAID 7C seems better than my play.
>olaugh: ACIIRSV 3B VARI. +30 306
>monkey: AAEEGIS D3 .AGA +17 348
#note Not very good. AGATES looks great but I wasn't sure of OSTOMATES at all. Should have found AEGIS N2 though.
>olaugh: CILNOSS K3 LOC.S. +30 336
>monkey: DEEIIMS N1 IMIDES +32 380
#note The sim likes a fish like FINE M11 but I preferred to rush to the end and take away big S plays there.
>olaugh: BDINOST 1N .D +9 345
#note Maybe DO or DON?
>monkey: EEEEHOP O14 HE +26 406
#note I almost just played HOPE M1 (champ player's choice) until I spotted BONITOS in the pool.
>olaugh: BINOOST C6 BONITOS +67 412
#note I think this is good for three sixteenths of a win, and the only possible win is by one point.
