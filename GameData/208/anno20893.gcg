>Lisa_Odom: IQS K5 QIS +36 64
>Jerry_Lerman: FIOPRTV L1 PROFIT +41 69
#note PIVOT at 6D for only 28, leaving FR sims about 2 points better than the 41 points for PROFIT.  I guess V leaves really ARE to be avoided.

>Jerry_Lerman: EGOPRTV 3F GROVE +18 152
#note V(U)G/G(U)V/GR(AD) sim a bit better than GROVE

>Lisa_Odom: ACDEIST 12H ACIDEST +75 232
>Jerry_Lerman: ADEEINX N9 EXI.ED +60 286
#note I briefly thought about holding on ACIDEST - since I think I recalled that only DACITES is good in our dictionary.  EXI(T)ED does sim better than alternative 52 point XI.  (I'm using Quackle without the updated 2014 dictionary, by the way).

>Lisa_Odom: NOS 14A SON +16 248
>Jerry_Lerman: AALNOOU O5 LAUAN +17 303
#note LAUAN sims best.
>Lisa_Odom: COW H2 C.W +12 260
#note This play wasn't generated by "Generate Choices" but sims pretty darn well - better than 6 that WERE generated -- and maybe would be even better if it knew what Lisa's other letters were.
>Jerry_Lerman: IJLNOOO 1I JO +14 317
#note Not generated by the 'generate choices' option - but sims higher than any of those that were generated, neck and neck with B2 JO(B) for 24
>Lisa_Odom: ?AIINRS 15C SeNARII +71 331
#note (B)AIRNISh sims a trifle better
>Jerry_Lerman: GILNOOT 1L .OOL +25 342
>Lisa_Odom: EF M9 FE +28 359
#note Knowing only these two tiles, Quackle rates this spot for 28 higher than N5 EF.  
>Jerry_Lerman: GIINRTT 11J GITT.N +32 374
#note Lisa realized that she couldn't win if GITTIN were good - (A)RDENT being her best scoring play.  So she challenged, lost that turn, and I went out with REI for 14, catching her with 16 - to end the game at 404-359
