#note I considered XI at K10, and it is clearly the best play, though Q indicates only by 6 valuation points.  I thought perhaps rack balance and setting up a new X spot (H12) would be worth a little more.   
In addtion to giving up 17 poiints, perhaps the chance of opp having QU play for same spot or just shutting it down weighed in.

#note TABOOING B7 and BLOODING, BLOOMING and BLOOPING (which I considered) all trump my play, though by fewer valuation points than the 9 I gave up.   Still, I overvalued the safeness of my play's position here.

#note HELP!   Why is CORA 13 J best?    ADS doesn;t look THAT much better to me for leave than ADIS, esp. not at cost of 13 points AND opening up another bingo lane.
