>Matthew_Larocque: EHIILOO 8H OLIO +8 8
#note Played this too fast. HELIO is a lot more points. I didn't know HOOLIE which is obviously the best thing here. Not a good start.
>George_Latis: EEY 7G EYE +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEHIW K7 D.WIE +18 26
#note Didn't know HOWDIE. I risked the H setup.
>George_Latis: AIV 6E VIA +10 26
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEHKOZ J10 KHEDA +46 72
#note I wish I had known HOKED, this could really kill me.
>George_Latis: ?AAEERV 13C AVERAgE. +76 102
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOQTZ 12A QAT +24 96
>George_Latis: AFILR L10 FRAIL +32 134
>Matthew_Larocque: EENNOOZ L4 ZONE +29 125
#note I showed him my other O then opted to keep it. If he parallel plays, the extra O would make it even worse. Of course, he could also have an O himself. Dunno. I missed E(V)ZONE which would force him to chose where to burn his S if he has one.

>Matthew_Larocque: CEGINOU A12 .UIN +39 164
>George_Latis: AEEMRST 15D TEAMERS +94 257
#note You have got to be kidding me. Matt, you KNOW this isn't one of the anagrams. And it's so many points. Why do I do this to myself.
>Matthew_Larocque: CEGLORT 3K LOG +22 186
#note No CLOG because that C is going to get in the way.
>George_Latis: AGOT N2 GOAT +20 277
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEINRT I6 C.. +5 191
#note I don't even know what I'm fishing for. I would play DICENTR(A), but I don't study words. I also forgot that LOGON was even a word, I only thought of LOGOI.
>George_Latis: ISX 8M SIX +39 316
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIINRT O8 .I +9 200
#note I was too busy looking at YO, but it's already too late so it doesn't even matter if I play NITRIDE here.
