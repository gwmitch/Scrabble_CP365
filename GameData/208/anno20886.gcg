>Joey_Krafchick: CEIIORT H7 OI +4 4
#note Quackle likes exchange I the best, but I feel like taking the center square is somewhat important. I guess for 4 points I might as well not....since CEIORT bingoes with A + E + consonants, so well over 30% chance of hitting a seven (-5.2)

#note No sense in fishing on this board, especially without the blank. I needed to open things up and get volatile, unfortunately.

#note I saw AERIESt, which scores 6 more, but too many easy overlaps are created. This keeps things way more open, as well, which is crucial at this point since one bingo might not be enough.

>Joey_Krafchick: ELNOORY O1 YON +24 347
#note This was probably a mistake. My initial logic was that there are two unseen N's, so why would I keep my N? 

I see based on her fish that she has a good chance at bingoing next turn, so I should prepare better for a bingo. She might not hit, if I'm lucky, but here's the difference (I thought of this immediately after she bingoes next turn, unfortunately):

If I anticipate her bingoing, there will be one in the bag after her bingo, so I can fish one last time if I don't draw into a bingo from ELNOR. I might lose regardless, but it seems to be more ideal to give myself a chance. If I only I thought of that BEFORE....lol

That being said, OY is the play I would say.
