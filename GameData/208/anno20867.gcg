>Matthew_Larocque: ACEGRSU D8 .UG +7 7
>Wayne_Clifford: EIT F7 E.IT +13 51
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEQRS -Q +0 7
#note Only sims slightly ahead of QuA(I). Really?
>Wayne_Clifford: EEKT H6 KE.TE +9 60
#note I thought this didn't take the S, but it's not the same as KENT.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEMRS I2 sCREAMS +95 102
#note There's one new bingo here - MACHERS. "A person known for getting things done". 
>Wayne_Clifford: CIILT 3I .LITIC +20 80
#note Yes yes, let's all have a good laugh.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFHILOU L3 .HULIA +20 122
#note (T)UFOLI does the same thing better. HA(T)FUL scores the most but gives back more points. E10 AFOUL and FI(C)HU round out the top. My reasoning was that the F was a good letter because of the (KA)F spot. I was hoping to draw an E.
>Wayne_Clifford: HINORS M8 RHINOS +28 108
#note Does this play mean he has an extra S for sure? I don't know. Also, apparently CLITIC takes an S! ROSHI scores 47.
>Matthew_Larocque: DFJOTWY L12 JOW +46 168
#note Given his last play, I didn't want to do this. I actually considered something like TOWY instead. Sim with S inference still says this is still the right play. I do have W(AR)TY, though, so maybe I can just play JO and bank on playing W(AR)TY next turn?
>Wayne_Clifford: MORSW 15H WORMS +48 156
#note TOWY would have still given him WORM(Y) allowing him to keep the S.
>Matthew_Larocque: DFNRTVY 8K T..DY +27 195
#note Sim likes (E)NVY better despite the extra points for T(AR)DY. 
>Wayne_Clifford: DEG N12 GED +24 180
>Matthew_Larocque: EFINORV N8 .IF +33 228
#note (D)IF or J6 FE? A long sim ranks (D)IF a sliver higher. Thought I might get lucky and draw an OVER- bingo.
>Wayne_Clifford: IPQ 5K Q.IP +30 210
>Matthew_Larocque: AENORUV 2B RAVENOU. +74 302
#note I didn't see this right away, this is why shuffling letters can help.
>Wayne_Clifford: EY J6 YE +36 246
>Matthew_Larocque: AAABEFL 14F FLAB +26 328
#note This is the easiest place for him to play a seven, I wanted to lock the board down despite the leave. I know quackle won't agree, but 1A FAB gives him a place to score points underneath which would also open a more dangerous bingo line down to the TWS. On the other hand, it would eliminate the R in sCREAMS.
>Wayne_Clifford: DOP 1A POD +23 269
>Matthew_Larocque: AAABEOT 13E BOAT +21 349
#note Making sure nothing ending in IES/IER can play (or -IA, -EA , -OA.....). There's actually only 5 seven letter words that end in -OA. Maybe just play OAT? Or should I be more worried about lane 4? Quackle likes ABATO(R).
>Wayne_Clifford: IZ 10B ZI. +33 302
#note He took his time on this play, maybe he was worried I'd be able to hit him back?
>Matthew_Larocque: AAENORU B10 .ONAE +28 377
>Wayne_Clifford: AENT -  +0 302
#note He kind of grumbled that maybe he was having a brain fart.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLNRU 4D LUNGE. +16 393
#note I saw LUNAR for 27, but thought that was greedy and I should just kill the R. He can't catch me after LUNAR, but it would be bad for my spread.
>Wayne_Clifford: ADENORT A12 ANTE +22 324
#note His highest scoring play is DENAR. TENOR leaves him with a stronger out.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAERS O11 AS +16 409
#note Wow. I sure wish I had known CLITIC took an S!
>Wayne_Clifford: DOR K13 DO. +16 340
#note He told me he was going out, then decided not to. This doesn't help his spread at all.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AER N1 RE.A.s +18 427
#note O1 scores 22.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (R) +2 429
#note I lost 10 on time, and he was overscored by 10.
