#note I think I decided to play like Quackle this game.
>Sam_Hollington: ?GIINOT J5 IGNITOr +68 76
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHIKRZ 5G HAZ.ER +36 36
#note In the interest of a dynamic, open board to suit my KI leave, I played this HAZIER instead of the one down low. It's debatable, but I was quite comfortable on that type of board over a middle-range board that HAZIE(r) created. KR is a better leave though, and I guess I could also draw a 6 down the I in HAZIER. Another interesting option is ZE(R)K for 52. I draw an E and I'm good, an M and I'm more than good. But I'm liable to get punished early with Sam's own 5 down there, so I'd rather not take that big of a risk.
>Sam_Hollington: EIOU L3 OU.IE +10 86
>Joshua_Sokol: ABFGIKS M7 FIG +22 58
#note I took a while wondering what to do this turn. I took this FIG over the 6F version of this play because this creates a dynamic lane for my S to complement the other lanes already open. I didn't want to just make a dump like at 6F. KAB there is alright I guess. 
>Sam_Hollington: EENSY 4D EENSY +38 124
>Joshua_Sokol: ABIKOOS 3C KOBO +28 86
#note Another weird position. I decided to go for points and leave, since there looked to be nothing much else to do. BOOK plays for 28 at 3C, which I missed. I like that a bit better I think.

#note I missed two better bingos here! 11E dISAR(r)AY, and pIRAYAS, which plays at 12D for 84 and at 6B for 79. Weaksauce :)

>Joshua_Sokol: ACGLTUX 1N .X +27 352
#note This might have been an oversight. With the score this close, I probably shouldn't be worrying about O2. I should be more worried about the P in PAWED. Nothing else comes to mind here. I guess I could play B7 C(A)LX. But if I'm not playing at O1, I should try to keep my X in store for later. So something like CLAG at 6E looks decent. Maybe even at 10B, but maybe I can't afford to lose so many points.
>Sam_Hollington: AM 6H MA. +25 353
>Joshua_Sokol: ACGLNTU 10A CLUNG +15 367
#note Again, with the score so close, I can't be sacrificing points to block bingo lanes that are unlikely to be hit. I'm really just shooting myself in the foot. I am intending to draw the J, sure, since Sam's last play means that he does not have that tile, but I don't need to block stuff. He is probably consonant heavy, and may not even have the S. So playing off 5 tiles is good, but not for a measly 15 points. He will be able to outscore, especially since this opens a juicy spot on the triple. But what else is there?
