>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEORT 9D COTE +12 12
#note No excuses for missing this, and I spent more than enough time on this rack. Perhaps I need to shuffle tiles more when the word doesn't immediately come to mind. This was a costly miss too. I also didn't think the short plays were worth it but Q disagrees.
>George_Macaulay: EELSTVW J2 TWELVES +80 92
#note George couldn't resist cracking a joke about playing a spelled-number bingo.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIRRU D9 .URIA +14 26
#note Already feel like I'm going to  get blown out.
>George_Macaulay: ?ADEEHO 11A gHE.AOED +72 164
#note Yep.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIIRW B10 W.ERE +38 64
#note Already in spread-reducing mode.
>George_Macaulay: AQ 2H QA. +12 176
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIILRS 3G GI +16 80
#note Thought about (D)RAIL, but I seem to focus more on leave once I get hold of an S. I would never think AGIRS is better than AILRS, but sim likes LI about as much as GI. 
>George_Macaulay: FGO 5I F.OG +16 192
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAILRS I7 A.A +9 89
#note I knew this rack could bingo with an M or a T, but didn't think of the third word using a P. I liked this play because it sets up more hooks that he might overlook. On the other hand, (g)RAAL scores 22.
>George_Macaulay: ANOZ 7F ZON.. +23 215
#note He said he had his own A that he could have used if I hadn't played here.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABILRRS A8 BRA. +20 109
#note Opening more room for bingos, but it's looking unlikely I will be able to use any of them.
>George_Macaulay: AJSY M2 JAYS +37 252
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILRST 8A .I +4 113
#note Don't miss OCREATE, or else crappy games like this happen. I also hate making plays like this, but TRAILS bingos with 2/3 of the remaining letters. Except I didn't know the new word LIATRIS, which makes this play less good. Some of the bingos would also be reliant on BI staying open. TRYSAIL doesn't even fit anywhere.
>George_Macaulay: TU 2M .UT +20 272
>Matthew_Larocque: AILRSTU C2 RITUALS +71 184
#note Took me 8 turns to bingo when I had one on the first turn. I did not know TITULARS.
>George_Macaulay: AIO L4 A.IO +20 292
>Matthew_Larocque: CEENOPX B1 COX +37 221
#note POX? I mean who cares about defense now Matt, get with the program.
>George_Macaulay: ?DEIMTY M7 DaYTIME +91 383
#note Good play, but he can score 109 somewhere else!
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMNNPV 11J VEN.N +16 237
#note I saw PENNE but never actually bothered to count it. I should take the 30 points.
>George_Macaulay: EIKLNR O7 LINKER +42 425
#note You're welcome, George.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEMOPPR 13G REMOPP.D +69 306
>Matthew_Larocque: DEMOPPR --  -69 237
#note Maybe REMOP was a new word? I didn't really get around to the fives. I'm sure George did, though.
>George_Macaulay: EEIO A14 OI +8 433
>Matthew_Larocque: DEMOPPR H11 .OMED +30 267
#note Chickened out on DOPED. Not sure why, I must have been thinking of the wrong definitions.
>George_Macaulay: EHILNST 14J HEIST +45 478
#note Apparently he missed THEELINS, but he told me he doesn't usually miss that one.
>Matthew_Larocque: DFNPPR 12F PR.F +15 282
>George_Macaulay: LN L13 N.L +6 484
>George_Macaulay:  (DNP) +12 496
#note A rather poor showing from me.
