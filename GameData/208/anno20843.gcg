#note This was a bad play. I don't know why I made this play. I saw ABIDE(D) D3 first, then forgot about it. I don't want a wide-open board against Matthew! BEEDI also looks better, same spot.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEFISX K2 FAXES +41 150
#note I can't remember my last tile, and that's important, but I know it was not a duplicate or a vowel. I saw no reason to play FAX at 11I here, as it took out two good 7 lanes and gave back huge overlap plays, that favor Matthew's tiles, given that 6 of them are random. I didn't however spot E10 XE(N)IA, which looks like the right play.

#note I knew ANTHOIDS was no good, so playing this seemed obvious. Unfortunately I keep mixing this up with HALIDOM. This play is why I lost this game.

#note Well, there it is, folks! Hitting Matthew with a taste of his own medicine... Held and released after this was slapped down.

#note I thought the bag was empty. This play is still interesting if I draw the J. But it's better played at B8. If I draw the J, he has to see JNANA and block it with QUI(RE). Otherwise I gain a ton of spread.
