#note Latin!

>Amalan_Iyengar: ?BDGIIL L11 GLIB +21 48

>Matt_Bernardina: AOZ (challenge) +5 207
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEINSTW 10A AWN +29 146
#note Wasn't sure what was best here. AW is simming better, along with AW/A(JAR)/W(EM)#. I saw that the bag has a lot of Ns and Rs left, so I made AWN.

#note LENTOUS# is a word
>Matt_Bernardina: INW 6E W.N +13 327
#note This should probably have told me he was holding onto the blank
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEFFQVX D1 FA.X +36 378
#note So here I was wondering whether to exchange or play QA(T) to avoid being Q-stuck, or to just take the points and hope a spot opens up. If he doesn't bingo, I can still outrun, even without a q spot. There are 3 I's left, so I went with the points

FAVE 2H and VEX 4A are simming best here. FAVE reduces the bingo odds from about 38% to 17%. I didn't expect that drastic of a change.

>Matt_Bernardina: ?ADENPR 4I oPERAND +73 400
#note Sims better than the higher-scoring options at 2H
>Amalan_Iyengar: DEEFOQV 1A DOF. +33 411
#note This is the best TWL word. DEFO# and DEF(F)O# both are at around 40% wi, whereas DOF(F) is at about 40%. It just depends on whether I draw one of the 3 I's out of the bag.
>Matt_Bernardina: BIIILNY N1 BLI.I +14 414
>Matt_Bernardina: INY (challenge) +5 419
#note I challenge because I have no hope of winning if it's good
>Amalan_Iyengar: EEEQV H1 EV. +18 429
#note Missed IN(B)Y, so I should have played VEE(R)
