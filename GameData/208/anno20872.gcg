>Evans: AHINNTX 8H XANTHIN +92 92
#note A strange choice admittedly, but I chose this placement assuming that Nigel knows all the new words cold while I do not. Thus, I need some early volatility to give myself a chance against a superior opponent.
>Nigel: EILP O5 PILE +72 72
#note Nigel you jerk.
>Evans: DEGORST M4 GROD.EST +63 155
#note Annoyed that my opening gambit failed and I'm only up 20 despite an opening X bingo, I go on tilt and play the worst possible bingo out of the five playable options. Good job, me!
>Nigel: AIMNORU K4 MINO.AUR +90 162
#note Damn it Nigel.
>Evans: AEIIRTZ L1 ZATI +58 213
#note Phew! Back in the lead.
>Nigel: CGIOY J10 YOGIC +40 202
>Evans: EEFIRSV 13G VER.FIES +88 301
#note Feeling pretty good at this point! Up by almost 100. Nothing can go wrong now.
>Nigel: ELOO O1 EOLO.... +33 235
#note Lucky-ass Nigel. First he gets to play a word hooking XANTHINE, then he gets the snapback for it too.
>Evans: ABEFIOT H12 F.EB +39 340
#note OK. Still up over 100. No need to panic.
>Nigel: CINNQUU H1 QUINCUN. +131 366
#note DAMN IT NIGEL!!!!!!
>Evans: ABIJOOT 7A JOBATIO. +71 411
#note At this point I was so angry by Nigel's luckbagginess that I neglected to spot the same bingo three rows up for 29 more points. So tilty.
>Nigel: AELMPRT D4 MAL.PERT +80 446
#note A bizarre choice by Nigel to play MALAPERT here rather than at D6 and expose the S hook. He must know that I have a bingo that plays somewhere else so I can't use the spot. Psychic-ass Nigel.
>Evans: EEEGSTV F2 EGEST.VE +66 477
>Nigel: ADSW 12A WADS +50 496
#note ..............
>Evans: DDKLRRW B10 DR.WL +26 503
#note Of course I bingo late in the game and draw 7 consonants.
>Nigel: AAEHINU 1H .UIN.HE. +29 525
#note At this point I messed up and overdrew the entire bag, so naturally Nigel puts the two blanks back in. With complete knowledge of the bag and my rack, he devises the cruelest possible way to steal this endgame.
>Evans: ADEKORY 15A RYKED +55 558
>Nigel: ??AA A5 qA.Aq +30 555
#note A painful way to lose. Though if there's one silver lining, it's that this game featured QUINZHEE+ and QAJAQ being played for their face values of 29 and 30 respectively. You were wrong, Lipe and Thevenot.
>Nigel:  (OA) +4 559
