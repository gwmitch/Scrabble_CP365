#note HEMIN is 28. II can get ugly if I decided to draw more Is, though.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ENZ J6 ZE.N +33 33
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHIMT K3 MEGA +25 41
#note I LITERALLY WROTE DOWN MEGA AS MY PLAY AND HIT AS MY LEAVE. MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATT

#note This actually happened.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BDILOT D9 T.BLOID +24 190
>Matthew_Larocque: DENNNOR 15D .ONNED +24 173
#note (D)ONNERD! That would have been so good.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IVY 14I IVY +20 210
>Matthew_Larocque: ELNNRWY 13C L.WRY +30 203
#note DOWRY, LOWERY. And besides, 8A WYN is the play I needed to find. Bad.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EFH 8A FEH +34 244
#note Punishment.
>Matthew_Larocque: AENNRST 3K ..N +10 213
#note WHAT I thought I looked for ENTRANTS. Maybe I thought it didn't fit, or that I was missing a letter. I don't even know. 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEKOPRS A8 .ORSPEAK +110 354
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEKOPRS --  -110 244
#note Held but this looked like it needed that extra E. You pretty much always hear this in past tense, but I assumed that it would also have a present tense just as a technicality.
>Matthew_Larocque: AENRRST I13 R.. +5 218
#note I don't deserve to play Scrabble. BTW MATT he's gonna play PRESOAK.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEKOPRS M5 PRESOAK +73 317
>Matthew_Larocque: AENORST G6 O. +2 220
#note Since I'm already commited to playing a bingo (if I can even find one), I need somewhere to play it.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DE M5 .......ED +32 349
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENRST N9 NEAREST +85 305
#note NEVER GIVE UP. NEVER SURRENDER. Also, FENESTRA/FASTENER are 86.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EOW O13 WOE +33 382
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CCIRRT K12 CR. +8 313
#note I wanted to play CIn(Q) just because, but that silly lane I created with OE is suddenly a factor. Well, except it isn't because he's going to block so I should still just play CIn(Q). R(E)C scores 4 more with the same fish. It wins 10% more than CR(Y). 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DIP 5G DIP +25 407
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BCIRTX 11G TIX +22 335
#note If I knew TeRB(I)C, that sets up XI for 27 to go out. CRIBs O5 lets me go out next turn as well with T(I)X in two spots. I wrote down 22 but added it as 14. I don't even know. I don't even know.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AAAJLV 11B JA. +12 419
#note Did he miss JA(I)L?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BCR E5 CR.B +16 351
#note Missed my outs.

#note I lost 10 on time so I only had 363. Lesson learned: Staring at your rack doesn't help if you don't look at the board.
