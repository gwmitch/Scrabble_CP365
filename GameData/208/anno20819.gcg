#note PUNITY*. Lucky to get away with that one.

#note Craig says this was his rack. Seemed he missed the spot for COERECT at 9A! A succession of mistakes by Craig cause me to get a huge break.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EHINRT A1 H.RNIEsT +149 202
#note I wasn't 100% sure of NOTCHIER, although fairly confident. Is it worth playing to draw the challenge for 9 less points?
>Craig_Rowland: CJO G3 JO +19 117
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGGOSX D7 EGG +12 214
#note I considered playing J8 SEX here, but it looked like SOX was better, but also, that would have been too much of a dirty succession of words. Probably better to wait until I'm rid of the two G's to score with my X.
>Craig_Rowland: EO 3G .OE +11 128
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIORSX 2I OX +28 242
#note I considered OX and EX in the same spot here. I knew that EEIRS was a better leave than EIORS, but not by much. The difference between the two plays is mostly a board control issue. If I play OX, I'm setting up OXO, which will stay on the board for a rather long time, unless Craig bingos at I4, which is fairly likely. Playing OX lets Craig bingo starting in A, D and S. The A is probably the likeliest between all of those, given the pool. If I play EX, TEE takes DLMNS. It seems that Craig bingos around as often at I4 after the two plays, so I'll take OX, for the better leave.
>Craig_Rowland: DEEM 4I DEEM +19 147
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIRSS 5K SAE +14 256
#note I considered fishing, but I preferred reducing Craig's bingo chances, keeping a less good but still great leave that's a tad more flexible if I don't draw into a bingo, etc.
>Craig_Rowland: IIII -IIII +0 147
>Joshua_Sokol: EILLORS 9H LILO +15 271
#note In the same idea as last turn, I chose to play off more tiles, keep a good leave, and reduce Craig's bingo opportunities, especially those that open the board to more future bingos.

#note I didn't know PARTERS+. Is that better than this?
>Craig_Rowland: DQU H12 QU.D +72 296
>Joshua_Sokol: ADKMVWY K11 KYA. +41 390
#note Nooooo! I realized after this game that I had missed M(I)KVA. This could have been quite costly for me... (O)AKY is probably a bit better, two spots up, since it doesn't allow Craig to hit that spot at 8K and open the board further while scoring.

>Craig_Rowland: GO 7L .OG +8 330
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEMRUW 6M MAW +20 428
#note Wow! It looks like M11 DUE outruns everything, but I thought MAW was better since it left me with DUE next turn. Quackle finds 15A REMUDA, which seems to lose to just a few things at O7. I guess I am able to outrun after DUE as well. I don't see how I lose after MAW, though.
