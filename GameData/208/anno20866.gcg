#note Best, but there was a problem:  there's a back hook to this word that makes a common word, and I compltely spaced on that hook for the entire game.  If you're looking for good scrabble on my end, look elsewhere.  If you want confirmation that I am nothing but an unrepentant luck box, keep going.

#note Still breaking in the new words.  Didn't think to look for YEZ, which scores 35 and is definitely best.  TIZ is also good if you miss YEZ. Didn't think of that, either.

#note At least I got this one right. Q also likes 9J AX; I don't.  74% to win.

#note VINY looked to me like it completely shut off the board, because I forgot you could hook an L onto it to make VINYL.  Whoops.  With that in mind, this position became limited to the bingoes I could find: FINALITY J1 (never thought of AFfINiTY, which would have been worth it to me) and INT(ER)leAF on row 12.  I wasn't sure of INTERLEAF and I thought FINALITY wasted the ammunition.  Best here would have been any number of 2x2's down the K column:  INFLATE, TAILFAN, or TAILFIN.  This?  Bwah hah hah!!! "Only" a 14 point equity loss.  Best is FATLING K5.  The consolation:  had I put down the bingoes I did see, they would have given him the lifeline he needed.
>Geoff_Thevenot: EOOSSST J6 TO.OS +12 63
#note Actual rack.  Had I put down FINALITY or INTERLEAF, he'd have had OSTEOSIS!
>Jim_Burlant: ??AIINT K1 aNTIAIr +63 155
#note Still blind to the VINY back hook.  Best is clearly TAILFIN K5.  This?  Another whiff.
>Geoff_Thevenot: EISSU 3J E.UI +8 71
#note Fortunately for me, Geoff picks up a boatload of vowels and can't do anything on row 1.
>Jim_Burlant: CGLNRSU 1J L.NGUR +21 176
#note GLUCAN 1G scores 27 and is slightly better...but I benefit from this.

#note More new word fail.  POOJA 5B scores 28.  Fortunately, this game is already officially garbage time.

#note Didn't write this rack down.   I recall just wanting to shut down row 1.  I'm sure I missed a much better play somewhere else.
