#note This wasn't a very good play. I had Ross on low-scoring tiles obviously, but that doesn't mean I should play crazy offense when there are other options available. I missed F2 ZO(WE)E (sadface), and playing it safe with (W)IZ of 6B ZIN look totally fine.
>Ross_Brown: ?ADEOTT 9E TOAsTED +70 120
#note As it stood, I should have gotten burned here. Luckily Ross didn't spot his 9-timer. DETONAT(E) also plays for 77.
>Joshua_Sokol: CCEGQTZ 7G Q. +21 74
#note Is this worth it? Should I keep my Q instead and play GEEZ or COZ?
>Ross_Brown: DEGHILR A4 GL.RIED +33 153
#note K5 GRID(D)LE is 40, and RIDGEL/REGILD at 8J or RIDGEL at 8A are 35 and 34 respectively. This is more defensive, obviously. 
>Joshua_Sokol: CEGGITZ F8 C.ZIE +36 110
#note And then I go ahead and tunnel, missing K4 ZIGGE(D)... Really bad! J7 GE(E)Z has also got to be better than this.

>Ross_Brown: ADESTVY 12J DEY +36 221
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CEERRT 13B CaTERER +85 221
#note I didn't know REERECT. That plays for 87, and is therefore the play.
>Ross_Brown: AMSTUVX H13 .AX +30 251
>Joshua_Sokol: EFLORSS 14G S.FROLES +78 299
#note what a draw.
>Ross_Brown: IMRSTUV 11B TRIV.UMS +76 327
#note And what a snapback. I held for a while, and was convinced that this was good. It's new, actually, and I probably saw it a while ago...
>Joshua_Sokol: AGIJKNT 6H .AKING +24 323
#note 13M TAJ. I did not see that. For sure that's the play.
>Ross_Brown: AEEIORU G6 A.U. +33 360
>Joshua_Sokol: IJNOPTU L4 PU.JI +30 353
#note I completely missed PINOT and PITON at 15K. I did not play this game well at all. I also considered UNJOI(N)T, but forgot if it was a word or not. Ross said he would challenge. That would have won me the game! I played this since if I draw an A I get TAN(G)O, and it also scores the best out of what I saw.
>Ross_Brown: BDEEIOR 13M BOD +22 382
#note this is bad news. Ross has either one or both of the last E's, and has set up a huge spot for them. I can't do anything about that.
>Joshua_Sokol: AINNOST M3 TAN.O +30 383
#note M2 STIN(G)O is the play that gives me a chance! Wow!
>Ross_Brown: EEILRTU O7 RETILE. +27 409
>Joshua_Sokol: AHINNOS N8 NAH +31 414
>Ross_Brown: MU B13 .UM +14 423
#note definitely did not deserve to win this game. I played extremely sloppily.
