#note Saw BORAXES but thought it only BORAXES only pluralizes to BORACES. I also missed HOAXERS and COAXERS which play for 89.

#note I liked this play for a few reasons. 1. It scores well. 2. It blocks a hot spot and 3. If I draw an I, i'll have BRIEFING. 
Jason said I should play FEEB although the possible threat of BRIEFING next turn with 4 chances to draw an I may be worth it for me, especially since I keep a reasonable leave with BRIEF. Thoughts?

#note This is the worst 100% win according to champ player, with a valuation of -9.4. Best is WO but in case of some freak bingo that I don't know/see I wanted to try to outrun him.
