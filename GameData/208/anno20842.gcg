#note I first thought of CAMELEON# to the triple, and then found CORNMEAL, slotting the M.  But a little more persistence brought me to my play, the best bingo, and I was rewarded with 5 extra points on the challenge.
>Tony_Leah: DEZ 7M ZED +53 91
#note Of course, Tony should have played ZED at J10 for 13 more points, but if he had I would have bingoed again with EPITOMES on column N.

>Tony_Leah: AENRSTT H2 TRANSE.T +61 181
#note Better than TRANECTS# because this both sets up an S to end his eight letter bingos *and* sets up a spot to place his seven letter bingos ending in the last S.  Tony is still down so much that he needs to keep the board open for as long as possible.

#note In response to this, I said "Nice play," but I guess Tony didn't hear me right, because he didn't draw his tiles for a bit.  He eventually said, "Are you still holding?"  I responded, "I didn't say hold.  I know that word perfectly well."

#note Often I would play the extra letter with DRIVING to end the game sooner and block up more lanes.  However, the bag was vowel heavy, with 12 vowels and 11 consonants remaining, and only one R unseen.  It seemed to me that given those circumstances, RT was a much stronger leave than T, and it worked out for me.

#note My high scoring play, but not best, because it fails to block his out plays, which I missed.

#note He also had AUREOLA through the UR.
