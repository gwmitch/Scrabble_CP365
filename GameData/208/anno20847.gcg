#note Not my favourite way to position a word, and I should probably strive to float even more letters out in the open. D8 (F)OVEA / (F)OVEAE and 7B AVOW are all very close in the sim. I don't like keeping WI or three vowels, though.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ??ERRTU D6 RE.UTeRs +68 146
#note Well, this won't be easy. Unless I can draw JXQZ and cash them all in like in my first game vs. Maureen.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEJMNO 8L MODE +37 59
#note Probably better to ditch the J now to increase my chances to get a bingo while the board is still open. Sim likes JE(T) and several other J plays over MODE.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: OX 6I OX +54 200
#note Ugh.

#note Should have just done something like this in the first place, although he would have covered it with BANC so meh.

#note *insert sound of toilet flushing* - my spread.
>Matthew_Larocque: EHIJNQU F8 .UQ +32 112
#note At this point I just want to repair my spread as much as I can.

>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHIJN G8 .HING +33 145
#note There's about a dozen ways to score 30+ points. A10 HAEING is 43 which I missed. I saw A7 HI, but not AHI for some reason. AGNI(ZED) and AGENI(ZED) are awesome and keep HJ that I can hopefully used to score again next turn.
