>Jim_Burlant: EHINRTU 8H UH +10 10
#note Definitely worth it IMO to not blow this apart for 26 points.  For reference, this play wins 57.8%.  HUNTER for 26 wins 4% less often and sims 10 points down.
>Darrell_Day: OY 7I OY +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: EEINRTY 6G YEN +12 22
#note I knew I was in for a tough one when my two tile fish out of a full bag yielded a duplicated E and a Y.  This is best.
>Darrell_Day: ETV F5 VET +17 29
>Jim_Burlant: EFIIRTU -FIU +0 22
#note I couldn't think of FEIRIE.  Between the cumulative frustration of how the mid-game had gone against Sam and the repetitive junk making its way into my racks,this was starting to get to me.  Darrell, with his defensive tendencies, is the last player against whom I can afford a sluggish start.  H1 FEIRIE scores 30 and is definitely best.  This is top-4 in a sim, but that's deceiving.  This is totally unnecessary and is atrocious play on my end.   Gotta stay calm.
>Darrell_Day: ABD G8 DAB +14 43
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIORT 10F O.IA +8 30
#note Any number of mediocre options are available.  I didn't think of OATIER (one of the new words), which left me with this.  The play is either OATIER for 25 (if you can think of it),  this,  OBI, or BIO.  41% to win.
>Darrell_Day: ACW E10 CAW +25 68
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGIRT H1 ERGAT. +24 54
#note At this point I was pretty sure that this was looking bad - he's got the V when he needs it to kill the northwest, and this early he's got the C to front hook OBIA.  I considered this and 12B EARWIG.  Q likes EARWIG best for the leave; I didn't want to give the S hook back for a huge play to 15H.  All my options are mediocre and this scores as well as anything I have available.  11I GIE is a good alternative as well, but I felt like I needed points and turnover.
>Darrell_Day: ABG D11 BAG +26 94
>Jim_Burlant: EIIJNQS 14B QIS +31 85
#note I finally get one right.  Besides unloading the Q, the beauty of this is that it only looks like a Q dump; in reality it sets me up for huge points on the next turn.  37% to win. 
>Darrell_Day: LLRTU 11H TRULL +14 108
>Jim_Burlant: EEIJNST 15A JIN +43 128
#note Courtesy of a remarkably good draw 2 turns ago, the game has turned around.  Where I had blundered my way down to 30% winning chances, I'm now at 60.
>Darrell_Day: DEFI 2F FI.ED +21 129
>Jim_Burlant: EEOPSTU M5 TOUPEES +67 195
#note I saw EELPOUTS, which didn't play, and couldn't think of its anagram, OUTSLEEP, which would have scored 5 more at L7 and not opened up N6. That left this.  Still in good shape at 77% to win.
>Darrell_Day: EEMORT 1A REMOTE +32 161
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEEIO 8L O.ED +24 219
#note Didn't recognize the lone playable bingo in this rack, but OEILLADE only scores 58 and I don't like it; it's too early to burn the blank for a 58-point air ball when there are 24-point plays available keeping the blank.  The sim confirms bingoing is not best here and that this is.  
>Darrell_Day: INX N4 NIX +53 214
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIINP O1 NIPA +24 243
#note No bingoes play.  This or PINA O1 are best.  77.3% tgo win, and my next rack pretty much clinches the game.
>Darrell_Day: AAM C11 AMA.. +33 247
>Jim_Burlant: ??EINOT O8 .EmOTIoN +74 317
#note Any number of bingoes available that score 74 and this is as good as any of them. Other options are DIpTErON, DOWNTIME, DONATIVE, DEVOTION, DEVOTING.  Just shy of 92% to win.
>Darrell_Day: DFU 2B FUD +31 278
>Jim_Burlant: AELORRW N13 OWE +24 341
#note The equity plays are 3H GLOWER/GROWER.  I'd rather make sure that there' sno chance of an easy 8 in case I've mistracked.  
>Darrell_Day: IK K10 I.K +7 285
>Jim_Burlant: ACHLRRS L11 .ARCH +40 381
#note This wasn't auto-pilot, as this is where I finally got my tracking back on target.  Assuming he had the most probable combination of bingo prone tiles in the unseen pool (EILNORS or EGILNOS jumped at me, though there were others) I made sure I couldn't find an 8 to the C or H before putting this down.  Championship Player confirms:  this is best.
>Darrell_Day: GNOS F12 SONG +16 301
>Jim_Burlant: ELRRSVZ 3C SEZ +38 419
#note Not sure I have this annotated correctly - final score 419 - 315.
