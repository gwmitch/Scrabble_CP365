#note I held this, but then remembered that the only reason I could possibly know the word PREFAB was by knowing PREFABS.

#note This, my friends, is a choky play if I've ever made one. And this was not the time to choke. As I shuffled through my possibly plays, I saw WOS/WAS/HISTONES for 51. But since I held the case S, I knew that playing there could wait. Not that I shouldn't play there, but that it wasn't the necessary thing to do. I was then afraid of Matthew holding the X with ZOOM, as it was played very confidently. I also knew that that wasn't necessarily what he kept, but that it seemed more likely than usual. So I looked at how to take that spot away from him. I saw WOG. That looked good. It's actually horrible. After I played it, I noticed how stupid it was. It gives Tunnicliffe an even better spot for OX or EX. All it does is makes it a bit more difficult to hit the X there. What a dumb, dumb play that I played way too quickly. Before playing it, I noticed LOGWA(Y)S. I knew that I could have been confusing it with COGWA(Y)S, but it looked way too familiar, as something I have recently studied looks. So I was 90% sure, but I imagined Tunnicliffe was more sure. It also blew my S, so it didn't seem that good so as to guarantee me 50 points next turn. But it was 56, so that is probably the play to make. Especially with 2 blanks out that will be very important to draw one of. But the best play actually seems to be something different than any other one that I have thus far mentioned. GHA(ZA)L+, a new word, is 40 points and keeps WOS for next turn. It also gets rid of the big X spot.

#note When I drew LLN out of the bag, I knew that I had messed up. I didn't know ALL(Y)L, which is the play to make here. This is just plain silly.

#note 80 points in 3 turns, when I could have scored more like 120, and more.

#note This was also really stupid. I chickened out of BILAYER, missed BAILEY, missed G6 plays...

#note I knew he had a blank here. Things were getting rough. All the past few turns, he had been really unhappy with his draws, and looked like he was ready to lose. I was even more unhappy cause I knew that both of the blanks were still in that tile bag. Until this turn. Then my anger turned into desperation, hoping he had drawn really bad stuff.

#note This is the best endgame play, since it induces the most mistakes. It gives me a chance to win. The best endgame play for spread is F(A)UVE for 22.
