>Tim_Thielmann: ACHR 8H ARCH +18 18
#note We exchanged comments about how our tournaments were progressing. I mentioned last game I had no chance, 3 opening bingos and no blanks to my name. Up to this game I had only drawn 4 blanks in 9 games, 22%. Compound that with dumb mistakes like missing OCREATE and missing easy winning plays..... 
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DIOSTU K5 OUT.IDeS +94 94
#note This isn't even a word, but there are no legit double doubles, so it was a good time to get away with a phony.
>Tim_Thielmann: DNO L11 DON +14 32
>Matthew_Larocque: AAENNOR 14I NONAREA +73 167
#note Yikes. Sorry about that, Tim. I never claimed to be good or anything!
>Tim_Thielmann: AESWX 15H WAXES +68 100
#note There's no way he can challenge my phony unless he is 100%, with a play like this. However, it was underscored as 62!
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEILTV H3 VALID.TE +63 230
#note !
>Tim_Thielmann: MY 15N MY +40 140
#note Tim commented that I must have learned from my previous opponent. 
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIIOR H1 RE........ +42 272
#note I didn't even know if this was a word, but I took no time to even think about it.
>Tim_Thielmann: BNR 6J B.RN +12 152
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEEIIO 5E OBE.I +14 286
#note Forgot about BEEDI. This is the greedy play, leaving a massive hook open that I'm not even sure about.
>Tim_Thielmann: EGY 6D GEY +32 184
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIITV 11C EVITED +36 322
#note Smartly not chancing it anymore. Except I missed an awesome play here! This also may be the first time I've made an 11-letter word. 
>Tim_Thielmann: FILOSTW 4B WOLF +26 210
#note He told me his rack.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEIPQU M3 QUI.CE +40 362
#note Last turn: (ARCH)IVED. I had taken note of several extensions, but also forgot many. There's 16 ways to extend ARCH to the TWS! I saw like 4 and then moved on. As for this turn, it was close between this and CAIQU(E), but he seemed to be looking over at B(U)RN quite a bit, plus it could have potentially been a setup. On the other hand, maybe he doesn't know CAIQUE, and it still weakens his bingo options. Wait what am I babbling about, I failed to play PIQUA(N)CE for 98! I could have made a run for 600 with that. Even when I get lucky, I manage to disappoint.
>Tim_Thielmann: ITTU N1 TUIT +21 231
>Tim_Thielmann: ITTU --  -21 210
#note The sad part is, if I hadn't quickly examined the new fours, this might have stayed on the board.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGILP 1A PIlLAGE. +83 445
#note Even though I missed PIQUANCE, Scrabble decides to reward me with a blank. There is no justice.
>Tim_Thielmann: EIITTTU -TUIT +0 210
#note I don't know what his rack was, but he tried *TUIT and didn't want to play TUI after.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFGRRS 13G FRAG +28 473
>Tim_Thielmann: JOT 3A JOT +29 239
>Matthew_Larocque: ENNORSZ C10 Z.RO +26 499
#note Pretty sure I left ENNS. I couldn't see anything else with the Z, unless I want to play R(E)ZONE.
>Tim_Thielmann: AHMOS 2E HOM. +25 264
>Matthew_Larocque: EINNS 9K .NS +23 522
#note Missed rack, too bad, I wanted to know if I missed a better way to score points here.
>Tim_Thielmann: AIPST N2 PIT +23 287
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKLNTU O1 KI +22 544
#note I might have been able to play KIST up top here depending on what I had last turn and what I kept. However, the stellar (B)U(C)KET is available here, but that's hard to see when you don't have any time left.
>Tim_Thielmann: AAEISU D10 A.ES +31 318
#note A play like KUN(E) last turn stops this.
>Matthew_Larocque: ELNTU 9D LUNE. +14 558
#note ELUT(E) for 26.
>Tim_Thielmann: AIU O4 AI +7 325
>Matthew_Larocque: T E11 .T +5 563
#note BURNT
>Matthew_Larocque:  (U) +2 565
#note Good drawing, poopy endgame.
