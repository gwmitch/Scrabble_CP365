#note eh. i sorta gave up after that. somehow this is simming near the top at multi-ply but i don't think anything really wins. J3 IRID is ahead by win% a little. (-3%) i'd have to bingo out and stick him with the QVB or something.

#note sure would be nice to have the blank for QWERTy. I3 QI is the best play here. (-19) I sort of tried to get into his head, and maybe it's my own pride talking here, but i thought ILEUSEs was easier to miss than LEISUrE/ELUSIvE and i just didn't want him to bingo out :( of course i know rob knows the words, but for someone who studies a lot of low-prob stuff, something like ILEUSEs could be difficult to anagram if it doesn't pop into his head right away. still he had 13 minutes and found it not after long.
