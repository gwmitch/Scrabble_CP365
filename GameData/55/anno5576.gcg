>Jim_Burlant: EIINRTY 8G YIN +12 12
#note Hmmm...the duck prefers exchanging IY, with this choice coming in second.  Yeah, I realize it's easy to front-hook this with the A and very easy to do a 3-tile overlap, but I'd rather not offer her the chance for an X, Q, J, or Z play at 8D, as low-probability as any of those are. 
>Lynda_Finn: BELU 7G BLUE +25 25
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIRTT K5 TAsTIER +80 92
#note TITRATE, TERTIAN, etc. score one more point in the same location.  sTRIATE and bIRETTA (both at K5) are the sim winners. 


>Lynda_Finn: ENOR 8K .ONER +18 43
>Jim_Burlant: BDELOOU J9 OBOL +26 118
#note Quackle prefers BOOED in the same location, but the sim suggests this position is as much about personal preference as anything else; this choice, which sims 4th, loses fewer than 3 points to the first choice.
>Lynda_Finn: RY 6J Y.R +27 70
>Jim_Burlant: DEEHQTU O4 QUEE. +24 142
#note Quackle prefers holding the Q and playing L11 EDH 17, keeping EQTU.  I would much rather unload it here.  Unable to find QU(BY)TE G5 21, I made this play reluctantly as I wasn't thrilled with the DHT leave, but sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.   Lynda told me after the game that, when I put this down, she was sitting on ADIORSV and that, being unsure of any of the backhooks for OBOL, she had intended to put down AVODIRES N2.  This play blocked that, and this had a huge impact on the outcome of the game. 
>Lynda_Finn: ADIORSV M2 AVOID +26 96
>Jim_Burlant: ADHNTWX N1 AX +36 178
#note Though second in win percentage, this play sims at the highest valuation of any of the choices.  OTher options include F8 TAX 33, and 2I HAN(D)AX (which I didn't know).
>Lynda_Finn: DE O1 DE +28 124
>Jim_Burlant: ADGHNTW 6E WHA +25 203
#note Not thrilled with the leave but given that she missed the OBOL backhook when she played VOID, I figured I should leave that line for myself.  The sim doesn't like this play, preferring L10 DAWT.
>Lynda_Finn: CEL E3 CLE. +18 142
>Jim_Burlant: AADGNTZ L10 DANG +21 224
#note Whoops!  Missed F8 ADZ, the sim winner but am not sure I would have played it despite the mega points - with this much lead, why give her an easy E hook if I don't have to?  This choice comes in third, at a hefty loss of equity. 
>Lynda_Finn: EFW 4D F.EW +20 162
>Jim_Burlant: AAHJTTZ I11 TAJ +24 248
#note Blind to F8 plays again.  TAJ F8 is clearly best, though this play is very strong defensively as well.  While it coughs up 12 equity points to TAJ F8, during the post-mortem Lynda's first comment to me was to compliment me on this particular play, since it really tightened up the board and made it much harder for her to do much of anything.
>Lynda_Finn: ACFIRST -AC +0 162
>Jim_Burlant: AEHPSTZ 9C ZETAS +35 283
#note Gotta know the hook to put it down.  I had no clue that FLEW took an S, and I'm going to venture that Lynda didn't know this, either.   I wasn't thrilled with opening all these lines, but given that I was now up 86 points and that I wasn't opening a 2x2, the 35 points here weren't the worst thing that could happen.  Despite the hemorrhaging of equity, the duck says my winning chances are > 97% with this play.
>Lynda_Finn: DIR 13L .RID +12 174
>Jim_Burlant: GHIKNPP C6 PHI. +22 305
#note Too paranoid about the lines I opened on the previous turn to look for equity.  Wasn't thrilled with the leave (gee, how many times have I said that this game?) but I felt blocking was paramount here.  
>Lynda_Finn: GRSUU B3 GURUS +19 193
#note Incorrectly scored as 18.
>Jim_Burlant: FGKNOPS N10 POK.NG +38 343
#note Probably the most interesting position in this game.  It's very clear that not only does she have another S, but she's created a lane for herself down row 1 for which I don't have a good block.    Ultimately, I decided that, since this play would put me up 151 points, even if she did hit the 3x3 I'd still have a marginal lead and would be able to weather the storm, especially if I had a 5 starting with F at D8.  Quackle prefers a bunch of H1 plays, but once again you have to know the hook to play it.  This play sims at > 99% winning chances now.
>Lynda_Finn: AINNO A7 ANION +21 214
>Jim_Burlant: EEEIISV 15L VI.S +36 379
#note Quackle once again prefers H1 plays - come on Quackle, how about acknowledging the need for defense once in a while?   Yeah, EEEI is nothing great but with a 129-point lead and no 3x3's open the only thing unsettled is the final score.
>Lynda_Finn: IM O11 MI. +18 232
>Jim_Burlant: EEEFORT B10 FET +29 408
#note And now I go to sleep.  Wasn't sure what I could do here...and I thought I was oh-so-cleverly blocking any out bingos when I put this down.  Joke's on me!
