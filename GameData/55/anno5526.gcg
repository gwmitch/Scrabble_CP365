#note Joe Edley e-mailed me about this position and told me that PEND 11K is infinitely better according to Quackle.  I'm not so sure, since it would empty the bag and leave me with a J that doesn't fit well on this board.  As it turns out, PEND would have lost, assuming Ian played the endgame optimally.

#note I wasn't sure enough of SPRENT, which wins by a few more points.  But I was happy to find the only other winning play.  Whew!
