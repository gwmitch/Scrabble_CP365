#note He should have passed here because he ended up drawing the Q.
>Brad_W.: ?AEIINN 1L .INN +33 376
#note I couldn't decide what to fish for so I decided to assume he had the Q and try to stick him.  To that regard, I should have played JEAN instead of JINN.  It would have meant keeping two I's but it also would have allowed me to keep an extra consonant (N) which would have been helpful for scoring.

>Brad_W.: ?AAEI 2H .AE +14 390
#note I was pretty low on time and took some quick points.
>Winter: AENQTU 14H ..NUATE +18 437
#note This was scored as 20 which would have made my endgame analysis trickier if I had had any time to do an endgame analysis.

>Brad_W.: ?AI 5K Is +13 403
#note I was surprised to find out there's a tie in this position, and there's a win in this position.  This wasn't it though.  I'd like to think that with more time I would have found them but I'm not so sure.  I'll post them in the next comment in case you want to look for them yourself.  Of course, given that he had overscored his last play by 2, I would not have realized the tie or win until the recount.

>Winter: Q -  +0 437
>Brad_W.: A M13 A. +4 407
#note Missed M3 (Y)A 7 and 9H (T)A 6.  Here's my thought process for the previous turn.  I saw my play of 5K Is but thought it was 15 not 13.  I also saw I12 A(XI)s 15.  I didn't find anything better.  I was now down to about 10 seconds so I played the first one thinking they were the same score.  That cost me 2 points.  The final score reported was 439-427.  If I had played AXIS and he hadn't overscored his last play, the score would have been 437-429, still a loss.  The tie involves seeing a play I did not see: I12 I(XI)A 16.  After L1 JARLs 11  I would have appeared to lose the game 439-437 but would have tied on the recount 437-437.  The win involves seeing a play that I did see but realizing that I could make the play in two steps, thereby getting points for the X twice: I13 (XI)s 9 followed by I12 A(XIs) 15.  After M13 I(T) 4 I would have appeared to lose the game 439-438 but would have won 438-437 on the recount.  Whew what an ending.
