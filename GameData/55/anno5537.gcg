#note couldn't find anything that scored, so I thought I'd ditch the V and an A.  Quackle likes keeping the V and playing 10H BAH

>Laurie: ?AACHIX 3M AX +28 313
#note This was a hard one.  Apparently, 3M AH gives me 90% Winning chances. That play didn't occur to me.   It works, because there are lots of good come back possibilities with the X like axenic, alexia, etc., but he can still block with an I  
>Geoff: MO G9 MO. +21 344
>Laurie: ?ACEEHI K3 H.E +12 325
#note He blocked BEACHIER and there are no other bingos available - a point that took me awhile to comprehend.  After that, it took me more time to comprehend that there were no 6 letter words beginning with E.  My next thought was that maybe I could stick him with the Q.  Of course by now, I've gone into overtime
