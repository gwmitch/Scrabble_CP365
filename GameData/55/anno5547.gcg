#note I saw POOLSIDE right away, but despite writing on my scoresheet the alphagrams that my rack made with each consonant, I completely missed the common word bingo.  Thanks a lot, Sam, for pointing it out right after the game.
>Steve: AIR 7G RIA +13 87
>Dave: ?DDEGIS J1 GIDDiES +67 88
#note My brain froze up here.  I thought there were probably some nines, but I couldn't find any of them, which is pretty bad since one of them is almost the same as the word I played.  My play is actually the highest scoring one, though it might be worth the point sacrifice not to open the triple, especially given the inference of a strong rack after RIA.  But I had no way of knowing that I was giving him exactly the letter he needed.

#note I have some very interesting choices here including SUBJOIN (which I didn't see), JOINTER, and even JOINTS, which hopes to win the race to the final N for UNJOINTS.  The philosophy behind my play is to keep a tight board in which he can't score much without creating more openings, while I have time to build toward a bingo that would go on the F, M or N column.  It might seem strange to want a blocked up board when I'm so far down, but it slows down the game, allowing more time for a comeback.
>Steve: ABT 6B BAT +21 296
>Dave: ABINRSV E3 N.B +10 186
#note 9B ARB is a reasonable choice, given that it sets up a few more lines, but without one of the front hooks it's a shot in the dark.  I thought there might be value in keeping the X spot on 9C open.  Meanwhile I'm setting up another S hook and trying to deny him any scoring plays that keep the board tight.
>Steve: GIR D1 GRI. +11 307
>Dave: AAIIRSV 1A VIR.A +27 213
#note Just chipping away at the lead a little bit at a time, though I've still got a long way to go.
>Steve: ELX 9A LEX +39 346
#note Suddenly, fate intervened.

#note I underscored this by two points.  Keeping the final U is very valuable with the Q unseen.
>Steve: Q E10 Q. +11 411
#note Just in time, as I was about to play VIS in that spot to try to Q stick him.
>Dave: ALOSSUV E10 ..S +18 439
#note On this and the next turn, I completely let my guard down.  The remaining pool didn't look that good, so I missed the three bingos he could still draw.  But the score is still close and it's not clear if I have a way to prevent all bingos without sacrificing too many points.  Quackle thinks my best chance to win is SALVO M5, for what that's worth.
>Steve: AAHMORT M3 .H +5 416
#note He's got one more shot at drawing a bingo, and one of the letters he needs is still in the bag!
>Dave: AILOSUV 15D .IVAL +24 463
#note I thought he was fishing for TAMARAO and knew he couldn't hit it.  But he could have gotten the Y for AMATORY.  What's worse is that from my point of view he might also have TRAMWAY.  Quackle sim thinks I do not have a guaranteed winner, but the best I can find is OVAL 10G which it says wins over 87% of the time.

#note I was definitely more lucky than good in this one.
