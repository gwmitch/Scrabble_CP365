>Deen: AEJ K5 AJE. +22 22
>Matthew: DHIMOTX L3 MIX +33 107
#note It sims best, but in retrospect, I hate it. It gives Deen a nice comeback if he has an E, and his last play infers he has an E guaranteed. I wish I would think like this over the board. Woulda gone with SIXTH, I think.
>Deen: BEEN M2 BENE +32 54
>Matthew: DHOOPTU 9E PHOTO +26 133
#note Hate keeping the U, but UPSHOOT isn't enough, and I don't want to risk anything on column N.
>Deen: IQ N1 QI +30 84
>Matthew: DENNPTU O2 DUN +11 144
#note Quackle prefers N5 DUN by a couple points. I just knew he had the I, though. I'm so used to seeing Deen turn down risky plays like that unless he has the key tile. I dunno, though. I considered N5 DUN, but it just felt like he'd get the triple at O8, I wouldn't draw the I, and then he'd get the triple at O1. Seems paranoid and unlikely, but with a lead like this, it seems to make sense.
>Deen: AGIR F4 GARI.. +12 96
>Matthew: EEINOPT 4D PI.EON +20 164
#note In hindsight, I might have gone with my first choice DUNNITE. PIGEON felt like it accomplished nothing and gave him an easy hot spot. Quackle actually likes my play, though. Close with EPIGONE, which I just missed.
>Deen: LMO E3 L.MO +22 118
>Matthew: EEFFNTT G3 F.TE +19 183
#note Missed E9 PFFT and I'll probably miss it ten years from now when it comes up again. 10I TEFF is also better than my play.

#note Tied with HUN. Shoulda played HUN, but hindsight is always...

#note Deen's actual rack. This game's in the bag, right?
>Matthew: ADIIRWY O7 WIRY +37 414
>Deen: ACDENOR 12A ACORNED +76 389
#note Well that was unlikely.
>Matthew: AADEILU B10 DE.AL +24 438
#note Pretty much botched this endgame. Pfft. Oh well.
