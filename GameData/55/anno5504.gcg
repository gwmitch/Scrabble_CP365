>Gibson: EO 8H OE +4 4
#note As Gary Oldman said in The Professional, "I like these calm little moments before the storm."
>Koenig: ADEHKSY I7 K.Y +19 19
#note You could make a case for DYKE, but meh, this is perfectly good.
>Gibson: BCEIORS 10C CORBIES +78 82

>Gibson: DIORTUY 5G .UDITORY +74 156
#note David took a little while to make this play and mentioned after the game that he almost missed it.  Meanwhile I'm thinking, in the two games I've played against him, he's bingoed twice in the first three turns both times.  Luckbox.
>Koenig: AEHOOOQ N1 HOOE. +22 111
#note OHO is not bad, but with the Q I like turning over the extra tile.  Keeping QI H1 alive is not bad either.  If only I had seen his rack.
>Gibson: ACIRSTZ 2B CZARI.TS +92 248
#note Ummm... this is crazy.  This guy gets the easiest bingos in the world, and I have no chance.
>Koenig: AALOOQT 4J QAT +41 152
#note But I will keep my cool and hope my rack improves.
>Gibson: ?DDILLN D1 L.NDsLID +74 322
#note Wow, either this guy thinks he can push me around, or he's finally showing me the reason he's a National Champion.
>Koenig: AILNOOU -  +0 152
#note David Gibson just taught me a new word!
>Gibson: AEX O1 AXE +56 378
#note Whew!  Finally he didn't bingo and let up with a small play.
>Koenig: AILNOOU C2 .OO +31 183
>Gibson: EEEFNRT M5 .EFERENT +66 444
#note This may be the first time that I've had a score like 444-183 and *not* been on the winning side.
>Koenig: ABILNUW L10 WAUL +25 208
#note I totally stand by this move.  In a closer game I'd probably play WEAN, but you need to shed that U and give yourself optimum chance to bingo here.  Not that I had any delusions of coming back.  Just trying to keep it respectable.
>Gibson: NTV 8L V.NT +33 477
#note I'm mildly surprised he didn't have the J.
>Koenig: ?ABINPS 13I BAI.S +44 252
#note If my opponent were playing my side here, I'm sure he would have found the 104 point play.
>Gibson: AJW K9 JAW +44 521
#note Wow, that's a low scoring play for him.
>Koenig: ?AIMNPR O8 .RAMPINg +92 344
#note Woo hoo, respectability!
>Gibson: EFU 8A FEU. +24 545
#note And of course he takes the spot where I wanted to dump three tiles.
>Koenig: GIIPRTU 6B IG.U +7 351
>Gibson: EGGINV 15I VEGGIN. +13 558
#note He took a while to find the ideal way to block my bingo and virtually assure himself of an out on the next turn.
>Koenig: AEIMPRT M1 APT +34 385
#note I thought for a while after quickly laying down PRIMATE and then CAMPER.  Eventually I realized that this was much better for my spread and played it.  He graciously complimented me on a good move, but AIMER was two points better.
