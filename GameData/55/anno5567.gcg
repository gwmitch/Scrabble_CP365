>Dave: EEEHINU -EEHIU +0 0
#note Maybe keeping EHN is a touch better.  HUE doesn't impress me much.
>Brett: ?BDGORY 8G BOGY +20 20
>Dave: EEFMNNT 9F FEN +14 14
#note BOGYMEN is cute, but not quite as good as this.
>Brett: ?ADIRRW J6 WR. +17 37
#note Missing a magical bingo.
>Dave: EEIMNNT 10H EMINENT +66 80
#note This wasn't hard to find, since Polatnick had opened with it against me the previous round.
>Brett: ?ADHIOR 11B HAIRDOs +73 110
#note RADIOPHONE is an understandable miss, but there's no reason not to play this word for seven more.
>Dave: AEILOUW B9 AW.ILE +40 120
>Brett: DEFHNOS A6 FOHN +32 142
#note DENS is a much stronger leave than DES.  No question FOH is better.
>Dave: AIOORUV 5J AVO +22 142
>Brett: ADEEIKS A12 KADI +58 200
#note LAKESIDE is easy to miss here, especially when your eyes are locked onto a 58 point play, but Brett's comment about the bingo being volatile is sheer nonsense.
>Dave: ?IIORTU 6A .RUITIOn +64 206
>Brett: AAEENRS 10E AE +15 215
#note Sigh.
>Dave: AEINSTU E5 U. +4 210
>Brett: AEENRSX M8 AN.EXERS +82 297
#note "HOLD!!!" I said.  I always remember that one of INDEX and ANNEX takes RE- and -ER but the other only RE-.  Actually, this exact one has come up in games before.  I probably would have thought about it longer and challenged it off, if I didn't have this comeback.

>Brett: CEEILSZ L8 ZE. +45 342
>Dave: EGLMSTU 8L ..GS +42 401
#note I was *very* tempted to play MUG, but I'm glad I didn't.
>Brett: ACEILSV 4A VESICAL +87 429
>Dave: ELMORTU O1 MOULTER. +83 484
>Brett: BDGILOP L12 OP +30 459
#note Brett is right to look for better moves here.  The leave is too consonant heavy.
>Dave: EOPQTTU L4 P.T +10 494
#note I thought I was in great shape to win here, but the one thing that could mess me up was JILL 4L.  This move temporizes just right for the endgame while holding good scoring plays QUEER, USQUE and QUA.  There is one downside to holding the Q here, which is that I could draw the J, as in fact I did.
>Brett: BDGILRY D10 G.RLY +22 481
>Dave: AEJOQTU F2 QU. +32 526
#note I saw that USQUE would give me outs in two places, but with the case A this looked like such a strong setup.  I scanned the board carefully but missed his out play.
>Brett: BDDI D1 BID. +10 491
#note Fortunately for me, so did Brett.  DISBUD wins 529-526.  At least he found the right way to block my big JATO play. BI/QI would have allowed JABOT.
