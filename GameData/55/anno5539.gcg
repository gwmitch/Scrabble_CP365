#note At this score, I strongly prefer my move to Quackle's suggestion of ROTL.  Even if I draw a bingo, it's not likely to fit after ROTL.  Here I am setting up a new spot, and with three O's already played, it's likely Joey will have to score low in order to block it.

#note Us is the kind of play you make when you're down by 100, not up by 100.
>David_Koenig: AEEINRT I8 .RATINEE +61 110
#note Of course I saw ARENITE.  I even laid it on the board and then changed my mind.  Many times ARENITE would be correct, but there were two reasons I preferred GRATINEE here.  1) I was still chasing even after bingoing and wanted to pry the board open. 2) Winning wasn't necessarily going to be enough.  I might have to win by a LOT in order to pass some of the other 10-6 folks to make it into the Final Four.

>David_Koenig: ADNOPSW J10 WOP +36 146
#note 14G P(RE)DAWNS 36 is a nice play in this situation that might be better because it keeps the board open.  Obviously WOP would be best in a close game.
>Joey_Mallick: AABINRS K9 BARS +30 199
>David_Koenig: ADENRSU 12C UNDER.... +24 170
#note I figured it was likely that ASUNDER would get blocked, and I desperately searched for ways to open the board.  H1 URED(I)A 27 is probably a little bit better than this move, but they're both the right idea.  On short plays it's too easy for him to block the bingo lines.
>Joey_Mallick: AEINOOZ F10 ZO.AE +36 235
#note No question, G11 O(R)ZO 48 is a big improvement.
>David_Koenig: AAHIMNS 4A MANIA +21 191
#note 13C HA is a terrible move which blocks up the board when I need it open.  MANIA not only creates vertical bingo lines, it also opens up row 3.
>Joey_Mallick: INOOQYY A4 .OONY +30 265
#note C11 Q(U)OIN 28?  No way.
>David_Koenig: CFHISSX B3 C.SH +32 223
#note 3B FIX scores great but seriously kills the board.  C8 FICH(U)S wasn't exactly great for the board either, but I considered it, until I found this play, which hopes to draw one of the five remaining E's for REFIXES while still keeping many bingo lines open.
>Joey_Mallick: DEGIIQY C11 Q.ID +28 293
#note He blocked my miracle bingo, but I've still got some life.
>David_Koenig: EFIRSTX 14H ..FIXES +50 273
#note How am I supposed to win after 14H (RE)X?  Maybe if I draw the S or W and he leaves row 3 open, but it's not the percentage play.  Instead I score 50 now and assure that at least one bingo line will still be open on the next turn.
>Joey_Mallick: EGIMOTY 15M MOG +24 317
#note There's no good reason to play 13L OMIT over this, as it needlessly gives me bingo line on the O column.  In a situation like this killing my comeback chances is far more important than squeezing a little more equity out of his rack.  G4 G(R)IM(L)Y 31 is a beautiful play which has the virtue of blocking both column 3 and plays to H1, but Joey's play makes a lot of sense too as it takes out my most likely bingo spots.
>David_Koenig: AEERTTV 10B VET +29 302
#note I'm keeping a great leave and only 15 points away!
>Joey_Mallick: EIPSTWY 15A WISPY +64 381
#note Oof.  So much for all that effort.
>David_Koenig: AAEILRT L8 LA +7 309
#note I was desperately short of time here and couldn't figure out anything better.  I need to open another line or he will block column 3 clinching the game.  One tile fishes didn't seem to give me a good chance to draw something that would fit on row 3, which was the more likely lane to stay open.  If anyone else has a better idea I'm all ears, though I doubt I can win even with a bingo.

#note Q says (H)ET -> KA -> (T)I(N) -> (NOD)E -> (E)R.
#note This continuation looks to be 14 points better than what I played.  I  went over on the clock at some point during these moves.
