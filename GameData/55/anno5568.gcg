#note Doh! I was so amused by the extension play that I forgot to look for what should have been an obvious bingo.

#note I saw WEENSIER, but I couldn't remember if it was good.  I thought GREENIER was a bit safer, but I couldn't remember if that was good either.  Geez, I'm rusty on the high prob stuff.

#note I have a couple of very nice scoring plays in FRAY and FRAME, but this manages the rack much better.  I reap the benefits of this very quickly.

#note This is a poor move that makes things closer than they should be.  The problem is that he can easily block both of my outs at once.  I should play off more tiles with EVENLY or LIVEN.
