#note I got too excited about this play. MINT is better than IT and  I should know that. TETH is fine here. THAT is good if I should play it safe.

#note Or O(L)EUM. The sim has them neck-and-neck. I would think I should play OLEUM to keep the better leave first.

#note OVUM/MINION is available here. I thought of INION hooks when Dielle played it, but didn't write down mp(INION) as I usually do on my scoresheet. Big mistake.

#note I need the blank here to win, but I don't necessarily win if I get the blank. In fact, I have to get a bit lucky because I will probably need a draw that bingos from at least one of TWIG (EN shouldn't be hard to hit). Not taking implication into account, Zyzzyva tells me I have about 60 chances at this, subtracting to around 45 because she could bingo or block the W perhaps. Out of 732 possible draws, these odds aren't very good, even if I underestimated quite a bit. On the other hand, I could play (M)OTTE, after which it's hard to deny me a seven letter word. I should bingo a lot more after MOTTE, plus she can't usually outrun me if I do get the blank. I didn't think this play through very well, even though I had plenty of time left and knew this was a crucial situation. I just didn't see any other options that immediately looked great, so I played way too quickly.
