#note interesting play, he laid down VERA at 9D first and then played this. I think I would do something fishier.

#note risky play, quackle suggests AREA at 2K which sims even and creates two spots for me to play, but also bingoes much less often.

#note yikes, what an awful phony. valid in no dictionary. I have no idea what I was thinking, especially since I have a really solid play with NARY at 9F which he will block...

#note running low on time, it seemed like the best chance I had was to fish some way or another. I saw GUANO but the bag was ugly and given the tiles available it seemed I might just be giving him free points. in retrospect though the points might not matter because any scoring play he makes would empty the bag and I'd be fishing to TINE, considerably better than EINOT. Playing OUT instead of NUT seems to bingo slightly more often as well. this is still not a bad option I think.

#note very fortunate draw...
>Jerry_Lerman: AACCEOS 15A ACES +26 376
#note I didn't have time to figure out what he might have, but him having the two Cs is huge. that said I still win if I draw a C because there are two spots. CACAOS is his best play.
