>JD: AAORSTU G11 OAT +14 14
#note looked for ages but there are a few better choices, TAO for an extra point or AA takes me from 33% to bingo to 50%ish

#note surbase is better defense because it's harder to score to the triple.

>JD: ADILMOT J4 DOM +24 127
#note saw MALOTI but decided to play short given the relatively open board

#note was feeling pretty good by this point, but...
>Peter_deux: DEEHINR 8A HINDERE. +92 189
#note it's a game
>JD: EEGOTWY 7E YEW +29 217
#note EE is often a better combo than EO, and that's the case here. I swapped YOW for YEW because I was worried about letters that could go at 6F, but that's relatively minor in retrospect.
>Peter_deux: IOPVX 13C PIVO. +20 209
#note he actually had the X on this play for the sweet double setup.
>JD: AEEEGOT 4D GOATEE. +20 237
#note didn't see the overlap on column I. for some reason I wasn't looking at that spot. sims even
>Peter_deux: IORRRXZ 5C ZORI +35 244
#note I think his rack was something like this (he had XI and passed it up).
>JD: BEFGHST N3 BETH +36 273
#note almost played SHOTE here for 46 but the resulting BFG combo is just too ugly. actually here the H is more valuable than the S so the tricky BEGETS (at I3) wins the sim by a point.

>JD: DFGILSS 14F FIGS +36 309
>Peter_deux: ERX 6F REX +25 290
#note given that he has RE at M3 this seems like giving up his X too easily, but then again he was looking to bingo at this point
>JD: ADLOPST H1 POL.A. +45 354
#note up 8% winning percentage over PLOD
>Peter_deux: ADEILRT 2D TAIL.RED +63 353
>JD: CDSTUUW 12M WUD +23 377
#note looked like I was in trouble at this point after the UUW draw. I was shocked when analyzing this game to realize that this might not be the right play. SCUD at 12L emptying the bag to score 9 extra wins any sim I make by about 10%! I tried attributing it to misplays by quackle with its endgame solver but it looks like STUD gets me up far enough that I will often be able to pull out the win. Interesting! Would love to understand this play better.
>Peter_deux: ?AJLNNO B7 N.NJA +28 381
#note this play wins half the endgames. If he draws an S, the I or a T (depriving me of ICTUS), he wins by a little bit thanks to threa. of course, to win two of my endgames I have to find SNOTS at I8 which is tough. JOIN wins half also. In actually GINS was in the bag when I played WUD, so I also had a 50-50 chance of drawing a winning tile.
