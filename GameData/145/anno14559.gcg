>David_Gibson: DHILORT 8G HOD +14 14
#note He debated between this and THIRD.  Q likes LIROTH best.  Champ 4-ply likes DHOTI.  From where he's sitting, he wants the play that makes it hardest for you to bingo out of the hatch.  THIRD would have prevented this.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEEQT 7D EQuATED +80 80
#note And I was just hoping for him to put a A on the star.  Flashes back from our last game.  I have no idea how I misscored this as 82.  He didn't catch it either.  There's two placements for 86 that'd've been much better.  Sloppy.
>David_Gibson: AEILNRT D7 .NTAILER +68 82
>Ryan_Fischer: BENOOST 8A BOO. +18 98
#note I missed EOBIONTS/BONITOES, thinking BIOTONES* was bogus.  Yuck.
>David_Gibson: AEIRSVW 10D .IRWAVES +68 150
#note He said he realized he was giving up a lot playing AIRWAVES, but with my playing short, he didn't want to give me ERS to work with.  Especially the S.  That's why he passed up WAIVERS.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEINSTU 14A INT.UDES +76 174
#note I take the opposite tack: maximize points, maximize volatility.
>David_Gibson: ETW H12 WE.T +33 183
#note The perfect play for me.  This rarely happens!
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADFLRR 13G D.FeRRAL +89 263
#note Best and only.
>David_Gibson: MPR A12 PR.M +33 216
>Ryan_Fischer: AEOTTUX 11B AX.TE +30 293
#note Something John told me is to be careful not to break up your rack too much versus David because eventually you'll get too far behind with a rack that really goes nowhere on a board that is increasingly dead.  This might be one of those cases.  AXITE scores best, but leaves OUT.  That's not going anywhere exciting.  EXU(L)T, which I didn't notice, scores two LESS and ditches the U.  much better, though it breathes life into the board.  Something I don't want to be doing right now.  Hard to say what to do here.  (S)TO(R)AX is another option.
>David_Gibson: ACEEPRS 6I RESPACE +78 294
#note Ugh.  What to do now?
>Ryan_Fischer: INOOSTU K10 .OU. +8 301
#note I missed (R)OU(E).  Had the right idea with SOUR.  This was such a bad position, made even worse by what I'd draw.  OUTSIN is a good option for scorin, trying to keep ahead of him.
>David_Gibson: EJLO N10 JEL.O +56 350
#note Yow.  ...and I drew back the SAME two letters.  -_-  If I hadn't missed that early bingo I'd really have something to complain about.
>Ryan_Fischer: INOOSTU I3 TOU... +8 309
#note ROUE or ROUEN is still the winner.  I thought I had to open up the board to have a chance, hence this.  Not entirely true because of the C.  I still had one more shot at a bingo through P, A, or E. (or longshots to B or O.)
>David_Gibson: AFKN O5 K.NAF +36 386
>Ryan_Fischer: BIINNOS 15L NISI +28 337
#note SNIB  is a nice option.  At least creates a dangerous lane.  NISI isn't as good as I thought.  I neglected to see the Z is still out, but the Ts are gone so ZEST isn't an option.
