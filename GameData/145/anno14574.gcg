#note This is OK, but I wish I'd seen KIDDER. That looks like a better play.

#note 6D DUIT is better equity, but I felt compelled to open a juicier S lane. This probably gives too much back most of the time. And Adam's not super defensive early in the game, so I'll probably still have lanes after DUIT/TWAES

#note Sims better than DIZEN. I definitely had second thoughts.

#note I burned a ton of time here, because I was sure there was a seven. (There's not.) And then I panicked and completely blew it. This play sucks because fishing off an S is WAY better. I did not spent nearly enough time comparing the leaves. I'd love to stop making these awful plays!

#note After the game Adam said he wished he'd done N11 MI since it left me with nothing.

#note Didn't like it, but if I think there's a chance it's good I probably need to go for it at this point. Got lucky it stayed
