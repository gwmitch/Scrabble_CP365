#note INGrAFT is more points but much more danger. I didn't see it but I still prefer wAFTING.

#note She would have had MARTLETS/MALTSTER, and I would have challenged either. lol...
>Joshua_Sokol: EINNPRU -  +0 104
#note I challenged, sillily. I was confident I would still get to play PUNNIER if it was good.

#note TETANY.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIKLLR E8 KILL.R +20 239
#note Did not know CLARKI(A) and missed KIL(N), but I really like this play since she kept a Y and she should be able to get something throught the K, whereas I have an easy 45 points next turn. Sim likes LILAC/CON

#note It's CRACK or QAT here. I guess I should have gone with QAT first...

>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEIQT C7 Q.T +23 310
#note QAID looks better here. I was keeping eed for a nice play at H1. QADI is really dangerous.
