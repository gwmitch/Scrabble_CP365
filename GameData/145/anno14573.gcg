>Rafi: EEIOOSV -EIOOV +0 0
#note I figured it was close between VOE and exch. 5 - close enough to warrant giving myself a better chance at a quick bingo to gain the early advantage. I'm also a better open board player and VOE leads to more closed boards. Quackle prefers VOE with the O on the star, which means that ES is not as strong as I thought, and EIOS is not as weak as I thought.
>Jim_Porter: AAEEGIO 8F AGIO +10 10
#note The rack looked like AAEEGIU, so I'm guessing the U was supposed to be an O. I would probably exchange 6 here, as AEE is pretty weak and "worth" about -10 points to offset the 10 from AGIO.
>Rafi: DEEGSST H4 SEDG.EST +61 61
>Jim_Porter: AAEEIUW -AEIUW +0 10
#note When exchanging tiles, (almost) always leave equal or more consonants than vowels with some exceptions being leaving just an E or if the unseen pool is very consonant heavy. While AE can be good for bingoing, it also leads to some vowel-heavy racks, and gives you fewer chances at the blanks. Leaving just the E is best exchange here... Quackle is favoring TAWIE which seems worse than exchanging to me.
>Rafi: BGIKNOV 5H .VOKING +30 91
#note No other options come close.
>Jim_Porter: ?AEELNV F3 AVELl.NE +64 74
#note Nice find, but EVEN(T)uAL is the star play.
>Rafi: BDEIMPT 3B BITM.P +30 121
#note PIT for 29 is the best alternative, closing some lanes but leaving a worse leave. With a bigger lead, PIT might be the best play, but I can't play defensively yet.
>Jim_Porter: LNRSTTU 5C LUT. +8 82
#note Right idea. Trying to shed one more consonant is better though, as RST is more bingo prone than NRST - you likely need two vowels to bingo. Quackle's top choice here is sneaky... UNL(I)T through the I in EVOKING to set up SUNLIT for a potential bingo to the triple. The more generic option is LUNT wedged between the two bingoes, setting up an S hook and leaving all the lanes from BITMAP and EVOKING wide open.
>Rafi: DDEEQRR L4 Q. +22 143
#note RE(B)RED is worth consideration here, as it scores 31 and gives me a shot at drawing into QI for 46. After your fish however, QI is the clear option for defensive purposes.
>Jim_Porter: NORSTWY E10 WRY +23 105
#note WYN is a bit better to set up an S-hook on a board devoid of many bingo lanes. WRY and  (T)OWNY are the next best options.
>Rafi: DDEERRW 12A WEED. +32 175
#note This turn I saw REBRED, which was the other play I was considering. If I'm behind or tied REBRED might be the play, but I'm not going to open up two bingo lanes with a lead -  especially after two fishing plays. Quackle agrees.
>Jim_Porter: ?ACNOST M1 ACTi.ONS +80 185
#note Lots of bingos available here, and you found the highest scoring one. Nice play!
>Rafi: DEHLNRR 1L H.RL +33 208
#note DENR is much stronger than ELNR, so it's worth the 3 point sacrifice.
>Jim_Porter: AAEFHNR A12 .ARN +21 206
#note FA for 32 is the best play. AEHNR has great scoring potential for next turn, (the H is by far the best 4-pointer) and the AENR synergy can often lead to a bingo in a turn or two. Defaulting to taking the triple isn't always the best play - this was probably your biggest mistake of the game.
>Rafi: DEFNPRR 13A .RF +24 232
#note I missed FR(E)RE for 38. DNP is a good leave too with a pool of 60% vowels. ARF is second best, with DENPR also benefitting from the plethora of vowels.
>Jim_Porter: AEFHJOU 6J HA +32 238
#note Very nice play, noticing FOREWARN and JUICE as possibilities. I likely would have not noticed FOREWARN and played FA, as the H is normally stronger than the F. FA actually sims slightly better (FOREWARN doesn't happen enough with only 2 R's unseen) but the thought was tactically sound.
>Rafi: DENOPRU L8 UNROPED +75 307
>Jim_Porter: EFJOORU A8 FORE.... +42 280
#note With all the E's and I's unseen for JUICE, FOREWARN is much better than JO and other alternatives. Nice play.
>Rafi: ABCELNY 14J BA.LY +34 341
#note Second best, after A(B)BEY for 45. In addition to the points, CLN is a great leave with 17 vowels and 8 consonants in the pool.
>Jim_Porter: ADEEJOU 15H ODEA +21 301
#note Going for JUICE again... and with 6 I's unseen it's easily worth passing up JUDO for 19 more points to go for 69 next turn.
>Rafi: CEINOSZ 2J ZOI. +40 381
#note ZOIC scores as well as anything else and leaves 3 consonants to combat the vowel heavy pool. My SZ draw here was hugely beneficial to me.
>Jim_Porter: EIIIJOU K11 JO +40 341
#note Not much you can do here... JO (and almost anything) leads to a sure loss. Quackle gives you just under 1% if you trade leaving JOE, hoping for JO next turn + something like an SX draw or an unblockable setup (plus I-heavy draws for me). Exchanging also doesn't allow your opponent to take advantage of your bad rack - since I knew the pool was so horrendous I was able to set up my bingo threat without concern.
>Rafi: AACENSU 2A AA +12 393
#note No bingo threat in the pool, and I saw that I could draw into CUISINE, NEUSTIC, or CENTUMS fairly often. 
>Jim_Porter: EEIITTU 3M .UI +3 344
#note This is obviously a bleak position after my AA play... no way am I going to open that spot without the tiles to safely do so. However, if you're faced with this position with AA NOT being the previous play, there might be an occasional sneaky win. I'm pretty lost as to how to evaluate the best chance to win here, but something like (R)EI or (G)IE to open up a second lane might steal a win if you draw CUTTIES and your opponent blocks the wrong spot. In terms of damage control, TUI/TAB is a pretty good play, ruining my bingo lane to cut spread.
>Rafi: CEINSUX I8 .X +34 427
#note Going for NEUSTIC or CUISINE again.
>Jim_Porter: EEIIMTT B6 ITEM +17 361
>Rafi: CEIINSU 1B CUISINE +87 514
