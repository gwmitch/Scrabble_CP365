#note Had no idea what to do here. I finally just got frustrated and threw away as many tiles as I could. PU(N)KIE is a word I didn't know, PI(N)KIE is a play I should have seen, and UKE 9G is really cool. 

You know what isn't cool? That I talked myself into making this play. I suck.

#note BRASILS. 

I saw 6 unseen As and BASILAR played with VACS. Also have a shot into GARBOILS. I decide to start fishing, since I really just can't score points otherwise.
