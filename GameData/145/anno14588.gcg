>JD: AGOOSTT 8G TOG +8 8
#note with both the A and the S figured I'd choose TOG instead of GOT, but that's rarely a good idea with opening racks...the more defensive option tends to sim better. TOGA is also even.
>Lester_Schonbrun: AENNX 7I ANNEX +25 25
>JD: ADEHOST 6M OH +22 30
#note lots of options on this play including HANDSET 2x2. my play is slightly too psycho to be best, but OH at 8K for 2 less leaves me just as many good options and cuts down on his scoring a bit as well.
>Lester_Schonbrun: AEEV 5K EAVE +32 57
>JD: ADEISTT 6I TI +12 42
#note horrendous missed bingo. guess I just didn't look there. 
>Lester_Schonbrun: OPW 4J WOP +26 83
>JD: ADEEIST 5C IDEATES +71 113
>Lester_Schonbrun: AEIU D4 A.IEU +14 97
>JD: BINPSSZ F3 SP.Z +35 148
#note lots of non-intuitive options here. could you bring yourself to play the top-simming play of NIBS? It wins by almost 10 points! but I think I would forgo that degree of volatility, especially since the odds are much better than random that he has the last S or a blank. actually, SNIPS at O1 also beats SPAZ in a sim since I can draw to ZEBU or BAIZE/BRAZE/BLAZE

>Lester_Schonbrun: DDIK 1D KIDD. +16 143
>JD: EIJNRST K3 J.. +10 187
#note somehow missed JEW which sims 2 points better. I guess this is the uber-safe option

>Lester_Schonbrun: AQU B13 QUA +35 206
>JD: AEFILRR 15A F.IR +24 284
#note I saw FARRIER but I have to block! I should turn over as many tiles as I can though to try and pick up a blank - with 4 Es and 3 Rs left quackle wants me to play FAIRER. However my play does leave the board tighter and without any 7s lane, and he would've bingoed had I played FAIRER, so I think I am happy with my choice.
>Lester_Schonbrun: BEEFILR 10J FEEB +38 244
#note he had BALEFIRE natural!

>Lester_Schonbrun: CLOY 12L C.OY +26 282
>JD: EMNOSVW H13 V.W +27 461
#note tricky little endgame. VAW is obvious but I am then left with no outs after he plays GYRAL for a bunch of points.. I did come up with the best endgame after the game - YEN for 6 leaving VOWS for next turn, blocking GYRAL and keeping VAW as a fallback. It's 18 points better than my play.
>Lester_Schonbrun: AGGILRR O11 G.RAL +27 309
#note after YEN I spotted ARGIL over the board but his best play is actually CARL at L12 leaving IGG at B6 next turn. cool endgame!
>JD: EMNOS 8A ME.. +18 479
#note he's going out regardless so I should just tack on the S.
>Lester_Schonbrun: GIR G8 .IG.R +7 316
#note altogether one of my sloppiest tournament games in a long time. lucky I won. some interesting positions along the way too.
