>Matthew_Larocque: AAEGORS I7 A.O +14 14
#note I had the letters arranged AGORASE and kept thinking to myself "no, I'm pretty sure it's AGOROSE". Yeah. Also maybe I should just play AGO instead.

#note Setup.
>Wayne_Clifford: CHOT 5J .OTCH +24 69
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGIRS L3 GI.E +10 45
#note I wanted to play (W)AGE but there's so many hooks on it....
>Wayne_Clifford: ??AEFRT 10B FAlTERs +76 145
#note I did get double blanked an awful lot this tourney, but I still played really bad on top of that.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGORS J9 EGO +12 57
#note Like missing both these bingos. The problem is I always think GHERAO is spelled GERAOH for some reason.
>Wayne_Clifford: ILOT 11C TOIL +17 162
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEJRRS K11 RAJ +24 81
>Wayne_Clifford: AENORST 14H TREASON +79 241
#note That's what I get for missing everything.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDELRS O8 RECLADS +91 172
#note Wayne almost challenged this, and then looked it up on his franklin thingy which doesn't use the up-to-date dictionary. Then he tries to call me out on playing a phony. Ha!
>Wayne_Clifford: APPU 15E PUPA +30 271
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIILMN 13K .IN +26 198
#note I didn't write this rack down but I know I considered plays such as MI(D), 6N MI, and MIN(G)LE. Thought about keeping IN because of the open G. I figured this J spot was easy points for Wayne and MI 6N should still be there next turn. Looks like I missed a 9 letter bingo here.
>Wayne_Clifford: ENO 12C EON +16 287
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIILM 6N MI +23 221
#note I really need a bingo and this play leaves me with a bad leave. Sim is suggesting LIE(G)E.
>Wayne_Clifford: ELUY 13E YULE +18 305
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEEILO 3K O.EE +10 231
#note Not looking good.
>Wayne_Clifford: IQRSTU 2F QUIRTS +39 344
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEFHIL 9B IF +25 256
#note I really liked this play, creating a bingo threat and ensuring that I score well next turn.
>Wayne_Clifford: INOTX 3C TOXIN +40 384
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEHLV A4 HALVED +58 314
#note Can't remember the seventh letter - think it was an M?
>Wayne_Clifford: DEW 13A WED +32 416
>Matthew_Larocque: AIMNRSV 4D MIS +39 353
#note I saw the possible V(I)SA, so I don't know why I ended up tacking on my S here. 
>Wayne_Clifford: ABEGN 2A GAEN +17 433
>Matthew_Larocque: ANRV A13 .AN +18 371
#note Best plays are at L10 - RAN(IS) or NAR(IS).
>Wayne_Clifford: B 12K .B +18 451
>Wayne_Clifford:  (RV) +10 461
#note With only drawing JSS here, I can't expect to win missing my bingos on turns 1 and 4.
