#note There's just nothing worth playing here, so I exchanged, There are a few things you can keep here. I didn't see the point of keeping a consonant heavy leave on this board, so I went with EN to turn over more tiles for the ?SSS left and keep a combination that has good synergy with the available D and T.

#note There are a few good plays here. UM O1, MAGUS/GAUMS/MURAS 12A and my ARM are all worth a look. Of the 12A plays, MURAS seems correct because there are so many Is left in the pool. I didn't like it though, because of the scoring opportunities it gave up. Between ARM and UM, I don't really have a good reason for my choice. I guess I liked the vowel/consonant balance but that doesn't make too much sense here, especially since I have to keep the U.

#note I wasn't quite positive of this, but I liked it better than lINGUIST, especially after the fishing play, so I went for it.

#note VIG C11 is correct here, as it sets up JAM/VIGA. Ron also said he wouldn't have challenged MEAGEREST*.
