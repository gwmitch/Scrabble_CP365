>Matt_Canik: AEEGPRW 8D WAGER +26 26
#note Forewarning: I'm still very much on tilt after the previous game, and I play this game in like 9 minutes. 

GAWPER is just clearly better, but I didn't know it. 
>Leslie_Millard: ERUZ E8 .ZURE +28 28
>Matt_Canik: DEEPQST 10D S.Q +32 58
#note It was really hard to play SUQ here, but quackle seems to like it a lot more than any alternative. Like 18 points better. 
>Leslie_Millard: IIII -IIII +0 28
>Matt_Canik: CDEEPTT D10 .EPTET +28 86
#note I guess this play is cute, but Q says just SEPT is better by about 5 points. 
>Leslie_Millard: AINW 15D .WAIN +24 52
>Matt_Canik: CDDILNO F1 CLODDIN. +67 153
>Matt_Canik: CDDILNO --  -67 86
#note Firstly, I was pretty sure this is good. 
Secondly, for whatever ridiculous reason, I thought this put a D on a TWS and scored extra points. 
Thirdly, I'm a moron.

>Leslie_Millard: DEIMN 4C MIN.ED +24 121
>Matt_Canik: ABDEIIN 5B BINA. +24 209
#note BA(D)DIE is cool- it doesn't hit a DWS but still scores 27. 
>Leslie_Millard: I 13C I. +4 125
#note SATINE, SATIRE, RETINA, ARSINE bingos all play here, so she's probably fishing with a blank, or so I think. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEEIRT 11C A..IED +18 227
#note I liked this play. It had challenge potential, it blocked her line without opening too much more up (a lot of bingos that play under this also play 9G), and it held ERT while scoring about as much as I can this turn. 
>Leslie_Millard: GIJN 2B JING. +26 151
>Matt_Canik: AEFORTT 13J OFTER +27 254
#note I'm fishing for an S hook here. Since I think she has a blank and this would be the only S-line, I think it's pretty likely she tries.
>Leslie_Millard: EEGH B12 GHEE +22 173
>Matt_Canik: ACLMSTV A13 CAM +44 298
#note Dumb luck that I happened to have one of the most lethal plays possible. 
>Leslie_Millard: ?EEFLSX O7 FLEXErS +107 280
>Leslie_Millard: ?EEFLSX --  -107 173
#note I wasn't too sure FLEXERS was valid (it's not), but I was certain OFTERS wasn't.

>Leslie_Millard: ?AEFLOS L9 FLOA. +16 218
>Matt_Canik: AKORUUY 8K KAURY +49 399
#note This is just so many points, I just sort of accept that she's bingoing out. 
>Leslie_Millard: ??AEPSV N3 VAmPi.ES +69 287
#note She's low on time and plays this to avoid going over. 
>Leslie_Millard:  (OU) +4 291
