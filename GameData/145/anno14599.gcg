#note SAUNA and NAUSEA making BAUDS are interesting choices here. I don't like NAUSEA because I'd like to avoid a very open board against Cecilia. On the other hand, PUNA doesn't avoid an open board, though it does take advantage of the strength of the S. Honestly, this board is pretty hard to close, but SAUNA seems to lean towards that sort of dynamic. I think I like SAUNA a little more than PUNA.

#note Quackle really likes ZETA or AZOTE. CEGOT isn't a great leave but...CFG? Really? Plus more equity for the opponent? I don't get it.

#note So I was trying to make the board very closed here but I'm not sure about this play. I do feel I have the advantage on a closed board, and I don't like play GEE here which makes an annoying S hook for the whole game but I can see a play like T(Y)EE being good here. GIEN doesn't have very good equity so I need to compensate for that. Maybe I can close this area later. Or maybe I just can't do it very well and have to live with it and play GEE. I still don't really like GEE though but TYEE seems alright.

#note Took me forever to see this, after looking for some kind of RETIREMENT fish. After looking at the play some it actually doesn't look very good because it makes it so easy for Cecilia to go out in two. Just look at some of the racks she can get that seem the worst and you'll see what I mean. I'm not even sure if she can lose a game after TRIMER. What does win some games? Maybe TRIM? TRIM certainly makes it easier for Cecila to blunder, and I have some potential at least to get a bingo and win (she can't block effectively, at least not without sacrificing too many points). I think I need to play TRIM and hope for a good draw with an S here.ii
>Cecilia: ADEILOR -  +0 328
#note TRIMER didn't look familiar to Cecilia. She could have won this, but she was flustered from her last game, and also perhaps because I blocked her bingo.

#note RATTEN + AS/QIS is best.
