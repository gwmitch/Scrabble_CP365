#note PEE is a decent choice too. It seems that EIIN is a bit better than EEI. 
>Dean_Saldanha: DGU 6H DUG +15 45
>whatnoloan: AEEFIRU 5I FAERIE +27 47
#note I didn't love making this play, especially since Dean has quite a few esses in his range after DUG. I didn't really see any other options, though they are available: FERIA 6B and EAU 9H. Out of all the choices, EAU keeps the fewest scoring options, and also starts to make a tight board (if he hooks DINE with a bingo I'm pretty screwed). I don't think I want a tight board with this score. FERIA also favors Dean and while FAERIE does that too, I think it's close enough that I should just take the points + leave with FAERIE. Quackle disagrees a bit, with FAERIE giving up 8 more points than FERIA for Dean, and in a sim the two plays are rather close.

>whatnoloan: CEGHILU M1 UGH +24 71
#note I didn't love playing this but it's what I saw. On the upside he probably didn't keep great scoring tiles last turn. I did miss some good options here: FICHU and CHIGOE. I saw plays like HUGE and FUGLE but didn't think those were quite good enough. FICHU and CHIGOE are the best choices here though.

#note Wow, ZEK bingos a TON. Over half the time. I should definitely take ZEK. This makes enough sense, really. I should always be able to play a seven and ABERST is good for eights, so I'll often get an eight too.

#note Wow, quite a lot of mistakes this game. Here I have OXEYES/OXEYE. I like OXEYE because the S is really good here.
