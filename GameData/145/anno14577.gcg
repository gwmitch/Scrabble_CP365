>Mariah_Smith: AEJNS 8D JANES +40 40
>Matt_Canik: FGIOORT 7G FOG +24 24
#note I should play this on bottom to avoid big counterplays. 
>Mariah_Smith: BEW 9G WEB +31 71
#note Like that.
>Matt_Canik: AEIOORT 9D OI +13 37
>Mariah_Smith: AHR 6H RAH +21 92
>Matt_Canik: AEILORT 5H ALOE +22 59
#note I can't expect Mariah to open me up here. Is it right to fish the O with something like (B)O? or BO/OI to set up the L?
>Mariah_Smith: GOT 10B GOT +18 110
>Matt_Canik: AEHIIRT 11C HAIR +30 89
#note Aaaand she blocked HET(AI)RAI 2x2. I'm getting more and more pissed with each passing turn. 
>Mariah_Smith: ?LLNS 12D SNeLL +37 147
#note Yeah I'm pretty mad now.
>Matt_Canik: DEEGITV 10I EVITED +26 115
#note After I play this, she said "I didn't know you could put a D on that." 

But she didn't hold. I thought that was my green light to phoney.
>Mariah_Smith: CELX M10 .XCEL +28 175
#note For those of you counting at home, she's pulled JSSX? already. 
>Matt_Canik: EFGMOOY 4I GOOFY +38 153
>Matt_Canik: EFGMOOY --  -38 115
#note Between the EVITED thing and my brother playing 2-3 phoneys on her a game at club, I thought I was fine playing this. I thought wrong. 
>Mariah_Smith: EENU J10 .ENUE +10 185
>Matt_Canik: EFGMOOY 4K FOGEY +37 152
>Mariah_Smith: TUZ H12 .UTZ +39 224
#note And the Z too?
>Matt_Canik: AAIMNOR 3M AMA +25 177
#note With only 3 Es unseen, I'm chancing that she doesn't have one. I need to keep this board open, and this did that fairly effectively. 
>Mariah_Smith: EIMPR 2J PRIME +46 270
#note But of course, she does have an E!
>Matt_Canik: DIINORU 1H DUO +16 193
#note Yikes I really should have played UDO instead. 
>Mariah_Smith: D 2J .....D +18 288
>Matt_Canik: IINQRTV 9K QI +24 217
#note Wahoo! I drew the Q! Power tile for me yes! And exactly when I needed it- when I'm trying to bingo!
>Mariah_Smith: AEOT 8L TOEA +19 307
>Matt_Canik: BIINRTV N6 VI. +14 231
#note Holding the IN together here just to try and hit something down the B column.
>Mariah_Smith: SY 11I Y.S +44 351
#note When this came down I was done trying this game. 
>Matt_Canik: BIINRTT B3 BRITTIN. +63 294
>Matt_Canik: BIINRTT --  -63 231
#note If this is good and she challenges and loses a turn, there's a real chance I can win. I was actually pretty confident this was good. 
>Mariah_Smith: NOPR B6 PRON. +14 365
>Matt_Canik: BIINRTT A8 BI +26 257
>Mariah_Smith: ASW 15M SAW +33 398
#note Mhm
>Matt_Canik: AIINRTT 3J TI +14 271
#note At this point, I'm so pessimistic that I'm SURE she's sitting on DUCKERs or DUNKERs, and I actually change course and block stuff. I accept that my streak of 290 straight tournament games where I've scored over 300 points is gonna end with this play. 
>Mariah_Smith: ?CDKNRU F10 D..CK +25 423
#note But I draw an E and feel really dumb sitting there with a last rack of RETINA. 
>Matt_Canik: AEINRT C1 RETINA +16 287
#note Goodbye streak. 
This was one of the most frustrating games I've ever been a part of. I'm still accepting blame- having two phoneys challenged off, even if I think they were somewhat justifiable, and playing FOG in the wrong spot... I could have done things a lot better.
