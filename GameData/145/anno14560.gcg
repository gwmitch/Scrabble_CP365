>Siddharth_Murali: EEIJNNR H4 JINNEE +42 42
#note This is an example of how I played almost beyond my Scrabble capabilities and still got crushed (I did play Scott Garner, of course). Kinda how it went this tournament.
JINNEE is best.
>Scott_Garner: INOT 4H .OINT +24 24
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AFIORY 6B FORAYI.g +79 121
#note Best again, took me a little while to find.
>Scott_Garner: BEEP 3J BEEP +24 48
#note Scott was about to play OBE 5D and realized it would make a two letter phony, then changed it to OBA, then realized that OBA was probably a suboptimal play, then took a few minutes and changed to BEEP.
>Siddharth_Murali: EELNTXZ 5C LEZ +50 171
#note Best again. And yes, keep the score in mind after this turn :)
>Scott_Garner: ALMW C2 MAL..W +30 78
#note Nice extension play, played almost immediately.
>Siddharth_Murali: CEKNTUX I9 XU +34 205
#note Best yet again. 4/4.
>Scott_Garner: DGINORV G8 DROVING +78 156
#note He was relieved more than anything to see that this wasn't blocked.
>Siddharth_Murali: CEFKNTT B1 KEF +33 238
#note Leaving CNTT never seems optimal, but this is too many points, and doesn't allow a playback. This is also best, and I've made 5/5 best plays so far.
>Scott_Garner: ACEIOTV 13F I.VOCATE +78 234
#note VOCATIVE was 4 more here, and worth the red square playback.
>Siddharth_Murali: ACENSTT K2 C..T +12 250
#note I saw N(I)CTATES being blocked right away. Fishing certainly isn't bad in this play, especially because I still had the S (this sims about 5th). But the best move is CANST for 40, scoring while blocking at the same time.
>Scott_Garner: OW H13 .OW +30 264
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEGNST N7 STANGED +76 326
#note Best. I'm 6/7. Too bad nothing was playable up top.
>Scott_Garner: APY 8L PA.Y +36 300
>Siddharth_Murali: AGLRTUU D1 GUT +17 343
#note Haha wow, GUT was about 1% better than anything else. 7/8
>Scott_Garner: ENOOSST 1F SOONEST +81 381
#note Only bingo. Sigh.
>Siddharth_Murali: AILMRUU J10 MU +20 363
#note Oh, this is uber crappy. AUR(E)I is best here, this is ninth best according to the sim. 7/9
>Scott_Garner: EHRS 8A RESH +45 426
#note :/
>Siddharth_Murali: AAEILRU F1 .AU +5 368
#note Sims crappy, but I don't exactly understand it. Sim prefers plays like AUREI 12K or UREA 12K, but I don't prefer playing big here with. Also, each of those leaves are kind of clunky, since bingoing is pretty much the only way I can win. 7/10
>Scott_Garner: BDIIL 10B LIBID. +15 441
#note For defensive purposes, of course.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEHILRR 12M H.R +12 380
#note This isn't bad, isn't best. I thought the bag looked pretty good with the exception of the Q, and wanted to empty it. Again, don't understand the sim. But I liked my play. 7/11
>Scott_Garner: AAEIOQR 15H .OE +6 447
#note Scott spent a good 11 minutes on this play. I think this was fine.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ADEILR 12B DERIL.As +82 462
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ADEILR --  -82 380
#note Had to try something :)
>Scott_Garner: AAIQR 12F Q. +22 469
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ADEILR D10 .AILED +22 402
#note Okay, enough with the best play count. After all, I still get crushed. Kinda how this whole tourney went, lol.
>Scott_Garner: AAIR B10 .AARI +10 479
>Scott_Garner:  (R?) +2 481
#note Overall, this was an enjoyable game. Scott played well, I couldn't expect anything less. Oh, and I also went 4 minutes over. So is this game really worth a negative 119 spread?
