#note Stupid. I didn't see anything here. VIN(I)C would have been my choice had I seen it. Even the change is bad though. CINT is pretty weak.

#note NOOOOOO! I missed (U)MIAQ! Damn! That even popped into my head several times this tourney, and then when it's actually useful, I miss it. Adding to the stupidity, I put down COP and changed it to CAP when I realized I'd need the O to hook on UP.
>opp: LO 11E LO +13 77
#note I wonder if he would have played here if I hadn't shown my O.

#note I should have maybe been more concerned about his last play. If he's able to bingo out, he wins. Not sure what the right play is.

#note Whew. He had AIRLINE before playing off the I.
