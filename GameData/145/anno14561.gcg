>Ryan_Fischer: DEGMOVZ 8D MOVED +28 28
#note Well, it's nice to see I didn't mess up from the first turn!
>Liz_Gottlin: KOOT 9G TOOK +16 16
>Ryan_Fischer: GOQTUWZ J6 ZOU. +37 65
#note OUTMOVED or WOG or GOWK are rated higher statically.
>Liz_Gottlin: IIIII -IIIII +0 16
>Ryan_Fischer: EGQSTWW -GQWW +0 65
#note WEST is 38, leaving GQW.  Q static says that's 5.3 better than the exchange.
>Liz_Gottlin: ?AEELPT D6 TE.PLAtE +72 88
#note bELEAPT and hEELTAP are a bit better.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEHOST C3 OBEAH +39 104
>Liz_Gottlin: EGLM 11A GLE.M +16 104
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEOSTU A10 O.EE +6 110
#note Hehe, five vowels to a leave of ST.  It's going to be THAT kind of weekend.  OUTSEE, and anything above it, just wastes the potential of the rack.  That's why I played what I did, even keeping the U.

>Ryan_Fischer: EIIRUVY -IIUVY +0 232
#note Shoulda played VIER, but its leave was just horrible.  Y(ET)I for 15 is another option.  Hard to shuck the U and keep a good leave without exchanging here.
>Liz_Gottlin: CR B4 .RC +24 195
>Ryan_Fischer: EHNORRT E2 HO.R +14 246
#note I have trouble breaking up this rack here.  Maybe I should have, though.
>Liz_Gottlin: DEIV M2 VIED +28 223
#note It should be noted that, as I was aware, until this point, no Is had been played and I had JUST thrown two of them away.  So I thought this was a really risky play, and really unfortunate for me.  Just the first of a series of misfortunes.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGGNPRT 2H .GG +9 255
#note Drawing GGP to ENRT is another example.  TEGG for 24 looks good here, though.
>Liz_Gottlin: INOW 1L WINO +42 265
#note Ugh.

#note Ugh.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIINRSU 12F .UI +4 324
#note Interesting.  IS and SI win 38% according to champ.  If I'd've fished TUI to the triple, I'd win, given the same draw.  Very frustrating, given the look of the board.
