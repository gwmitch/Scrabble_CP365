#note OK, anyone who spots LANGSYNE 12A is a better man than me. HORSY wins the sim

#note Sims best, but only at 40% wins because of the multiple Z threats
>Q: AAEMZ 15K AMAZE +60 391
#note On reflection Ed was probably better off playing ZEA 2J, giving the AZO possibility and leaving himself with a vowel (he kept two of FPR after AMAZE)
>Andrew_Fisher: AIKOSSS L7 OASIS +17 369
#note Fortunately I had banked five extra points when Ed checked LARGOS (I forgot to record it here), so my solution was good enough for a win. Better is ASKOS 15A which I should have seen.
