>Chris_Cree: EEF 8G FEE +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: DHIKORU J6 KUDO +27 27
#note Best- nothing else worth consideration.
>Chris_Cree: ?ABENOY 9B BAYONEt +70 82
#note Best bingo for Chris is K1 sOYBEAN.
>Jim_Burlant: HINNRRS E8 H.RN +14 41
#note No really great options available.  Q gives marginal preference to E5 RHINO; I don't think it's worth 2 extra scoreboard points to leave myself without vowels.
>Chris_Cree: ABEFIRT K1 BAREFIT +82 164
>Jim_Burlant: AIILNRS 4E AIRLIN.S +68 109
#note Only bingo.  15% to win in a short sim.
>Chris_Cree: GIV 5C VIG +20 184
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIOPU D9 .AUPED +28 137
#note Minor slip here.  Couldn't think of PAREU, which plays at 3I and scores a handful more points.  This still isn't bad, though, as it does unload the U and it does float me an E through which I can hopefully bingo.
>Chris_Cree: AEGGIST L7 STAGGIE +73 257
#note I held this for a little bit - I always get taken for a loop when I see one of SAGGIER, STAGGIE, or RAGGIES,and I have to remind myself that it's RAGGIEST* that's the phony and that the other words in this list are all good.  Chris is 95% to win with this.
>Jim_Burlant: EIJNOOZ 1K .OOZE +51 188
#note It actually takes the sim a little while to sort out, but this is best.
>Chris_Cree: ILMORW 14J WORMIL +48 305
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: DHIJNSV 13A JIV.D +32 220
#note That hurt in a lot of ways.  Besides his having scored 49, I was going to play JIVED 13I for 48 myself, and now I was going to have to play for 32 and probably give back a bunch.  This is best, though it's 4.2% to win.  Of note:  D3 SHIV 44.
>Chris_Cree: EOQRU 15F ROQUE +47 352
>Jim_Burlant: HINSTXY 3B NIXY +35 255
#note There are a bunch of O column plays (SIXTHLY, THINLY) that I missed. They do very well statically but my deficit is so great that they sim very poorly, because the only thing they do is guarantee that  I lose by 70 or 80 and take away whatever winning changes I have.   Best is aparently 3B SIXTH, which wins 7%.  This wins not quite 2.
>Chris_Cree: AMP 2M PAM +44 396
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEHST D2 A. +9 264
#note None of the AAEHLST? bingos play on this board, and I didn't even look on rows 11 or 12.  THANAGES and HETAIRAS play for 72 and 65 on those rows but they have the same problem as the SIXTHLY/THINLY plays I missed on the previous turn:  they block the O column and eliminate the only chance I have at getting back in this game.  I saw HAJES and TAJES at A11, but thought that they blew too much of the rack apart while he killed the O column.  I probably can't win this game anyway, but this play practically guarantees me 90+ on my next turn, so at a bare minimum it's a terrific spread saver.  This isn't one of the kibbitizer's original choices, but it immediately vaults to the top of the sim.  The bingos sim way down for the reasons I describe earlier.
>Chris_Cree: CEEILOT 11H ECLO.ITE +72 468
#note Sigh...
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEHNST 1A HANTlES +91 355
#note Oh, to have had this rack one turn earlier - ANETHOLS would have played for 176 with ANETHOLS and I'd have a shot at the win.  Instead I have to play for 91 and the only question is the final margin of victory for Chris.  Sigh.  
>Chris_Cree: COTT O8 OCT.T +24 492
>Jim_Burlant: DELRSU 3K .UES +32 387
#note I mistracked and only showed 2 tiles, AN.  Between club, tournament, and informal play, this is literally the 12th or 13th straight game I have lost to him, and once again there was just nothing I could do. I lost focus and stopped caring.  Best is B9 BURDIES, which saves 6 points of spread.

>Jim_Burlant: DLR B12 R.D +14 401
>Chris_Cree: N G8 ..N +6 537
>Chris_Cree:  (L) +2 539
#note A couple of minor mistakes - YAUPED instead of PAREU and perhaps something else instead of NIXY...but there just wasn't anything I could do about this.
