#note Sam said he thought it might not be his game ... I blocked EOLIPILE/EOLOPILE (I don't know which spelling) through the L. Reasonable to assume I'll make a BA-, BE- or BO- play from the B and allow him to play it making AE, EE# or OE.

#note fILAGRE(E) doubles the G. This is the only other playable one to the E.

#note G(E)O#, N10. But it's close.

#note Before you call me a luckbox for having three bingos in the first five turns, I would like to point out that three of my opponents (including two of my last four) did it to me.

#note CONF#! I'm telling you, threes to make fours burned me.
>Sam_Kantimathi: AY 13F AY +20 228
>Jason: ACDIOPQ 13A CAP +28 326
#note COPI(T)A# is better ... really shuts down the board. Didn't know it, as you might guess.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ?ACEERY A4 EYEChAR. +89 317
#note I was sure this was good, but it's phony! Sam said after the game he thought I'd hold and release, because we were at a point where the five points lost on a challenge could prove significant. I don't know if I'd have challenged as an OWL out play, that's how sure I was.

>Jason: HIJQRTU F7 J.. +13 375
#note Took a long time here, perhaps the longest time I took on any move in the tournament. Glad Quackle isn't laughing at me for this one. Almost played THR(AW), the only play higher on CP's list, but didn't like opening at all with that "bonus"-friendly pool.
>Sam_Kantimathi: AHN C2 NAH +19 368
>Jason: AHIQRTU D1 QAT +26 401
#note Surprised Duck prefers QUA instead. I loved keeping the case U here.
>Sam_Kantimathi: EILMNRT E1 INERT +27 395
>Jason: HIORRTU 9M RHO +19 420
#note Loved this play, too. Takes out the only decent spot to score (MM here) while keeping IUT and threatening (QI)VIUT with the right draw. Given the pool, MEM(O)'s the only comeback play that really hurts me, I think. CP says this and R(ODS) are the only two plays: Each have win percentages of more than 90; (U)H at 14J is third at 66.67%.
>Sam_Kantimathi: EILMMNV O6 VIN. +21 416
>Jason: EIORTU 5E .OUTIER +14 434
>Jason:  (challenge) +5 439
#note I had other wins (although a lot involved words I don't know, like TRODS#), but low on time I wasn't 100% sure if plays like (WOO)T# won and I told myself to trust myself on TOUTIER#. Fun game and, except for EYECHART*, perhaps my best-played one of the tourney. Glad my OWL luck against Sam carries over to Collins. :) Final score actually 447-408.
