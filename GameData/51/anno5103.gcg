#note -1.1  Quack says L3 EGAD.  I considered it, but I really need to get bingos down.  I'd like to keep at least 50% consonants to do that.

#note -1.2 O9 SEASIDE.  I forgot SEASIDE was the anagram.  Could have got one more point.
>tim_anglin: IWY H12 WI.Y +42 423
>jeremy: EFNOOOP F1 OF +31 461
#note Nearly played K9 POOF. I correctly chose F1 OF, or so Quackle says on Many ply sims. After thinking my head off, I decided on F1 OF keeping the P for endgame ammo, and reducing my chance of drawing the Q which could be trouble for me.

#note -9 D10 PE(L)ON.  Well, I found a way to win.  D10 PE(L)ON stops Tim's out in one.
