#note What else are you gonna do here?  I sure as hell ain't playing SUQ K8, Duck.

#note This rack makes a trifecta but is pretty useless on this board.  The duck likes the fishy OWL.  I just had to write that last sentence.

#note I'll take that for a dollar.

#note Example #5387 of why Quackle is better than I am.  On a good day, I could see myself finding that play, but not in the 0.2 seconds it takes my computer.

#note Typical of what you expect against the machine.  You feel like you're drawing like a demon and racking up the points, then you look up on the scoreboard and see he's right there with you.  But he's about to run out of steam and let me start making some distance.  Meanwhile, this is an interesting moment.  What do you do?

#note ZONE is of course the high scoring play by a good margin.  However, it could get into consonant trouble while giving him back a big play on the Z.  It seemed reasonable to me, as my consonants have some synergy and might be able to score well.  But then I saw this play, which still scored a lot, didn't risk quite as much, and held onto the Z for more damage on the next turn.

#note I guess that worked out pretty well.

#note I have no complaints about Quackle suffering the I-death once in a while.  A few games earlier, I traded three I's off my rack and drew the remaining two.

#note I suppose you could make the case that playing this at 3H blocks a few more bingo lines, though it still does nothing about the A column, which is his most dangerous spot.  When I can outrun bingos, I generally just prefer to play as many tiles as possible to expedite the end.
