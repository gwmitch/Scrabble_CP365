#note Yuch. I hated closing the board like this. Might VINYL be better?

#note Not sure here. I liked trying to open. This could give him a large play, and he can also play small and keep the board well-controlled here.

#note Nice play, I thought.

#note I also thought about CEILI, but realized that the board was much easier closed afterwards. I thought he had an S for some reason (I assumed the wrong thing from a tidbit of coffeehousing). Even without the S, CEILI seems like it could be thwarted easily enough (Although the R bingo lane still seems a problem). Turns out he would've had HONKIES. Admittedly, this still doesn't look so hot. CEILI might be right?
>Carl_: EHIKNOS L8 .HOKE +28 248
#note Not sure what is right here. I wonder if there is a good way to try and make a board blocking play here. Considering an exchange two and some fishing off before, this seems kind of risky. Maybe it's just because I'm looking at it from my standpoint, though.

>Noah: ??DEFNO 1M FON +29 266
#note This is quite a miraculous draw! I played this because I felt AI was likely a setup. After this, it seems like I will bingo plenty, and so I waited to bingo. I liked this as opposed to FEOD because FEOD gave him the spot up top. Quackle says FEOD bingos 10% more of the time. Hmm.
