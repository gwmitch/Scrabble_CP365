>Charnrit_Khongthanarat: EHIIJOR 8G ROJI +22 22
>Khoo_Beng_Way: AILNPWY 9H WANY +28 28
>Charnrit_Khongthanarat: EEEHITW 10G HEW +28 50
#note Pakorn thinks WEE (10F) would be better because it keeps the board open. 
>Khoo_Beng_Way: ?ABEILP F10 PLEB +32 60
#note Suanne spotted BIPEdAL (7A), Eldar saw BIPLAnE (11A). Beng Way's play left the crowd utterly disappointed. 
>Charnrit_Khongthanarat: DEEEEIT 11D TI.ED +25 75
#note David suggested EDILE (11D) as it dumps 2 out of 4 E's and exposes the B lane with front hooks A and S. 
>Khoo_Beng_Way: ?ACIOTU K9 .UCA +18 78
#note Both CAUTION and AUCTION were spotted but no one found  a fitting spot until Pakorn suggested NOWED which is valid (7B). It wasn't as big a disappointment for the crowd when Beng Way failed to spot CAUTIOn or AUCTIOn (7B), knowing that even Pakorn wasn't sure about NOWED. 
>Charnrit_Khongthanarat: EEEGOTY 12A YGOE +28 103
#note GOEY (L12) was suggested by the experts. 
>Khoo_Beng_Way: ?IINOOT A12 .ONI +21 99
#note Pakorn spotted cOITION (7B), but the experts think that Beng Way would not play it because he would not know NOWED. 
>Charnrit_Khongthanarat: AEEGOST 7B GOATEES +72 175
#note The Malaysian observers and Beng Way supporters sighed when the play was made.

>Khoo_Beng_Way: ADEILMN (challenge) +5 207
#note PLEBS was challenged +5. 
#note Pakorn spotted dAUBIEST (13C) which is the highest scoring playable bingo. 
>Charnrit_Khongthanarat: HILNRTU 15L HURL +42 245
#note HURL was agreed unanimously by the panel of experts as the best move. 
>Khoo_Beng_Way: ADEILMN N10 MINDE. +30 237
>Charnrit_Khongthanarat: CEEIKNT 5B NECK +34 279
#note David Eldar bet RM5 on Charnrit failing to play NECKTIE, sadly, no one took up the bet. Sorry David.

>Khoo_Beng_Way: ?AADINO O4 ODA +16 266
>Charnrit_Khongthanarat: ADELRST 3I DARTLES +75 392
#note The obvious play of DARTLES (3I) sealed the victory for Charnrit. Malaysians and Beng Way supporters were crossing their fingers, hoping that Charnrit misses it. A loud sigh roared the room when it was played. 
>Khoo_Beng_Way: ?AINRVX J2 V.RIX +39 305
#note By now, most of the observers weren't interested in the game anymore as it seemed almost certain that Charnrit is our new WYSC Champion!
