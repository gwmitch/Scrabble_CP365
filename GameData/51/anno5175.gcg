#note Completely missed TOXEMIC 6H. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUGHHHHHH I didn't even look for a bin-go. That's a good way to improve! Every move, make sure you've checked for a seven, check every possible letter to play though, and check every word on the board for hooks! I haven't ever been so systematic and it often bites me!  If we run a simulation with Nick's rack ADEEITT as it was, TOXEMIC wins 87%, CIMEX 45%. That's a massive error :-)  In a must-win game to keep my WSC title hopes alive!

#note 11/17 unseen tiles give me a bingo somewhere. And V gives REPLEVI(N).

#note I was also tempted to fish for PEREGRI(N) because there were two R's unseen (as opposed to only one V) but that would kill my chances of a B column bingo.
