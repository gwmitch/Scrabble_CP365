#note Elmhurst, IL 11/09. Q prefers UNAU, but I prefer leaving an N to an L.
>al_helfgott: AIMU 5D MIAU. +14 14
>trashman: ?AEINYZ 7G Z.YIN +31 39
#note I struggled with this play. Q likes 4A ZINE 54, which I considered, but didn't like the potentially huge comebacks, and wanted to shed the Y. 6C ZANY is probably best.

#note Only playable bingo

#note Missing the 6-tile underlap at 10A URANITE for 82!
>trashman: HIJNORR 10B HOR. +35 144
#note Saw 4C JOHN 43, but wanted to shed the R and save the J. Q prefers JOHN

>trashman: IORRSST 15D TSORRIS +85 314
#note Best. If it were good. Which it's not. 14D RESISTOR is the only real bingo. Al holds for quite a while, but lets it go. A brazillion ways to spell the word, but this ain't one. I dodge a bullet...
>al_helfgott: DIOV 11K VOID +27 253
>trashman: ABNOOQT 8M Q.T +36 350
#note Saw J10 QAT 41, which Q prefers, but didn't want to leave this spot open with the X unseen, and didn't want to create another lane.
>al_helfgott: CEIOOPT J10 POCO +23 276
#note Al's actual rack, as he initially lays down J10 COPIES, then 14J OCTOPI. I hope he plays 4I COOP, which is Q's top pick, but he ends up blocking my bingo
>trashman: ABNOOSS 13I B.ONS +20 370
#note Q likes L3 BOATS 32, but I just want to take out the most obvious bingo lane. Which is fortunate, as Al would have had...
>al_helfgott: CDEIILT D3 DI. +12 288
#note ...IDIOLECT. Dodged another bullet

#note O11 SAFER 37, 3H FEARS 23
>al_helfgott: EINT 3G TINE +9 360
#note Endgame not quite right, miswrote something. Final of 495-366 is correct, though. Al wins the tourney with a 9-2 mark, but this made up for my horrendous loss to Al last time out. EDIT: I should note that TSORRISS is good, but needs the double S ending.
