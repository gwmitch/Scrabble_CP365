#note I used up virtually all my time on this, certain there were 9's in column N. I focussed on -IES endings, and missed all 3 bingos, simple plurals of 8's: PROMISEES, MEMORISES, REIMPOSES. Also missed 2 bingos in column K, which I gave up on early: MEMOIRIST and MELIORIST, which I didn't know. I also spotted the possibility of H8 WOOMERAS, so fishing the I made sense in the end.

#note I miss out on the O, which Liz informs me afterward was still in the bag, as she draws it here. This tourney was incredibly inconsistent, as I lose to the bottom 3 seeds and miss tons of common bingos, but beat the 4 highest seeds I played. So, my "most inconsistent Scrabbler in the Galaxy" moniker remains intact yet again...

#note I'm over on time, and about to lose 10 more points, so slap down the first outplay I see. I left 10 points on the board, for what it's worth. M1 ELM 18
