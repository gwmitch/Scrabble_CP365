>trashman: ADEGHOU D8 .UGHEAD +38 100
#note Now my goal is to play VERONICA, I say. At this point, Lisa proclaims (as she likes to do) the game is over, and proceeds to plunk down...
>lisa_slankard: AQST 15A QATS +63 113
#note ... I scold her for her premature proclamation of defeat, to which she replies, "but my leave is terrible". 
>trashman: FILNORZ C13 ZI. +49 149
>lisa_slankard: B 14B B.. +20 133
#note blocking any 8's ending with Q
>trashman: FLNNOOR 6E N.NFLOOR +63 212
#note ...prior to the play, I overdraw, drawing 3 instead of 2. I turn over INO, and Lisa throws back the I. I slap down this phony, which Lisa holds, but lets go as she has...
>lisa_slankard: ?EIPPRW 11C W.IPPERs +84 217
#note ...a play she's not sure she'll be able to make if she loses a turn. Looks like a shootout is brewing...
>trashman: CDEIOOT L4 CO.DITE +22 234
#note Q likes 3C OCTAVO and 5C COOTIE. Missed both. H10 DECEIT scores best, but the OO leave with 3 unseen sucks. 
>lisa_slankard: OW K5 W.O +25 242
>trashman: DGINOOS 8K D.NGO +29 263
#note Q prefers 10B DOG, but I'll take the 15 extra points.
>lisa_slankard: IX E13 XI +35 277
>trashman: AGIIOST N6 GI.A +10 273
#note Again, no great options. Q likes 5C GAIT or 5D IOTA for 14
>lisa_slankard: AM 10B MA. +17 294
>trashman: IORSTTU 5C TOU. +12 285
#note Best, setting up another lane. Unless you count O7 TORTIOUS 63, which I suppose might be a bit better...
>lisa_slankard: AAILNRS O8 .RINASAL +79 373
#note Nice. Takes an -S, too, not that it matters here...
>trashman: AEILRST 13H REALIST. +68 353
#note None of the 7's fit in column B
>lisa_slankard: BE 12L BE +18 391
>trashman: ?AFKNVY 4B KAY +32 385
#note Tough to do with the case O unseen, but I need to shed clunky tiles and score. Q slightly prefers FAY. H10 dEFRAY for 45 isn't worth the blank in a close game
>lisa_slankard: EM 9B EM. +23 414
>trashman: ?DEFNOV A1 DEVON +42 427
#note I get lucky and draw the O
>lisa_slankard: EEHINRY 14J YIN +34 448
#note Lisa has no winning options, as I have 2 spots for FECAL (Insert #2 joke here <===), but H11 EYRIR 36 only loses by 1...
>trashman: ?CEF 15G FaCE +30 457
#note ...instead, she gives me a few more spread points. This game held up as the high loss for this tourney. Good game, Lisa!
