#note Didn't know choice #2 and was satisfied with this one when I saw it.
>Michael_Bradley: DEOV L8 D.OVE +22 36
>Jim_Burlant: AINOOSU G7 U.O +7 31
#note Duck prefers UNAI 7G, keeping OOS. -2.7.
>Michael_Bradley: GSUY 10D GUYS +22 58
>Jim_Burlant: AEIINOS M7 IO. +7 38
#note Whoops!  Confused UPOS* with APOS.  Quackle's #1 choice is AGIO D9 10, shedding the A as well.  I wanted to keep as much of this rack together as possible, especially since there were 6 T's still unseen.
>Michael_Bradley: IZ D8 ZI. +23 81
>Jim_Burlant: AEFIMNS 13F FAMINES +74 112
#note Chose this because I felt that the 6 extra points at N1 weren't enough to offset the added danger of opening up the 3x3.  The duck disagrees, but not by much.  
>Michael_Bradley: EHIO H11 HO.IE +33 114
>Jim_Burlant: ADGORTW E5 TOGA +21 133
#note LOL.  Didn't know there was a bingo in this rack and I didn't want to open up the O column for those unseen S's.  Didn't like shutting down row 15 with WODGE, either.  I felt that I wanted to make sure that he couldn't burn me with something like FRIZ or PREZ or RITZ.   Was concerned about the potential hotspot at F6 but couldn't find anything else I was happy with.
>Michael_Bradley: AEFL F3 LEAF +30 144
>Jim_Burlant: ?DRRTVW -RVW +0 133
#note Quackle's preference is 15G VERT 7.  I felt that for the meager points available, the excvhange was the best option.   Quackle says that I should have only kept RT? and thrown the D back in as well.
>Michael_Bradley: AEL 11J LA.E +14 158
>Jim_Burlant: ??DERTT 3F .ETTeReD +68 201
#note Duplication in the rack plus the 2 blanks made me happy I found anything that played, period.  Couldnt' find 15H ExToRTED.
>Michael_Bradley: BEERT 2J BERET +41 199
>Jim_Burlant: EIMNNWX 1M MIX +44 245
#note Best.
>Michael_Bradley: ACLPS 11A CLASP +40 239
>Jim_Burlant: EEJNNTW H1 JE. +30 275
#note Ouch, missed A8 EJECT.  But, given his rack, this wouldn't have had a significant impact on how the game played out.  Debated JET/JETE, and felt that with only 2 E's left in the pool it might be wise to keep the E.  JETE and JET sim virtually identical, with the same valuation.
>Michael_Bradley: GIKLNO A9 LO.KING +57 296
>Jim_Burlant: DENNSTW 8L ..WN +24 299
#note Best.
>Michael_Bradley: Q 9C Q. +21 317
>Jim_Burlant: DEHINST K1 H..D +8 307
#note Quackle doesn't like this play at all, but this is the difference between playing a computer and a human.  And it gets the job done.  I'm obviously interested in trying to land one of those 4 unseen A's, and I also have to make sure he doesn't make a cheap defensive play on row 15.  I'm also hoping that if I bingo on the next turn I'll beat him to the C.  Quackle's preference is to just play to score, with SITED 4H 41 being its choice.
>Michael_Bradley: AACORTV J2 ..AT +8 325
#note After the game, Michael told me his rack for this position.   Given that he doesn't know the bingo, CAV(E)ATOR,  he's got a tough decision, and hit took him 7 or 8 minutes before he made his play.  Play the C now, and watchme bingo back and have it come to an end game...or take a turn out to block my most likely bingo line and hope he can keep me from bingoing before he plays his C.
>Jim_Burlant: DEINRST 15E INS.RTED +61 368
#note Geez, didn't think about the INTERLOCKING front extension.  I must really suck.  Joking aside, I think my preference would have been for RELOCKING, leaving DINST.  
>Michael_Bradley: ACNORVW N10 CROWN +40 365
#note When I saw my rack didn't have the C, I was sure my goose was cooked.  Fortunately, Michael opted for the out in two instead of the counterintuitive sequence that would have won him the game...
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIIR D1 AERIE +15 383
#note Still blind to the front extension of RELOCKING.  
>Michael_Bradley: AV 3B VA. +12 377
#note Fortunately for me, Michael didn't see VAU/ADOWN at K7.
>Michael_Bradley:  (AI) +4 381
