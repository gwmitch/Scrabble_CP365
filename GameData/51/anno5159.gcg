#note Sim likes TAMIN#, but MIC is nice and low-variance. Another play I almost like is MI in the same spot.

#note Was tempted to call the blank a G# for a likely +5, but wasn't 100.0% sure and seemed foolish to risk anything at this point. My spread in the tournament was already good, and had I got back in the hunt, I would probably pass most everyone I needed to without these five points.
