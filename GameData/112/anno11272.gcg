>Mandy: IK 9H KI +14 28
>Brett: BDLLMTX J8 UN +9 31
#note This is me fishing...
>Mandy: BEGIRUY E2 REBUYI.G +78 106
#note This was the beginning and I'm thinking "OH CRAP!"  This is the first of 2 games which I get in a early hole against Mandy.  
>Brett: BDLLMTX F8 .OT +9 40
>Mandy: AENV -?? +0 106
>Brett: AENV D1 VENA +34 74
#note needed points so I made this aggressive play, giving me an awful leave.  
>Mandy: ?CEEMSS K4 SChEMES +82 188
#note This is a nice play.  I have trouble coming up with unique words like this.  
>Brett: EIILOOW 11D TOY +20 94
#note I knew this word.  Just shaky on the definition.  Doty - stained by decay.  No relation to dote - to show excessive affection.  This drew a challenge.  These challenges kept me in the game.  It also appeared like she was partially tracking tiles.  If she corrects those two aspects, she would be unstoppable.  
>Mandy: AAEFORU -  +0 188
>Brett: CEIILOW L3 OH +20 114
>Mandy: AAEFORU C2 FOG +32 220
>Brett: ATX 12C TAX +33 147
#note I struggled to decide where to play the tax.  More points at M1 but I feared I'd be closing the board down more there.  
>Mandy: AAEIRTU M3 FAB +32 252
>Brett: CEGIILW 13B TAE +13 160
>Mandy: AEIIRTU 14A AA +8 260
#note She was dumping some vowel.  Little did she know I finally got my rack in order. 
>Brett: EEINNPS 15B PENNIES +85 245
#note So lucky!  Back in the game.  
>Mandy: EIIRTUW J8 ..AIRED +18 278
>Brett: ILMORVW 12H ZO.IL +48 293
#note Very familiar with Zoril, zorilla, zorillo, zorille.  Meaning a small African mammal.
>Mandy: ?CITTUW -  +0 278
>Brett: LLMRSVW I11 M.W +25 318
#note No vowels but trying to keep the pressure on.  Miscored as 21.  
>Mandy: EGIORT N4 GOITRE +21 299
#note clever spelling of goiter.  This move made me super paranoi, considering i was low on vowels.  
>Brett: DELLRSV -?? +0 318
>Mandy: AEIIJQT F14 Q. +31 330
>Brett: DELLRSV 3B C... +6 324
#note Really didn't know what to do.  I figured to create another backup s hook just in case she tried blocking shags.  
>Mandy: AEIIJTU 6B WIL. +18 348
>Brett: DIRT O9 DIRT +9 333
#note I don't remember my rack but I might have had JAWED at 13G says Quackle.  That's a nice move considering I would not have to use the blank and get 38pts for it.  
>Mandy: EP H12 .EP. +21 369
>Brett: ?ADJLNS O1 JiNS +43 376
#note No choice but to go for it.  
>Mandy: ?EILORUV 14J .IVER +18 387
#note I think time was getting low.  She would have survived playing DRIVEL at 14K.  Considing how she has not been playing for a while, I'd hate to play her when she's on her game.
