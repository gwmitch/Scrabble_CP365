#note Not great. N6 FUD or 6J FUDS. Either way, this is looking really bad.

#note This sims poorly, but I didn't see how shutting the board down while down a bingo was going to work, so I passed on FUD. But I guess the board has to open eventually? Or not??

#note O1 OLDER apparently wins 61%. I'm skeptical of that, because it seems like I'll just get outrun by J5 EF and 15H ES and stuff. But I guess I just have to hope I draw some of that stuff, and kill the scoring spots in the N/O columns in the meantime. I dunno what VOE is supposed to do. I think I was fearing getting stuck with the V, but really, I'm going to lose long before that becomes my main concern. This play is really bad and should have cost me the game OLDER makes a lot of sense now.
