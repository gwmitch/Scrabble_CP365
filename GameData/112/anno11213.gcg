#note shoulda looked a bit harder for morgans, but i was satisfied with this bingo until he held me for literally like 8 minutes. i started convincing myself i made it up. (-1)

>cesar: CEOSUUV J3 UVEOU. +11 85
#note uveous 13B is better for the score mainly but it's also more defensive. (-3)

>cesar: CEORRSZ 15A CR.ZEROS +311 396
>cesar: CEORRSZ --  -311 85
#note ok, so i thought 311 points was worth the low chance that i was screwing up the spelling of CRUZEIRO in my head. maybe i coulda had a 700 game. ZOA 10B looks reasonable here. (-48)

#note CROZE 5B is more sober. -2
