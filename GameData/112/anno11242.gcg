>Debbie_Stegman: OW 9F WO +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILRT E5 DILATER +88 110
#note TRAILED  E9 and E6 REDTAIL both score 72, but this is best.
>Debbie_Stegman: ITW 10G WIT +19 35
>Jim_Burlant: DEFGIMN F4 DEF +31 141
#note Best.  Static gives slight preference to EF F5, but I'd rather unload the extra consonant.  F4 DEFI also worth considering, but I didn't like leaving myself vowelless.
>Debbie_Stegman: BIV 10B VIB. +17 52
>Jim_Burlant: EGIMNOO D10 .OOM +18 159
#note Weak.  Best is clearly 8A OMEGA.  I missed it.
>Debbie_Stegman: COX G3 COX +29 81
>Jim_Burlant: EEGINNO 13C O.ENING +26 185
#note Best.  8A GENOA also worth consideration.  87% to win.
>Debbie_Stegman: ?CIKPRS J2 PICKeRS +82 163
>Jim_Burlant: AEELNTV 11H NAVEL +20 205
#note So-so.  Couldn't think of LEAVEN, which plays for 28 at 12G and is best.  LEAVEN wins 71%, this wins 66%.
>Debbie_Stegman: EFLRU L8 FUL.ER +26 189
>Jim_Burlant: EEEGRTZ 8A TERG. +24 229
#note I wanted to open up the left side of the board, and I figured that I'd have a good shot at drawing an A for FAZE 8L if I turned 4 with this play.  And, as a safety valve, it set up a guaranteed ZEE B6 if LEZ 10L  disappeared and I didn't land an A.  Q agrees with my reasoning, saying this is best, and that 5J KEG is a close runner up.  
>Debbie_Stegman: ?ADEMNO M2 aDENOMA +79 268
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEISZ 8L ..ZE +48 277
#note Best - nothing else worth consdering.  N8 BIZE is a distant runner up - too volatile unless I was sitting on the case S.  46% to win.
>Debbie_Stegman: EOPTY L2 TEPOY +39 307
#note Ouch!  Very nice!
>Jim_Burlant: AABEIST N6 BI. +38 315
#note Prior to Debbie's putting down TEPOY, I had planned to fish off AB with something like NAB H10.  Then she gave me a huge hot spot for my B.  Feeling pressure to stay in the game, I put this down, as I felt that the 38 points were too much to pass up.  Additionally, it potentially set up my S.  Q says this is a very good choice, but it's not best.  Its recommended play is a really slick choice that does a better job balancing the rack and playing the tile pool:  AA K4 scores 28 and wins 52%; this wins just shy of 51.  Even if the fish doesn't yield a bingo rack, if all else fails I'm probably going to have BIZ for the next turn.  
>Debbie_Stegman: HU N2 UH +21 328
>Jim_Burlant: AAEENST H13 .AE +9 324
#note Her last play made me nervous.  Not only did she thwart O1 plays back-hooking YOB with my S, but a look at the pool suggested she was close to something.  If she hit down the A or O columns, the game was over.  So I wanted to create another line that was more flexible than the O column.  Q still prefers K4 AA, saying it wins 67%; this wins just under 50.
>Debbie_Stegman: AI F11 AI. +6 334
#note Uh oh...
>Jim_Burlant: AAELNST 5J .A.. +16 340
#note Quackle still prefers the AA K4 fish.  I might agree with that if there were still 4 A's in the pool, but I don't think the unbalanced rack will help me if I need to counter a bingo.
>Debbie_Stegman: DENORSU A1 ROUNDES. +80 414
>Jim_Burlant: AELNQST 3I Q. +21 361
#note I'm dead - taking a turn out to deal with this pretty much was the last nail in my coffin.  Winning chances reduced from roughly 50% to 12%.
>Debbie_Stegman: AHSY 14A ASHY +37 451
>Jim_Burlant: AELNSTT M11 STEAL +25 386
>Debbie_Stegman: AIRU 15A AI +14 465
>Jim_Burlant: NT 14M .NT +6 392
>Jim_Burlant:  (RU) +4 396
#note When I replayed the post-FAZE sequence by following Quackle's recommendation of AA followed by BI(Z) and giving myself the same replacement tiles that I had in the game, it put approximately 20 - 25 more points on the scoreboard, but instead of a no-go bingo, I was stuck with a rack of jibberish when she hit ROUNDEST.   BOOM and NAVEL were minor mistakes that erred on the side of rack grooming.  In short, while this wasn't perfect on my end, perfection probably wouldn't have mattered; this one probably wasn't mine for the taking.
