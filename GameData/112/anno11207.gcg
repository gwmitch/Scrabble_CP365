#note IMINO is ugly because it gives great scoring spots and keeps crap. Wasn't sure whether this was the right exchange, because IMN didn't look that great here, but that's a very heuristic judgment. Anyone have a more concrete idea of what is better to keep?

#note Tough rack. I also considered ZEE B10. INURE 2F also isn't a bad option. I like playing the Z now, and I liked scoring a few more and keeping the EIRU with more consonants left than vowels.
