>Mandy: AEGITTU 4C PEE +20 117
>Brett: BIKNQSW F2 LIR. +12 69

>Mandy: AGIPTTU 13G M.W +15 132
#note That was my spot for ZA at 13G!  
>Brett: ATZ 14E TZA. +37 145
#note Really wanted to play IZAR but felt she'd have move trouble hiting the triple word with TZAR.  So I kept the 2 i's and will have to work on my rack the next turn.

>Brett: AEEILNU 1A BI.E +33 178
#note Throughout the game I was make moves as a reaction to Mandy's move.  
>Mandy: AIPTTUU 8A NOSH +48 212
#note Held on Keepings and let it go...thank goodness.  Still need to work on my -INGs.

>Mandy: ?AEEEIN 2E A.IENEEs +59 330
#note There she goes again...This was her best move with those tiles.
>Brett: BOW 1H BOW +43 290
>Mandy: ACDTTUY 15H .OU +3 333
#note Somehow she managed to get the last 3 u's.  Yuck.  
>Brett: AAGILTX 14J XI +50 340
#note She wasn't tracking.  I still have two outs for my q now.  
>Mandy: ?ACDDUUY L11 CAYs +25 358
>Brett: AAGLQTT 11K A.T +10 350
#note I figured she had some u's to deal with so she'd have at least 2 moves.  If I could play qat at N10, I'd be good.  I believe she was running very low on time!  
>Mandy: DDUU 1L UDU +7 365
#note Hate this ... totally did not look at this move!  UDO is good, UDU is not.  Almost cost me the game.  
>Brett: AGLQT N10 QAT +38 388
#note Got it!  Another squeaker!
