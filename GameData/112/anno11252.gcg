>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AELPRVW 8D WAVER +30 30
#note Sim gives a slight edge to VAW. They are pretty interchangeable I think.
>Sam_Rosin: AELOSTY H8 .OYALETS +86 86
#note I studied a very small number of CSW bingos for this tournament. Luckily, a lot of the ones played against me were among those I studied, so I avoided giving away too many nickels.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEENNTT F4 NEB +25 248
#note Didn't know SNEB#, so I was unwittingly setting up a bingo line that only Sam would know about.
>Sam_Rosin: UX 14B XU +37 183
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AENSSTT F14 T. +4 252
#note This was weak. I decided to fish to NSSTAE, but the leave doesn't bingo nearly often enough on this board. And I decided to kill the easy scoring spot in the process. Sim says to keep scoring with 14F TATS. If I had been sure of YAHS#, I would have played K10 ST#.

#note NASUTES# is better.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EGIIOOV 12H ..EVO +16 334
#note This isn't good. I missed G4 OGIVE, which is probably worth the points, and which blocks the SNEB# bingo lane. I wanted to kill column L, but that was a weak bingo lane, anyways. Yes, this is a pretty significant blunder. D2 VEGO# was definitely findable, I just didn't see the word on my rack.

#note Another weak play. I missed a few plays which required some # fours I don't know. But G13 KEY should be easy and obvious.

#note Well, NEWWAVER is pretty cool. But I can actually block both his outs for more points, too.
