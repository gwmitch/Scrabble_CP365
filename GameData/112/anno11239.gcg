#note Best.  Other options include 7D and 9C IGLOO.

#note Or BLISTER in the same location.  67% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: AADDENO 4I OA.ED +30 122
#note And after several minutes, I find it.  The other option that outscores this is DRONED 4J.  This is best, winning 70%.
>Darrell_Day: AFX 2M FAX +37 103
>Jim_Burlant: AAADHNV O1 A. +27 149
#note I felt that, bad leave or not, the last thing I wanted was to play elsewhere and watch him play WO or something equally clunky for 47 points at 1N; as ugly as the leave was/is, the rack grooming would have to wait.  Quackle agrees - this is best.    6B VANDA sims well, but I think that's a deceptive sim result.
>Darrell_Day: ENPTY 8J P.ENTY +36 139
>Jim_Burlant: AADHNTV J8 .AVAN +20 169
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Couldn't think of VANDA, which plays for 24 at 6N.  10H VANDA is also a very good choice.  Not a blunder, but a slight equity slip, both for the points missing and extra tile not turned out of this yucky rack. 
>Darrell_Day: CLMU 9D CULM +22 161
>Jim_Burlant: DHNRRTU D9 .HURN +20 189
#note I saw the K11 plays and didn't like them for a simple reason:  outside of my AX play, I'd been getting good turnover and the S's weren't coming into my rack.  I didn't want to play for 26 and give back 40+ on row 15. Of the available choices, I considered this a reasonable compromise.  55% to win.  
>Darrell_Day: DEIKL 12H KI.DLE +32 193
>Jim_Burlant: DEEFRTT H12 .ERF +33 222
#note Again, the options didn't seem appealing.  The problem with plays like TREF N11 and N12 DEFT is that they potentially gave back way too much.  Duplicated T's aren't the worst thing in the world and there are only 2 left in the unseen pool - surely I won't draw another one, will I?  52% to win.
>Darrell_Day: NZ I11 Z.N +27 220
>Jim_Burlant: ADESTTT 14G T.ET +19 241
#note This does poorly statically, but it rapidly shoots up towards the top of the 2-ply sim.  Q's preferred choice is 14F TARED and 14G TREAT.    As for why the defensive tack, I felt that Darrell was rapidly closing in on something and I wanted to take away any RE- words on row 14.  I'd make this play again.
>Darrell_Day: GV M11 V.G +14 234
>Jim_Burlant: ADIORST 15J AROIDS +26 267
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  I couldn't think of ADROIT to preserve the S, not that the S is really that useful on this board.  I felt that turning 6 and scoring 26 was important given the unseen ??SS.  60% to win.
>Darrell_Day: IOW 13B WI.O +14 248
>Jim_Burlant: AADEOTU 14A TOD +21 288
#note This board is so dead that I wasn't worried about building a bingo rack - I wanted to create as much distance between Darrell and myself as possible.  I also felt that, if I defended the Y with something like TODAY O4, he could play something like OWE B12 and I wouldn't be able to have a good block for his blank A column bingo, so I wanted to snuffout the possibility of his opening the A column up later.  With this play, if he doesn't hit anything through the Y this turn, this game is over except for the final score.
>Darrell_Day: ?CGIILS O6 GL.SInIC +64 312
>Jim_Burlant: AAEENPU N8 .APA +29 317
#note OMG, is this good?  I held GLYSINIC* for several minutes.  I didn't like it, as I know GLYCINE is spelled with a C, and my inclination was that it wasn't good.  HOWEVER:  I wasn't 100% sure.  Was there another variant?  Secondly, take a good look at the pool.  QUS? are unseen, and if I lose the challenge the game is over.  However, I have a 29-point comeback that available that takes out N10 and puts me up 5.   With all this rattling around in my head, I felt that, if I was anything less than 100% certain it was bad, I had to let it stick and take my chances with the remaining draw.  Post-mortem, Darrell concurred with me:  in this situation, unless I'm 100% certain, I have to let this go.  This was an absolutely brilliant play by Darrell.  As for this choice, it's the right idea with the wrong execution.  I should have played TEPA (which I couldn't think of) to preserve an A in case I drew a W so I could play at 15A.
>Darrell_Day: INQ E8 Q.IN +35 347
#note Annotation ends here, so I'll summarize:  between letting the phony go and playing TAPA instead of TEPA, I screwed myself out of a 30-point AW at 14A to tie the game.  This allowed Darrell to play there after his q dump and I was left scratching my head trying to figure out where to dump my tiles off on this board while Darrell wound up with the case blank.  Final score 353 - 394.
