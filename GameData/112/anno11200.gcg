#note Also considered DAB and BAD 7F, because I have a decent shot at JOUNCING. I didn't think this was enough of a factor, but the fact is that CGINN isn't that bad anyway, and adding that possibility, which I can fish for repeatedly, makes it even better. The reason I played this was to open the right side of the board more, but I should just play DAB.

>Noah: AENOTTV 14J OVATE +24 413
#note I also considered OVATE O7, but here was my reasoning. I figured this gave her a lot fewer bingo lanes than the other OVATE, and gave me a good chance at closing a lot of the remaining ones next turn. Underlaps wouldn't be too great to overcome unless she had the B, but AHA doesn't indicate it--it seems like she would've played BAH. AHA looks kind of like a fish, and the pool/board is good for bingoing, so the three point sacrifice looked worth it.

>Noah: DEILNRT 12G TRIDEN. +18 431
#note I thought it made sense to score decently and deny Mary bingo lanes. This puts me up a fair margin, and the pool isn't that great, so I think I should do okay in a lot of endgames. What do you think? Is a smaller play required here?
