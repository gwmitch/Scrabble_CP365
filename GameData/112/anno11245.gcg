#note Best bingo.  Of note:  E(PI)LATION K6.  82% to win in a short sim.  Little did I know I was just getting started.

#note A deceptive rack in that nothing really scores.I find this a bit odd.   Q wants me to dump the rack with M2 HERIOT 18 and 10G OLEIN for 17.  With Steve struggling, why would I open up easy lines for him to hit?   This balances the rack just fine, and with Steve having just exchanged, I don't mind giving up a handful of points to groom the rack.  I'd make this play again.

#note I didn't really look hard enough for the best bingo here - paralysis by 1000 choices.  13C NITERIES and WINERIES are best.  While the win percentage is identical, this is risky due to the unseen J and Z. But given the miserable luck Steve was having, it didn't matter and I benefitted from this mistake.

#note Not looking to do anything but empty the bag and turn tiles.  Not trying to build a rack or anything.  Best is apparently 12A OCTROI 28.

#note Again, not worrying about rack building.  Quackle wants me to rack build with O1 OF.  When you're having the game I was having, the bingos fall out of your rack even when you're not trying to make them happen.
