>Jim_Burlant: AEEKLNQ -EKQ +0 0
#note Technically not necessary to exchange with KNEEL available, but this isn't bad at all.  Not even one of the original kibbitzer choices, in the 2-ply sim this wins more often than anything except 8D KNEEL, and this doesn't trail KNEEL by a whole lot.  I just saw the Q and the K and didn't even bother doing anything else but exchanging.
>Steve_Hartsman: ABINRST -ABIN +0 0
#note I think it was 4 tiles that Steve exchanged; I'm not sure.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEILNT 8D ANTLIkE +64 64
#note I chose this for the lack of front/back hooks.  Q prefers that I play it at 8F, which ostensibly wins 0.5% more often than this placement.  Whatever.
>Steve_Hartsman: ACDEENU F3 CUNEA.ED +67 67
#note Best bingo for Steve; AUDIENCE H5 is the other one.
>Jim_Burlant: EENPSUW J6 WE.P +17 81
#note Saw U(N)SWEEP* 5E and thought that WEEP for 17 would be better than UNSWEEP for 0.  No really great options available; the sim prefers E4 NEW by a bit.  This is the runner up.
>Steve_Hartsman: DIM E4 MID +23 90
>Jim_Burlant: ELNSSUY 10H SLY +35 116
#note Weak.  Somehow missed YULES, which plays at 10J for 39 and D1 for 37.  
>Steve_Hartsman: ADGR D2 GRAD +26 116
>Jim_Burlant: EFFNSTU H10 .TUFFS +39 155
#note I missed a bingo, but I think I'll give myself a pass:  SNUFF(I)E(S)T plays at H3 for 66.  This or SNUFFS is the next best choice. Still 64% to win.
>Steve_Hartsman: QT D7 Q.T +12 128
>Jim_Burlant: AEENOOU -EOOU +0 155
#note Yuck. Q says it's not necessary to exchange, and that AENEOUS 15B is a good rack dump.  Really style preference as to whether to dump the rack or exchange.   Either this or exchange 5 keeping EN is the play.  
>Steve_Hartsman: DEE E8 .EED +16 144
>Jim_Burlant: AEINOTW G5 OW +17 172
#note Or at K5 for 15.  AT this point, seeing the AEINT in my rack, I notice the open S on row 15 and am fixated on fishing my way to a SATINE 8.  Surely this shouldn't be that hard with those 5 unseen R's, should it?
>Steve_Hartsman: EO K5 OE +9 153
>Jim_Burlant: AEINOTU 11C OU. +4 176
#note Still fixated on fishing my way to the SATINE 8 on row 15, which was/is ill-advised.  I should have looked harder to dump the rack, and there was an admittedly hard-to-find play here that accomplished that:  3B TU(R)A(C)O scores 25 and leaves EIN.
>Steve_Hartsman: AEILNRS L4 RENAILS +74 227
#note Steve told me after the game that he missed RAINLESS 15A. His best 7 with this rack is L3 ALINERS; he was worried about 
>Jim_Burlant: AEINNTV 12A VAIN +28 204
#note Well, now I have no choice.  Gotta put points on the board to stay in the game, as this rack has no 8's on this board.  This is best.  32% to win.
>Steve_Hartsman: BER A12 .ERB +27 254
>Jim_Burlant: EIILNOT 14A .OIL +8 212
#note Weak.  Again, a row 3 play, 3B TO(R)I(C) is the winner.  Q also likes G13 OI, but I didn't like the board with it, especially with K unseen, and with X unseen M9 OI struck me as being reckless.  18% to win.  TORIC wins 22%.
>Steve_Hartsman: AHO C1 HAO +19 273
>Jim_Burlant: EGIINRT 3H IGNITER +78 290
#note Whoops!  Missing STINGIER 15H for 83. 50% to win.  STINGIER wins 52%.  Back in the game - but not for long.
>Steve_Hartsman: ?EGHNOR B3 GORHENs +72 345
#note Best bingo is 12F ROUGHENs.
>Jim_Burlant: ABIJMRY 8L .AMB +24 314
#note I saw that I was sitting on the case R and didn't want to burn it with BRIM.  Q says I don't have the luxury of holding onto it, and that BRIM should have been the play.  BRIM wins 12%, this wins 7.5.
>Steve_Hartsman: OX 14H .OX +29 374
>Jim_Burlant: CEIJRYZ 10L .IZY +36 350
#note As poorly as I've played to this point, I actually have a chance at a win.  I looked at N1 JERRY and ruled it out - I wasn't going to play there until I saw the case O come out, as I didn't want to give him an easy 27 points.  I considered holding onto the Y with something like SIZE in the slim hopes of drawing a U so I could play JURY,but considered it too much of a longshot.  Ultimately I felt that keeping the pressure on and staying in the game was the first order of business.  Championship player says it's either this or JERRY N1.  In reality, the only play that wins given this pool and Steve's next play is a play that many of us would have rejected:  SIZE 10L.  More on that in a second...
>Steve_Hartsman: AAPST O1 PASTA +33 407
>Jim_Burlant: CEIJKRU A4 JEU +42 392
#note Had I played the counterintuitive SIZE on the previous turn, my IKU draw would have yielded a rack of CIJKRUY, and my play of JURY K11 would have left me CIK.  Steve, sitting on OTV, would be screwed - he'd have no way of blocking my out without V-sticking himself.  His best play would be VOE M1, after which I would go out with RICK 13 for 20, getting 2 points from his unplayed T to win 414 - 413.  Instead, making what seemed to be the plausible choice resulted in a 20-point loss.
>Steve_Hartsman: OTV J12 VO. +13 420
>Jim_Burlant: CIKR 1A IC. +24 416
#note Best.  I can go out with ICK 15D, but this actually preserves 6 more points of spread.
