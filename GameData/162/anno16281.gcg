>Andrea: ARTZ 6I TZAR +68 98
#note Equity play backfires... LAP would have been ZAP or MAP or BAP (etc) so Andrea didn't yet have the Z or another scoring tile.
>Rafi: AEINPTV L2 VIPE. +20 37
#note PAVIN looks better.
>Andrea: ?EIOOST E5 TOOtSIE +80 178
>Rafi: AIILNOT K5 A.LII +20 57
#note I'm in a pretty bad spot here. I think AALII is my best chance at getting back in the game - I'm going to need at least 2 bingoes most likely. VIOL doesn't seem like it will work very often... the lane I'm opening will usually get blocked immediately.

>Rafi: EGRTUUW F4 TEW +31 149
#note Really wanted to trade, but I had trouble passing up 31 points. TEW also sets up a new lane. Maybe should have just traded down to ERT... next turn I'm going to have to fish or trade probably.
>Andrea: COR 2H ORC +13 251
>Rafi: GIORSUU -GIUU +0 149
#note Maybe GROUT or GURUS instead. I'm running out of chances though, and need to bingo pretty much right away - ISU isn't super prone for that.
