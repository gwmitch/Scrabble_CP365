>Zev_Kaufman: HILPY 8H HIPLY +34 34
>Joshua_Sokol: AFQUVWX 7G WAX +47 47
#note I really didn't know if FQUV was better than QUVW but I guessed that it was. It is, but just barely. Although I didn't even see QUA... Already a rather large mistake on my part.
>Zev_Kaufman: AEGR L8 .AGER +18 52
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFPQUV 11J VE.P +18 65
#note It seemed like I shouldn't open the triple lane unnecessarily. exch FPV is an interesting option.
>Zev_Kaufman: AEU J10 U.EA +9 61
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEFQTU 6F FA +18 83
#note Interesting choices here. I12 AFT seems pretty strong. 9G FA sims above my FA but so does I13 F(A). But everything seems pretty close. I could also potentially play K4 EQUA(L).
>Zev_Kaufman: ADILNOR 5F ORDINAL +77 138
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEEQTU N8 QUEsTED +95 178
#note I was really hesitant about this play. I felt like he was really really likely to have drawn an I and other tiles he can probably work with, so his average score after N8 QUEsTED would probably be in the high 40s. So if I play 14G QUEsTED, maybe he really does average more than 22 less. Even with an I inference, Quackle prefers to go for N8, as opponent will average only around 15 points less with 14G even with a sure I on his rack. So I probably made the right decision between my 2 bingo options. But maybe I shouldn't bingo at all...
>Zev_Kaufman: IKT O7 KIT +56 194
#note Just about what he was supposed to average after QUEsTED, unfortunately.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINSUY M13 YIN +25 203
#note This or fish. I think it's better to keep my lead rather than risk missing a bingo draw.
>Zev_Kaufman: EIVW H1 WIVE. +39 233
#note Yup.
>Joshua_Sokol: BCEISTU 4G B. +13 216
#note Instead I decide to fish this turn. I didn't like my chances, and neither does Quackle. I could potentially just play CUBIST/ORDINALS and go for other good tiles that may be somewhere in the bag.
>Zev_Kaufman: GIZ I13 ZIG +44 277
>Joshua_Sokol: CEISTTU 9B CUTTIES +67 283
#note Well, it worked. Now what...
>Zev_Kaufman: ABCLO D4 COBAL. +22 299
#note Zev choosing to race toward the blank.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINNST 13M ..N +6 289
#note So, time for me to blow the game. How is it that I only saw CANNIEST in ACEINNST? That's terrible. Also, (COBALT)INE and A(ZA)N are better plays.
>Zev_Kaufman: DEGOR B9 .ODGER +24 323
#note Zev continuing to smartly shorten the game.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINNST 15E ANTI.EN +24 313
#note This seems familiar. COBALTINE is still available. I also missed ANTEING. Hooray.
>Zev_Kaufman: ?EMOSST M1 MiTOSES +77 400
#note (W)EStMOST is awesome.
>Joshua_Sokol: EHINORS 1M .HO +24 337
#note This is getting worse and worse. 1H (W)INSO(M)ER is something I need to see, and something I even looked for. I really need to play HO(M)ER or HO(M)IE though.
>Zev_Kaufman: ADJO 12B .ADJO +28 428

>Zev_Kaufman: EFMOORU A13 FOU +26 454
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIMNRS 2J RAM.ES +30 375
#note I didn't know MES(i)AN, and most of you didn't either I think :P. Just RAM(i)E is better.
>Zev_Kaufman: ELOR 13E ORE +15 469
