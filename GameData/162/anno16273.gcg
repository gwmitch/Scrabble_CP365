>Tasha: AAEEEVV 8G VAV +18 18
#note Tasha Underdogs It Up in Cali - Episode 4.  This is probably my favorite game of the tournament.  If I were playing a lower-rated player, I would have played EAVE.  Since I'm not playing a lower-rated player, I briefly thought of exchanging.  But then I decided that VAV is more annoying than exchanging. 
>Rafi_Stern: AJTZ H7 T.J +10 10
#note I'm pretty sure Rafi mentioned having the Z on his opening rack.
>Tasha: AEEEEIO -AEEEIO +0 18
#note I realized too late I should have kept the O.
>Rafi_Stern: EIRSZ J8 SIZER +44 54
#note Rafi took a very long time here.  He said he thought of exchanging the Z, but decided to play SIZER.  I was hoping he wouldn't exchange.  Had he exchanged, though, I would have played G6 LUV.

#note I didn't see LWEI.  Playing that instead certainly would have prevented what happened next.

>Tasha: ?AEGLNO E1 ELONGAt. +66 252
#note GASOLENE is better.  I either didn't see it or forgot about the E spelling.  However, playing ELONGATE worked out for me.  I took a while here because I didn't want to play ELONGATE and I was looking for something through the C.  An OIC word or something.  I thought of passing up the bingo to fish off an O but decided not to.
>Rafi_Stern: BHNOSW 1D B.SNOW +42 294
#note Rafi had the H.  Had I played GASOLENE, he would have played 14G BOW, setting up his H to play HENS for a total of about 70 points.  42 points is better than 70.  I still got burned a bit, though.
>Tasha: EEILRTT 2H RETITLE +75 327
>Rafi_Stern: ADEI O1 IDEA +27 321
>Tasha: BDFIIMS 3I BID +25 352
#note At first I thought of 5J BIFIDS*, but felt that was probably phony and I really can't afford to play a phony.  I mean people are watching.  So then I thought of K1 BIFID but didn't really like the play.  I felt that I should make a shorter play that scores well rather than a longer one that scores well.   BID sims better than BIFID by 4 points.

#note I think I took a while on this play.  I mistracked a bit and thought there were no E's left (but I knew there was an S), and I knew that with the remaining pool you must have some mad skills to bingo on row 5 if I were to make the right block.  I played FLAM to take out the last remaining bingo lanes - column M, column N, and row 5.  I doubted that he'll hit something through the W.   I was also kind of hoping that I would be able to play 5K QIS next turn.

#note Although a few turns ago I thought there were no E's left,  I had RAFI tracked at DEEFHIR.  I was expecting 5K F(I)E for 22 points and figured that was his highest-scoring play and I'll win by 13.  It turns out he had an A, but it made no difference.
