#note Damn, D3 MEA(DOW)Y! I don't know if this is a good play or not. Underscored by 2 :(
>Brenda_Casey: EOV L2 VOE +19 90
>Joshua_Sokol: AADEIMO M3 ODA +20 206
#note I remember hating ODEA because of the triple letter next to the A. (Z)I(R)AM seems correct to me.
>Brenda_Casey: DEFNSU B8 .EFUNDS +38 128
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEIMPS C3 API.C. +38 244
#note Lucky lucky draw. I missed E(S)CAPISM and didn't know (S)CAMPIES. I like this anyway.
>Brenda_Casey: EIMR D1 MIRE +28 156
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEMST N4 STEAMED +73 317
#note I considered the possibility of EM(M)ASTED* being good but completely whiffed on (D)EMASTED.
>Brenda_Casey: NOW O7 WON +37 193
>Joshua_Sokol: AAHINOT 1A HIT.AN +33 350
#note (M)AHONIA and (M)ANIHOT were two words I didn't know, and I wanted to block the 3x3 lane.

>Brenda_Casey: ANOV 9D NOVA +21 214
>Joshua_Sokol: AILORST 13F ORALIST +63 413
#note I missed (D)ILATORS. I must have seen TAILORS M9 but I didn't like putting the S on the 3x3 lane and giving her a chance to win. I also wanted to block the most lanes possible, which ORALIST does pretty well save bingos with an S in 5th position. Very unlikely that will happen.

#note -4
>Joshua_Sokol: GUUX L13 .UX +18 522
#note I missed G(O)X. I must have mistracked or something, or just thought it made sense to leave an out play in the off chance she doesn't go out. I also missed A11 XU. Whatever
