>Joshua_Sokol: ?CEORTY H6 RECTOrY +80 80
#note This game I was told to be alert since my opponent was being accused of cheating. I played really differently because of that...
>Nancy_Konipol: LOO 8F LO.O +6 6
>Joshua_Sokol: BINSTUZ G7 B.UT +22 102
#note I think I spotted TZU(R)IS and decided not to burn SZ in one turn.
>Nancy_Konipol: ?CEEIRS J2 CERItES +71 77
#note CEIlERS.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFINSZ 12C NAZIF. +42 144
#note But CEILERS would have given me a spot for NAZIFIES :(. I think 4H ZA(R)FS isn't worth the risk and the worse leave for 12 or so more points. There are a lot of really decent options here though, 3I F(E)AZE, 4I F(R)IZ, 6E IZA(R)... Not sure which to choose from, so I chose the one that she would be most likely to challenge.
>Nancy_Konipol: AO E11 A.O +24 101
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEINRS C6 ANSERI.E +70 214
>Nancy_Konipol: EHM 8A ME.H +39 140
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINNOR 14D INION +20 234
#note Here's where the famous overdrawing incident happened where it is possible Nancy was trying to palm an S. 

I knew she had VW because of the overdraw so I played this. Worst case scenario she has WAVE or something.
>Nancy_Konipol: EIRVW 15G WEIR +32 172
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEGLTU 15A GEED +29 263
#note DE(NAZIFY is a word? jeez... I think this play is alright, but I may prefer GLED in the same spot, the pool is pretty consonant heavy.
>Nancy_Konipol: KMRVY 5I M.RKY +28 200
>Joshua_Sokol: ALOTUUW D1 OUTLAW +25 288
#note I know she still has a V so this play isn't that dangerous. I missed the better WAL(K)OUT and probably decided against 14J OUTLAW for some dumb reason.
>Nancy_Konipol: DDIV B4 DID +20 220
>Joshua_Sokol: AELOPRU A1 PULA +25 313
#note Ah, OPER(C)ULA. Nice. LA(Y)UP is also an idea.
>Nancy_Konipol: ENV M2 ENV. +20 240
>Joshua_Sokol: AEJORTU 4H JU.A +25 338
#note I'm not sure if I saw 6F JA(R). I think that's a better play than this.
>Nancy_Konipol: AIV L5 .IVA +12 252
>Joshua_Sokol: EIOQRST 11B Q. +11 349
#note I think JA(R) was better precisely because the Q was still swimming in the pool.
>Nancy_Konipol: AB 14A AB +19 271
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIORST M8 GORIEST +71 420
#note I wonder which is better between my play and plays at K9. My play seems to be a better defensive play, but is it worth the 3 point sacrifice? The sim doesn't think so. Knowing me I probably didn't see my higher-scoring options.
>Nancy_Konipol: AFO L10 OAF +26 297
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGHLNX 2L H.X +26 446
#note I'm supposed to play L(U)NGED or G(U)LDEN here. I guess Nancy just didn't see my out.
>Nancy_Konipol: PSTT 3I S.T +13 310
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGLN 1C L.NGED +24 470
>Joshua_Sokol:  (PT) +8 478
#note I only recorded myself getting 6 from her. Weird. I also seem to remember her only have PST on her rack in the end, where she could have went out instead of playing S(E)T. Maybe I'm crazy.
