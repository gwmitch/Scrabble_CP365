#note This game... I was a bit shaken after what had just happened a few minutes ago. Read on if you want a detailed story, if not, tl;dr.

The game before this, I had finished really fast against Vicki Kahn, and I was bored waiting for everyone's games to finish, especially Jeanmarie and Jack's, as I was about to play Jack. At some point I was walking around and I saw Jeanmarie moving tiles around the board and moving her mouth, so I thought the game had ended and she was post-mortem-ing with Jack. I see she has OUT?ENC(E) laid down and I ask "OUTFENCE? Is that good?". At that moment I realized that Jeanmarie's clock was still running, and she responds "please leave". 

I felt so bad about that, cause I was sure their game was over. I went to report the incident to the director and I calmed down a bit. Unfortunately, Jack thought I had indicated to Jeanmarie that OUTFENCE was in fact valid and had aided her to win the game, as it was to be an outplay. He had just misheard, but he wouldn't let go, and now thought I was trying to help another youngster win at his expense. He wouldn't hear anything else, so I was now a rascal in his eyes. He kept telling me "I hope you learned a lesson" and it was really bothering me, and now I had to play him.

#note I hated playing this. It was stupid. Why didn't I just play something else? N1 WAS is a ridiculously large improvement over this, like, 50% ridiculous. This play threw the game away.

#note M6 cOGNOME(N), jeez... Otherwise MO(J)O or if blocked OM, as he played, is better played after 10K GiEN or GaEN in this situation. Otherwise MO(J)O is obvious.
