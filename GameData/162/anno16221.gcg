#note Pretty sure I looked this up at some point..... so off you come.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAEENU 8H EAU +6 6
#note What a stupid play. I know he cannot bingo - so even more of a reason to exchange.
>Roy_Kamen: EEEMRRT 7F TERM +19 19
#note He mentioned after that he should have played REM 9H.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEFNRT 6G FEAT +22 28
#note Liked how this made the board clunky, but I'd like 32 points for FRAENA too.
>Roy_Kamen: AEERZ 5I RAZEE +36 55
>Roy_Kamen: AEERZ --  -36 19
#note Hmmm

#note STOP IT
>Roy_Kamen: AOZ 5J AZO +26 45
>Matthew_Larocque: AAINRST 4D ANTIARS +69 99
#note Is M4 really a good idea? I don't think so, Quackle.

>Matthew_Larocque: CEEJPTY 4L JEEP +50 149
>Roy_Kamen: ABEILOT A5 OBLI.ATE +86 197
#note Well this should be a fun one.
>Matthew_Larocque: CLOTTVY D8 C.OTT +26 175
#note Considered (P)OTTY but didn't know (P)LOTTY. My reasoning here was that the Y is better than usual with the juicy B6 spot. Quackle doesn't buy it.
>Roy_Kamen: DEORU O4 .OURED +27 224
>Matthew_Larocque: ACGLNVY M3 V.NAL +31 206
#note Still keeping the Y for a high potential payoff. However this caused me to miss the superb AG(E)NCY. An even better play is VAL(E)NCY.
>Roy_Kamen: OW 5D WO +19 243
>Matthew_Larocque: BCFGMQY B5 MY +34 240
#note Did I literally just draw BMFQ? 
>Roy_Kamen: LU J8 .LU +5 248
>Matthew_Larocque: BCFGHNQ B8 F.B +29 269
#note If I can keep scoring well things might not get too horrible.
>Roy_Kamen: AK 3G KA +24 272
>Matthew_Larocque: CGHILNQ 3A INCH +27 296
#note There's some Is left, so setting up QI seemed like as good an idea as anything.
>Roy_Kamen: ?AEGIRS 11G ERASInG +68 340
#note Thud
>Matthew_Larocque: GILNNQW 2A QI +37 333
#note GLNNW come on let's do this
>Roy_Kamen: DD 10D .DD +21 361
>Matthew_Larocque: GILNNOW 1B LOWN +14 347
#note I figured my chances of getting away with *LOWNING were 0%, and killing this bingo line seemed like a game conceding move. I just didn't know what to fish for and how to open another bingo line in the process. Still, my initial thought of N8 NOW must make way more sense.
>Roy_Kamen: DEX N8 DEX +33 394
>Matthew_Larocque: GIINOOV M9 GO.O +24 371
#note Here Roy have some free points.
>Roy_Kamen: EENPRSY 13I PREYS +40 434

#note 13B VIs.
>Roy_Kamen: EN C6 EN +11 445
>Roy_Kamen:  (I) +2 447
#note I lost 10 on time. Not sure where I went wrong here, I was able to score pretty well with some garbage racks. I think I could have handled the latter part of the game better to increase my chances of winning.
