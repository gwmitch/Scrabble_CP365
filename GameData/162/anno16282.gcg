>Morris_Greenberg: ABGIMNN 8G NAB +10 10
#note Game 1 of round 3 of the Boston Area MatchPlay tournament. I got matched up this round with Chris Kulig, one of the more underrated players I know. He swept an 1800 player in round one, so I knew I shouldn't take this round lightly.

Speedy player does not like this play at all, but, the sim shows most plays are pretty much equal here. BANING for 24 wins the sim, but 11 plays, including NAB sim within 1.5% of it.

>Morris_Greenberg: GIILMNN 10D LIMING +27 37
#note Shoot, chickened out on LIMNING! That is obviously better...
>Chris_Kulig: ADELPT 11B PLATED +31 47
>Morris_Greenberg: ?DJNNOR B11 .ORN +12 49
#note I played (P)ORN to set up the J, however, the problem is Chris can play there in a lot of situations, and I am essentially giving him a really high scoring spot. NOR(LA)ND is a cool play I missed, which handedly wins the sim. The cute (WE)N surprisingly comes in 2nd, with all of the E's and I's out, hitting JOINDeR or JOiNDER as a double double is over 20%! This is a bit less than 7% back.
>Chris_Kulig: EIRW A12 WEIR +46 93
#note Yup, I deserve this.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?DIJNPU 7C PUNJI +21 70
#note Didn't love anything here, this is either first or second best according to the sim, neck and neck with another play through the LA, UP(LA)ND.
>Chris_Kulig: OX 6C OX +22 115
>Morris_Greenberg: ?DEEOST 6G DETOxES +63 133
#note I miscounted all of the J2 plays as 65 (instead of 69), I think I missed the hotspot on the D. I liked how this would likely give me a high counter play if he overlaps over DETOxES. Still, this is a bit sloppy, I missed the highest scoring play DEmETO(N)S E1 for 76, as well as the 72 point options and J3, EScOTED and OErSTED. Surprisingly, this is only a bit behind the J2 plays, but, the 3 bingoes I missed are much better than all the rest.
>Chris_Kulig: AMY 5J YAM +27 142
>Morris_Greenberg: AEHQRTU 8A QAT +41 174
#note I was mad he blocked QUAER(E), QUART(E), and QUATR(E) L1, I played this fast, hit my clock and then realized I completely missed the H1 spot. This is a pretty big error.
>Chris_Kulig: AEGOT H1 GOATE. +24 166
>Morris_Greenberg: ADEHIRU 3C AIRHE.D +28 202
#note HEAU(ME) is a sweet word I didn't know, and I completely missed HU(ME)RI in the same spot. I once again forgot to count the D on the hotspot, so it was scored as 24. This is third best after HEAU(ME) and HU(ME)RI
>Chris_Kulig: ?EIILNT 1A rETILIN. +77 243
#note He mentioned he saw the TI(ME)LINEs/(ME)LINITEs/IL(ME)NITEs 9s. But, this scores more.
>Morris_Greenberg: AAHIOUZ E5 ZO.A +36 238
>Chris_Kulig: AORSVY 12G SAVORY +30 273
#note He hated this at the time, he told me his other tile, I forget what it was though.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEHISUV 4A HUES +28 266
#note Still didn'ty know HEAU(ME). I was debating back and forth between this and VIES, ultimately deciding that with 2 U's unseen and down by a ton, I am basically done if I have 2 at once. Surprisingly, VIES is simming MUCH better, neck and neck with HEAU(ME) for the top. Another play that does very well which I did consider briefly was (S)UAVE M6, creating 2 high point hot spots. I nixed it because I thought 13 points was too few being this far down. This is 5th best after VIES, HEAU(ME), (S)UAVE and (LA)VISH.
>Chris_Kulig: EEK C11 .EEK +35 308
#note Chris didn't like this play either, he thought I have an S after playing one for not that many points last turn, so he thought I could get a huge play starting with the S. Still, it's 35 points on a relatively weak board for points.
>Morris_Greenberg: ACIORSV 15C SCORIA +42 308
#note I was choosing here between the two 15C plays, SCORIA and SAVIOR, for 42 and 39 respectively, along with F1 (I)C(H) for 14. I saw if I draw a U after (I)C(H) I could bingo with SAVIOUR at 15C, and if I don't get the U, I still have the 42 point SAVIOR the following turn. Still, I thought it was likely he'd try blocking that area with a play at H12, and then I'd be screwed. SCORIA is better than SAVIOR according to the sim, but about 15% worse than (I)C(H) (which sims second best overall) and over 20% worse than VO(ME)R, the sim winner. I can see why VO(ME)R is good, it scores and leaves the high lane open in row 15, keeping the nice combo ACIS. However, I think most human opponents would block that high spot, so the sim is inflated. Still, it probably is not inflated by 20%, so this is not that great a play.
>Chris_Kulig: EFF 4L EFF +28 336
#note I was nervous about this after I hit my clock. This is probably another reason VO(ME)R simmed so high (about 37% win), since it blocks his highest scoring spot.
>Morris_Greenberg: BDLRTUV L8 BURD. +14 322
#note I didn't see any wins (there were none), so I played a word that I was not sure if it was good or not, hoping it would cause an incorrect challenge, allowing me to win.
>Chris_Kulig: CGINOU N1 CUI. +18 354
#note C(O)IGN to block V(O)LT is better, but a bunch of plays win for Chris, and he's pretty low on time.
>Morris_Greenberg: LTV J11 V.LT +9 331
#note Overall, I played pretty poorly, I deserved to lose this one. I don't play or study much during the school year, and it's starting to show after about a 3 month hiatus. With the miscount, 354-335 final score.
