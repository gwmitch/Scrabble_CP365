>Joshua_Sokol: ?AHNORR H4 AiRHORN +70 70
#note Phony. Very good phony. She held and then quickly laid down her next play.
>Yvonne_Lobo: AGIILSW 10C WAILI.GS +66 66
>Yvonne_Lobo: AGIILSW --  -66 0
#note You know when the worst thing happens and you decide not to challenge a word you're unsure of cause it gives you a word you think is good? Yup.
>Joshua_Sokol: DOWY 6F WO.DY +28 98
#note Forgot to write down my rack.
>Yvonne_Lobo: AGIILSW 10B SWAILI.G +66 66
>Yvonne_Lobo: AGIILSW --  -66 0
#note Yvonne digs herself deeper into the hole she dug. :(
>Joshua_Sokol: EGINNQV J3 ENV.ING +14 112
#note I'm supposed to play NE(R)VING even though it gives her 31 next turn? I don't know why Quackle does this even when it knows exactly what she has... I didn't play QI because I saw that it gave her WING(Y).
>Yvonne_Lobo: AGIILSW 10F WI.G +16 16
#note Quackle thought she was going to play (N)ILGAI. This looks alright
>Joshua_Sokol: AEQRSTV -QV +0 112
#note I don't know why I decided not to play QAT. Maybe I have my leave wrong.
>Yvonne_Lobo: ACEILS 11D ACE +15 31
#note Weird play.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACERRST C8 CRATERS +76 188
#note I didn't know if CARTERS was good. I think I should play 12F TRACERS.
>Yvonne_Lobo: ILSX 12A IL.X +42 73
>Joshua_Sokol: DLOORTY A8 ROOT.LY +30 218
>Joshua_Sokol: DLOORTY --  -30 188
#note Oh, now I know why I though ROOTILY* was a word a few days ago. It's hard for my brain to process that a phony is a phony sometimes, since I play it and I guess I remember it being played rather than being acceptable or not. I saw DO(C)TOR and DO(C)TORLY (which doesn't play unfortunately), but that's what I should have played.
>Yvonne_Lobo: ADES A12 .DEA +15 88
#note I was really scared she had a 3x3 here...
>Joshua_Sokol: DLOORTY 8A DO.TOR +30 218
>Yvonne_Lobo: IIIS -III +0 88
>Joshua_Sokol: ALNOSTY 10B Y. +13 231
#note Maybe I overvalued my leave but this was also for defensive purposes.
>Yvonne_Lobo: EM B14 ME +20 108
>Joshua_Sokol: ALNOOST 5D LOO +11 242
>Yvonne_Lobo: AEJK 4A JAKE +50 158
#note aww, that was unfortunate
>Joshua_Sokol: ABNQSTU B2 QU.NT +32 274
>Yvonne_Lobo: ENUV 3I V.NUE +24 182
>Joshua_Sokol: ABHIOSZ 12F BIZ +32 306
#note Interesting how AHOZ is just about as good as AHOS. This gives back too much maybe, but usually will kill the rack she's been working on for a while I think, unless she just doesn't have anything with the Z. Maybe I should still play C1 BIS(K). Or 4J (N)OH.
>Yvonne_Lobo: EIRU 2B .UIRE +16 198

>Yvonne_Lobo: AEO H12 .OEA +39 237
>Joshua_Sokol: ABELPSU A8 .UP +14 348
#note I think this was my rack. This doesn't seem to be the play though.
>Yvonne_Lobo: DEFISTT 14G F.TIDEST +78 315
>Yvonne_Lobo: DEFISTT --  -78 237
#note lol
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEILST L2 S.ITABLE +72 420
#note BASTILE is best with the inferred rack, apparently.
>Yvonne_Lobo: DEFISTT M9 FETID +35 272
#note I12 EFT or M9 FIT seem like better options.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFGIMN 15E dEF.MING +65 485
#note lol, gg Yvonne
