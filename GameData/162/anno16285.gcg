#note Chickened out on (Q)UINIC, thought it needed two N's. QUINNIC* is phony, however. I also thought (Q)UINCE was phony, and (Q)UINCEY* was good. Time to review!
>Chris_Kulig: ALMU C9 .UALM +32 87
>Morris_Greenberg: ACEINTU N5 TUNICAE +67 182
#note Wanted to block (RETAX)ING, since it was probably in the back of both of our minds after (QUIRT)ING the previous game.

>Morris_Greenberg: EINNSWZ M11 WIZEN +41 223
#note Oh jeez, WIZ 7G, completely missed it. This is pretty much as good though.

#note I talked myself out of playing JAY 14A to set up OM/(J)O/(A)M the following turn. I have a comfortable lead, and there's no reason to get too greedy since he could easily have an O and be right back in it after that sort of a play. JAY still wins the sim though, but I would rather play it safer here.

#note Really savvy play by Chris.
>Morris_Greenberg: CGHIINS 14C SIGH +33 373
#note I am really nervous about the lane Chris set up, but since I'm up by a lot, I figured I'd let him have it, and block the next highest scoring lane while scoring a bunch. This wins the sim handedly.
>Chris_Kulig: OORVW 5C VOW +44 299
#note He said he got a terrible draw and couldn't even go down to the triple!
