#note Right idea, wrong execution.  GRIG in the same location unloads the I instead of the A.  I didn't think of it.

#note The sim say sthis is the clear winner, 23% to win.  And that's about to nosedive quickly.
>Darrell_Day: ?ADORSU 15E ArDOURS +80 179
#note Best bingo for Darrell, and he's 92% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: EEEMNPR M2 EME +14 72
#note  About the only thing I saw here was EMPIRE 12H, which I thought would lead to a too quickly gummed up southern hemisphere and leave me nowhere to bingo if I couldn't draw an S.  Best is a play I never looked for, E5 PREENER.  I was too busy trying to keep the board alive and didn't look for my best play.  I realized this choice was risky and was hoping that his racks might cool down and he'd take it out for cheap as I've seen him do in other games.  And, perhaps thinking too optimistically,  I thought that if he didn't have a D, S, or H, he couldn't hurt me and I could hopefully do something.  My best play, PREENER, wins 6%, and this wins 4-1/2.  While this play was terrible and not justifiable in any way, the next sequence of turns should erase any doubt as to whether I was going to have a chance in this game.
>Darrell_Day: EHNW 1L WHEN +51 230
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: EGINPRY 11H REP.YING +64 136
#note Only bingo, and it wins 3.5%.
>Darrell_Day: AQU O8 QUA. +42 272
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: AEEJSST 14B JEST +24 160
#note I put this down to open up extra lines. And with 4 T's in the unseen pool I didn't mind parting with my T.  Best is apparently 2K JEES, which wins 3.5%.  This wins 1-1/4.
>Darrell_Day: OVX 15A VOX +57 329
#note Of course.
>Jim_Burlant: AAELLSZ 13J Z.AL +26 186
#note Down to 0.21% winning chances.  It's either this or 13C LA, the latter of which sets up the easy Z bomb.

>Darrell_Day: DEO 13C DOE +35 374
>Jim_Burlant: AELOSTT D2 LOT +10 214
#note A lot of no-go 8's in this rack and no 7's.  Again, just trying to set up the spread saving bingo.
>Darrell_Day: AIOST 1D STOAI +23 397
>Jim_Burlant: ACDENST C5 DECANTS +73 287
#note Quackle makes me shake my head at times - it says I actually have 2.7% winning chances.  How?  If Darrell falls asleep for the next half hour?
>Darrell_Day: ADLN N1 .LAND +25 422
>Jim_Burlant: ABEIOOP 2D .OPE +26 313
#note At least I find the optimal end game - this gives me OBIA B2, OBIA B3, and OBIA 10E as unblockable out plays.

#note While my plays of EME and JEST were hardly ideal, it was pretty obvious that, once he came back with WHEN, this was going to be a bag job.  If I don't get reckless with EME and JEST and don't give him the huge X bomb and 51 for WHEN, I probably lose this game by 30 or 40 - at best.  As it is, considering that at one point I trailed by 170 points, I'm amazed that I only lost this by 98.
