>Richard_Charach: UUUU -UUUU +0 0
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEFKOO 8D COOKED +32 32
#note Hoping I can get PRE/MIS later on. OUT also works.
>Richard_Charach: ?AERSTY H2 YEASTi.R +61 61
#note His best bingos are (E)STRAYEd and (E)ASTERlY for 83.
>Matthew_Larocque: EFINORT 2A RENOTIF. +82 114
#note Richard thought about challenging here. I wasn't 100%, but I was pretty confident.
>Richard_Charach: DMU A1 D.UM +30 91
>Matthew_Larocque: EGIORSZ D1 Z.OIER +50 164
#note This only sims slightly better than Z(O)OS or Z(O)RI. Surprised that Z(O)OS is there, I mean the S is a good letter, no?
>Richard_Charach: JOTY 6F JO.TY +39 130
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGNST 9H .EAGENTS +65 229
#note Only bingo - I thought I was definitely missing others here.
>Richard_Charach: EX -  +0 130
#note Challenged because he must have thought the word was RE-AGENTS (and AGENT can be a verb).
>Matthew_Larocque: CEFIUVW O5 VIEW. +33 262
#note Have to keep a clunky leave no matter what, but at least I'm scoring points and taking out a big threat.
>Richard_Charach: EX 10I EX +54 184
>Matthew_Larocque: ACFLUVW L5 FAUV. +15 277
#note The first play where I didn't feel good at all about my choice. I was determined to dump either WU or VU at the very minimum. I forgot all about W(O)FUL and WA(E)FUL, though. (A)WFUL should have been obvious since that's exactly what my rack is. F(E)CULA is a cool play that I didn't know - no S- hook either.
>Richard_Charach: AIR K3 RAI +16 200
>Matthew_Larocque: CHILLQW 6N Q. +31 308
>Richard_Charach: EPR 8A PRE...... +54 254
#note Richard wasn't oblivious to that either, to my detriment.
>Matthew_Larocque: CHIILLW D8 .HILL +20 328
#note Another play where it seemed very mediocre, but I had to commit to something. I was originally going to play WHI(R)L, which Q likes a little better. I didn't even know the I-hook on CHILL, one of the main benefits of playing (C)HILL.
>Richard_Charach: EGO 11J EGO +18 272
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDINW 12G ACID +22 350
#note Not sure what my last letter was. I considered 12L plays like WIND or WADI, but decided that ACID had better defense. Not sure if that's worth the point cut. I know I thought about CANID, but did I miss NICAD? Without my full rack it's hard to know what's best here. Also unable to take advantage of CHILLI due to faulty word knowledge.
>Richard_Charach: ADR H12 .ARD +21 293
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINNSW 14A SWANNIE. +76 426
#note Somehow my instincts said I could probably get away with this against Richard.
>Richard_Charach: ILT A12 LI.T +15 308
#note Lucky that's all he could get down.
>Matthew_Larocque: BBHMPTU 12L HUMP +38 464
>Richard_Charach: EGINOSU 15H .IGENOUS +83 391
>Richard_Charach: EGINOSU --  -83 308
#note Richard has previously played a desperation phony on me, and the circumstances made me leave it. This time I had breathing room, plus I really didn't think the word was good anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABBOT 13K BOTA +26 490
#note I was terrible for recording my racks for these tournaments. I think I had the blank here though, and the L or N. BOTA scored points so seems pretty solid either way.
>Richard_Charach: EGINOSU 14M EGO +23 331
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABLN 10A ABL.Ng +13 503
#note If I make the blank an S, then it's actually a valid word! Richard did not take the free challenge here. (E)NABLe(R) is awesome and ties for best out with BA(L)LoN for 16 points.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (INSU) +8 511
#note The most notable thing about this game is that, despite being a low 500, still ended up being the high score of the tournament (good for a mini-prize).  I guess that happens in 1 day tournaments. I wasn't going to win anywhere close to what I did last year anyways, but once in awhile I guess I need to play the role of cannon fodder ;)
