>Jim_Burlant: ACHHIRS 8H ICH +16 16
#note You have to know it to play it - the 20852-probability RHACHIS scores 88 at 8C or 8H.   If you don't know that, this is your best remaining choice.
>Chris_Schneider: AO J8 .AO +8 8
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEHPRS K2 PARcHES +81 97
#note A zillion possible bingoes with this - K2 SERAPHS/SHERPAS/tEPHRAS/THREAPS, SHAPERS...but I whiffed on the star play when I alphagrammed AEHLPRS.  Never recognized PLASHER, which plays at K5 for 110.  I even saw PARCHESI back hooks on subsequent turns and never recognized that PARCHESI played at H1.  This is about the worst possible choice I could have made from this rack. Just awful!
>Chris_Schneider: AEINORT 2G ATRO.INE +74 82
#note Best bingo for Chris - other options are ANTERIOR on fow 4, AERATION on ro 3, ANTIHERO on row 5, and ANORETIC on row 6.  Those all score in the 60's, and this scores 74.
>Jim_Burlant: DFIOUUY M1 U.IFY +22 119
#note I saw the danger of comebacks like Q(U)AG for 97 at 1L, but do I really have a choice with this rack?  Quackle agrees - the only other plays worth consideration are 1M UDO and K10 YOU and they give up enough due to their wretched leaves that they're really not worth making.  I'm going to have to risk this. 
>Chris_Schneider: EEINSTV H8 .NVITEES +86 168
#note Unlike me, Chris finds his best bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: ADMOTUU 1F AMU +25 144
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Q verifies that I don't have a viable 1L play, so 1H has to be taken out.  That said, a much stronger choice than this was available:  DUOMA 1D 40.  DUMA 1E scores 31 but doesn't sim a whole lot better than this because the OTU leave was a hair vowel heavy. DUOMA wins 32% to this play's 27.  I never recognized DUOMA, which should have been the play.
>Chris_Schneider: LMOUV 13C VOLUM. +28 196
>Jim_Burlant: ADDOOTU 3B OUTADD +28 172
#note Finally, I get one right.  This scores well and clears out the garbage quite nicely.
>Chris_Schneider: BKN 1L B.NK +48 244
#note Play misscored as 47.  He's 80% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: EGLNOWW K10 WOW +23 195
#note I'm a little bit rattled here - at the time, I didn't know I'd missed DUOMA and it seemed like none of my intermediate plays could  keep up with the onslaught of huge clunk bombs Chris was dropping on me.  And now I've drawn a pair of W's after spending consecutive turns with a pair of U's in my rack and the only plays that score well leave me with a W.  I'm going to have to trade some score to get rid of the clunk.  This is best, but the outlook is bleak - I'm 15% to win with this.
>Chris_Schneider: EEIILNO L10 LIE +24 268
#note His rack.  This is Chris's best play.
>Jim_Burlant: EGIILNN E3 .LIENING +68 263
#note Somehow missed ELOINING B1.  Taking a look at the board position, the initial inclination is that this is safer.  However, upon closer examination this still threatens ZETA or JETE D1 and 8A isn't going to be the easiest thing to hit to counter.  So, given my situation, I needed the extra 4 points with ELOINING.  ELOINING wins 35%, this wins 33%, but not for long.
>Chris_Schneider: CDEEINO 15A CODEINE. +86 354
#note Only bingo for Chris.  Play incorrectly scored as 89.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIORRT A8 RhETORI. +80 343
#note Risky choice given the unseen X, but this scores 80 and none of my other options score more than 68.  I have to put this down, and Quackle confirms this is my best bingo.  20% to win.
>Chris_Schneider: EX B9 EX +51 405
>Jim_Burlant: AADFPRT F6 FAD +33 376
#note Best.  Still bleak - 10% to win.
>Chris_Schneider: GRSYZ B1 GR.SZY +54 459
#note Ouch!!!
>Jim_Burlant: AAELPRT N5 APTERAL +72 448
#note With this pool and BGJQ still unseen, I'm half scared of putting the bingo down.  Unfortunately, I trail by so much that I don't have any choice.  This wins 68%.  Play incorrectly scored as 70.  After I put this down, we thought the score was 462 - 446 when, in reality, it was 459 - 448.
>Chris_Schneider: ABGJQST 7C QA..T +25 484
#note C7 QAT scores 26.  
>Jim_Burlant: EO 4D O.E +13 461
#note Terrible luck for Chris to get stuck with BGJQSZ at the very end.  As for this, both this and NEON 9E score 13.   This was a club game, so we never bothered to recount.  Final score recorded as a 487-487 tie.  Wow.  Needless to say, in a tournament this would have been recounted.
