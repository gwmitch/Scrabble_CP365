#note Sims slightly ahead of WHITEOUT. This is 3 points less but stronger defensively.

>Evans_Clinchy: CERSUUY 13H U.Y +6 72
#note I think it's either this or UEY# H11 for 13 extra points. A lot to sacrifice for an E, but this is also a really effective blocking play, killing basically all of most likely scoring areas. The two options sim close.

#note Managed to miss ERF# A6 which is best. Also didn't know INBENT#. This sims a ways back... but I figured it wasn't that terrible to keep NNN, since I have JANN# in my back pocket for next turn.

#note Sim prefers exchanging. This might be one of those situations Quackle gets wrong because it expects a human to open the board?

#note I have QI/QUEY ready to go for 47, but that can wait. Gotta first make sure she doesn't bingo. This play gives me some easy points and a backup QI spot (though QUEY is nearly unblockable anyway).
