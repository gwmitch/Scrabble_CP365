>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AADEEIR 8H AE +4 4
#note Me and Gabriel are having an ongoing debate about this play. I think he should exchange AE instead.
>Joshua_Sokol: AJNOQRX 9G RAX +38 38
#note For blocking purposes of course.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ADEIRSV I7 V.. +17 21
#note I blocked ADVISER. Another reason that in most situations, exch AE seems the better option to me, and obviously in this situation it was.
>Joshua_Sokol: IIJNNOQ -IIJNOQ +0 38
#note This seems like the worthiest exchange, and the sim agrees to a certain degree.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ADEEIRS 10B DEARIES +69 90
>Joshua_Sokol: AEENNTU 7I .ENUE +9 47
#note What do I do here? I wanted to keep the board open. I guess 11C NAE could have done the trick. Maybe I play C8 UN(E)ATEN.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ACEJT C8 EJ.CTA +46 136
#note Great, he drew my J with good tiles :(
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AENOPT K5 PA.ThEON +86 133
#note Only 2x2 I saw, I jumped on it. Gabriel was playing too fast for me to look harder. Lucky draw of course, basically evens the luck balance for this game so far.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: BILTZ J10 BLITZ +56 192
#note And there she blows. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIORU 14J .AIRE +28 161
#note I hadn't spotted DEJECTA at this point. Bad play.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: COWY M11 COW.Y +26 218
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGORUY D4 GUYED +29 190
#note I didn't know ROGUE(R)Y. Still hadn't spotted DEJECTA.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: IV 8A VI.. +24 242
>Joshua_Sokol: HKLMORU 8K .HRUM +53 243
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AMP E5 PAM +31 273
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIKLOO F3 LOOKED +51 294
#note Maybe keep the D for DEME and play OKE instead?
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: OO 13M .OO +8 281
#note It took him so long to play this. He went from playing really really fast to really taking his time. At least I can read what he's up to.
>Joshua_Sokol: GIINOQT L4 QI +26 320
#note I guess I really need to infer a blank here, but I thought that the L+ the ER were more threatening than the T in that position. Should I really play (T)OTING? It's an interesting idea. I thought maybe I could manage a bingo through the M some of the time. Maybe even 13B Q(A)T?
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ?ABEINS 12A Be.AINES +76 357
>Joshua_Sokol: DGIINOT 7C D... +28 348
#note I didn't know what to do. I think I should play M3 DING(ER), which I chickened out on. Possibly A12 (B)IOG is a good idea.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: FFU A12 .UFF +36 393
#note It would have prevented this...
>Joshua_Sokol: GIILNOT M3 LING.. +30 378
#note Quackle wants me to fish off the O. No way. My only lane after that is quite easily shut down. M3 LIT may be a good idea, but I felt like brute force was necessary for me to win rather than perfect rack management.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: GIW H12 .WIG +24 417
>Joshua_Sokol: HILNOST O12 H.ST +48 426
#note I didn't even consider that he was going to bingo. I should have played 6J H(A). It wins half of the time with his rack, but I didn't actually know SOLITON. Lose-lose for me unless by some miraculous feat I guessed SOLITON.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AENRRST 2G RANTERS +67 484
#note I put up a decent fight I think. It really came down to what he drew after swig. I was so ready to go out with (F)OOTLIN(G), which he wouldn't have seen because of time trouble had he not drawn the bingo. :(
