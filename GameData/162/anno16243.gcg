>Joshua_Sokol: AEUV 8H UVEA +14 14
>Zev_Kaufman: ENOORTT 7K TOO +6 6
#note I hate making plays like this, so maybe I should just play R(A)TTOON.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEU 6H BEAU +11 25
>Zev_Kaufman: ?EELNRT N2 RELENTs +70 76
#note Damn, L1 ENTREs(O)L! (U)NdERLET is another better option.
>Joshua_Sokol: III -III +0 25
>Zev_Kaufman: ADEERUV 5E UVEA +18 94
#note I missed ADVER(B). Crazy that this is the 3rd time UVEA was played in 2 games with Zev.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEILNST E4 T.NICLES +70 95
#note CENTIL(E)S.
>Zev_Kaufman: DDEGGNR 3L DR.G +12 106
#note 31 DREDG(E) looks OK.
>Joshua_Sokol: IOTTUW O8 OUTWIT +33 128
>Zev_Kaufman: ABDEGNY D10 BAYED +28 134
#note AGEN(C)Y. I didn't know BENDAY, and I didn't want to play BANGED. L1 BA(D)DY is pretty nice. Otherwise 4I GYBE is a decent option too.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAKT 4H KATA +27 155
#note This seems like it's going to cause me to worry later on. Maybe he has the S.
>Zev_Kaufman: ?DGMNOP C11 POM +32 166
>Joshua_Sokol: EJ J2 JE. +26 181
>Zev_Kaufman: ?DEGNRS 14I GaNDERS +76 242
#note I was quite lucky to have drawn the other blank.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIX D1 IXIA +28 209
>Zev_Kaufman: HHIINOO C2 OHO +34 276
>Joshua_Sokol: DEF F10 DEF +27 236
>Zev_Kaufman: ACHIILN B2 LA +30 306
#note Why not LAC... CLIN(C)H is a bit more of a risk but it may be better. Opening the 3x3 with AN(OX)IC seems way out of my courage level.
>Joshua_Sokol: C 12B C.. +8 244

>Joshua_Sokol: ENY 14D .ENY +10 270
>Zev_Kaufman: ILOPQSZ 11K QI +46 416
#note Wow, L1 PO(D)S is best here. Pretty counterintuitive.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIMOS L1 MO.S +38 308
>Zev_Kaufman: LOPSZ A7 Z.PS +15 431
#note I misannotated. It was GANDeRS rather than GaNDERS, so I'll make it as if it's the same score in the end. Final score was 435-317 after Zev went out with (V)IE.
