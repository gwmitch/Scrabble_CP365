#note I was quite wary of keping the Q here with DAFT, because even if I draw QI there might not be a spot to play it! Exchanging looked good to me, and I tossed them all because the pool looked really good. This is actually a poor assessment of the pool though, I think. If you look at what's been played, it's mostly average tiles. Thus, the pool is really polarized. I looked at SSSS?? and said "let's dive in!" but I don't think that's the right attitude here. There is also plenty of bad stuff to draw, and with a lead, I should try to reduce volatility, so I think ADT is the best keep here.

#note Bad! I just snap-played this, missing ADZ, ADZE, and AZIDE. That said, this play seems better than ADZ/ADZE because of the setup and not setting up a huge stupid lane. Also DQ appears good enough that this is also better than AZIDE. Nevertheless, playing so quickly was poor.
