#note Q also suggests something like 9K HOE. It's a good leave but I don't have any hooks for that board. 
>Goldfish: AABEIMO K5 AMO.BAE +60 60
#note Cool play. The only play.
>Spherulitic: ?EIOPRS H8 .OSsIPER +83 137
#note Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin You say you wanna get in my Benz? Well, use me, use me... 
>Goldfish: EINORVZ L1 VIZOR +44 104
#note Every play is wicked volatile. 
>Spherulitic: ?EIJNTV J2 JIVE +33 170
#note Pretty much the only option. All the plays are so similar it's easy to compare them -- 2K JIVE opens column O for no reason, 11D JIVES opens up 12A-D for no reason, J5 JETE keeps the V and leaves 2J open for no reason.
>Goldfish: CDENNOT 11A CONTEND. +70 174
#note My canny placement of the blank at H11 instead of H10 pays off.
>Spherulitic: ?AGLNTU 14A UnTANGL. +74 244
>Goldfish: ACEIMOP 15A POEM +55 229
#note It's going to be very hard to put this game away if Brad insists on plays like this.
>Spherulitic: AEFHNNR A7 FREN.H +54 298
#note Take out M2, or A7? The leave at A7 is nice and it scores best. Boom. I'll risk leaving M2 open for one more turn, holding an A if Brad doesn't take it.
>Goldfish: ACDDIIS M3 AID +37 266
>Spherulitic: AINSTUY 10A .Y +26 324
#note This an 13C AYU are really close.  This works well given that I'm about to draw an E.
>Goldfish: ACDEILS 15H .ADICELS +92 358
#note It was this moment I realised this was going to be a high-scoring loss for one of us -- there were still 28 (soon to be 21) tiles in the bag and we were both pretty dang close to 400 already.
>Spherulitic: AEINSTU O8 SINUATE. +77 401
#note Brad had spent a long time on his first couple turns, and my plays had by and large been pretty easy. At this point I think I had about 18 minutes on my clock and Brad under 10, maybe about 6 or 7? It ended up not really mattering though, I think.
>Goldfish: AABGLRU E4 ARGUABL. +72 430
#note Well, crikey.
>Spherulitic: FLOSTWY 6I LY.S +61 462
#note That J6 spot bothered me all game. "Hmm, maybe I can hit LYM or something." 
>Goldfish: DIIORTW 1L .ROW +30 460
#note Discussed this move with Brad after the game. Playing J10 WRIT right away empties the bag. VROW leaves one in the bag and saves WRIT for next turn. But if I have the Q, I'll most likely play there, I guess, and if he gets the Q, he'll play there instead of WRIT. FWIW, Quackle likes WRIT best. Q also likes D1 WORD. There are plays out at D1 that score a lot, and there's not much inference to be made about my leave from my last play.   The third play Q considers is 4D WADI. This leaves a 30+ point Q spot and sets up a 40+ point Q (which is also an X spot). Hmm...
>Spherulitic: AFOTUWX D4 FAUX +52 514
#note Quackle is an amazing tool. For example, without it, I never would have realised that if Brad just left the Q in the bag, this play LETS HIM BINGO OUT TO WIN. *facepalm*
>Goldfish: DEIIOQT F2 DIET +18 478
#note Best, blocking my out.
>Spherulitic: NOTW 2N WO +25 539
#note Six point mistake, but it's 100% to win.
