#note Given the lack of decent options here, this is a perfect opportunity to try and dictate where things will go on this board. It would be cool to keep things ultra-tight with few escape routes, but it would seem I am at a large disadvantage in terms of drawing an S or blank after a play like G(U)V for 7. Especially since I would most likely have very poor options for next turn. All of this is OK if she doesn't have an S or a blank, but I wasn't so sure at the time. That is why I decided against G(U)V. F(U)G might be a bit better in that I hold a U for (FUG)U. Anyways, I decided to just score and hope to phony my way out of any trouble if need be. Linda had told me that she plays Collins and always confuses the two dictionaries, which was useful information. Anyways, I probably made the wrong play, since I didn't have a very solid plan.
>Linda_Kong_Ting: AMR E9 .ARM +18 30
>Joshua_Sokol: AGGRSUV G6 GU..G +8 25
#note I decided to forgo VUGGS/FARMS here. I shouldn't have. I just wanted to make my S very powerful.
>Linda_Kong_Ting: ?DEINNR J2 DINNERs +69 99
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEINSV 4H VI.AE +24 49
#note Thought about D12 AVA, setting up a potential hook for myself and a potential challenge from her, but I decided to just phony this turn instead.
>Linda_Kong_Ting: HM D12 HM +28 127
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AENSTY 14C AmNESTY +68 117
#note I couldn't see anything else. 11G ShANTEY looks like the play. There were a few other options as well.
>Linda_Kong_Ting: BEIRS 13I BIERS +30 157
#note It seemed Linda was trying to catch where my eye was lookng these past few plays, so on her time I looked longly at the spot she played in.
>Joshua_Sokol: LNOOOTX 15A LOX +39 156
>Linda_Kong_Ting: HTW K11 WH.T +20 177
>Joshua_Sokol: GNOOOPT 3I P.NOT +31 187
#note L10 POO(R) is a good option. I preferred to score more, just to keep the pressure on. The leave is likely not good enough to justify that.
>Linda_Kong_Ting: A 12K .A +14 191
>Joshua_Sokol: CGIIOOT C7 COGITO +22 209
#note I believe this was held. Perhaps I should have played COGITO(S) at M7, which is even more likely to be challenged than the singular form. Given she just played off one tile, it's not usually a problem to open up L8, but who knows what she kept. After the game she said she knew it was Latin but that she didn't know if it was in the dictionary. 
>Linda_Kong_Ting: ABJ 2L JAB +36 227
#note Not sure if the B8 placement is better than this. It's 4 more points, but...
>Joshua_Sokol: EFIIKTZ B10 KI +34 243
#note Given she just played off an A and then JAB, I really couldn't infer an S at this point.
>Linda_Kong_Ting: IIII -IIII +0 227
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFIRTZ A11 FEZ +22 265
#note worked out well. Maybe M7 FRITZE(S), or better yet FRIEZE(S)? 8A FR(O)E keeps the Z for the future. All justifiable options. I liked getting rid of the S hook after her exchange and beating her to a bingo if need be.

#note a fortuitous draw!
>Linda_Kong_Ting: ALSUU O1 USUAL +31 296

#note I couldn't find an out in two! This was in fact the best endgame move.

>Joshua_Sokol: DDI 7F D.D +11 418
>Linda_Kong_Ting: AE 14N AE +10 335
#note I noticed she could actually I stick me, heh. 5I A(N)E is the best play though, I sticking me is 3 points back and this is 7 back.
