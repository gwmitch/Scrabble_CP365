>Jeremy: AOSTTTU 9F .ATTU +17 71
#note I was disappointed OUTSTA(R)T was blocked, and I sure haven't studied down to (B)ATTUTOS# in the Collins lexicon.  So yeah, I missed a 71 point bingo here, and took the 17 point play instead.
>Jackson: ADN 10I AND +12 26
>Jeremy: ?DEEOST 11C OErSTED +68 139
#note H1 mODESTE(ST) 80, 11H rOSETED# 76, a few 73 pointers, and I take a 68 pointer.  Sometimes mistakes pay off.
>Jackson: ?AGIIRX 12G ORATING +78 104
>Jackson: ?AGIIRX --  -78 26
>Jeremy: DEINORS L5 INDORSE +64 203
#note L8 ROSINED would have been fine, but I wasn't sure if TROADING* was good because I've learned TROADES# and   TROADS#.  I basically played extra paranoid exposing as few tiles to bingos as I good, thinking the only hooks here were E,D, and S.
>Jackson: AGORT 12K GROAT +32 58
>Jackson: IQ (challenge) +5 63
#note Foolishly, I challenge before I notice the golden play I'm sitting on.

#note N11 P(A)OLO# sims best here.
>Jackson: GO 9C GO +16 152
>Jeremy: EEELLOS 13J LOSE +25 521
#note N6 SLEE# sims best here.  I thought LOSE was probably going to sim really badly, but it's not that bad.
>Jackson: AA N14 AA +17 169
>Jeremy: ?EEEHLN 10B HEN +31 552
#note I knew ENwHEEL which plays at B4. In fact I thought of it on the car ride home. 15B ELEvEN(T)H also works.   *shrug* that's a miss. HEN sims better than the bingos anyhow.
>Jackson: EFI N2 FIE +18 187
>Jeremy: ?EEILLN H1 LoNELIE.. +77 629
#note 6A or 15E LENtI(C)LE# or LENtI(C)EL#. 15 E bEL(T)LINE were other available bingos.
>Jackson: AGIJNW A8 JAWING +64 251
>Jeremy: AIMORUY O1 AYU +31 660
#note N6 YOU.
>Jackson: UY N6 YU +33 284
>Jeremy: AEILMOR 15B ROLAMI.E +61 721
#note Championship player says 4G O(E) keeping MAILER and drawing that last tile to bingo out maximizes points, but giving Jackson complete knowledge of my rack is going to let him block.
