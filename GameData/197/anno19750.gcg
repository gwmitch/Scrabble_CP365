>Lloyd: EMORSTU 8F OESTRUM +74 74
>Matt: CEHIIMN 9E HIM +20 20
#note Spent some time seeing if there was an 8, there's only CHIMINEA#.  
>Lloyd: AEFGILR 10A FRAGILE +80 154
>Matt: ACDEINO H1 CODEINA. +86 106
>Lloyd: CDEIORS 2G C.RODIES +76 230
#note Hoping he stays away from the F, but didn't really expect a 3rd bingo out of the bag.
>Matt: ADELORT A8 DE.LATOR +167 273
#note Although it must be frustrating to open with 3 bingoes and be down by 40.
>Lloyd: DUW 1M WUD +28 258
>Matt: AEINNQT C9 Q.NAT +48 321
>Lloyd: OOPRTUW 4B OUTPOW.R +76 334
#note I held this for awhile, stared at the alphagram, linked it with TOWROPES and wisely decided to let it go.  4 bingoes in 5 turns for him but I'm still in the game.
>Matt: AEEIINP D10 .ENII +20 341
#note I did consider PIE/PIA, but I just felt that AEIN could end badly.  GENII keeps the P in reserve for next turn, along with a more balanced leave.
>Lloyd: EJNY 6F JE.NY +39 373
>Matt: AABEKPZ 5J BEAK +27 368
#note This was a tough rack since I didn't have choices like ZUPA# or BUAZE# available.  This sets up ZAP for next turn and dumps two clunky tiles, and scores well.
>Lloyd: ?GV C3 V.G +14 387
#note First score under 28 for him, telegraphing a blank.
>Matt: AFLPTVZ L4 Z.P +28 396
#note Well that draw was not ideal.  Trying to keep the board tightish for now while I wade through this dreck. 
>Lloyd: ?HNT 6A NTH +19 406
>Matt: AEEFLTV B14 FE +22 418
#note Starting to look more promising.  This is the play, scores and doesn't open anything reckless.  
>Lloyd: ?AB M5 .AB +16 422
#note He mentioned afterward that he regretted this play after hitting his clock, since it sets up an X bomb that might keep me in the game even if he bingoes.  
>Matt: AEEILTV J8 .ELATIVE +71 489
#note OK, which bingo do you take?  He definitely has one blank, possibly 2, and there are two S's unseen as well.  Make him find the 8 and maybe I can get an X bomb in retaliation.  
>Lloyd: ??AAIRU 12J .AU +6 428
#note Wise to forgo the bingo right now, I think, although drawing the X could be problematic.  Quackle actually suggests VAU for 12, and every point does count in this game.
>Matt: ILNOOSY 15F LOON.YS +33 522
#note Well looking at that pool, I thought I had to block the 3x3 just to have a chance, ans hope that he draws the X.  CP suggests BEAKY, which I guess takes the 3x3 hit, and tries to draw into my own bingo in return.  My actual choice comes in 2nd.  I'm really curious what others would do, my brain broke.
>Lloyd: ??AGIRS N5 ScARInG +75 503
#note SyRInGA scores 81, giving a bit of leeway in case there was an error in a recount, but that's a tough find with 2 blanks and limited time.  This was enough to win though.  Thus caps the wildest shootout I've been a part of.
