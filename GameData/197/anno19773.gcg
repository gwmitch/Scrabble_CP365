#note I thought for a while here. I thought about pretty much every option Quackle has, but they all are too volatile for me. I'm trying to keep the board shut and with minimal hotspots and no blanks out I probably won't be burying myself. My play keeps the board tight with decent scoring tiles for next turn, I like it.

>Joey_Krafchick: AACEEGW N6 CAGE +19 206
#note I purposely played the C and not the W. Despite the fact that the C is a great tile (especially compared to the W), WAGE is way too volatile especially when I'm down.

#note 1000 iterations @ 2 plies sim puts WICK(E)R best by far equity wise, but I liked the defensive aspect of CREEK since I just took 32 points on a board with barely any points to offer. With both blanks gone on a closed board going up 30 is key, and the C in creek doing what it does creates problems for the board. (-6)

>Joey_Krafchick: DEFIIRW 4A WI.E +22 277
#note I contemplated FI(R), which won the sim after 1000 iterations, but with the J not out for JA(R) there I don't see him likely to use that spot. That being said, I figured the W would be a hard letter for him to use, so I took that route gutsily. (-5)
>Matthew_Bernardina: AITU 11B AU.IT +19 272
>Joey_Krafchick: DFILORV A4 .ORLD +27 304
#note I thought about this for a while. I figured there was a pretty solid chance that I could take this spot with the W and leave IF at the very least for next turn to score. I was thinking to grab all the points I can get to make sure I'm safe since he won't bingo.

VROW is the play, I somehow didn't see it but I had the general idea right somewhat. 1000 iterations @ 2 plies sim it leads the way. (-11)
