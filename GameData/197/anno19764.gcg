#note I made a displeased karris exchange for the second turn in a row
>JD: EFIIINR -FII +0 48
#note might as well draw for the bingo

>JD: DEEINQR 11E N.EDIER +32 80
#note 32 points way too much to sacrifice to exchange, I may block 2x2 here

>JD: AEEELNQ -EEQ +0 141
#note I didn't like giving up free points by playing ANELE at 12A, even though I draw a Q play with one of the 8 Is or the 4 Us. exchanging isn't too bad. NEE at 10J is an interesting play I didn't consider, very defensive and keeping potential of drawing QUALE.

#note keeping ANN outsims keeping ENN by a bit. not sure why

#note quackle much prefers JINN at N6 for 6 more points, but that seemed to make his next play too easy

>JD: AENPWYZ 2J ZEP +69 412
#note should I pass up the 69 points for ZEP to block with WINZE? given that it drops his bingo percentage from 36% to 6% and his average points per turn by 26, absolutely!!
>John_Karris: ?DELRSU 1A SLUDg.ER +140 404
#note john gets to close the spread by a bunch but never wins. still, way too greedy on my part not to block!
