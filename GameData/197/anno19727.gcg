#note I picked this over GRATINEE and the other AIGRETTE placement to set up another J/Z hotspot since I still need plenty of help.
>Brian: UUU -UUU +0 189
>Bill: AACEJOU 6B JA +52 172
#note Taking the N6 spot is better for board openness, but I figured he might be consonant heavy and taking out a couple floating vowels might thwart his plans. I've closed the gap enough that I can try to work my way back more cautiously.
>Brian: BEILMNS 10B MILNEBS +92 281
#note Whatever. Checked on the hook.
>Bill: ACDEKOU 8A OKA +38 210

#note At this point I could care less if I let him score 600.
>Brian: LMSY 15E LYMS +49 562
#note +10... I knew LYM and had no reason to doubt it took an S, but it blocked POLENTA and the challenge computer looked lonely.
>Bill: AELNOPT 15K NETOP +27 333
#note I'm long past the point of caring that I need to block QIS (-16).
