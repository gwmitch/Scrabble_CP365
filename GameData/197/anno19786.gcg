#note bad miss of OATEN in the same spot as well as K2 NOTATE, which does great things to this board all things considered. Considerable mistake on game one of the day.
>Dean_Porporo: APWY 1H WA.PY +51 144
#note Coupled by the fact that I knew Dean phonied a considerable amount! How did I let this slide?!

#note Dean looked ready to bingo here. Does that mean I should play B10 XI? Probably.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?BDJRUV C12 BRU. +26 192
#note Not sure what my thought process was here, forgoing F2 J(A)B like this. I guess hoping for an E, but that's kind of silly. I should much rather bingoing. I also just hated leaving 14A open I guess, cheap points that Dean could take without punishment giving the tiles I would be holding. Still not enough to forgo JAB. Another medium error. They are starting to add up, aren't they. Don't make mistakes or you will get frustrated and lose :)

>Joshua_Sokol: ?ALMORR O5 MORAL. +24 312
#note I was really down in the dumps here. I missed PREMORAL and PREMOLAR at M8. Those would be right to play, but otherwise I need to play MORALs or MOLARS or ARMORS. ARMORS is probably better given that two R's are still left to draw.
>Dean_Porporo: OOP 9K POO +15 367
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACFNRT 13F iNFARCT +64 376
#note I also want to avoid eating the Q... But it seemed mostly hopeless for me at this point. Maybe I can draw the last S or draw a challenge, with Dean thinking I misplaced the A and the R. Maybe INFARCT doesn't take the S, miraculously, and I can win a challenge if he tries to add it. Maybe he thinks it doesn't take an S. This seemed to allow me to win most often.

#note -11 but I challenged for the impossible win anyways so why did I challenge and not challenge WARPY...

(this is what was going on in my head at the time)
