#note I had a few nice plays here. 5E F(ORE)RUN, E5 FUG, 4C UPF(LOW) and 14F FR(O)G. I decided against FR(O)G because of the leave, mainly, but FR(O)G is made much better in that it keeps UN(AWESoME) for next turn, which I failed to consider. I didn't even remember that word. I opted for the points here, which is probably wrong. But I also don't think I should be trying to bingo at the expense of sacrificing points either. I should probably just play the standard FUG.

#note missing the good option of E4 P(F)UI this turn. Holding that G would suck though, but perhaps it's better than holding three vowels.

#note Do I go for B9 (T)IE? I like it now that I see it since it takes out a lane that could turn out to be problematic. I think that's the right play.

#note I missed higher scoring options here. I was very much focused on blocking ths most of her bingos as possible, knowing what she left. Considering this I think I made the right play.
