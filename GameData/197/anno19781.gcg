#note I didn't like this position. Quackle wants me to get rid of the K somehow, which I wanted to do too but it didn't seem to make sense to fish. I don't know, I think I like my play as it ensures I can score next turn as well.

>Roger_Cullman: ?AIILNS 12E SAILINg +68 104
>Joshua_Sokol: AIILOTZ 10B ZOI. +35 84
#note I know that SAILINGS is valid, so I proceed to fork the scoring spots here. I think this is the best I can do here, 4 A's are already gone, usually it won't sting much to open this up.
>Roger_Cullman: CIO B10 .OIC +15 119
#note lol

#note I am not lucky! What are you talking about?
>Roger_Cullman: GINRY 8J .RYING +42 199
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABILRS M2 BRASIL.n +70 327
#note missing a few better things and hoping to draw the challenge. Almost.
>Roger_Cullman: AJ 9A .AJ +51 250
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGMRUV O6 VU.G +9 336
#note I3 GUV. I had actually forgotten about S(TARE) so this is a bad play given my reasoning behind it: close everything possible. But there's a big 7 lane staring at me in the face that will bring Roger to the same score as me if he hits it next turn. Whatever, still in good shape.
>Roger_Cullman: ADM I3 MAD +20 270
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEMPRT H1 DEEP +41 377
#note oh right, MM is a word. Large mistake number 2, missing H1 TEMP. DEEM looks better given the two actual values of the leaves.
>Roger_Cullman: ENS H12 .ENS +12 282
#note right idea, but he should play something with SAILINgS, which he didn't know was valid.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMOORT 14C MOTIO.ER +64 441
#note not like it mattered. I should have played something through the S because the pool is just so much scoring and so little bingo material. Almost drew another challenge though.
>Roger_Cullman: AFLO 15A LOAF +46 328
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEOPUV 2E EPE. +12 453
#note blocking everthing, but VEEPE(E) is the better block. Didn't know that one!
>Roger_Cullman: HHSY 10M SHH +40 368
>Roger_Cullman: HHSY --  -40 328
#note the Y would have worked!
>Joshua_Sokol: EEOOUVW 11A ..W +19 472
#note thought there were two left. Meh.
>Roger_Cullman: NW G11 W.N. +11 339
>Joshua_Sokol: EEOOOUV N1 VOE +22 494
#note I didn't want to spend too long on this endgame, especially since I was on a tight schedule that night. the best play is apparently F1 U(P)O
>Roger_Cullman: GHHNSUY 3B HUNH +25 364
#note GUSHY is a word! I had no idea. I would have instachallenged. Even though I should know it since I know the pair in EGHIRSU... his play is G2 (E)H, preventing me from blocking GUSHY well and scoring.
