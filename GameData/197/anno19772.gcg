#note I thought VOLTAS looked funny, but in my world lit class we just learned about what VOLTA was, so it seems to make sense to take an S. But, obviously not. VOLTAS*

#note This here was stupid. I don't know what happened but playing EH for 32 not emptying the bag seems pretty obvious a play. I'm gonna win regardless and a bingo out still doesn't win, but this is just laziness on my part.

#note THat's what I deserve. WAWL and GIGUE were bad plays near the end that cost me spread, otherwise I just outdrew him.
