>Anna_Miransky: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>Joshua_Sokol: ADHPTUX 7H XU +19 19
#note I liked this cause I know this position very well and am comfortable with it but 7H PHUT is just so much better, setting up my X and stuff
>Anna_Miransky: I G8 .I +12 34
>Joshua_Sokol: AADHNPT F9 PHAT +21 40
#note Given her last play I can infer something that can't usually take advantage of this. But to be safe I should have just played PHT
>Anna_Miransky: GINZ E11 ZIN +48 82
#note she drew the Z, she said

#note 14H (I)NTAGLIO also played, but I missed that.
>Anna_Miransky: DFNR K11 FR.ND +18 152
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHIRSW N10 WHA.E +38 226
#note interesting choice between AWHI(L)E, WHI(L)E, WHA(L)E, WHA(L)ER on N or HON/HAM 13C. Decided WHALE over WHILE cause despite ARS being better than IRS I saw there were two more A's to come than I's. But maybe ARS is just that much better.

>Joshua_Sokol: ILLRSVV 12M L.V +12 238
#note I3 VILL(U)S seems like the play even though it opens up a new quadrant. Everything else just doesn't score enough to deal with the ongoing threat I opened up.
>Anna_Miransky: ??AEORT O4 ROseATE +73 245
#note Why would she pass up the opportunity to play RHEOTAXIS?
>Joshua_Sokol: AILRRSV N1 VIRAL +20 258
#note ? Preferred giving her the V rather than the R given the pool. Not much scores with that V. But is there a better play?
