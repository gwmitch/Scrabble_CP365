>Defense: AAAEFRT -AAF +0 0
#note There are two main options to consider: 8F AFAR and trading AAF. They are both pretty similar equity-wise. The defensive-minded player will always trade AAF here, as it concedes fewer points immediately to the opponent and shoots for the first bingo. Based on raw static evaluation, a leave of AERT is only 10 points better than AET, but it is silly to equate bingo leaves by points. A better indicator would be how often we bingo next turn, and if a defensive player knows that AERT will bingo 55% as opposed to AET's 28%, he'll decide that it's well worth it. AFAR, for what it's worth, gives back 5 more immediate points and an additional 10% chance of the opponent bingoing out of the hatch.
>Offense: ?IORRUW -IORUW +0 0
#note This is a very tough turn. If the offensive player were going first here, he wouldn't care about what he's throwing out for his opponent this early in the game; he would make the move that, on average, nets him the most points this turn + next turn. 8G ROW and trading IORUW are very close in this regard. ROW scores an immediate 12 points, but only bingos 55% next turn instead of 67%. However, the offensive player notes that his opponent exchanged 3, and when he knows he's not sacrificing many points, if at all, he'll lean towards not providing unnecessary floaters. The offensive player also notes that he also wants the best rack possible to counterbingo if his opponent bingos, so his preference will be to keep a better leave.
>Defense: ACEEERT -E +0 0
#note The defensive player automatically rules out ECARTE/CERATE/CREATE, as these plays blow up the rack and give the opponent a lot of options to work with. The two main options are 8G CEE and trading E (trading EE is ruled out because it bingos less often next turn than trading E). This time, it's a pretty tough call. Passing one bingos so much more often than CEE (72% to 45%). However, there are two problems; the defensive player is more reluctant to trade twice since he doesn't want to fall behind early, and CEE helps block the left half of the board for later on, even though it provides more to the opponent immediately. After much thought, the defensive player decides to stick with his original strategy and trade E.
>Offense: ?DGIORT 8D GORDITa +70 70
#note While the defensive player might prefer 8G GORDITA for 68 for long term board control, the offensive player is perfectly happy with taking the additional two points and not exposing vowels next to the double letter squares.
>Defense: ACEENRT E5 CAR.TENE +90 90
#note CAR(O)TENE is too many points to pass up. While it may seem like CAROTENE exposes a lot of hotspots, infact the opponent's average score and bingo % with a random rack is almost identical to something like (I)NCREATE. Furthermore, INCREATE leaves all of the board open, while CAROTENE makes the top left harder to access. The defensive player takes CAROTENE here.
>Offense: EILMNOR F6 ME.INO +36 106
#note Pretty easy choice for the offensive player. There are no bingos available, and this scores very well while keeping a neutral leave. While the offensive player would like to keep the board open, the alternatives are so much worse.
>Defense: EHINOQR 7H QI +26 116
#note This is the only play that makes any sense, no matter if the player is offensive or defensive. 
>Offense: FGLORRT D12 FROG +30 136
#note Another straightforward play for an offensive minded player. This play has the highest static equity, and the offensive player is perfectly fine with the board position as well- He likes opening the board in such a way that creates bingo lines while simultaneously taking out a hotspot that his opponent can use. 
>Defense: CEHNORS 15D .ROSCHEN +92 208
>Offense: DHILORT 14J HOD +30 166
#note While the board isn't dead yet, the offensive player knows that if he isn't proactive about opening the board, his opponent will close it in a heartbeat. There are a few options here.  HOD, HID, HOLD, and DH(O)OTI. The offensive player immediately rules DHOOTI for a few reasons. He wants to be proactive about opening a new S line, even if he has no S, because GORDITAS will probably be taken out sooner or later. He also wants to take out the 14J hotspot, knowing that leaving it will not add variance at all. So now it's between HOD, HID, and HOLD. HOLD can also be ruled out. While IRT is a safer leave, the offensive player doesn't care; now is no time to be 'safe'; he knows he needs to bingo soon, and a leave of ILRT bingos around 4% of the time more, and these can play at 6I if he doesn't draw an S. Also, he wants to open the board in a way that's hard to block while scoring well and not in such a desperate fashion. So now the choices are HOD and HID. HID is ruled out because LIRT simply is a much better leave for bingos than LORT, despite the fact that there are more I's in the pool. (LIRT bingos 6% more often). Also, while HID opens an E hook, it's too easy for the opponent to shut down the board with his own E. So HOD it is.
>Defense: EIIJRTU L9 JURIE. +28 236
#note Not the ideal pull by any stretch of the imagination, but the defensive player is bailed out by this play that seemingly does everything right.
>Offense: ADILORT 6I DILATOR +66 232
#note The only bingo.
>Defense: EIIIITV O6 .IVET +24 260
#note Another unfortunate pull leaves the defensive player in a very awkward spot. The main options here are (R)IVET, trading IIIIV, and (R)IVE, in that static equity order. Keeping EIT might also be worth considering because he has the last four I's. However, the triple alley is too dangerous, and if the defensive knows that he's allowing 12 fewer points on average by taking out the spot, it becomes an easier decision for him. So it's between RIVET and RIVE. The T doesn't do too much to help the leave; knowing that there are no I's to pull from, the defensive player likes the idea of flipping the low point T to go for the second blank, the K, the X, the Z, or the three remaining esses. RIVET also reduces the playability of bingos formed by random seven letter racks for the opponent.
>Offense: EMNPSSU 13B PU.S +23 255
#note There are about a dozen plays here that are all similar equity-wise, but the offensive player grabs the first opportunity he gets to create a new lane for himself on the triple alley that is hard to block if his opponent doesn't have the last S, or a bingo with a blank as an S. 
>Defense: DFIIILO 11I FLO.ID +20 280
#note The defensive player is in a lot of trouble here. What should he do? Even he realizes that playing OI at 14A is pretty crazy. Instead, he tries to turn over a lot of tiles to try and get some goodies of his own. Keeping II isn't as bad as it seems since there are no more I's in the pool. The other options are OIDI(A) and IDIO(T), but those score much less, play fewer tiles, and provide additional scoring spots for the opponent. The defensive player decides to forgo blocking for one turn, hoping to dodge a bullet in column 1, and hoping to draw an S, knowing that it's game over if his opponent bingos now.
>Offense: AAEMNSU 5K AMU +20 275
#note This is the only reasonable option that doesn't use the S- the offensive player will be furious with himself if he makes such a bold play and refuses to reap in proper rewards. Thus, he rules out the two alternatives, NAUSEA A10 and ME(D)USAN N9. He is aware that his opponent might block SPURS, but he hopes that his opponent sacrifices a large number of points to do so, leaving column 4 plays for himself.
>Defense: ?EGIINS A7 IGNItES +81 361
#note What an amazing draw! The other option is dINGIES, but that concedes ES bingos without leaving the TWS fully open for playback.
>Offense: AENSTYZ 9I ZA +46 321
>Defense: AEEELPU N11 .UE +4 365
#note The defensive player is stuck with another awkward rack, and he literally can do nothing about the B column. However, he finds this setup, which gives him a guaranteed 36 points anytime in the future as his opponent cannot use it to good effect. And if his opponent does play there, that's a turn that they're not bingoing.
>Offense: AENSTYY 14F YE +28 349
#note Tricky turn. There is no effective way to play off both Y's without playing something like G12 YAY(S). However, the offensive player realizes that he doesn't need to be desperate, especially since he knows that his opponent will block the last lane. Instead, something like YE pulls him within 16. YA in the same spot is ruled out since there are actually higher bingo chances on this board with ANSTY, and the AMA hook is quite valuable for scoring.
>Defense: AEELOPW O12 PLEW +45 410
#note Again, the defensive player has no way of blocking column B, unless he plays something like OE at B8, but he realizes it's foolish because his opponent can easily outrun using the AMA hook. Instead, he decides to cash in his setup.
>Offense: AANSTXY 7L TAX. +30 379
>Defense: AABEKLO 6B KAL.. +21 431
#note Now the defensive player needs to block at all costs, and this gets the job done quite well while not emptying the bag.
>Offense: AENSTWY G2 WYTES +27 406
#note There is just nothing to fish for, so the offensive player decides to minimize losing deficit.
>Defense: AABBENO 2F B.ANA +18 449
#note I'm going to keep endgames out of the commentary since endgames have a definite solution. GG!
>Offense: ANV H13 VA. +14 420
>Defense: BEO 1H BO +26 475
>Offense: N C13 .N +4 424
#note And that's it for Game 1 of the Offense vs. Defense commentary series! Note that this is only for personal benefit; I'm not making this public but I will show this to a few people- this is just a test for now to gain perspective and receive some feedback. :)
>Offense:  (E) +2 426
