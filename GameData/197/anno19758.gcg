>Noah: AGRSTUU 8H AUGUR +14 14
#note I would play GURU against most opponents, but I've learned to love an wide-open board against Roy Kamen.
>Roy_Kamen: IIIII -IIIII +0 0
#note Roy exchanged five.
>Noah: IINOSTT K7 T.ITIONS +66 80
#note Wasn't sure whether TUITIONS or INTROITS would give back more. Quackle thinks it's TUITIONS. Another reason to play INTROITS is to block the pesky AUGURS/Y hook. Still not sure between the two plays, there might be other factors here.
>Roy_Kamen: ?CEEQRU 11F QUERC.nE +68 68
>Noah: DDEIILW 13H DWI.ED +30 110
#note Wasn't really sure whether this or WINDED is better, just chose this because it doesn't matter much.
>Roy_Kamen: DEEKN H10 N.E.ED +27 95
#note Roy put down KNEEDS 14F first.
>Noah: AAIILPT 7B TILAPIA +63 173
>Roy_Kamen: IKNO 8A KINO +34 129
>Noah: EEORTWX F5 EX.O +29 202
#note Thought about playing OX, but then saw this. Was a bit afraid of what it opened for a minute but then realized it wasn't really a bad opening.
>Roy_Kamen: ACLP E2 CLAP +24 153
>Noah: DEEORTW L4 REWO.D +25 227
#note Seized the opportunity to control the board so well. This takes out the really annoying AUGUR-S(y) hook and makes the top of the board likely to close soon. The bottom left is still annoying but TWEEDS doesn't close as efficiently as REWORD does.
>Roy_Kamen: AGJR 4A JAGR. +42 195
>Noah: BEGMNRT 14F GR.ET. +22 249
#note I also thought about doing GRAB/BRAG (no other good plays here really). Though the BMN leave isn't stellar, and though my lead is dwindling, blocking the ED is still solid here.

>Roy_Kamen: ?AHILNO 15A eNHALO +30 323
#note Roy's actual rack. AZAN B1 looks fantastic here.
>Noah: IINSTUY C2 Y..I +8 335
#note The best thing I can find here (with Quackle's help) is YIN 10M, which wins half of the games, including the one with the E in the bag, which is good since he definitely didn't keep the E with eNHALO. This play is really horrible. I felt paralyzed here, and was not analyzing well at all.
>Roy_Kamen: EFINOSV A12 FIV. +13 336
#note Roy's best play is FON G3 or VINOS G1.
>Noah: BINSTU I7 S.B +20 355
#note I blew a tie here! I saw SUINT N6, but didn't realize it actually tied. I'm really happy with how I played all of this game, until the last two turns, which were horribly played.
