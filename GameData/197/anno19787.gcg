#note A very cool position here. Yes, JINX is 70 whopping points! But it gives so many points to Sal, which makes it far worse than its face value. I also have (OUTLAW)ING if I draw an I after this, and I am sure to score with the J most of the time after this. But it is kind of clunky and OUTLAWING isn't that important. Perhaps JINX is still the play. There is another scoring spot on top of (EX) after JINX, which evens out the score-allowing problematic of JINX. Given that I didn't realize that I was forking scoring spots with JINX, I think I made a mistake here.

#note if this was challenged off I still had STUNTMEN, so I felt like it was a risk worth taking. Besides, it could be good even though I thought it wasn't. I've obviously heard it used in speech before and Sal probably has too.

#note I played this xause even though it's a tad aggressive, Sal hitting something with DIGS isn't such a problem at this point, since I can counter with a bingo of my own: Something with DIGS opens an even better lane for me. I stand by this play, even though I could very well have played something like C2 (AWA)RD and kept things conservative. OUTLAWING is still a possibility after that, and OUTLAWS is also a possibility. I wanted to keep options open on this board, though, not just one. Probably not the right attitude.

#note here's the most important part of this game and yet I don't have my full rack! This might have been it, though. I don't even remember if this was the correct board orientation. All that I know is that I had no wins and I had to try and invent a scenario in which Sal thinks he is done for. That did indeed happen but he still pulled off the win since I couldn't execute whatt he feared given his mistracking and all. Anyways, tough loss this was.

>Joshua_Sokol: EEEKOOS 9L O.E +5 411
#note I felt it was necessary to draw the H, but instead I drew a vowel. I wanted to induce the most mistakes here given I had no win, and this seemed to do that, making Sal fear for his win. I knew he hadn't tracked correctly either, and his time was running out.
>Sal_Piro: ADHLNRU 13D HURL +17 433
#note He might have had the U here, but for sure he botched the endgame, just not enough to lose. This is -17 to DHURNA or LURDAN on row 15.
