#note I hate having two blanks at once. PERMEATE and PERMEASE shouldn't have been missed. EPHEMERA also plays on the triple, and GRAPHEME MEGAPODE MEGAPLEX PREGAMES are the other bingos.

>Bill: ??EEFIN 12A FE.. +12 195
#note This time I only saw REDEFINE and didn't think it was worth it. Missed BENEFIC, didn't know VENEFIC and ENFIERCE. Of course REDEFINE has to be worth it if I'm going to play for over 50 less. Vague idea of threatening a triple-triple but this is just misplayed.

#note I was low on time by this point, but I should've recognized how easily this gives up 30+ point overlaps. In an endgame that will probably come down to close-quarters scoring, I can't allow that. AVIZE is the play; I saw it but optimistically thought I'd be able to get a big score out of the Z later.
>Melissa: DEL 13M DEL +22 310
>Bill: FGITTVZ N7 F.Z +15 325
#note Chickened out on TIFT, which is essentially as good on bingo defense and keeps alive the hope of getting some value out of the Z.

#note Melissa and I both mistracked; I think she thought I had one vowel, whereas I thought she had EEY so I thought this was going to lose to EERY.
