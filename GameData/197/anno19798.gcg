>Juraj_Pivovarov: ADEFRY 8D FRAYED +34 34
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEIMSS E5 MIS.EADS +94 94
#note I actually saw SIDEARMS first, but allowed myself some extra time to look for any possible 2x2. The last time I opened with a 2x2 bingo on Juraj, I still lost by 85. Will I fare better this time?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DEINX D2 INDEX +39 73
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIMNPT 7E .AMP +27 121
#note D(A)P for only 12 points fares about as good as (S)AMP, but after my huge bingo I'd rather take the points and defense.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: JOTU 3C U.TO +8 81
#note While he didn't say for sure that he had the J here, he made it seem like he had intended it as a setup.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADINOT 4F DOATINg +69 190
#note There's a 9 through EM here! Sim likes DIATrON in the same spot, but I don't see what the advantage is.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AJT B1 TAJ +32 113
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEINS 1A A.E +9 199
#note I saw it, and ultimately chickened out because 58 points seemed like too little for a word I wasn't sure of. Of course, in hindsight I feel like a dumbass. 58 points is a lot for a rack this bad.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?EIOPST K4 .EPOTISm +86 199
#note He doesn't get this 2x2 if I play AGENESIA.
>Matthew_Larocque: AABEINS D10 BAA +21 220
#note Only one A left in the bag, does that make BAA a mistake? I'm not playing 2F BA, though, Quackle. That's silly. I'll wait until I have a play that cannot be overlapped before I use that spot.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EKRZ C12 ZERK +46 245
>Matthew_Larocque: EILNRRS 15A LI.ER +30 250
#note My win % is dropping very quickly thanks to A(T)E. I already had a bad feeling that I was destined to lose.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IQ J9 QI +28 273
>Matthew_Larocque: ABCENRS A1 .B +8 258
#note If 2F stays open,  I should have about a 50/50 chance to bingo next turn. I don't expect Juraj to play there unless he himself has a bingo, or something safe like GUV.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ELN L4 .LEN +11 284
#note Is he trying to open the board? He's ahead currently, so I wasn't sure. Maybe he just couldn't score with his letters.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEHNRS 2F RANCHES +78 336
#note 77% to win now.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ENORU 1K ROUEN +23 307
>Matthew_Larocque: FHIIOTU F10 HO +33 369
#note 1G HI? I didn't really think too much when I saw 33 points.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: V 10I V.. +6 313
>Matthew_Larocque: FGIITUU H1 I.I. +12 381
#note Here's where I really fumbled. For some reason, I was oblivious to the M column and thought the board was really hard to bingo on. So I thought, despite the garbage on my rack, that I could still outscore him. I was low on time as well, so I didn't weigh the options as much as I should have. A 4-ply sim at 2000 iterations suggests (E)TUI as the best play by far, setting up my F. The best exchanges keep either IT or F, but 1G TI and I(N)I(A) are slightly favored. I really thought keeping the Us was a big mistake here, though.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CL 13B C.L +11 324
>Matthew_Larocque: FGGTUUY N1 .GGY +18 399
#note Really bad time to miss (V)UGGY. Also, why don't I just exchange this and hope he draws some of it? I'm low on time, and combined with a super awkward rack, I should have known better than to try and play through. This wins like 12% less often than (V)UGGY. (m)UGG wins in the simulation though.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: W H7 ..W +8 332
>Matthew_Larocque: FLOTUUW O4 OF +12 411
#note I didn't want to empty the bag, and I wanted to prevent any possible play to the TWS. I can't remember if I had a reason to play OF instead of OW. This wins 95% of games - J6 OF wins 98%. I still should have exchanged before.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EGINOOR M6 GOONIER +70 402
#note "Wait, how did I not realise that he could bingo there?" was basically my reaction.
>Matthew_Larocque: ELTUUVW 8M .WL +18 429
#note N8 WET scores 19.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: T J4 .T +5 407
>Juraj_Pivovarov:  (ETUUV) +16 423
#note Yay I won! Oh wait, no I didn't because I went overtime because I thought my lead was big enough that it wouldn't matter. Good job managing that end sequence, Matt.
