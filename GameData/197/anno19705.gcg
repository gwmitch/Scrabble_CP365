>Jonathan_Lindh: DEFINNT 8D FINNED +28 28
#note Best play!
>Harriet: AACELU F4 LACU.AE +17 17
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEMOTTW E2 TEEM +22 50
#note My original choice D1 TOTEM for 24 points is best choice despite being risky. My choice doesn't even rank as one of the top plays.
>Harriet: AEIORTV D8 .AVORITE +80 97
#note This was a good natural bingo by Bill
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEGOSTW 11C C.W +16 66
#note I thought this play was brilliant but Quackle ranks it outside of the top 10. SCOW is good and I have the S.
>Harriet: DILL G1 DILL +9 106
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGINOST H8 .GESTION +80 146
#note Best play! I told you C11 COW was brilliant Quackle!
>Harriet: INPY D1 PINY +42 148
>Jonathan_Lindh: EJT 15A JET. +33 179
>Harriet: DILOP 1G .IPLOD +36 184
#note DIPLOID is good. DIPLOD*  is phony. I am idiot for not challenging this one.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABIOOQU 1A QUI. +45 224
#note Best play! C13 QAT I saw, but this has the best leave.
>Harriet: AEEIMNT 7I ETAMINE +65 249
#note 74 point L1 (D)EMENTIA and 67 point H9 (G)EMINATE both sim better than this one. It's very unsual for Bill to choose the worst bingo out of 3. I7 ETAMINE sets up the next comeback play...
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABDGOOS O4 BOD.GA +39 263
#note Best play! Balances the rack, closes the triple word, and scores 39 points in one swoop. Unfortunately...
>Harriet: UYZ 14B YU.Z +44 293
#note QAT earlier would have plugged this.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AABORSW 13A ABR. +26 289
#note I liked this but I6 WAB for 25 points is vastly better according to Quackle. This play is down on the list.
>Harriet: AH 12A HA +27 320
#note Grr, Bill smartly blocked SCOW with this. I had SORROWS on the next turn, which is what Bill would have felt had he not blocked my bingo.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?OORSSW M1 SOW +23 312
#note K2 WOOS would have cleared the W and the extra O and S without pluralizing a phony. Thankfully, Bill was not a douchebag and did not challenge off his own pluralized phony. Lucky for me because this play balances my rack.
>Harriet: EHKU K3 KEHU. +24 344
#note KEHUA* is phony and I held. It's good in Collins and I confused it with LEHUA which is good. Had I smartly challenged it off, I would have been able to play the 74 point double double ERASIONS, however with my rack, Bill is completely fucked for the game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ??EIORS 15H .OtaRIES +71 383
#note Best play! I told you Bill was completely fucked! I'm starting to outdraw Bill and it paying off.
>Harriet: AFO I11 OAF +23 367
#note Bill is even more fucked because I picked up the last S and the X, the two remaining power tiles left in the bag.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGNRSTX J9 NEXT +26 409
#note 4th best play. How did I miss J4 NEX(T) for 59 points? That was a very bad miss. I was just focused on closing this game out and not blowing like the RUDDIEST out bingo game against Steve.
>Harriet: AORRV M5 VA.R +7 374
#note Bill HAD to take my 2 of 3 outplays!
>Jonathan_Lindh: GRS 4J R.G +8 417
#note I was stupid and missed J10 (E)RGS for 5 points and out. My play was tied for 2nd best.
>Harriet: OR 14M OR +10 384
>Harriet:  (S) +2 386
#note Lost quite a bit of spread I shouldn't have and allowed two bad phonies, but when you draw all the blanks and S's, you're bound to win 99% of the time, even against Bill. 5 of 12 plays were best plays, and possible a 6th in JETE but I wasn't sure of my rack.
