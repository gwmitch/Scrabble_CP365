#note I really struggled to understand why he played this, and was quite afraid he held an X, but I didn't give him that much credit in the end.

#note IWIS looks nice too but I preferred closing down more lanes and letting him open something for me.
>Craig_Rowland: ENP 4A PE.N +18 200
>Joshua_Sokol: IINSSUW A1 WIS. +27 260
#note I considered this and UNWIS(ER) previously. I think UNWIS(ER) might be better come to think of it. That U really sucks and N is pretty dangerous right now.
>Craig_Rowland: ?CEHLNS N1 cLENCH..S +92 292
#note SCHLi(ER)EN was available! bLENCHERS is also a word. I held this for a long time and challenged. You never know and I had URINOSE anyway, so if it was good I was still OK.

#note held by me again
>Joshua_Sokol: AERTVVW 13H VAW +25 355
#note wasn't sure of what to do at all here, took a while and just went for the equity. Many things seem close.

#note This looks right. Any objections?
>Craig_Rowland: DILNNOT 5I TOD +18 377
#note K1 OLD(E)N. Why he played this really perplexed me throughout the rest of the endgame.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIP 6A PA.E +18 401
#note so much so that I retracked many times and looked over the board many times for a freak outplay. Finally gathered myself and just went ahead with the best play.
