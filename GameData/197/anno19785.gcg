>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAELNR H1 ALtERAN. +74 74
>Joe_Edley: ?EFLOST M2 FOLaTES +82 106
#note (L)OFTLESs 2H was missed and scores 4 more, but it doesn't look like it's 4 points better than this, if better at all.

>Joe_Edley: ACIOOTV E4 VOCATIO. +76 217
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEEKRY 3B KEYED +43 233
#note H11 (R)YKED is miles better. I saw it, but or some reason decided not to play it, perhaps since I didn't want to open more lines. But my leave is just so much better than his post-bingo rack most of the time.
>Joe_Edley: AO 4D A.O +26 243
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDGORS L11 DOBRA +29 262
#note UNDERLIED* is phony. I wasn't sure. Joe held, and then released, saying "I don't remember". 
>Joe_Edley: AORR 13J AR.OR +14 257
#note this was a bizarre play. Joe said he actually didn't hold an S, but that he hoped I would think he did and spend mine.
>Joshua_Sokol: GMNSSWZ D9 SW.NG +25 287
#note I couldn't do that unfortunately.
>Joe_Edley: EINVY 14F VEINY +40 297
>Joshua_Sokol: CEGMSTZ H13 Z.G +39 326
#note The moment of truth. Hoping he doesn't have anything huge along O. I think given the score and all this hope is necessary.
>Joe_Edley: BEIJRS O8 JIBERS +56 353
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIMNST 15K M.NIC +27 353
#note I have to score here. It looks like I should play ET(A)MIN though. I missed that possibility. It scores better and retains scoring tiles that work well with a lot of the pool and the board. This seems like a small mistake.
>Joe_Edley: ADENPUW 1A PAWNED +45 398
#note Joe said he chickened out of UNAWED here. This was indeed a small blunder he could afford most of the time, but a small blunder nonetheless.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMOOST F7 TIME. +27 380
>Joe_Edley: EGHPTUU 13B PU.H +20 418
>Joshua_Sokol: OOS 2B SO +24 404
#note OOPS. I was trying to win here, but I should have just gone with the best play. I missed OO(P)S and also missed Joe's out.
>Joe_Edley: EGTU B9 GETU. +10 428
>Joe_Edley:  (O) +2 430
#note Another great game against Edley though, where small to medium errors cost me dearly.
