>Jonathan_Lindh: ALOT H8 ALTO +8 8
>Harriet: DGIIORS I6 GIRO +12 12
#note I thought I missed a bingo, but no. Second best play. This was a shitty rack.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ANTX 11E TAX.N +24 32
>Harriet: DIIOPRS 10D DIP +24 36
#note 2nd best play! Quackle likes F10 POT better but I don't like 2 I leaves.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DGHLOUU 8G L..D +5 37
#note Steve is going for a bingo. I have an S so I'm taking his lane.
>Harriet: AAIMORS K4 ROAMS +20 56
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIMNRST G1 MINSTRE. +62 99
#note I blocked his lane, but he took the only doable bingo here. I say doable because E4 INTERMITS through the IT for 72 points and F6 EMI(G)R(A)NTS through the G and A for 68 points were 2 9 letter bingos and the only other playable bingos. Those would have been insane though.
>Harriet: AEINOUW 1G .IAOU +21 77
#note 3rd best choice! Clears off a lot junk. I didn't see G1 MIAOW for some reason and I didn't see H1 UNAI, the two better plays.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENOO 4D NOO.E +12 111
>Harriet: ABEEHNW 2J WHA +35 112
#note 4th best play. I saw the 59 point J2 WHEEN but I chickened out...AGAIN! I though it might be WHEAN*.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIOTW M2 TOWIE +26 137
>Harriet: BDEEFNS N6 FEND +29 141
#note 4th best play. N3 FEND is safer scores 2 more, and is something I never even saw.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEE O7 DEE +24 161
>Harriet: AABESSZ 5C ZAS +30 171
#note I don't care what Quackle says, this is BEST!
>Jonathan_Lindh: Q 2F Q. +31 192
>Harriet: AABELOS L4 ABLE +40 211
#note Best play! This may have been the deciding play of the play. Also my highest scoring play of the game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: GIJ 9C JIG +26 218
>Harriet: AHINOSY 6B YAH +34 245
#note Best play! Why don't I know the AYAH hook?
>Jonathan_Lindh: FU 6F F.U. +16 234
>Harriet: GINOSUY 12H SUING +22 267
#note Playing defensively. Both blanks are out and I think Steve has acquired at least one judging by the FRUG play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEINPRV K10 VI.E +14 248
#note Yeah, he definitely has one blank. But I have a blank too.
>Harriet: ?AORTUY 14K sTAY +19 286
#note OUTPRAY or GRAYOUT in the A column would have better a million times better than this junk, but I needed to block this lane if I wasn't bingo. I really need to get my 4's down because my knowledge SUCKS on them.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?CENPR A4 PRaNCE +45 293
#note Could be worse for me. sTAY should have been the death of me but I had 9 lives on October 30th.
>Harriet: BEKLORU 13M KOB +35 321
#note Scores 35 points and sets up the RULE/LURE outplay at B1.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEIRTV 12B CIVET +30 323
#note Steve's goose is cooked and he knew it. CIVET is the play here though.
>Harriet: ELRU B1 RULE +12 333
#note B10 LUCRE, which I didn't know, and B10 ULCER get 6 more than my play. I just wanted to get this one in the bag.
>Harriet:  (ER) +4 337
#note Mistakes were made, but none were fatal. This somewhat atones for the last 2 games against Steve, which were the RUDDIEST game and the AGNOSIA game.
