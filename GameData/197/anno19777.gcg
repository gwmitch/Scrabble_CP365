#note I played in the right spot, but not with enough letters. DOLER(I)T(I)C for 71.

#note THIS is a great example of what great board vision can mean. Sacrifice of 55 points for not finding the best play here. (common word).
>Dan: AGP 3A GAP +31 115
#note A tax for not finding the best play on the last turn.
>Steve: EHILORT A3 .OITER +24 187
#note A corollary to not having good board vision is tunnel vision. Not the easiest of bingo finds for a player at my level, but focusing on the A file for plays to the tws probably took out any chance I had of finding it. And there are other plays superior to this, which fish off HO in hopes of bingoing next turn (OH, HOD).

>Steve: BEHIJLO I9 JOB +43 230
#note JIB instead: there are five I's unseen against just two unseen O's. That's enough to improve winning chances three percent, from 71 to 74.

#note championship player likes dumping one tile and leaving one in the bag in hopes of a counter bingo, but our chances are slim nonetheless (12.5 percent). Suggested are (W)E at N2, and U(S) at A11.
