#note missed GONEF. GONEF definitely better.

#note AOR is very weak - much better to play AW at 7B for 9 less, but bingoing 34% instead of 14% (row 10)
>Orry: CELNOSS H2 ENCLOS..S +64 129
#note I saw that he had missed COLLINSES. unfortunately this did not prevent me from wrongly challenging
>JD: AGOORUZ -  +0 113

>JD: AHIORRT 3C HORA +32 145
>Orry: FOP 4B FOP +32 191
#note orry said that his leave on this turn was dreadful - something like UUIW
>JD: DGIJRST B8 ..JIG +29 174
>Orry: AGIO A12 AGIO +22 213
#note still keeping an awful leave
>JD: ADHORST 7C HO +22 196
#note the pool was extremely vowel-heavy, so fishing for something on column M looked pretty appealing even with ADRST. Q slightly prefers either HOT (M3) or HOD at 5D. HOD is probably my choice.

>JD: ?ENTUVX N9 EX +52 331
#note sick draw - I have a play that is definitely better than taking the 52 points - VEX at 12L sets up the case T and leaves orry in all kinds of trouble, whereas I could get burnt pretty badly with my play and wind up unable to play my blank for a few turns. they're reasonably close on a sim.

#note could fish for imperium, but I will block anyway

#note I got this one slightly wrong since I didn't see his out of CURDIER - should just play VALINE.
