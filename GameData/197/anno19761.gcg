>JD: ENRSTVW -NVW +0 0
#note could keep ENRST, but I was worried about being too consonant-heavy if he exchanged after the X2. Should've gone for it in retrospect, sim is even

>Carl: HILRW H1 WHIR. +36 153
>JD: DEHKNPZ 12H KEN.H +38 216
#note close between KENCH and PHIZ, ideally I would keep the Z for J10 but there seems to be no good way to do it. KENCH is worse on defense since it gives free points at H12. even sim
>Carl: AEW 7G AWE +27 180
>JD: DEFIPUZ H12 .UFI +33 249
#note missed FUZIL at L1 but keeping the Z is actually extremely strong, average score 5 points better after FUZIL and better defense. only 1 point back. still get to draw for ZONED
>Carl: INNY N2 NIN.Y +43 223
>JD: ABDEPVZ O1 ZED +44 293
#note first big mistake of the game, keeping the Z gives me so much more firepower - I looked for a play like ADVERB but didn't see it

#note after blocking both his outs, I was trying to keep WEEPIE to go out but 4 better to play ORE, his best play is HID at 2H anyway
