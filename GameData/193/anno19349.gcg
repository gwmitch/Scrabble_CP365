>Darrell_Day: AAEEORW H6 AWA +12 12
#note I wanted to see what Darrell was made of defensively here, which is why I chose this play over "better" options, but I should probably just play AWARE.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEENTTU 8G T.UTENED +60 60
#note And obviously my plan of giving as little as possible back to my opponent completely failed here. And by sacrificing 5 points and little board control, Darrell does the same as me, and yet I cannot respond.

#note Back in the game!
>Joshua_Sokol: NUY 6F YU.N +15 97
>Darrell_Day: AEHMNQV K7 H.AVEN +32 120
#note What do I infer from YUAN? Probably that he has a relatively strong leave and that I shouldn't open anything up. Even if he doesn't have anything though, I'm not in a positive position here. I think I should have played K2 V(E)NAE and this looks like pivotal mistake number one: blindly whoring equity despite Darrell's last play. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINRSU N5 URI.INES +63 160
#note Although Darrell was unable to take advantage of my board-opening play, his likely leave of EINS or ENSU or EIRS or ERSU will, in most scenarios, punish my last play.
>Darrell_Day: FKMMOOQ -FKMOOQ +0 120
#note I can't play through this...

>Darrell_Day: IIMOPT --  -32 120
#note I don't remember my last tile, I think it was another I. I thought this was good. Pivotal error number 2.

#note ugh
>Joshua_Sokol: CEM H1 EM.C +33 254
>Darrell_Day: ?IIOPTW 14J WIT +21 150
#note free points for Darrell, but it seems necessary to open the left side

>Joshua_Sokol: ACEJLO 15E CAJOLE +50 342
#note Was kinda surprised the last S wasn't a part of this play, but I understand the ideas behind QUARTS over QUART
>Darrell_Day: EELNOST M6 OL. +18 259
#note Well there go my winning chances, I thought this was a clever way to score and leave O1 as a bingo lane but I forgot I was forming HILI... Strike three and I'm out.

#note Challenged.

>Darrell_Day:  (AAFSTVZ) +44 361
#note Darrell said he lost around 44 points by challenging. It was 52. But I struck out already so it doesn't matter!
