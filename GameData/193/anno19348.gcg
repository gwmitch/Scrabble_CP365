#note I missed D8 CREAT(I)N(E), which is probably worth it here. The problem is that there are so many As and Es left, I have to be careful about keeping too many. It doesn't seem like any of the plays in the D lane, otherwise, are worth playing. I didn't think Nigel had S? here, so I figured I could race for one of those, or I might induce a small blocking play. Even if he does have an S, he may opt to play down from S(CAT) for not many points, or open up the board by playing a word ending in S. The odds of him bingoing with an S just aren't that good here, so it's a good shot to get myself back in the game. That said, I think CREAT(I)N(E) may keep me close enough - I just missed it.

#note 4C ZEE seems so obvious in hindsight. The 6 points I get now aren't worth leaving C3 open.

#note I should just go out here. Not sure why I didn't - mustive been low on time or something and missed Z(A).

#note Nigel went over by a minute, and so the final score was recorded as 415-386. At the time, I'd felt I'd played this game really well, but now after going over it I feel like I dropped the ball a bit. I got too desparate too soon, and played too quickly as a result, and was bailed out by some friendly tiles. Maybe morning four was destined to be the bad morning? Hmm....
