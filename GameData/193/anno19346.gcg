#note AUF# on the right side is better. AIMT leave is too strong to pass up.

#note AT(EMO)YA is a very cool play that I missed.

#note Sim recommends I make a higher-scoring play that digs more for the blanks. EALE# 5E and ANILE 5D both look nice.
>Joel_Wapnick: ?ADHIRT 3A AIRTHeD +85 290
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEILNU 2J .UALIA +30 210
#note Scoring, keeping a balanced leave, making a desperate triple-triple opening and hoping to cash in.
>Joel_Wapnick: DHJ O1 H.DJ +69 359
>Evans_Clinchy: CEILMNU B2 L.NUM +26 236
#note At this point I figured the chances of Joel letting me have the triple-triple were precisely zero, so I might as well take the spot myself. Sadly I missed a lot of better ways to do so. ACUMEN looks best.

>Evans_Clinchy: CEEIOSX B8 OX +29 265
#note Maybe EXO# 9H for the more balanced leave? At this point I just need to salvage spread. Winning this game and playing for second place in the final round isn't gonna happen, but I might need the spread points to have a shot at fourth or fifth.
>Joel_Wapnick: KLNP 4H PL.NK +28 495
>Evans_Clinchy: CEEIORS C9 OE +14 279
#note SOIREE 8J looks best. SQUIRESS#! That's a cool hook.
>Joel_Wapnick: TT 9E T.T +13 508
>Evans_Clinchy: CEIORSY L4 .Y +9 288
#note Setting up a spot for ORACIES#. Worth a shot, I guess.
