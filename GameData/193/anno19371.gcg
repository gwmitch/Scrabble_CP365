#note dang!  (E)ARLDOmS!  he would have bingoed back afer that. he wasn't sure of trolands but decided not to challenge.  bummer.  If I had played earldoms and gotten the same tiles I drew on the next turn, I would have had to know toluidin, the anagram of dilution.  i'm usually good with anagrams but not that one.  And i'd have to be able to see unsolid, overlapping 2 words down n7.  I just couldn't stop his momentum.
