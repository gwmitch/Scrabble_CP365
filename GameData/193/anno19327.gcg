#note Didn't realize that while giving up more bingos, 15F plays make it much harder for him to block (WOOD)Y. That said, I missed SYCEE and SYCE. This is not a bad play. Held and released.
>Andy_Hoang: AEINRTT E14 .T +2 315

#note ...But this got the challenge!. He has some bingos here.
>Kevin_Bowerman: DHINOTY J13 OH. +34 472
#note Best is things that block his bingos, but I saw that he did not see them, as he held for several minutes before challenging. Obviously, I should still block, but I didn't really look to see TAN(G)LIER
