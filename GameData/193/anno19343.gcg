#note Something very interesting happened on this turn. She laid down HARK, her intended play, at 8G, but accidentially laid it down backwards. I immediately put her on hold, because I remember reading in Joel Wapnick's 'How to Play Like a Champion' book that such plays were supposed to be counted as invalid. I, as an asshole over the Scrabble board, hit the challenge button and then called director (Joey), but Joey wasn't around, so Heather and I waited for around 8-10 minutes. When Joey got in the room, we asked him, and after 'researching' the rule and then asking someone on Facebook, he ultimately decided that I could challenge off this play (and win if KRAH is bad, it obviously is). Cynthia Seales, who was sitting next to me, stopped the clock in her game and walked across the room to Joey, because she's a director (I think) and she was pissed at the ruling since she'd never heard of such a thing before. (Even before Joey came in the room, she sort of blatantly told me that I was wrong). I don't know how Cynthia and Joey's discussion went, but she came back and still wasn't happy. 
This was Alpharetta. Two weeks later, she came up to me in the Metairie tournament and said that she had investigated it further on her own and said that no such rule had ever existed, despite me having read it clearly in a book, so I didn't know what to say. I just said 'thank you so much for looking at this in your own time' or something like that.
Alas, I'm confused. What IS the correct ruling?

#note Unfortunately for Heather I wound up bagging her anyway, so it didn't matter.

#note Don't ask why I didn't play SEIGNORY... well if you do, I'll say, because I chickened out of it! I'll note though that I passed up the 7's for 75 and 77 since a) cheap points b) she might not know the hook and I can use it later after clogging up the rest of the board.
>Heather_Steffy: CIIV D9 CIVI. +20 77
#note Glad to see this play
>Siddharth_Murali: EIIMNRZ M11 .IZEN +36 248
#note MAIZE holds 10 points of addtional equity, but it's probably not worth playing here! I missed MEDII though, which looks a bit stronger than this.
>Heather_Steffy: ET 15M .ET +9 86
>Siddharth_Murali: BEEIMRY 14M .YE +24 272
#note This looks good, keeping things tight and holding scoring tiles. Passed up BEY because of -ST bingos (again, she might not know SIDEWARDS) and also to keep a better scoring leave. IMBRUE doesn't seem like a feasible option.
>Heather_Steffy: DEM F6 ME.D +13 99
>Siddharth_Murali: BEIMRST N5 TIMBERS +78 350
#note Of course I could always draw ST and bingo. Q says TIMBRES is a full 5 points on D.

>Siddharth_Murali: AGLNOOP H1 GO.P +30 412
#note I thought this was a good time to go back on the offensive, since the win is secured, but still, I should definitely play LOP here. If neither of us bingo, I still gain a lot of spread!
>Heather_Steffy: ?Q 2J Qi +62 248

#note ABOON for just 4 more is apparently double this play's raw equity.

#note She said that I blocked TRENDIL(Y) here.
>Siddharth_Murali: ACHOTUU 5I CUTOU. +16 508
#note This is best, as I have 3 juicy spots for my H as well as one of them to potentially go out.
