#note FY# is definitely better, don't know what I was thinking.

#note Quackle comes up with a cool alternative here - SHH J8 is a really strong defensive play that I didn't think of. My play isn't very good. Doesn't score enough to be worthwhile.

#note Just TUI is obvious, and indeed it sims best. But I'm not sure if it's right against a human when you're losing and would like to bingo. This opens line 5 and thus gives me a better chance at seizing control of the game, I think.

#note Yup, this appears best. Points and turnover are the objectives here, especially with the blanks still unseen.

#note BALLIUM#! I had no idea that hook was a thing. I saw TURBOND# but didn't know I could play it for 81.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?DEEPUW F4 W.PE +15 272
#note I couldn't find anything worth playing here that didn't give back a monster bingo possibility, so I just shrugged and chose this. It's a tiny bit blocky. There's probably something better. Maybe WE D14?

#note Figured I'd take one shot at EXCAVATE to run up some spread. I can afford to waste one turn at this score...

>Evans_Clinchy: ACEOTVX L2 COXA +29 385
#note All right, the game's starting to get close again after the Q play. Time to block - this restricts any potential play with the ZEA# hook, so I'm back in control now.
