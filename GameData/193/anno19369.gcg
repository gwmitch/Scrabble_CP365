#note I need to not lose by 107, so his opening play works in my favour. I've got two esses, so the odds that he cannot hit him are pretty good, and if I mange to hook VUGG, I'm in great shape for a tight board.
>Samuel_Sussman: BOOYZ 11D BOOZY +51 67
#note This is so ridiculously improbable.

#note This makes a bingo anywhere but hooking DAK difficult.

>Winter: AAEIJLT 6J J..E +27 260
#note If he has an ess too hook a bingo, I want to force him to give me back a play.,
>Samuel_Sussman: ADRW 13G WARD +23 245
>Winter: AAILSTU N2 TAILS +28 288
#note Saw TALUS but not 100%, which makes this my weakest play of the game thus far.
>Samuel_Sussman: ILP M1 LIP +20 265
>Winter: ?AEHIIU J13 .UI +6 294
#note With the blank, I decide that balancing my rack to try and bingo back in case he does favours me.
>Samuel_Sussman: ACELN 15J .NLACE +27 292
#note Ruh roh--I've let him get too close!!!
>Winter: ?ABEHIP 1I PIBA. +10 304
#note Quackle doesn't penality me that much, but I question whether I should have gambled on drawing into a bingo here. I figured since Sam had opened up a spot with that E, and I had the blank, I might as well try to bingo in case he didn't becase, blocking that E wasn;t going to score, and I was only up by 2.
>Samuel_Sussman: ENOR 2J NOR..E +18 310
#note Ouch.
>Winter: ?AEHIUW O1 H.W +35 339
#note Leave could kill me, but obwiously I need the points.
>Samuel_Sussman: AEELMTX O10 TAXEM. +23 333
#note Wasn't completely sure of this, but had to let it go.
>Winter: ?AACEIU 5N .A +2 341
#note According to Quackle, this was an easy endgame, but on the ground, it did not seem that easy to me. Fortunately a had a lot of time, and I finally decided that taking out the 14 points Sam gets from (HEW)N was my best option.

Quackle likes it, but what else am I missing?
