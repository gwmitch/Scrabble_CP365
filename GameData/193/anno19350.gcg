#note lol my phone went off at this point and i scrambled to turn it off and josh said "that's ok.. i have an easy rack".. :P.. i'm basically about to go 2-5 for the day here. 

Josh: I'm gonna use Cesar's metric this game so that we're on the same page!
STEARIN sims within a point of this, which makes sense since I can't really defend against STAINERS being a threat as well as STEARINE/STEARINS, despite the immediate benefits for Cesar. I think STAINER is less of a variant play though.
>cesar: ABCCLNP D9 .CALP +18 36
#note -0.5 CAB.. close enough, whatever.
>sokol: ADEFSUW C11 FEUD +31 105
#note Cesar: oh right

Josh: This was an abnormally aggressive play by me, but SCALP infers a lack of an S and this has great board control benefits if it works out in my favor. Normally I would play FEU here.
>cesar: BCLNRRS -BCLNR +0 36
#note i was so frustrated at this point. at nationals it actually felt like i drew lots and lots of consonants and was about to be 10-11...  so against my better judgment, i didn't keep the C, too. I even told myself "come on cesar, you're not gonna draw lots of consonants again" (-1)
>sokol: ABGNOSW 10D .OB +29 134
#note -1 to 10G BOW. I missed it. It's a great idea to maximize the value of my S here with BOW
>cesar: ADEIORS K3 ROADIES +74 110
#note well that was lucky

Josh: as lucky as AEINRST as a first rack?
>sokol: AGGNSUW 7H WAG.NG +26 160
#note I thought 4G WAGG(O)N was better than WAG(O)N, that 3J W(R)UNG had a deceptive lack of long-term defense, and that J2 WAG was way too aggressive. Maybe WAG is right, but Quackle agrees with my play. 
>cesar: ABDENOO E9 ..NDO +33 143
>sokol: IIIINSU -IIII +0 160
#note Cesar came close to figuring out what I had exchanged. It said IIII but in fact is was UIII and I kept INS
>cesar: AABEORR 6I RA. +17 160
#note significant mistake, ABEOR is a worse leave than AR... BORAGE is the clear play here. i like quackling without looking at what i played, and i was asking myself "what else would i play besides borage, because i don't remember playing that" ... but i was in a down mood because of my record. can't let it affect me. (-6)

#note dat draw tho
>sokol: GHINNOS 15A NOSHING +104 302
#note eek

Josh: lol hello best possible draw
>cesar: AKMOSTU D2 KOM.U +26 264
#note (-4.5) to SMOKE, which i probably completely missed. seem right even though it's the case S, there's two blanks to draw and it gets me pretty close! (-4.5)

#note mutter mutter

Josh: blanked. BLANKED. This happened almost every game! -100
>cesar: ?IMOTTW M2 TWO +22 322
#note WOT at M3 still sims best, even though he'll probably see securely, because of cerulean, but i just plonked two down anyway

Josh

#note Josh: CERULEAN dude... I was not capable of thinking straight here. -40
>cesar: ?AEEIMT A8 MIsEATE. +80 402
>sokol: ?CENRYZ 3F CZ.R +26 372
#note C....ZAR...... -7 to Z(A) cause I can draw into (G)LYCERIN a lot and sometimes ARDENCY at 14G
>cesar: EEIIRTV 1F VI.IT +8 410
#note i wonder what is right here. this was a tough move. i think i laid down restive and picked it up (not sure though) and then actually CHICKENED OUT on visiter.  VISIT gives him another turn to fish. i just didn't want to empty the bag but realistically i'm still reasonably likely to win because i'm far enough ahead to outrun most out in 2s, i think. the problem is that i couldn't find a 6-letter word that didn't open more lanes (like RIEVER). in the end i believe VISITER is right because of the point difference. VISIT is definitely wrong but i don't know words... about a 28% win mistake
>sokol: ?EELNUY J9 .YE +14 386
#note It was so hard to choose a play here. (G)EY or (G)UY were also things I finally considered. I had also mistracked. I have to hope he drew the Q. RYE was bad cause I didn't know there was an H in the pool. In the end I think I should play GUY. Same sort of mistake as Cesar made last turn, like -28%
>cesar: EEHIQRY K11 HEY +28 438
#note i played this pretty quickly but was secretly worried i was missing something through the g
>sokol: ?AEILNU 2M .A +4 390
#note I went like 6 minutes over looking for stuff... I was just so distraught here and people were being loud and it was lunchtime and ugh ugh ugh why did I choke another game
