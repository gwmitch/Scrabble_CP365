>Jim_Burlant: EEEIINO -EEIIO +0 0
#note Quackle prefers that I keep an I as well, leaving myself EIN.  I'd rather have another crack at one of those blanks and not leave myself as vulnerable to a vowel overload.
>Kevin_Schutz: GIMNOO 8D MOOING +24 24
>Jim_Burlant: EFINPRV E6 PR.VEN +22 22
#note G7 FIVE wins the sim.  The nex 4 options (F7 FOP, E6 PROVEN, G7 FIVER, 9E RIF) all sim interchangeably with each other with a valuation loss in the neighborhood of 2.5 points.
>Kevin_Schutz: IX 7G XI +36 60
>Jim_Burlant: AAFILOR F10 FOAL +30 52
#note Obviously an F10 play was the right call here.  FOLIA F10 wins the sim with this choice coming in second, but I'm surprised this takes as much of a hit as it does.  Can someone please tell me why this is a 7-point dog to FOLIA?  I can understand taking a 2 or 3-point hit...but 7?
>Kevin_Schutz: OY D11 OY +13 73
>Jim_Burlant: AADEIOR 6D A.O +7 59
#note Obviously a fishing situation. Quackle prefers 7C OAR, with this choice duking it out with G6 IXIA and F5 AI for 2nd place.   Haviing played Kevin many times I felt that if I fished I needed to ensure openness, as he is very quick to tighten the board up.
>Kevin_Schutz: ?DEEKNS 5F SNEaKED +74 147
#note Quackle prefers 14F plays to this, but not by a huge margin:  despite sacrificing 9 points on the scoreboard he only loses 3 equity points for this choice.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIRUV H1 DRIV. +39 98
#note Yuck - this would have only been a good draw had he hung the N or a T.  While any number of H1 plays score well,  (this choice sims second to DEAVE, which I didn't know), the problem with this position is that none of them let me unload the U.  Now I have to hope I don't draw a W or a  Y, as the last thing I need now is to have to grind through toxic rack-killing combinations.   I've fallen from 40% to 15% winning chances.  
>Kevin_Schutz: AMO C11 MOA +21 168
>Jim_Burlant: AEGNUUY L3 UN.Y +16 114
#note Too bad I didn't think of GAUDY, which should have been my choice.  GAUDY sims a credible 3rd to GUYED L1, which I didn't know.  
>Kevin_Schutz: ABC B12 CAB +24 192
>Jim_Burlant: AEGTTUW M1 GUT +12 126
#note Anything is as good as anything else here.  More points are available with 3F TWIG and J2 GAWK, but I'm not going to get very far keeping the U.  J2 WAUK scores 7 more, but with 4 T's still unseen I better unload one.  Quackle prefers 3F TWIG, but I need to keep as many lines alive as I possibly can and open new ones while I'm at it.  3F TWIG seriously impedes row 2, which is one of the 3 most promising bingo lines on this board since I don't have an S.  This choice sims w/in 2 equity points of TWIG, the sim winner.
>Kevin_Schutz: AG A14 AG +13 205
>Jim_Burlant: AEELPTW 6L .EW +17 143
#note Though this choice sims as one of the top 2 or 3 choices, N2 PEW is much better.  Don't know why I didn't see that.  N2 PEW sims at 16% winning chances, btw, with this choice simming at 13%.
>Kevin_Schutz: ILLST O6 STILL +25 230
>Jim_Burlant: AELPRTU 5C UP +8 151
#note After getting past my annoyance at having drawn my 3rd U in 5 turns, I spent several minutes looking for "UP" words I couldn't find.  Didn't occur to me to look for "PRE" words, so I wound up missing 1D PREADULT 64.  In the absence of finding the bingo I thought I should open another line so I could hook my T.  PREADULT sims around 23% winning chances.  
>Kevin_Schutz: EET N2 TEE +13 243
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHLRT B2 LATHER +30 181
#note Once again - gotta know the bingo to play it.  TREHALA sims in the neighborhood of 25% winning chances, with this play coming in at not quite 5%.  
>Kevin_Schutz: EJT A1 JET +34 277
>Jim_Burlant: ACEFIIO A6 FOCI +34 215
#note Best play, coming in at 2.4% winning chances.
>Kevin_Schutz: EINORRT 12F .NTERIOR +68 345
#note So much for having any chance.,
>Jim_Burlant: ADDEISS 13K DIES +19 234
#note Ostensibly I have 6% winning chances with 14E ASIDE.  If I had thought of that one, it would have only thrown gasoline on the fire 2 turns later.
>Kevin_Schutz: ?EIQRWZ O1 WE +18 363
>Jim_Burlant: AAADIQS K10 QA.. +28 262
>Kevin_Schutz: ?EIRZ H10 ZI.hER +42 405
#note Given how this game has gone...just about right.  And adding insult to injury...scored as 45.
