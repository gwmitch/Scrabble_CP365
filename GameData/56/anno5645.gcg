#note -2. BEAR is a better leave, and i knew this, but i have a small aversion to Bs. BEAR is a better leave though, again.

#note -7.5. FEY at C1 sims considerably better. i am actually pretty surprised about this. i know it's more open and that quackle would like it a little more, but i dont really want to do that. i'm surprised at how much worse my FEY is. i don't know if i should even consider this to be a mistake, to be frank.

#note i do not know what to make of that last move, and it seems like a good time to start freaking out, but i figured he could air-ball whatever strong leave he had. i can't remember right now what he had but it was a good leave. if mike gets back to me i can update this with his racks. C9 FILLET sims considerably better, but i feel it is not right after FEW. and i didn't think of FILET or FLITE! ? -7

#note this is the typical kamikaze play. a lot of things sim near each other, so i don't know what to play here, but i just didn't like anything else. for what it's worth, this does sim highest, but mike thought it was pretty risky since i didn't have the E. do you guys think i'm insane? second choice is 3A MOZO or J3 LIMO.

#note i started running into time trouble around here. i couldn't decide whether i was making up PICAL .. i wasn't. -3.5

#note was trying to play fast now because i thought i'd need it for the endgame. i think i had about 7 minutes left. i can be pretty slow. yay! quackle likes it.

#note not much time now. i don't understand why i didn't play STALAG. there are no Os unseen, but i think i hadn't tracked PENGO yet! i was getting pretty low on time now and i freaked out a little... pretty bad mistake. i spent too much time trying to find something on column M but even GALAH is fine. at least i knew quackle would hate this :) - 14
