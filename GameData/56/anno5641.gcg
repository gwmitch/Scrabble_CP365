#note Phoenix Presidents' Day tournament 2010, Round 11.
>Gary_Smart: AEPRT I5 PAT.ER +19 19
>Jim_Burlant: GIKMNRV 6H M.KING +23 55
#note Saw J4 VIM and 6F KIVA (quackle's first 2 choices) and rejected them because I felt they didn't turn enough of the rack.  Regardless of what Quackle says, I  prefer this choice.    Incorrectly scored as 24.
>Gary_Smart: HO 5K HO +22 41
>Jim_Burlant: CENNRVY L4 C..EY +28 83
#note I had been planning to play VINERY K5, but his play of HO killed that, causing me to brain-lock.  This is the first of a number of key mistakes that I made in this game.  ENVY 4L is clearly best, but I inexplicably missed it.  It took a couple of minutes for me to even find this, and I didn't see CONVEY in the same spot.   CONVEY not nearly as good as ENVY due to the leave (NNR), but it's still better than this.   While this play scores 28, it's still a very poor play due to the NNRV leave.
>Gary_Smart: INO 8L .ONI +21 62
>Jim_Burlant: ?NNRSVW -NVW +0 83
#note My second critical mistake.  While a good draw could have bailed me out, you can't put yourself in position to rely on that happening unless you don't have a choice.  The NNRV leave on the previous turn left me vulnerable to a consonant overload, and while I drew WS? (no complaints about the S?, that's for sure) this was the result.  Of course, GROWN M6 is a lot better than this, but I didn't see it.  The only thing I did see was OWN M8, as I was too fixated on keeping the R and getting rid of both the V and the W, which I couldn't do.    All I saw was OWN M8, and I didn't feel the 9 points were worth the NRSV? leave.

>Gary_Smart: EEINQU H10 EQUINE +50 112
>Jim_Burlant: ?INRRSU 15A ReINSUR. +74 157
#note While I got the bingo down, this play shows the cost of having exchanged on the previous turn.  Had I allowed myself to see (G)R(O)WN, the IUR draw to NSV? would have resulted in UNIVeRS(E) for 92, and I would now be up 192 - 112 instead of 157 - 112.   Additionally, UNIVeRSE would make the bingo lines down columns A - D much less lucrative than this play.  A game-changing difference.
>Gary_Smart: ILO D12 LOI. +8 120
>Jim_Burlant: AABEHIP E10 HEAP +24 181
#note Wasn't thrilled with shedding the E but felt I had to turn this rack.  The plays of BAH or PAH C11 left me with 3 vowels.  Considering that (a) I had spent 3 or 4 straight racks overloaded with consonants, (b) the tile pool has lots of vowels in it, and (c) he's probably getting ready to bingo on the next turn, I didn't want to be vowel-overloaded.  The ABEI and AEIP leaves could have led to this with the wrong draw.    Quackle prefers C11 BAH or PAH, but not by much.
>Gary_Smart: ADEELRS J9 DEALERS +70 190
#note Incorrectly scored as 71.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AABBII 12J .ABIA +14 195
#note Quackle prefers K11 BI by a hair; I prefer not to be stuck with duplicated vowels if I don't have to.  This choice comes in 3rd.  
>Gary_Smart: ENW K11 W.NE +28 218
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCIOTY 9M YO +20 215
#note I suspected there was something in this rack but the 24000-probability BIOTYp(I)C was way  beyond my skill set.  I spent a lot of time on this turn and was less than thrilled that this was all I could come up with.  This was a mediocre play at best; I think the best of the non-bingo options is 15J (S)YBO. Quackle also likes 10B BOTHY, but I don't; why would I make it harder for myself to bingo if I'm sitting on the blank?
>Gary_Smart: OTU F6 TO.U +9 227
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCEIST A8 BISECTo. +92 307
#note While Quackle says my winning chances are now > 90%, I told myself I wasn't out of the woods yet given my post-bingo rack, the tile pool, and his previous play which told me he was potentially onto something.  
>Gary_Smart: OW 10N WO +27 254
>Jim_Burlant: AAADJNO D7 ANOA +10 317
#note Another critical position.  I spent minutes trying to figure out what to do here.  I obviously needed something to block the obvious bingo lines down columns B, C, D, and E and couldn't do that with anyting better than DOA(T) 6C, which I thought would still leave me vulnerable with the AAJN leave.  So now what?  Quackle prefers M11 JIAO (one of the power words I always forget to look for) and 4J JA(C)ANA (which I'd studied, but forgotten).  I felt that it might behoove me to clear out the vowel overload so I could get ready for the end game.
>Gary_Smart: ADEERST C3 DERATES +78 332
>Jim_Burlant: ADJLTUV O12 LAUD +27 344
#note Options here are not good...but this was a poor choice; I was hoping he didn't thread the needle and draw both the X and the I, but I  panicked and felt I needed the points.   Though counterintuitive, among Quackle's suggestions, VELD 4B looks best, setting up JUT F2 35 on the next turn.  I just was too fixated on the O column triple to think the end game through properly.

#note JOT D2 followed by G(I)V(EN) 13G followed by L(I)M(O) O7 loses by 8, but I didn't find this.
