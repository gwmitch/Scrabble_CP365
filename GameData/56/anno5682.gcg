#note Noah: n(ON)pARITY and hYdRATI(ON) are cool. TRAY definitely looks better here, don't know why I didn't think of it.
>Cesar: BFIOSTU 8A FOU +20 93
#note Cesar: D12 BOUT is the highest simmer. i suppose i do make plays like that sometimes. maybe i should do it all the time. next is D11 OBI which i didn't think of. this seems to me like a bit of a stylistic choice, though. -6
>Sodium_Hydroxide: EFGIJNV 12D V.ING +28 130
#note Noah: This is truly an awful play. I somehow missed JIVEY, JIVY, and JIVE!!!!
>Cesar: ABINSTT 7C BA.T +17 110
#note this is such a bad miss, but at least i found it before quackle by staring at my racks at the end of the game. the problem is that i'd had this exact rack recently on an ISC game and there was an O, and i looked it up or found it, and i couldn't remember whether there was a bingo there or not, and i leaned towards no. mark s was making fun of me for moping about missing this :) it really could have helped. boo cesar. -28
>Sodium_Hydroxide: DEEEFJU F2 JEFE +31 161
>Cesar: HINOSTY 3C HON.Y +30 140
#note Cesar:-0.4, 7H HOY. OH DEAR GOD I LOST 0.4 EQUITY POINTS.
>Sodium_Hydroxide: DEHIRUW 4A WHID +41 202
#note Cesar: this isn't good, i fall behind a little more every turn. loan me some skills, noah!
>Cesar: EGIMSTX 2A MIG +19 159
#note Cesar: zar tries to get creative. yay, quackle likes! this is my Nigellian play. 
>Sodium_Hydroxide: CEKNORU H12 .UNK +27 229
#note Inexplicably missed GUCK here.
>Cesar: EELOSTX 1A EX +48 207

#note Cesar: ugh.. now now
>Cesar: ACERTTZ O1 RAZE. +48 331
#note 10B ZETA looks great. this really was a critical move. i spent a while on this rack, but i could not come up with anything besides RAZED; but it's critical to balance racks in what is sure to be a close endgame. but even if i see ZETA i don't know if i'd play it. funnily enough, RAZED blocked a triple-triple, so if i'd superfocused and found ZETA i probably woulda had to walk out of the room. -7.5
>Sodium_Hydroxide: AAEILMS H1 MASE. +36 354
#note Noah: Too point focused, I guess. A(L)/A(WEE) is probably better. 
>Cesar: CEILQTT K1 QI +15 346
#note Cesar: i think a 2-ply sim is misleading here, so im doing a 4-ply sim for this one up to 10000 iterations: L4 L(O)TIC, 11I TELIC, Exch QT and then my play. TELIC seems reasonable to me, i'm too scared to do anything else. what's right here? Anyone agree with LOTIC? -7
>Sodium_Hydroxide: ADEIILU M1 ALIU.DE +18 372
#note Quackle prefers DULIA. I guess there's no reason not to play it.
>Cesar: CELLTTV 11I TELL +15 361
#note Cesar: yurkgh. it seems so essential to keep my E that quackle is willing to sacrifice points with 7L CELT and 7L TELL. it seems to me that i'd need a miracle bingo in any case, so the 6 more points that 11I TELL scores won't make a difference, so i might as well maximize my bingo chance, right? -8%
>Sodium_Hydroxide: DINORRS C11 RINDS +25 397
>Sodium_Hydroxide: DINORRS --  -25 372
#note Cesar: ! Noah: Well, now I know VYING doesn't take a front hook. lol. D(U)R(E) looks like a fine play here.
>Cesar: CGOPSTV L10 G.OP +14 375
#note Cesar: nfori have no idea what is right here. with partial knowledge of RINDS every time i hit "ask championship player" it comes up with a different set of choices. 10A OPT seems to be ok though and 7L VET. -4% .... 10A OPT wins 5.56% of the time. i don't see how. it turns out i drew AI, so if noah somehow goes blind i can go out with CAVINGS. what actually wins 5% of the time?
>Sodium_Hydroxide: DINORRS 13H .NRI.S +18 390
>Cesar: ACISTV 7I S.AV. +18 393
#note Cesar: i'm just blind to the 10A spots. VISTA there. -7
