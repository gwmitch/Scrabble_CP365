#note B6 FI(L)IBEG 27 accomplishes exactly what I was trying to do with IF, uses more tiles doing so and cleans up my rack - definitely a better play.

#note This was a huge WTF moment...I was expecting VEE from him for sure.
>Jesse: AENORTT 13I TO +7 428
#note My long shot decision was to go for any number of 7s that show up by drawing a number of things that aren't AE or EE. If I draw the W, no biggie, I can at least score with it in an endgame without any other counters.
