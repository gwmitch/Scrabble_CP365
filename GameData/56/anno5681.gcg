#note With inference, Quack likes 14I AUGITE/AGUE.  But then if I don't draw an S, I'd be boned.  H1 DAUT(I)E is interesting; he can either bingo with REALIZER in a very dangerous spot, or play ZER(O), killing his new bingo lines.
>Noah_W.: ?EEIRRZ F2 ZER. +33 127
>E._Tran: AEINTTU 10J .UT +5 233
#note H1 AUNT(I)E is the play here.
>Noah_W.: ?EFIIKR 3C FIR.lIKE +88 215
#note Phoney.  But I've got a good counter and wanted to make sure I keep the lead.

>E._Tran: ALLNORS L3 LORAN +12 317
#note Helps kill both lanes.  Didn't know LLANO.

>E._Tran: ABEILOS L12 BO +18 335
#note Sim likes scoring with AL(I)B(I) here.  Also prefers BOA/BIO/BOIL, but I was too paranoid to play them.

#note I didn't mind the vowel heavy leave given the pool.  Champ player likes 1L BI(S)E.
