#note 8G ZED is best.  Not sure why I made this play, this should have been a no-brainer.

>Jim_Burlant: DEEIORT 7C OE +5 69
#note Quackle doesn't like the fish here, preferring H1 REEDIT(ED).  As far as small rack dumps go, 6H TOE is second best.
>Ed_Saunders: APRT 6G TRAP +30 64
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIRTU B1 REAUDIT +73 142
#note This needs that little asterisk after it.  This was an honest mistake - I confused it with the legitimate PREAUDIT.  The play was not even held, and it certainly leaves the legitimate choices in the dust.  If I had played this straight, 5I DUI would have been the best choice, simming at 59 - 60% winning chances.  This play sims at 74.  And, in what is becoming a familiar refrain, look how I'm rewarded on the next turn.

#note Quackle prefers the 5I placement; I don't think it's worth the extra risk of slotting the 3x3 for only 3 more points, given that there's a blank still unseen. 
>Ed_Saunders: INOQ 4A Q.OIN +48 145
#note Right after he hit his clock, Ed realized he'd missed QI J10.
>Jim_Burlant: AIILMRW J10 MI +22 238
#note Best.
>Ed_Saunders: DEEEGNR 10B RENEGED +98 243
#note Beautiful play.  Ed is back in the game.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIKLRW 8J W.LKER +42 280
#note Best play here is 8K AWAKE...pretty ironic because I'm not awake if I missed AWAKE.  This choice comes in 5th, at a pretty hefty loss of valuation.  
>Ed_Saunders: JLLO C9 J.LLO +40 283
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIOSV L12 OVA +18 298
#note Risky play, but didn't know the first choice and couldn't see anything else. This winds up simming 4th-best, though at quite a disadvantage to H10 DAVIES, the clear winner.
>Ed_Saunders: CSV 14K V.CS +18 301
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIRSS F2 CIS +26 324
#note Saw SIDECARS, ASCRIBES, and SCARIOSE but couldn't think of CLASSIER.  This is one of the two best non-bingo choices.
>Ed_Saunders: FFINTUU -FFIN +0 301
#note No  idea what Ed's rack was here, this is a random Quackle rack.
>Jim_Burlant: AENORST 14C SANTERO +72 396
#note Best bingo.   I'm now at 93% winning chances but don't consider myself out of the woods just yet, given those bingo lines on the northeast quadrant and that unseen blank.
>Ed_Saunders: DFO H12 FO.D +36 337
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEGITX 13G B.G +23 419
#note Best.

#note Best.

>Jim_Burlant: ?BEEIOT N2 EBOnIT. +20 459
#note Thought I might have missed something here but wasn't sure.  I would never have found BIOMETER or CENOBITE, but I should have seen OVERBITE O5, as I've played OVERBITE before.  That said, this choice wins 100%, though at an obviously huge loss of equity.  While the CLASSIER miss probably came out in the wash, this miss definitely cost me a hefty amount of spread.  Not to mention a few nervous moments while I waited for his next play, as my tracking wasn't entirely right.
