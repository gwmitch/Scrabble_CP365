#note This was a bit of a risky move. I liked my chances of him not having the right tile to score to that H, but it could have gone wrong. Moves like this are why I am seldom involved in close endgames, I always seem to make all-or-nothing plays in the pre-endgame. It's a close sim, J6 HIT edges out.

#note I saw M1 WIFEY but not O1 FERITY! It's almost worth it to sacrifice the points to block the H, but not quite.
