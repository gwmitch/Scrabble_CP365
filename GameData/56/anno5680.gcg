#note 9i (E)X and 9h S(E)X sim top followed by trade X. I considered the first two, but went with points. I hate these sort of decisions.

#note 2nd to the stand out play EMEN(DE)R db/db. 
>bnjy99: ACDR 8A CARD +37 83
>james: EHLNORT 12B HOTEL +29 111
#note a ton of various plays along row 12 among top choices. Mine's at the bottom of the pack and is quite a weak play in comparison to 12b HOLT.  12a THOLE wins the sim, but i prefer HOLT.
>bnjy99: AKO 13A KOA +29 112
>james: ?AAELNR 13F AdRENAL +59 170
#note this is one point fewer than 13f ARsENAL but sims better. go figure.
>bnjy99: DIIIR A3 IRIDI. +10 122
>james: AAEHRRS 12I RAH +15 185
#note yuck again. HAARS m9 is the play - scores points, keeps ER.  When i was considering options here I wasn't really thinking clearly (obviously).

#note long sim comes back with this - my play is a close 3rd behind 15a FLUE or FEU.  Why is this?  Is the benefit to me of killing the B14 spot so great that it negates the very average bingo line i've just set up with the E at H15?

#note ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I saw STRIPY but didnt look hard enough for the spot. As it happens J7 SITand J8 ID (creating a nice S hook) both outdo each of these plays.
>bnjy99: EPT 15L T.PE +30 316
>james: ?ADIIRT J8 ID +19 360
#note low on tie. IT in the same spot is probably better as it avoids the potential of duplicating the T.

#note if i'd kept the D i'd have had an unplayable BAWDRIC = BALDRIC.
