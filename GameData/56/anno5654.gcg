#note I started laying tiles down from G8: Z-W-I-E... then I picked them up and said, "just kidding!"
>Bob: DEM L10 D.EM +32 107
#note "Damn you, Bob!  You blocked a beautiful play!"

#note There is one bingo that scores one more point.  It is a species of dinosaur with excellent diction.

>Dave: AEIQSTU H1 QU.ET +45 241
#note I was yearning to play PASTIQUE* but it didn't look quite right.  It's a conflation of PRATIQUE and POSTIQUE.
>Bob: ACGIORS 14F ORGIACS +72 266
#note "That is *not* a word," I said as we went to the challenge computer.  I was feeling feisty this night.  Bob went to the snack table and didn't even bother to look at the screen as I did the lookup.  It was our third trip of the night, as I had challenged DENTALLY and LEUGH# in the previous game.
>Bob: ACGIORS --  -72 194
#note "You're going to kick yourself when you see what you missed."
>Dave: AIISSTU 2J .AITS +14 255
#note "What did I miss?"  "GRACIOSO to the O."  "Oh wow, nice find!"  "Thanks, I've played it before."
>Bob: ACGIORS 9G AG +23 217
#note "It's a Spanish clown."  "Ah, now I remember seeing that."
>Dave: AAIMPSU 1L PIAS +38 293
#note A shame I had no R to play through, I thought.  But I missed AMIAS.  Oops.

#note I wasn't so happy to leave the A column wide open for him, but this was the only way I could see to clean out the rack.
>Bob: BFIOR 12A FORBI. +32 345
#note At first I thought I would be fine when I tracked Bob's remaining tiles, but the more I thought about it, the more my brain hurt.  "This ain't easy!" I exclaimed at one point.  Eric came over and laughed at Bob's rack.  I said, "E-I-E-Y-O!"
>Dave: BDELNNO A12 .OND +24 358
#note Quackle agrees.
>Bob: EEIOY A7 OYE. +21 366
#note Missing my out.  If he blocks it, I should still win in various ways, as long as I'm careful.  Quackle thinks BEE is his best, losing by two, for what that's worth.
>Dave: BELN 13E N.BLE +13 371
#note "Damn it, I mistracked," Bob bemoaned.  I don't remember if he called me a stinker.  I've learned to block that out by now.
>Dave:  (EI) +4 375
