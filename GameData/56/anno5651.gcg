>Jim_Burlant: ?AGIRTZ 7F ZA +15 15
#note Didn't know ZIGGURAT and felt ZIT broke up too much of the rack.  Didn't like dumping the Z cheap but the sim says this is the best non-bingo option.
>Mike_Wier: BEEIRTW -BEEI +0 12
>Jim_Burlant: ?GINORT J8 sORTING +69 84
#note Sim prefers STORING in the same location by a hair.

#note Best.
>Mike_Wier: AGIKNSW 5A WAKINGS +88 170
>Mike_Wier: AGIKNSW --  -88 82
#note Mike told me after the game that he saw SWANKING but wasn't sure it was good (it is), so he tried this.  I wasn't sure about SWALE or WAKINGS (turns out SWALE is good)  but having played him many times in club and tournaments, this smelled suspiciously like one of his phonies so I challenged it.  
>Jim_Burlant: CEOORTY 5I TOY +19 128
#note This is a very weak play; best is obviously OY 10A.  I considered that, but then got fixated on dumping the second O.  Then I saw TOYO 5I and almost put that down...but then I spent so much time debating the pros/cons of giving him a hook for the N I knew he had, that by the time I finally saw TOY, I had forgotten about the original play at 10A.  OY!  
>Mike_Wier: AGIKNSW C7 WA.KING +38 120
>Jim_Burlant: CDEMORR L4 CODER +25 153
#note Normally would have played L4 CORED for more points but felt that didn't want to give him the easy S hook at L3.  Probably should have just played CORM L4 leaving RED (the sim winner btw).  But this mistake winds up benefitting me.

>Jim_Burlant: AEEOPRT D1 OPERATE +75 264
>Mike_Wier: ACINNST 1A CAN.NIST +140 333
#note Whoa!   I held this.  Mike told me after the game he had hoped that I was going to challenge...but once I saw my comeback play I realized I had to let this stick.  Turns out I did well to let this stay, as CANONIST is good.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEMOPT A1 .OMPlEAT +98 362
#note Back in the lead - woo hoo!  Best play, simming at 53% winning chances.
>Mike_Wier: DEFNOST N3 TENFO.DS +72 405
#note You've got to be kidding me.  This is insane!
>Jim_Burlant: ABDDIOQ O1 QAID +55 417
#note I held TENFOLDS but released when I saw that it gave me this play in return.  This is clearly best, and this sims at barely 38% winning chances.  Mike was laughing and shaking his head in disbelief as this came down.  And every play along the way the people at the boards next to us were turning their heads.
>Mike_Wier: EGIILR 13H LI.GIER +18 423
#note Scored as 16.
>Jim_Burlant: ABDENOR A12 .ADE +36 453
#note Too bad Mike couldn't have hung the L or the I and given me an out bingo.  Anyway - I felt that the J had to be taken care of right away, as I didn't want him hitting me with JIVE.  Though my play of JADE looks good, it was not best.  Since Mike emptied the bag, (I)NBRED 12J 38 is best.  Even though that lets him have JIVE 12A 42 (his obvious comeback), it would yield out plays for me with either 2C APO 9, or MOA F11 5.  In either case, I would also get 12 points for his unplayed HOU, thus guaranteeing the win.
