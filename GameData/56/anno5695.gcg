>Toh_Weibin: ?AEGKOY D10 KAY +29 57
#note Missed DEKAlOGY here. A word I have seen before... but I don't blame myself too much here. Other options are GO(B)Y (actually a very intelligent setup) and KAYO. I don't really like OAKY (which ranks 4th on CP) because you should be leaving the board a little opener now.

>Nigel_Richards: AEERSST 5C TESSERA. +66 114
>Toh_Weibin: EIOPTUZ I3 ZO. +45 175
#note Was fixated with playing the Z off. POUT is better on CP, possibly because of a high scoring play around 4A to 4D.

>Nigel_Richards: AIV H1 VIA +30 177
>Toh_Weibin: EGIINOT 7A TIG +23 229
#note Straight-out bad play. Should have done something like OI and GIE, if I looked at more possibilities.
>Nigel_Richards: CEELMO A7 .ELECOM +36 213
>Toh_Weibin: EIIJNOP 7H JO. +23 252
#note This doesn't simulate well but I still think its not as bad as the simulation shows. Perhaps better options include PEIN (which probably simulates better because of the O hook which you keep) or PION 4D, or risking the D hook with JIN(S) F2. The winning E(N)JOIN I7 does not really appeal to me...
>Nigel_Richards: AEHR 4D HEAR +30 243
>Toh_Weibin: EIINNOP K1 ION +19 271
#note ION B13 is better.
>Nigel_Richards: AEINRSW 13F .INWARES +82 325
#note Was afraid of something like this happening!
>Toh_Weibin: EIMNPTX 14I EX +55 326
#note On hindsight, MINX might have been better. However, I liked leaving more than one line open to give myself ample chances for comeback. A blocky X play to the TWS, in response to MINX, would probably kill the game for me.
>Nigel_Richards: FNU 12J FUN +31 356
>Toh_Weibin: IMNPRST 15F PRIM +32 358
#note Not a completely good draw, but I have to hope for something out of this decent bag.
>Nigel_Richards: CTU 3B CUT +16 372
>Toh_Weibin: AABNRST B13 AB +27 385
#note This is an interesting move. It's actually 7th on CP and the best is BA B14, so I think that's crap. The real choices for me are AB, AB 9G, and, well, something like  BANT 11K. I didn't think AB 9G was necessary especially since a bingo might not appear anyway - similar for any S hook opening. I was more eager for him to open from 11K and give me an opening :).

>Nigel_Richards: UNKNOWN (challenge) +5 438
#note OK.. Make your calculations... I think I win... Challenge!
>Toh_Weibin: AELNRST 10H TREN.ALS +62 447
#note Was held for a while but he knew it was good. To tell you the truth, I didn't see its anagram (so if I'd played AB 9G earlier I might have been thrown into the hall of shame). Overall, I felt I played too defensive but I was a little afraid of going all out because of what happened the last time I played him (nine timer).
