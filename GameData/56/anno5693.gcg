#note i really wanted to play TEPEEING*. i don't know where I pulled that "word" out of.

#note whoops. i didn't even look for bingoes through the E. ESTHESIA. -6.5
>David_W: AAEINTW J6 AW +12 93
>Cesar: CDOORUW C7 CROW +27 158
#note OUTCROWD is way out of my prob range but it looks familiar. i didn't think of it. OUTCROW/WOODCUT. if i really want to play well i should look at what he just played. WOODCUT makes sense, but if i'm not seeing it then 5J WOOD is nice. i was too hung up on REVOKES  to even look for anything.  10B WOUND is also interesting. CROW is always wrong.  -61

#note i'm pretty sure i had a T, so CROWFOOT is probably best

>Cesar: ADDELNT B9 DANDLE +30 281
#note H11 DAUNT makes a lot of sense. i was mostly deciding between DEFAT and DANDLE. i decided to be aggressive and open two good spots. but DAUNT still looks best. -2.3

#note my rack kind of looked like this. i kept the E because there were only a couple left.
>David_W: ?FGIRST C13 IF +19 342
>Cesar: ?CDELNO H11 DO.CE +33 354
#note i have NO CLUE. i figured if he doesn't bingo, i have a good shot at winning, but IF is very aggressive and implies he has something good too. i agonized over this move. L10 COED doesn't seem right to me after IF, but I was leaning there before.  i could also play 15A OD and try to outplay on a closed board, but i suck. COED sims highest. K1 DOC is also pretty nice because it gives me a chance to come back if he does bingo. -3

>Cesar: ?ABLNRT G3 BA +9 363
#note oh well, he was gonna get STRaNGE anyway. i don't know what type of miracle i was hoping for here, but i was in such a bad mood. sorry.. nothing is gonna win here, but 5I BL(ED) may maximize my spread.
