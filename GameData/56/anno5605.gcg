#note EViLEST/LiEVEST :/ -- fitting that I only remember the obscure VELITES.  I passed up TwELVES for defense, but that's not the play by a long shot.

>Ryan_Fischer: AADEOPS C11 .AP +24 265
#note I was gonna take AA 10F, but didn't think DEOPS was that great a leave.  Maybe wrong; ADEOS is vowel-heavy which is my trademark.

#note Well, it worked.  Okay, don't blow it!

#note Fishy, fishy.  No really, don't blow it!
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGIIOP 10J .ODE +19 391
#note Okay, here's how I arrived at (L)ODE - "the only way he gets me is a bingo to the S.  Block.  Okay, how?  Well, how about "DIP?"  Yeah, but then if he has a T you're screwed... look at the pool.  CUBITI... no, you dope, you mistracked, there's no B.  Find something that can hurt you.  Okay, MEETING.  Reason enough.  Find something else.  Well, LODE blocks, but leaves an N hook.  But then I have a counter.  It's a bit safer.  Okay, play LODE."  Footnote: CHAMP says DIG in that spot, but that leaves a ING lane.  I guess I could counter after that still.  Oh well.  (L)ODE wins 92% of the time, but I misplay the next rack, too.

#note Really bad miss here, and he might have challenged PU(R)I.  I'd also have at least a fighting chance in the endgame, although I still lose versus perfect play.
