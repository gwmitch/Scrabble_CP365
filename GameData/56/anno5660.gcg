#note What do you do here?  Exchange UU?  Or play UNIQUE?  If I'm sitting on DINES or LINES I mighte be more inclined to exchange.  I just don't think DEILN is powerful enough to warrant trading.  Besides, if I exchange 2 Ruth is more likely to make some small defensive play that renders me unable to put the bingo down.  I'd rather turn the rack (admittedly, DL is kind of a neutral leave), not have to worry about one of those U's coming back from the dead later in the game, trail by only 5 points instead of 22, and take 5 cracks at the SSSSJZX?? that are unseen. The sim results indicate this choice is more about stylistic preference than anything being clearly right or wrong.  First choice is exchange UU.  This choice is

#note Quackle prefers exchanging UU, which I considered...but rejected.  I'd be more inclined to exchange UU if I had an S...but I felt that, especially if she made a small defensive play it would be all too probable that I'd have a homeless bingo...then what?  I'd rather take 5 cracks at the unseen SSS??XJZ, score 17 points, and not have to worry about 2 U's coming back from the dead at critical point in the game.

#note Too bad I couldn't think of FLEDGE or even FREED, both of which are better than this choice.  Though GEEZ play scores well, it is a poor play for 2 reasons.  First, it doesn't turn enough of this consonant-overloaded rack, and the DFLR leave could be problematic unless I draw at least 2 vowels.   Secondly - trailing by this margin I need to keep the board alive for as many bingos as I can; this doesn't just kill row 15; it also kills row 14 and makes it easier for her to defend.  Wasn't happy about this play when I made it, but the neurons weren't firing properly.

#note This is another rack that needed to be turned - quackle prefers playing for equity.  After a couple of minutes this was all I could come up with - pathetic.  5F FURLED is the winner here; don't know how I missed this.  Still brian-locked, I guess.  The silver lining: the draw bails me out of this mistake on the next turn.

#note Quackle prefers A7 FEOD to this. While there is some merit to playing short given my situation, I don't think I'm going to get very far keeping LNY.  I'd rather unload the Y and try to draw into a rack that's worth building.This choice sims third at a mild loss of valuation.

>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIIT M3 I.EATE +16 234
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  AVIATE A3 is the clear winner - too bad I didn't look harder to find it.  While I bungled the early game, I've been playing well since ROLFERS.  However, this choice  is one I really have to look at insofar as where I contributed to my own downfall, and you'll see why in a moment...

#note Quackle prefers A4 VEENA, which I didn't know.  Even if I did, I'm not sure I'd have played it, given that there was on ly 1 E left in the unseen pool.  I felt that with 3 T's in the pool, a fish was in order.  
>Ruth_Hamilton: AOPSY O8 SOAPY +54 363
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINST 13H ENTASIA +71 322
#note Ouch.  I have to wonder - while I still would have been vowel-addled if I played AVIATE instead of IDEATE a couple of turns back, would she have had as potent of a sequence as BONG/SOAPY?   
>Ruth_Hamilton: TUX 12K TUX +35 398
>Jim_Burlant: BEGIMTV 2A BE.M +20 342
#note I had played ENTASIA with the hopes of opening a number of lines for potential 8's; with the blank unseen there was the slim possibility of a miracle bingo...but her play of TUX killed that.

#note At this point I stopped annotating and cannot reconstruct the sequence; we played out the end game with nothing noteworthy occurring.  Final score was recorded as 377 - 449.  While there were a number of tough racks, I really have to look at how poorly I played on turns 2, 3, and 7 before blaming tiles for this loss.
