#note D12 BOUT is the highest simmer. i suppose i do make plays like that sometimes. maybe i should do it all the time. next is D11 OBI which i didn't think of. this seems to me like a bit of a stylistic choice, though. -6

#note this is such a bad miss, but at least i found it before quackle by staring at my racks at the end of the game. the problem is that i'd had this exact rack recently on an ISC game and there was an O, and i looked it up or found it, and i couldn't remember whether there was a bingo there or not, and i leaned towards no. mark s was making fun of me for moping about missing this :) it really could have helped. boo cesar. -28

#note this isn't good, i fall behind a little more every turn. loan me some skills, noah!

#note 10B ZETA looks great. this really was a critical move. i spent a while on this rack, but i could not come up with anything besides RAZED; but it's critical to balance racks in what is sure to be a close endgame. but even if i see ZETA i don't know if i'd play it. funnily enough, RAZED blocked a triple-triple, so if i'd superfocused and found ZETA i probably woulda had to walk out of the room. -7.5

#note i think a 2-ply sim is misleading here, so im doing a 4-ply sim for this one up to 10000 iterations: L4 L(O)TIC, 11I TELIC, Exch QT and then my play. TELIC seems reasonable to me, i'm too scared to do anything else. what's right here? Anyone agree with LOTIC? -7

>Cesar: CELLTTV 11I TELL +15 361
#note yurkgh. it seems so essential to keep my E that quackle is willing to sacrifice points with 7L CELT and 7L TELL. it seems to me that i'd need a miracle bingo in any case, so the 6 more points that 11I TELL scores won't make a difference, so i might as well maximize my bingo chance, right? -8%

#note !
>Cesar: CGOPSTV L10 G.OP +14 375
#note nfori have no idea what is right here. with partial knowledge of RINDS every time i hit "ask championship player" it comes up with a different set of choices. 10A OPT seems to be ok though and 7L VET. -4% .... 10A OPT wins 5.56% of the time. i don't see how. it turns out i drew AI, so if noah somehow goes blind i can go out with CAVINGS. what actually wins 5% of the time?
