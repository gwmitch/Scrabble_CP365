#note E5 GHEE, which I didn't think of, is obviously much better.

#note This is a random Quackle rack; I have no idea what her rack was here.

#note Quackle's preference is 13B MARKA or KARMA.  Uh...no thanks.  Can it really be right to give her an X bonanza?  13C ARAK, which I didn't think of, is probably best.  This play takes a mild equity hit (<2 pts).

#note While this scores well and does the best job manicuring the rack of any of the choices, it's definitely risky because of what it opens up.  I saw the risk and thought that with only 3 O's still unseen she might not have an immediate play there and I could get away with it.  Quackle prefers C3 AUXIN, F3 XU, H1 XI to this. 15J AUXINs also worth consideration.  
>Joan_Kelly: EOP 15M OPE +29 188
#note Good thing for me she also didn't have the H for HOPE.  That would have been painful.

>Jim_Burlant: ADELORZ 1A ZA.RE +45 349
#note AZIDO 1A much better than this; don't know why I couldn't think of it.  But the duck says I'm at 99% winning chances, even with this mistake.

#note Quackle does not like this, preferring A4 VENULE.  Would have been nice if i had thought of this.
>Joan_Kelly: IM A14 MI +25 280
>Jim_Burlant: AEGGNOU 1H .UG +7 419
#note Simply wanted to prevent any miracle 8's like HISTONES H1, which was still a possibility given this pool.  As good as anything else.
>Joan_Kelly: DENNPST 11B P..S +16 296
#note Once again, I lost track of the end sequence and failed to annotate it properly.   The only thing of note that did happen was that I completely flubbed the end game, blocking a line I didn't need to block and needlessly hemorrhaging, I don't know, 25 - 30 points of spread.  While the win was never in doubt, I think that, in retrospect, the lack of focus  (perhaps the game had come too easily?) and late-day fatigue were beginning to show.  Final score recorded as 446 - 347.
#note Time to review the 4's, eh?  For some ie
