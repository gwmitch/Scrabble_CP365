>Evans_Clinchy: EHINQTT 8G QI +22 22
#note TENTH 8H setting up QI for next turn is kinda cute, but... nahhh.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ENORTU I5 TONsURE +69 69
#note ROUTiNE is one more.  Saw it.  It's dumb.
>Evans_Clinchy: DEGHNTT 11G TH.GN +18 40
#note Looks right. Scores decent, keeps the best leave I can hope for here.
>Ryan_Fischer: HJORTUU H4 JUT +22 91
#note Fishing for OUT(JUT)
>Evans_Clinchy: DEIKLTY J2 DIKEY +42 82
#note It's between this and HIKED. They score the same, but this offers less counterplay if you infer he's close to a bingo. Fewer lanes open for eights this way.
>Ryan_Fischer: AHNORRU H11 .ORAH +36 127
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEILOT 13C LOITE.ED +72 154
#note Lucky to see a lane to get this down.
>Ryan_Fischer: CFNRTUX D12 C.RF +26 153
#note Bad move.  Best is to dump the X with UNFIXT.  FUNCT(O)R is interesting, too.
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEFIOS 15A BOF. +36 190
#note Considered FIEF to avoid keeping such a vowel-heavy leave, but this is pretty clearly better.
>Ryan_Fischer: ALNPTUX I1 PAX +40 193
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEIRSS 1G AS. +15 205
#note This was a really difficult turn. I wanted to do three things -- score at least a little bit, keep a strong bingo-prone leave, and also find a way to open a lane with a short play. ASP does all three of these things... but at the same time, AEIRS is risky. If I draw two vowels and he gets his bingo down, game over. The better play might be AI 9F -- same score, opens a double-double lane for the R that I'm holding, and keeps a leave that doesn't leave me so desperate to draw consonants. My chances are probably better that way.
>Ryan_Fischer: ELNRSTU L5 RUNLETS +68 261
#note If I'd known he wasn't sure of (THEGN)S I'd've played at F1.  2A is dumb.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEILRRS F1 RAILERS +67 272
#note Going for the more defensive of the two placements. Normally I'd go for aggression since I'm only up 10-15 points and I might need some volatility to keep the lead, but 2A just looked stupidly overly aggressive to me.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?INOOSV 5D VO. +12 273
#note Best, oddly.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEIIMN D3 MA.IE +20 292
#note Seems right, as it scores without giving too much back. ELEMI 8K seemed way too reckless.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?GINNOS 8L .ONG +15 288
#note Whoops, missed (H)OrNINGS.  Also of note, c(H)IGNONS and m(A)SONING.  Game would've swung heavily in my favor had I hit any of those.  I missed an -INGS versus Weinstein, too.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEINTV O6 VA.INATE +63 355
#note More defensive than NAVIGATE, since the V makes it tough for him to do anything in the top-right corner.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEINSW 10A ENdWISE +65 353
#note EVANS: The only bingo! Nice find.  RYAN: Oddly for me, WEES/EWES is better than the bingo based on initial valuation.  I can't really argue as I'm opening the triple for only 65 when still down after the bingo.  After EWES I'd still have 3 lanes to work with.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEGLOW A6 WODG. +30 385
#note With six vowels out of 13 still in the pool, I thought it was important to keep a consonant on my rack. AEL seemed like the perfect leave to keep here -- flexible enough that even a terrible draw wouldn't kill me in the endgame. GLOWED seemed reasonable at first because it left one in the bag and scored a little extra, but this looks better because AEL is less risky than AE in this spot.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCDPUZ C2 ZAP +40 393
#note Pretty much resigned to empty the bag and lose.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEILMY N10 ELEMI +30 415
#note Best. Scores nicely and keeps multiple spots in reserve to drop AY for the out next turn.
>Ryan_Fischer: BCDIOU 14K CUB.D +24 417
#note EVANS: Phony. Couldn't go after it in this spot, for obvious reasons.  RYAN: Champ likes CO(Z).
>Evans_Clinchy: AY 14A AY +24 439
#note Good game!
>Evans_Clinchy:  (IO) +4 443
#note Yep, very good game.  Close all the way, and the one who made the fewest mistakes won, as it should be.
