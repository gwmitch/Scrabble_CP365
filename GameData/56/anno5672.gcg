#note The paranoiac in me didn't want to put out an H or an S in the 3x3 lane - the S for obvious reasons, but the H because I didn't want to offer easy scoreback. 6I RETOuCH for 79 or HECTORs for 78 are probably still better though, paranoia or no paranoia.

#note Quackers prefers B9 (E)YELET 34 or 1F GLEE(T)Y 30. Not sure I'm a fan of the GQ leave, but the QT leave is good. In any case, I'm not in a rush to lose the Q.

#note Quackle likes B(E)ND in the same spot, but I disagree. Here's my logic: He's just played off an S, he doesn't need it to win on this board, so he may not have the other one just because he played TIS. M(E)ND, unlike B(E)ND, takes the A and E front hooks, both of which are abundant in the pool and somehow aren't on my rack. No one play of his can completely take out both lanes created by this play. Long shot starts now...

#note Creating another possible lane for an S bingo, or if I don't draw the S, a potential lane can be created by dropping a vowel before the last R.
>Mike_Ryan: DOU A4 OUD +17 394
>Jesse: AABHMNS 1A BA. +24 366
#note Now that I have the S, and given the pool, he will not be able to block me if I just patiently build toward a bingo while scoring along the way.
