>Brian_Bowman: IIII -IIII +0 0
#note Without going into the long story as to the what and why, just as Brian said "exchange four," something was said that caused Brian and I to laugh for a good minute. Even Carolyn Easter shushed us!
>Jason: FGNNOTV 8G FONT +14 14
>Brian_Bowman: AVW 9F VAW +21 21
>Jason: GINNQUV H7 V..ING +15 29
#note Was about to exchange into QU, QUN or QUIN until I saw this, which seems to be the only play.
>Brian_Bowman: DELNNOT 10H .NDOLENT +65 86
>Jason: ?HNQTUY O8 NU.TY +36 65
#note Too focused on the T. H(O)Y at K9 is clearly best.
>Brian_Bowman: AEU 6G EAU +17 103
>Jason: ?EHIQSW N7 QI +13 78
>Brian_Bowman: BE F6 BE +22 125
>Jason: ?DEHJSW M9 J.WED +48 126
#note So close to JEWFISH! :)
>Brian_Bowman: GIP L12 PIG +23 148
>Jason: ?FHILSS 15G SeLFISH +97 223
#note Hehe, SeLFISH/(PIG)S. If only there was a certain $5 prop bet going on. Looking at you, PZ and JK.
>Brian_Bowman: LOO 5E LOO +13 161
>Jason: AABEEMT 14E AMEBA +22 245
#note Stupid fives-to-make-sixes. Stupid not having reviewed the four-vowel sixes in forever. Add the E for 10 more.
>Brian_Bowman: AA K12 AA +11 172
>Jason: AEEOPRT 15A OPERA +26 271
#note Don't like Speedy's suggestion of fishing off the E. The board's closed, that huge X spot is still open, in addition to that ?SSZ also unseen. Turnover is good. Plus, it's unlike Brian will bingo to the O or P. ETAPE is better, though, I think.
>Brian_Bowman: ETY 4C TYE +14 186
#note A couple turns after this, Carolyn had another great moment when a phony was played on her. "Hold. NARF*. NARF*? What the hell is a f***ing NARF*?" Brian and I got chuckles out of that.
>Jason: CDERTTZ N12 REC +25 296
#note Cute, but there's a cuter, better play. TREF at J12 ... not knowing AMEBAE continues to hurt me. CP puts me at 94.45% to win after this, and that's about where I thought I was. Hard to see Brian winning even if he bingos twice.
>Brian_Bowman: ACDIORS C8 IDOCRAS. +76 262
#note Uh, he was supposed to use the blank there. And the X is still out. And how did I just pull eight consonants in a row from the bag? Look at the unseen pool!
>Jason: DLMRTTZ 8A TR.M +27 323
>Brian_Bowman: ?EEIIRS A1 fIERIES. +74 336
#note Crap! X still out *and* he's fixed the E- and I-heaviness and was supposed to slow him down! I've never gone from being about 95% to win to thinking "I'm going to lose" so fast.
>Jason: DKLORTZ J3 DOLT +16 339
#note Or CP's pick of DOT, but that gives back almost as much if he has the X and this leaves one in the bag.
>Brian_Bowman: AN B13 NA. +16 352
#note Blocking ZE(R)K and ZAP/ZEP/ZIP in that spot.
>Jason: GHIKRUZ 4I Z.UK +34 373
#note How'd I pull two more consonants? I've never been so happy to see KUZ on my rack in my life! The 10B placement is nine better ... didn't realize I was threatening an out until after I hit my clock. I thought if I went down there, Brian plays XI at K3, threatening OE for a bunch next turn. Oops. Or I can play GIRTH or GRITH at C1 and guaranteeing an out next turn; that's seven better. I found the worst of the four wins.
>Brian_Bowman: EEIOUX C1 EXI. +22 374
#note E(T)UI is two better.
>Jason: GHIR 11C .HI +16 389
#note Better to take the points with HI at D1 and let him go out. Should've done the math, but spread was irrelevant.
>Brian_Bowman: EOU D11 .E +14 388
#note Second to AMEBAE.
>Jason: GR 6A .RG +6 395
#note Missing G(NA)R. Heckuva game.
>Jason:  (OU) +4 399
