>Jim_Burlant: BIIIOPR G4 PIRO.I +11 11
#note None of the options here are particularly good.  Quackle prefers I6 BIDI 9 and does not like this play at all, docking me almost 8.5 equity points.  I just figured that I should turn as much of this rack as possible, given that it was not possible to salvage a bingo-prone leave.
>Margie_Gordon: AENV H1 VANE +29 39
>Jim_Burlant: ?BBCDEI 10B CrIBBED +85 96
#note Didn't know the 8 in this rack and took a chance.  I was 90% sure the CRIBBED was good (it is) and equally certain this back-hook to PIROGI was phony (it is).  But I've seen phony versions of PIROGI fly in club and I know at least one expert has said it took him numerous attempts at the cardbox to finally get PIROGI right, so I thought this had a good chance of sticking.  This play wasn't even held.
>Margie_Gordon: AEFT F2 FEAT +22 61
>Jim_Burlant: AAEMNUW B9 A.UMEN +20 116
#note Sim winner is C7 WAUR, which I think (a) gives up too much for leave and (b) creates openings almost as dangerous as this play for 9 fewer points.  This choice comes in 3rd, roughly 2.5 points down. 2nd is E1 WEAN 20; I prefer to unload the U.
>Margie_Gordon: ACOT A6 COAT +20 81
>Jim_Burlant: AAJLQRW E10 .LAW +18 134
#note Urp.  Don't know why on earth I missed  on RAJ A13.   Hideous play.
>Margie_Gordon: INORRSX -INORR +0 81
>Jim_Burlant: ADJQRRY A13 RAJ +34 168
#note Better late than never.
>Margie_Gordon: ?EFLRST J2 ReFLETS +69 150
#note I held this, as I had never seen REFLETS before.  When I wrote EFLRST? on my score sheet, I immediately saw that she could have played FiLTERS in the same spot for 6 more points.  I figured she was trying to draw the challenge and therefore didn't take the bait.  She confirmed after the game that she had indeed been trying to draw the challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: DGQRWYY 3J .DGY +16 184
#note 12D WADY and 12D WARY are the sim winners.  This choice loses 9-1/2 points and barely beats the exchanges.
>Margie_Gordon: AH D12 HA +25 175
>Jim_Burlant: AGIQRWY F12 YAW +32 216
#note L1 WIGGY is best.  Right after I hit my clock I realized I had transposed my letters and that, if I was going to play in this spot I should have put down WAY, not YAW.  This is a very bad play and this is justifiably slammed in the sim.  
>Margie_Gordon: IMN 15F NIM +25 200
>Jim_Burlant: EIOOQRS -OOQ +0 216
#note Quackle prefers E1 QI.  Uh...no thanks.  It'll take at least another cheap rack dump to clean up the EOORS leave...why not fix it all at once?
>Margie_Gordon: EO 4L OE +15 215
>Jim_Burlant: EGILRRS 6I R.G +4 220
#note Quackle prefers 4D GRAPE. I preferred to open another line for my S.
>Margie_Gordon: EIT H12 ITE. +7 222
>Jim_Burlant: EILNORS 14H .LOINERS +70 290
#note This play sims with the highest valuation but does not win the sim on a win percentage basis.  C4 LORINERS wins the sim for percentage at 85%.  This comes in second, at 84% winning chances.
>Margie_Gordon: AQT O11 QAT. +14 236
#note Hmmm.   Margie is in a tough spot here having (probably) just pulled the Q, and she spent a while on this turn before reluctantly making this play.  I have to wonder - assuming her best play is not an exchange, would she be better off  playing QI D9 11?  Or perhaps opening up the possibility of O1 bingos with a play at 2M?  I can't know for sure w/o having seen her rack, but this did not strike me as the right play - not only because she made the board easier for me to defend, but because she was burning the case A for only 14 points. Of course, my opinion is probably biased because of my post-bingo rack...
>Jim_Burlant: EINOPTU 13M PO. +20 310
#note Amazing draw given this pool.  Anyway - Quackle prefers dumping the rack with POUTI(N)E L9.  I'm at 92% winning chances with this play.
>Margie_Gordon: DEES 2J .EEDS +26 262
>Jim_Burlant: EEIINTU 15K TUNE +18 328
#note Not even one of the original choices, this is the sim winner, at 89% winning chances.  As far as I'm concerned, keep the tiles turning and keep emptying the bag.  Yeah, the leave is hardly desirable, but with this pool she's going to have a heckuva time trying to bingo.
>Margie_Gordon: HU 1N UH +17 279
>Jim_Burlant: EIILOUX E1 XI +14 342
#note Yet again, not even one of the original choices, yet this wins the sim.
>Margie_Gordon: IKNR D2 KIRN +26 305
>Jim_Burlant: EILOUZ 6A .OZ +16 358
#note Late-afternoon fatigue was setting in, and big-time.  I was so tired by this point that it was obvious that any play beyond 2 tiles was getting to be too much for me to find. OUZEL or OUZO are clearly much better than this.
