>Noah: ADIISTV L8 VISIT +31 70
#note This is the star choice in the sim, but I actually like DAVITS 11D, which I whiffed on, because it keeps th board more open.
>Demigod: CEFLORY 11J RE.FY +36 83
>Noah: ACDEMNS N10 C.MAE +36 106
#note Quackle prefers the very volatile CUT G6, which bingos over 80% of the time.

#note Darn, it's not good.
>Demigod: AACILSZ F5 ZA. +16 132
>Noah: ADNPSSY O12 SYN +25 131
#note Quackle's favorite is DYSPNEA 14I, which I didn't see. Otherwise, this is in a dead heat with ADZ and SPAZ.
>Demigod: ACEIKLS 12D SACLIKE +83 215
>Noah: ABDLLPS 11C LAB +20 151
#note Didn't know PIBAL H11, which is definitely best. LAP keeps a better leave (didn't think about the leaves in enought detail). Ultimately, if you're going to set up an S when down by 80, set up a stonger one-BALD is second best and a great play which I, sadly, didn't consder.

#note Now now!
>Noah: AEINRRS M1 NAR. +10 197
#note There really don't seem to be any good choices in this rack. This doesn't appear on Speedy's radar, but sims best. 
>Demigod: BDEENRV H1 VEN.. +24 332
>Noah: AEGIORS 8L .IGA +24 221
#note Although this sims about equally with GONIA, and even a little bit better, I think this was a poor choices-GONIA seems a lot better to me.
>Demigod: BDDEIJR D4 J. +18 350
>Noah: EOORRSU G12 .OUR +5 226
#note At this rate, there really seems to be no hope. Another rack with no fantastic options at all. Quackle agrees that true desperation is the best option-especially against Speedy Player.
>Demigod: BDDEIIR 15D BED.ID +39 389
>Noah: ENORSTT 10B TET +10 236
#note Again, an annoying rack. NOT 1M does a little better in the sim.
