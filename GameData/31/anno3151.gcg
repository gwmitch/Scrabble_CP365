>Jason: BIMNOOP 8G BOP +14 14
>Chuck_Armstrong: OVX 9F VOX +28 28
>Jason: DILMNOT 10G TOLD +24 38
#note Close call, but Q agrees.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EGR 11J ERG +11 39
>Jason: FHHIMNR L9 HI.H +22 60
#note Close between this and NIGH ... given Chuck's last play, a T keep is very probable, but he may be using it to bingo. Even giving Chuck a T, HIGH leads NIGH by a point or two in sim.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AIPRT 8K ATRIP +37 76
>Jason: EFGMNRR N6 FR.NGE +22 82
#note OK, I'm playing Chuck Armstrong, I've lost zero equity through four turns (don't worry, mistakes are imminent), I'd kind of like some power tiles soonish. kthxbye.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEGRU O11 RUGAE +23 99
>Jason: FIMMORS N14 MM +24 106
#note Curse MISFORM not going down. Short of asking to use my emergency Clabbers play, this is best. MOM at M12 is also worth considering.
>Chuck_Armstrong: IIJNN M2 JINNI +29 128
>Jason: FIIORSU N2 OF +33 139
#note Correctly passing on FURIOSI*, but still making my first mistake of the game as I whiff on FU(J)I. 15-16 point error.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EY O1 YE +25 153
>Jason: IIIRRSU -IIRU +0 139
#note Punished for my misplay last turn. IRIS at 13I runs neck-and-neck with this and keeping RS. I kinda see IRIS ... very, very rich bag and mitigates a potential hot spot. This sims about a point behind an RS keep.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?ACEIOZ 11B ZOECIA +40 193
#note Chuck missed ZoOECIA but in the post-mortem questioned whether or not it would be a good idea to play it anyway. Steve Grob, Scott Pianowski and I all said we'd play the bingo and FWIW, Q says ZOECIA is a 17-point mistake.
>Jason: ILNRSTU D5 INSULT.R +68 207
#note OK, say Chuck had played ZoOECIA. Bingo anyway or play LUT(Z) keeping RINS with gobs of A's, E's and T's out? Q, at its best here since Chuck's rack is random, says to bingo anyway ... clear-cut.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?AABEEW C1 WAnABEE +83 276
#note Jeff Fiszbein was playing Steve Anstandig. "I have a 'What would Chuck do?' rack," Jeff said. "You can't say that anymore!" Chuck said. "I'm not No. 1 anymore. The pressure's off me. I'm just a wannabe." Then he played this. Another minor thing I should say ... THIS IS PHONY BALONEY! ARGH! Why didn't he just play WA(N)nABEE through the N in INSULTER, the stinker?
>Jason: AACDIIQ E2 QAID +40 247
#note ...and if he had played WA(N)nABEE, this rack is far less promising. So ... maybe that exchange of mistakes is a wash? (Yeah, Jason, keep telling yourself that...)
>Chuck_Armstrong: EOVW B6 WOVE +35 311
>Jason: ACEINST 13G CINEAST +89 336
#note "How you get to be No. 1 in Michigan," I said. "Play off four and get a SATINE rack." Said Chuck: "I remember, I remember ... it was a while ago, but I remember." Later, sitting next to me playing Jeff Fiszbein, I put down my 19th baby bingo of the day (ANISEEd) after a misplay the turn before and Chuck said "You're so lucky" and laughed. "How do think I got to be No. 1, skill?" I asked. "I keep telling everybody I'm just getting lucky and nobody believes me! I've got them all fooled!" I then beat Chuck the next game, so :P 
>Chuck_Armstrong: EKT H12 K.TE +39 350
#note The fact that Chuck took a while to play this made me believe the case E was in the bag. Perhaps even the case S, too. (Correct on both counts.)
>Jason: ADEOSUY 1A YO.E +33 369
#note "Holy balls, how is he not bingoing with that unseen pool?" I remember thinking. I considered a blocking play like (C)AY at G13, but then I felt I risked getting outrun, maybe beaten to the JINNI hook. I just decided to bank on the E being in the bag and grab as many points as I could with a tolerable leave. CAY outperforms this in sim. YOUSE at 13A is the clear sim leader and CP's pick.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?DILNOU 15A UNDOcIL. +77 427
#note Chuck could've grabbed more points with UNsOLID or UNOILeD, but the only way he loses now is a bingo out and this line is more worrisome than row 1. "Here's how you stay No. 1," he said as he played this, "Draw all the blanks!" Such a stinker...
>Jason: ADERSTU 1H RUSTED +38 407
#note Cool to make the Duck-approved play nine of 12 times (with a tenth play just a point off), but stupid WAnABEE*...
>Chuck_Armstrong: ALS 13B ALS +15 442
#note I stopped Chuck's 6-0 run in his last game, but that was a pretty pedestrian idiot-proof game. (Although I was complimented for my opening CUPb(O)ARD for 98...) Anyway, unless he becomes inactive or moves, Chuck will always be Michigan's No. 1. After all, I've never heard anybody ask: "What would Jason do with this rack?" :)
>Chuck_Armstrong:  (A) +2 444
