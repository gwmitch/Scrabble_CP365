>Eugene_d'Eon: AILNSVY 8D VINYL +30 30
#note 8D VAINLY is better by 3.  Probably because of ZI(N), JI(N), etc plays in response to VINYL.  Otherwise, I'm not sure why.
>Gigi_Miller: BEEF 7G BEEF +25 25
>Eugene_d'Eon: AINPSWX K5 WASP +28 58
#note 6F WASP, ABY, SEL, PE is 4 points more and no danger of (P) out to the TWS.  Better by 7.
>Gigi_Miller: EOOV 8K .OOVE +33 58
>Eugene_d'Eon: AGINOOX N8 .OX +29 87
#note L3 OXO is better by almost 2 points.  GAIN is a better leave than AGINO.  And (V)OX closes bingo lanes and doesn't open any reasonable new ones, whereas OXO does.  Didn't even see GOX for 36.  sheesh.
>Gigi_Miller: AJT M7 J.TA +32 90
>Eugene_d'Eon: AAGIINO F8 .AOI +6 93
#note I passed up (V)IGIA for the leave AGIN vs ANO.  Do the math man.  Wow.  5 points worse.  VIGIA is best.
>Gigi_Miller: NOW L10 WON +25 115
>Eugene_d'Eon: ACEGINR 11B REAG.NIC +72 165
#note ANERGIC doesn't go down.  Saw the move and quickly played it.  Didn't even notice RECA(N)ING.  Possibly a better challenge opporunity, but worth 8 less.  She held ANERGIC for 3 minutes until she found her next play for 69.
>Gigi_Miller: ??ESZ H10 S.ZErs +69 184
#note Don't know what else she had, but she had 12A ZEdS for 51 and keeping one of the blanks.
>Eugene_d'Eon: AHIKLMN K11 HIM +28 193
#note I really choked on this one and new it.  Wasted time and found nothing.  My brain was screaming at me that there was a good 5 in my rack, but i couldn't find HAKIM.  Just H(A)IKA.  Didn't see the (WON)K hook.  7 points.  2-ply sim likes K11 HAKIM.
>Gigi_Miller: GRUU J12 GURU +15 199
>Eugene_d'Eon: AEEKLNS 14B SNEAKE. +40 233
#note 6F KAE, ABY, EEL better by about 2.  KN(E)EL is better too.
>Gigi_Miller: ACD 6F CAD +24 223
>Eugene_d'Eon: DELMNRU L2 MULED +24 257
#note M(A)UL(E)D is better by 5.  12A MELD is 2nd best.
>Gigi_Miller: EPR M1 REP +22 245
>Eugene_d'Eon: ADEEINR 15A DIE +16 273
#note REIN(V)ADE doesn't fit!  I deserved to lose that money in so many ways.  I got scared of the spot below SNEAKER and made this horrible move.  5J E(WE) is the play.  open that shit up with ADEINR.  come on man!
>Gigi_Miller: EHT 12B ETH +26 271
>Eugene_d'Eon: ABEGNRR 15J .NBEAR +33 306
#note BARGE(ME)N is cool.  But sim likes my play better.  10B ARB wins a 2-ply sim.  7 points.  my magic number for equity loss per turn.
>Gigi_Miller: FOT J4 TOF. +39 310
#note Nice find.  I didn't know TOFF and held for a while until I noticed she could have just played OFF.  
>Eugene_d'Eon: AGIORRY O10 YOR +24 330
>Eugene_d'Eon: AGIORRY --  -24 306
#note With all my mistakes so far, i had a 78% shot of winning with N2 GORY.  33 points.  leave AIR.  close a hot spot.  Hello!?!?  I don't know where I was, and what i was thinking, but WTF!?  I have some rules for remembering bad 3s.  DET* puts you in DEBT.  You're DUMB to play DUM*.  And now I have a new one.  YOR* a f**king idiot!  
>Gigi_Miller: AILNOTU O7 T.N +6 316
>Eugene_d'Eon: AGIORRY I2 GRAY +21 327
#note She probably just picked up the Q.  I still have a 75% shot if I just play N2 GOR, or GORY.  GRAY hands her the game.  My clock was 2 minutes at this point probalby.  Panic!
>Gigi_Miller: AQST E3 QATS +33 349
#note You have 30 seconds on your clock.  Find the winning play!  GO!
>Eugene_d'Eon: IIILORT F2 TI +15 342
#note Nope, that's not it!  Yes, I saw TORII.  Yet again I missed the ME hot spot.  wow wow wow.
>Gigi_Miller: DILOU 2I .LI..D +24 373
#note nice one.  It's over if it's good, and i don't know it so I challenge.
>Eugene_d'Eon: IILOR -  +0 342
>Gigi_Miller: OU 5C OU. +3 376
>Gigi_Miller:  (IILOR) +10 386
