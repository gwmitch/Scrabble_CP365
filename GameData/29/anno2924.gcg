#note Duh... AWEIGH is way better. -6
>Karl: TV 9F V.T +8 22
>Evans: AAEHIQT F5 QAT +23 35
>Karl: ?DNOORS J2 DRONgOS +69 91
#note DROMONS is two points better.
>Evans: ABEHINY 3I B.AINY +28 63
#note Missing YEAH 10G. -3
>Karl: AMT 2L TAM +28 119
>Evans: AEEHOPS O1 HE +21 84
#note Missing POOHS 4H. My play keeps a better leave though. -4
>Karl: GV M1 V..G +8 127
>Evans: AEIOPRS K3 .PO +18 102
#note GO I8 wins the sim by a mile, which makes sense now that I think about it. AEIPRS is way better to fish with than AEIRS, and playing GO with an A, an R and an S in hand is a nice way to open a bingo lane. -7
>Karl: CEU H4 CUE +14 141
>Evans: ADEIRSS 5J ..DS +14 116
#note Again, AEIRS is not that good. Perhaps fish off just one S? WIFES G6 would be fine... -9
>Karl: EEEPT 10H TEPEE +16 157
>Evans: AEINRRS 11J AR +12 128
#note I missed ATTAINER H8, which would have been cool. RIN 11I keeps an awesome leave and opens a nice little bingo lane for me, though. It looks best. -5
>Karl: BHT L9 B.TH +21 178
>Evans: EEIINRS 12L .IE +6 134
#note Quackle likes IRE M7. I disagree -- this play opens a volatile bingo lane to cash in next turn. It seems better. -2
>Karl: CDOR O9 CORD +19 197
#note If he wants to block that spot, he could play CREDO N10? That opens up a new spot though in row 15...
>Evans: ?EIKNRS O7 RE....INg +99 233
#note Yay.
>Karl: AMN N6 MAN +15 212
>Evans: EIKNOSW N10 WO. +29 262
#note Missing WEEK in the same spot. -4
>Karl: ELX 12H LEX +23 235
>Evans: AEIKNSY H12 .AKY +33 295
#note He held. I prayed for a challenge.
>Karl: ILN G11 NIL +18 253
>Evans: AEINOSU 15H .OU +6 301
#note Not the sim winner, but there are a million plays within a couple points of each other, and this is understandably one of them. It blocks the only bingo lane worth blocking and dumps excess vowels. Quackle prefers UNION 14K, which is also good but doesn't block the Y as well. I'm playing it extremely safe here. -2
>Karl: IRU 11D RUI. +8 261
>Evans: AEEIINS D11 .EI +6 307
#note Even after 5,000 iterations, opp's bingo percentage is 0.00000. This play seemed like a no-brainer to me, but Quackle likes fishing off AI at M8 much better. I suppose this is a case of me playing too safe -- I'm more likely to bingo here than he is, so blocking lanes is kind of wimpy here. -9
>Karl: DLO C12 OLD +14 275
>Evans: AEILNSS 15A INS +14 321
#note Quackle wants to just fish off an S for IS/SILEX. I like my play because it puts an I under the triple lane, making eights damn near impossible for him. Basically unless he slaps down FOREGUT/TOE right away, this game is mine.
>Karl: A 2I A. +7 282
>Evans: AEFLSUZ 1F ZEAL +44 365
#note Obviously FUZES is best, and I saw it. But I chickened out on SAB!! I was 99.5 percent sure of it, but I knew that out of SAB and SAR, one was Collins-only, and I was almost positive it was SAR#, but I didn't want to lose the game because I wasn't absolutely certain. Time to review my threes.
>Karl: EGIJORT M7 JOE +45 327
#note JET B10 is actually better. This play doesn't guarantee him an out in two, whereas if he plays JET he's setting up GIRO and he also has GIRON/GROIN at 14K.
>Evans: FSU 14M FU. +12 377
#note I'm supposed to block GRIT, of course. FOE 12B, dumbass.
>Karl: GIRT B9 GRIT +10 337
>Karl:  (S) +2 339
