>Jason: EEILNOT -E +0 0
#note Super-super close. This wins sim by a hair over OE (Randy's pick when I told him the rack).
>Randy_Greenspan: ?ACHQSS 8D QuASH +52 52
#note Randy considered exchanging, and even after playing this asked if it was right. Everybody else agreed, as does Q. No contest. Seeing three power tiles on his first play, for a brief second I wondered if my luck was running out.
>Jason: DEILNOT E7 O.TLINED +66 66
>Randy_Greenspan: CPS 13C SP.C +16 68
>Jason: EKMORTU G10 MURK +33 99
#note Speedy puts KO(P) 2.3 points ahead of this, but in sim giving Randy an S, KOP's 20.6 points ahead. Can you see why?
>Randy_Greenspan: BLRSY C4 BYRLS +28 96
>Jason: CEENOOT 7H ECOTONE +68 167
#note Answer: If I'd held onto MU, I'd have MU(SQuASH) for 63 here.

#note Randy was asking a bunch of people (including Bradley Whitmarsh, who he called a "fisher") whether or not he did the right thing here. He knew MUSQUASH and wondered whether to fish for the U. Debbie Stegman, Paul Avrin and Bradley agreed it wasn't worth it. He didn't want me to corner the tiles; said he was going to ask Adam Logan.
>Jason: DFIILNO 2B DI.L +25 271
#note Like in the second Dackman game, we're burning through consonants so fast, vowel-itis is sure to ensue. Missed LI(P)ID at D11. (-8.4)
>Randy_Greenspan: EGIUV J6 V.GIE +19 214
#note Obviously he hit a U. Put down VOGUE, then VOGIE, then VOGUE, then this and finally hit his clock.
>Jason: FIIINOP I9 POI +17 288
#note Blocking the best lane. Missed PIO(N) or INIO(N) along row 12. (-7.8)
>Randy_Greenspan: AEE 5K A.EE +10 224
>Jason: AFIINRR 6F RIF +17 305
#note (BI)RIANI ... good one to know. FRIAR at 4F and INFR(A) at F4 also finish ahead of this. (-1.0)
>Randy_Greenspan: AJR 4H JAR +24 248
>Jason: AADINRT D11 TA.IR +25 330
#note Nice play, except I scored it as 22. Must've forgotten to count ID.
>Randy_Greenspan: EZ E2 .EZ +31 279
#note ZA there coulda been bad...
>Jason: ?AADNOV G2 OVA +21 351
#note Debated between this or NOVA. Q likes AVA. (-)
>Randy_Greenspan: NU 1G NU +13 292
>Jason: ?ADEHIN 2I AH +32 383
#note Missing (EN)cHAINED, but no need to risk the trip-trip and out. (SPECK)ED is the guaranteed win, Q says. (-10.4)
>Randy_Greenspan: AERSTTU 12I STATURE +72 364
>Jason: ?DEEINN 13K DINEs +22 405
#note Gotta love burning the blank for one more point.
>Randy_Greenspan: AI 6A AI. +5 369
#note AI(M), but he was short on time. What a run...
>Randy_Greenspan:  (EN) +4 373
