#note Not a great play at all, seeing as I whiffed on HERB. This actually isn't a gigantic mistake, as IIP is awful, but I really still should NOT have missed HERB. BI 1D is anoher good choice.

#note Didn't know CARABINE (I never really knew how to spell CARABINER, actually) and didn't know RAPHIA.

#note I had some trouble deciding between this and BAWD. I didn't like the ILNT leave that much though, and preferred DINT, so I played this. Turns out ILNT is better, at least on this board. Also, the points help out.

#note An awful play. I didn't realize TED 3B would actually be best. Also missed BAWLING. I really shoud have realized this play closes the board down prety well. But, is his leave really that bad on this board?

#note How do I miss KIWI? I guess I am having a short attention span in this gam. One thing I must fix. KIWI is the only thing winning more than 1 % of the time. Surprised how badly this sims.

#note I wanted to setup, but this is not right. Out-in-two is far better. OI O14 is best. I really should have thought this through better.
