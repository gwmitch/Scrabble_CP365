#note Missing LAMP(I)ON as a double-double. (-9.9)

#note Down 139 without a bingo? Make one up!
>Brian_Bowman: CEIMNO L1 .ENOMIC +24 197
#note (Scored as 22. This nearly got recounted, too ... would've gained two.)
>Jason: EINPVWX H12 .EWN +30 147
#note Close call. Sims third. VIXEN at 2A and VIEW at J7 (only saw the latter) finish ahead of this. (-2.3)
>Brian_Bowman: AIIO M10 OI.IA +12 209
#note Brian overdrew after GENOMIC; I looked at FIO and put the F back. As Brian put this down he said: "You made the right choice." (Ducky agrees.)
>Jason: EIPSUVX N8 VEX +54 201
>Brian_Bowman: ETW K4 WET +27 236
>Jason: AFIPRSU M3 UP +20 221
#note Fishier than I wanted to be, but didn't see anything better. Remember taking a while on this play. Missed the spot for PFUI (12B), Q's clear pick. (-6.7)
>Brian_Bowman: GLOT 14J GLO.T +20 256
>Jason: AEFIRRS 15B REFRAI.S +65 286
#note Took a while deciding what to fish off ... until I took one last look at that open N. I recall somebody rack-stalking me here (although maybe it was my paranoia), which made me doubly happy to see this.
>Brian_Bowman: DO O9 DO +16 272
>Jason: EGHOQST O12 HOST +40 326
#note GOSH instead. Too wrapped up in taking the extra three points. (-4.1)
>Brian_Bowman: FI 15K IF +20 292
>Jason: EEGJLQU B11 QUEE. +28 354
#note OK, got this board pretty shut up now, but he's probably got the blank and spots to bingo...
>Brian_Bowman: AEINRST 2A STEARIN +76 368
#note He doesn't have the blank? Ruh-roh. "You can almost hear Alex Fiszbein say 'nice find,'" I commented. (RETAINS at C7 for nine more, maybe? There are reasons for passing on it, though ... leads sim, but not by that much.)
>Jason: ABCGJLY 12A J.BA +42 396
#note Ooh! B(U)LGY, which I wish I'd seen, is CP's pick, though this and J(U)GA are close. I lamented not having an I for J(U)ICY. B(U)LGY almost certainly wins given what I drew. Of course, this wins, too, assuming I could play an endgame. (-27.5)
>Brian_Bowman: DEY 13B .YED +32 400
#note The pool looked so good, I thought Brian might empty on the number and go for the bingo. But I think Brian's correct to play the D.
>Jason: ?CGLTVY J7 CaVY +24 420
#note OK, Q says this endgame isn't quite as simple as I thought, but Brian was at 11 seconds; I had more than 10 minutes. Now, not making excuses here, but we were operating on a different schedule than the rest of the room, since we didn't have to wait for pairings. Round nine (second game of the day) was finishing right about the time Brian played STEARIN. So, people were talking in the room, etc. Frank Lee's table was behind me, Connie sat opposite him and she's whining about this, whining about that. So I spent literally four minutes basically sitting there with my finger up my nose waiting for quiet. (I didn't want to get on Connie's sh*t list with an angry "shhhhh!") But I take the blame for not being focused enough. Even when the room was basically empty, I could not wrap my head around this endgame.     Anyway, the analysis. Obviously Brian has O(V)A/A(DO) for 30, unblockable with my rack. In the post-mortem, I thought L(E)V won (leaving two good spots for CaGY), but that surrenders EONIAN/(LEV)O. There are two wins: L(E)GaCY (best) and L(E)ViTY. Looked for sixes to set up an out in two; just couldn't see them. I totally missed (A)EONIAN as an out, too. I just didn't have Brian scoring decently, blocking G(E)LT, and leaving an out. And if he could, he'd probably be surrendering the 30 for OVA. (-31.0)
>Brian_Bowman: AEINNO 3C NINE +20 420
#note A la Shelley Ubeika and Jason Keller, I could write on my scoresheet, "NINE, dipsh*t!" Totally embarrassing to miss that. Heck, totally embarrassing to miss (A)EONIAN. Very disappointing.
>Jason: GLT N8 ...T +16 436
#note G(E)T/(BY)T(E) is one better.
>Brian_Bowman: AO 8M O.A +30 450
#note Missing PRUNABLE, missing BULGY, botching the endgame. Too many mistakes.
>Brian_Bowman:  (GL) +6 456
