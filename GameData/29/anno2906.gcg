>Dallas_Johnson: IINNRRT -INR +0 0
#note I don't mind the exchange.  RIN is an obvious fish type of play, that a good opponent will take note of and create a situation where you can't bingo next turn, or you bingo for the minimum while opening up dangerous lines as your opponent takes the turn to groom their rack to take advantage op the opportunities.  If you had an S, RIN is a no brainer, but without it, I like the exchange.
>Pete_Zeigler: ADFKOPU 8F POUF +18 18
#note I did not know PADOUK, which is a pretty cool play.  POUF was the best play I knew, and I picked the duck-approved placement.  In the back of my mind, I was hoping to be able to use the POUF/POUFF/POUFFE progression.
>Dallas_Johnson: EEINRST J2 ENTIRES +71 71
#note The overlap is very tough to see.  I think ENTRIES was the right choice of the sevens there.
>Pete_Zeigler: ADJKNOX 5I J.NK +30 48
#note I passed on the AX play to get rid of the JK combo.  Duck disagrees.  I figured this was my best chance at multiple reasonably scoring plays in a row.  I think I stand by it.
>Dallas_Johnson: GIMOOVW G7 V.W +17 88
#note This is a bad miss, especially not holding an A.  VOW 7E is better on so many levels.  Only way this could make sense is to set up a big ZA.  Don't panic.
>Pete_Zeigler: ADIOQRX 3H QI.DAR +34 82
#note Best.  When faced with multiple powertile situations, I usually try to get rid of the more difficult one to play first.  And with POX likely to still be there, QINDAR was a no brainer to me, once I saw it.
>Dallas_Johnson: GIMOOOV -GIMOOOV +0 88
#note I don't hate the exchange as much as Duck does, but there are plenty of good plays here.  POMO is a bit aggressive for my tastes, as it leaves too many 30 to 40 point responses while you are drawing to a bad leave, and POO leaves a slightly less dangerous board, but a worse leave.  MOO and POM are just way too aggressive. These are the tough positions where Duck doesn't adequately account for the flow of the game.  
>Pete_Zeigler: DEEGHOX F8 .OX +33 115
#note Duck likes POXED.  I could go either way with it.
>Dallas_Johnson: EEIMSTT E9 MET +27 115
#note No question.  You're opening, but you have an excellent rack to open with.
>Pete_Zeigler: DEEGHIT D10 HEDGE +35 150
#note Hoping to draw the R for the more obscure hook.  It keeps scoring, although it's pretty aggressive.  HIED would be worth considering, if I had put you on a bingo-type rack from your previous play, which I couldn't.
>Dallas_Johnson: EHILSST 14B SH.LTIES +76 191
#note very nice find.
>Pete_Zeigler: AIIRTTU I11 TUI. +5 155
#note Duck likes taking the points at f4, but my play sims far better than it would appear by static equity.  I couldn't leave the H column spot uncontested.  URAEI there would have been interesting... I got hung up on undoubling.
>Dallas_Johnson: DDGINOW 15F ODD +29 220
#note I couldn't block everything...
>Pete_Zeigler: AAIRRRT 4J .AR +24 179
#note best. I briefly considered exchanging, but figured I couldn't afford a zero here.  Good choice.
>Dallas_Johnson: AGIINOW 11I .OWING +20 240
#note Duck really likes fishing here, because AWING or OWING bingoes with a bunch of stuff, and leaves WAIN as a worst case next turn.  I actually like WIGAN/AVOW, which leaves an uglier board while leading.
>Pete_Zeigler: ABIRRTU L8 BRU.T +20 199
#note I missed AIRBURST.  I never would have seen that.  This was my weakest play of the game so far... Missed a bunch of cool plays on rows C and D, and even board killing plays above TOWING beat mine.  If I knew RUBATI or URBIA, I woulda played them in a second.  BURA and TUBA are far better as well.
>Dallas_Johnson: AAEEIOR 8L .ARE +18 258
#note ODEA is cute.  BARE is a rack panic play.  Why open with an awful leave while up?  Every play should accomplish a goal... this had none.  It doesn't score well, it doesn't clean up your rack, and it doesn't create a board in harmony with your rack and the game situation.  AIDE/METE kills the most dangerous bingo line, and starts building a rack.  AREAE cleans up your rack and kills a secondary line.
>Pete_Zeigler: ?AAGIIR 6A GIARdIA +71 270
#note I almost missed the hook. 
>Dallas_Johnson: ACEIOYZ A6 .AZE +42 300
#note GYOZA is sweet.  I like YOGIC best, which immediately threatens ZA for 44 on the next play (plus other cool possibles), while scoring.  GAZE doesn't set up any reall possibilities next play... this isn't a great Y board.
>Pete_Zeigler: AAEILNO C12 AA. +21 291
#note Sim dislikes the fish.  I was slow to recognize how bad the board was.  Duck's philosophy on the best way for me to win seems to be to tie the board up and hope I can keep you from scoring.
>Dallas_Johnson: CEILNOY 15A YO +17 317
#note Just an error.  YOU for points or YO 7L for defense, and they both score more.
>Pete_Zeigler: AEILNOP B5 P.NA +19 310
#note Duck gets very aggressive with POI and POLE winning sim.  Fishing the I with QI is interesting, with 3 Es unseen, PERONEAL is looking at me as a real possibility.  My play is not very good.  I panicked.  although it's close, I should have known better than tying up the board here.
>Dallas_Johnson: ?CEILMN J10 M. +10 327
#note Take the points with 3 Es unseen.  EM 10I
>Pete_Zeigler: EILNOTU N5 LOU.IN. +12 322
#note LOURING sims surprisingly well.  I was almost certain this was a huge error... but Duck seems to realize that you are more likely to bingo than I, and LOURING turns over while killing the bingo line.  I was racing for the high point tiles and hoping you'd miss.  TELOI 4D is best, and I missed it.
>Dallas_Johnson: ?CEILNO 4G LI +15 342
#note very nice.  Wins sim by a ton (14%), despite not appearing in Ducks initial choices. almost guarantees being able to set up something on column O.
>Pete_Zeigler: CEEFTVY 7A ..Y +19 341
#note FEVER is the only play Duck sees winning, and I only see wins if the blank is in the bag.  By this point, I'd put you on the blank. I wanted to extend the game, so a one tile play made sense to me.  I had to hope you missed.
>Dallas_Johnson: ?BCEENO O1 BEaCON +40 382
#note nicely done. not an easy find under pressure.
>Pete_Zeigler: CEEFLTV D1 CLEVE. +28 369
#note Best.  
>Dallas_Johnson: EOS M11 .OSE +10 392
#note OSE 13K for 4 more, but the win is safe. well done.
>Dallas_Johnson:  (FT) +10 402
