>A: EEFNOOP 8G FOE +12 12
#note Missed 8G POOF, but I might have placed it wrongly anyway. FOE is 2nd, losing 0.7 points.
>Zhiyuan: AEIIIKL 7H KAIL +18 18
#note -7.6 here. Best is 7F LIKE, which turns an unpromising AII  leave into a promising setup for ALIKE. I'd play 9F KAIE, which is less defensive. If I sim more, KAIE might win. KAIL is bad in that it uses all your consonants, though LIKE is good because of the turnaround factor.
>A: DENOOOP 8K OO +5 17
#note OO sucks. -14.3 here, 10th. OOPED leads ODEON by 4.9. POLO is 8.1 away from ODEON. I should have just played POLO la. POOLED/LOOPEDPOODLE/OPINED/PEON are around POLO also.
>Zhiyuan: DEEIIIX L8 .XIDE +26 44
#note OXIDE not bad la. 4th, -5.8 here. I'd play DIXIE 9C, which is the best. 9K DIXIE is 4.4 points behind for obvious reasons. 9F DEI is 3rd, -4.8.
>A: DENOPRS 13F PONDERS +77 94
#note I saw FORSPEND, RESPOND, PONDERS but forgot PERNODS. PERNODS wins in this case, though I would say the N on H13 is more defensive. I lose 1.4 equity here.
>Zhiyuan: ABCEIIW H11 WI.CE +33 77
#note This is best.
>A: AFIJMTU F10 JAU. +29 123
#note After 571 iterations, JAUP is 8th, -10.6. I missed FUJI on J4 and 12E (2nd, -2.8). I saw MUFTI M5/B14 but I thought JUMP was more defensive even though JUMPY is a threat. However, JAUP only hooks S, so I chose JAUP. TUFA M8 is the same as 14B MUFTI. I suppose if I wanted to get rid of the J, FUJI 12E would be best. I noticed the crappy leave of FIMT but didn't think of it much! Shouldn't think too much and play balance next time. MUFTI M5 is definitely the move.
>Zhiyuan: ABEIIIW 9G AI +16 93
#note AI is 13th, -7.9. Throwing off the Is is a priority here. Even changing is fair, but since you're behind BIDI 11J does well to deprive me of the K11 square. It also opens another line.
>A: ADFIMTT M8 FIT +25 148
#note FIT tops speedy but drops to 3rd, -1.3. ADMIT wins?! I saw J10 FATED, M6 ADMIT and FIT, but thought FIT was more defensive. ADMT, FT, IMT are all decent leaves but I suppose the FT/IM/IT leaves have synergy which ADMT lacks. Also, given 5 As left, ITA could still be used even if I squander the A. ADMIT looks very very dangeorus to me, but the leave more than justifies the risk.
>Zhiyuan: BEIILUW K10 BIE. +25 118
#note BIER is 2nd, -7.4. LIBRI in the same spot keeps E with the UW, instead of IL. Changing BIILUW is 3rd, losing 12.4.
>A: AADGMRT J11 DR.AM +18 166
#note DREAM sucked, and I knew because it threw the R away. It's 12th, -7.6. I somehow thought he had a bingo and decided to block the E. :S J11 AGED is loads better.
>Zhiyuan: EGILSUW 15J .UESLI +27 145
#note MUESLI loses 9.6. The best moves here are 14B IGLUS and J5 IWI. I'd advise IGLUS 14B even though the fish looks tempting. Fishing gives your opponent a double-double line and good blocking will restrict your bingos to the 15th row. MUESLI is bad in that it keeps GW, doesn't score enough AND throws the S.
>A: ?AGQTTV J6 Q. +31 197
#note This is best. DUH.
>Zhiyuan: EEGIOSW N9 SEW +26 171
#note N10 OWE is best. By now, WZY's win % is 26.66, which means he has to open and gamble in order to win. N9 SEW doesn't open any new lines (it blocks one), uses the (useless-for-bingoing) S AND keeps EGIO.
>A: ?AGOTTV 11A OTTAV. +18 215
#note Assuming no challenge, this move is 6th, -6.9. I was right about only two things: OTTAVA > 11C TAVA, and I have an unplayable GAVOTTe.15B GAVOTTE, 12D AGUTI, 012 VAGI, 12C VATU, N13 VOL are all better.
>Zhiyuan: EGGHIOT A10 H.GTIE +36 207
#note HOGGET best. This move is -6.5, 2nd.
>A: ??CGHNY C7 YaCH.iNG +94 309
#note GYNARCHY and SCYTHING the only other bingos. This scores the most.
>Zhiyuan: DGNNNOU 8A GU.NO +18 225
#note GUANO loses 4 equity and is 5th. D3 DUNNO is more open and keeps GN, so it beats UNGOD/NN even though UNGOD scores 10 more.
>A: AILMORR O10 ROMA +21 330
#note Running out of time. ROM is clearly better but what if I include the challenge? LOL. ROM has the highest equity but loses out to O10 ROIL on win %. Not telling you why HAHAHA.
>Zhiyuan: DELNNUZ N13 ZE. +35 260
#note ZEL best.
>A: AILORSY 14C .AYS +26 356
#note GOYS is better if I wanted to play there. I went for score because I was running out of time. 7C YAY wins A simple blocking move such as 9C COY finishes 2nd. 7C YAY opens a new line exclusive to my S and wins. Assuming I played GOYS, I'd lose 2 points. Gays loses 7.9.
>Zhiyuan: DELNNRU 7B N.ED +15 275
#note NYED owns all your lines! DUNNO is best.
>A: BILOPRR E5 LI.. +10 366
#note LIDO was a desperate move as I was out of time. K5 LILO is best as it maintains the blocked situation.
>Zhiyuan: EELNRTU D2 RULE +10 285
#note RULE loses a hell lot of equity. D10 EAN wins because it doesn't empty the bag.
>A: ABOPRRT 1A PROB +43 409
#note I was kinda stuck but was surprised with RULE. :D
>Zhiyuan: AENNTV 3B VA.NT +16 301
#note F2 VENT.
>A: ART A1 .RAT +16 425
#note Best.
>A:  (EN) +4 429
