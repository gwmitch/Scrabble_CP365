>Matthew: ALNQSTT G6 QAT +18 18
>Craig_Rowland: GIR H5 GIR. +18 26
>Matthew: JLNSTTX -JLTX +0 18
#note Best.
>Craig_Rowland: DEF 7F F..ED +15 41
>Matthew: AEMNSTY I7 ..MY +14 32
#note I fail to see the seven in this rack. It doesn't play, but it's kind of funny. Check out my round 3 game vs. Lou Cornelis to see why. 5H (G)AMY is a bit better. (-0.9)
>Craig_Rowland: III -III +0 41
>Matthew: AEINOST 9A ATONIES +73 105
#note EMMY takes the -S. (-16.9)
>Craig_Rowland: AEEILRS 11D REALISE +76 117
#note And Craig knows it.
>Matthew: IJLOPTU A6 PUJ. +39 144
#note JALOP was more points, but I liked the leave for PUJA better. (-3.3)
>Craig_Rowland: AHKOO B2 HOOKA +34 151
>Matthew: ILNOORT A1 ROTL +25 169
#note Doesn't make Quackle's top 15, but it sims to the top!
>Craig_Rowland: DEFUZ 12A FUZED +51 202
>Matthew: DEIINOX C3 OXIDE +56 225
#note Yes, I did spot J2 IXODID. I'm happy I found OXIDE, though.
>Craig_Rowland: AGN 13B NAG +36 238
>Matthew: AGINORR K8 ROARING +82 307
>Craig_Rowland: ?EILPRT L3 TRIPLEs +72 310
>Matthew: AAEEINU K4 EAU +16 323
#note I would have a hard time taking a chance on 14I EU(G)ENIA or 3I AUN(T)IE. Admittedly, I spotted neither. (-2.7)
>Craig_Rowland: UV G11 .UV +10 320
>Matthew: ABEINVY 13I VI.EY +30 353
#note Aaah... one of those -Y words that doesn't work with -EY as well. Did tolarjev make a list for that one? Unchallenged, VINEY sims best. The correct valid play is M8 BEVY.
>Craig_Rowland: CDEO M2 COED +25 345
>Matthew: AABENNS 5B ..NA +16 369
#note As a Montreal representative, I would like to invoke my right to play one French word per game... BANANES, s.v.p. ROARING takes an S. All the best moves pluralise it. (-14.8)
>Craig_Rowland: W E5 .W +5 350
>Matthew: ?ABEINS N5 SABEINg +67 436
#note Luckbox pulls the blank. Again, the best plays are along row 15. (-34.0)
>Craig_Rowland: TW 8K ..W.T +24 374
#note Craig's fish drew into the other W. Yucch.
