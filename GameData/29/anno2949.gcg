>Jason: AELRRST -R +0 0
>Brian_Bowman: CFIU H6 CUIF +18 18
#note Given my fish, I'm surprised he didn't play FUCI, which  doesn't -S hook.
>Jason: AAELRST 9H .A +6 6
#note Relieved I wasn't missing a bingo. Really having to work hard to stay calm at this point, esp. given the circumstances. I'm surprised Q wants me to add the L. (-3.2)
>Brian_Bowman: ANTW J6 WANT +21 39
#note Trying really, REALLY hard to stay calm after he blocked OLESTRA at 10E.
>Jason: AELORST K6 OLESTRA +80 86
#note Nearly fished off the O before seeing this fit, getting off tilt. Maybe if I'm up 2-1 instead of down 2-1, I don't take the time needed to see this?
>Brian_Bowman: IU 10K .UI +3 42
>Jason: ?ADEGOS 10B DOtAGES +76 162
#note Can't make any specific rack inferences, but DOsAGES at L1 is out, out, out after that fish, even though it's Q's pick. (-2.0)
>Brian_Bowman: CEINOSS L1 OSCINES +79 121
#note Was surprised he didn't play COSINES. Fishing for a challenge, maybe?
>Jason: ?FHIPTU L12 HUP +26 188
#note Missing UPsHIFT. (-26.7)
>Brian_Bowman: AY J11 AY +16 137
>Jason: ?AFILNT 1F FLATIr.N +80 268
#note TAILF(A)Ns is a double-double. Gotta like seeing ??SSSS out when you're ahead by a bunch. (-9.1)
>Brian_Bowman: IQ 9M QI +42 179
>Jason: EJMMOTU 9C JUT +38 306
#note Yay for what the rest of this game would become: Mindless good-scoring board-closing plays. Q likes MOM at 11E ... assuming JUT will still be there? I'd just as soon kill all the good bingo lines. (-4.0)
>Brian_Bowman: ABN 11C BAN +30 209
>Jason: EGGKMMO M13 MEG +24 330
#note Passed on GE(C)KO. Q frowns slightly. (--0.8)
>Brian_Bowman: EW 2L .EW +14 223
>Jason: GKMORVZ N6 ZOR. +33 363
#note Nice try, Brian. (I don't mean that in a derogatory way, either.)
>Brian_Bowman: AENV O5 VANE +40 263
>Jason: DEGKMRV N13 ME +25 388
#note V(I)G at 4K is Q's pick. This spot is hard to block, though the P's out. Plus, I assume V(I)G will be there next turn if I draw mediocrely. (-3.8)
>Brian_Bowman: BER C9 ...BER +34 297
#note Nice scorer and opener. He ain't lying down.
>Jason: DEGIKRV 3J VI.E +24 412
#note I knew this play was lousy, but I made it anyway. Maybe I'd just been drawing so well I assumed the bag would bail me out. Considered Q's clear pick of DRIVE at 2B. I was afraid of HOAX for 88 in response at 1A. (I played JOAX for 102 there in our Woadwage game pre-Cleveland Classic.) (-13.9)
>Brian_Bowman: IOTX 6D TOXI. +30 327
>Jason: DGKLPRT E4 PR.G +14 426
#note Of course, one of DRIVE's advantages is that it limits the potential of this rack happening. But why didn't I play GR(O)K? (-)
>Brian_Bowman: ENO O1 ONE +16 343
>Jason: ADKLOTY B13 YOK +29 455
#note Didn't want to take the chance on KAYO/(JOBBER)Y, get it booted and watch Brian bingo. I'll take the equity hit here. (-36.2)
>Brian_Bowman: DDO A12 ODD +17 360
#note (Counted as 15.)
>Jason: ADHILLT 5E .AH +20 475
#note It's called "blocking the out play". LATHI at I11. Of words I know, LATH is five better than this. (-8.0)
>Brian_Bowman: EEIRR G10 .ERIER +7 367
#note No. 1 in Michigan is mine and a winner-take-all game five awaits.
>Brian_Bowman:  (DILLT) +12 379
