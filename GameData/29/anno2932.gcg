#note Not a favorite of Quackle's. AURIS 10B is it's favorite (I didn't know it) but URARIS is also decent I guess. I don't know though, with so many low scores, I like keeping AIRSS a lot over the other plays.

#note Noooo. VICE is best. Why didn't I spot it??

#note Gail now becomes belaboured with consonants for the better part of the rest of the game, close after escaping serious vowelitis. How awful :-(.

#note Crap! This is what I always guess at unrisen/sunnier. Anywy, M6 UNAI is best.

>Noah_Walton: ABEEIOR M7 BOA +23 342
#note BITE and OATER are Quackle's favorites, as well as EYRIE. I lie EYRIE much better than OATER, although 	Quackle says they're equal.
>Gail_Wolford: FL 11F ..LF +10 237
>Noah_Walton: ?AEEIPR 11K E. +4 346
#note Missing EARPIEcE. Why I am fixated on keepin AEIPR? the next few turns is some random reason that is stupid. AE or somethin else is better probably.  I kinda stoped thinking after NIECE.

#note Championship yes this wins 100% of the time. I'm not so sure. Of course, I had misscored this game as well.
>Gail_Wolford: ?CDEILN H3 NICEL. +15 281
#note She didn't spot the tough DuLCINEA. kINDLY is best here besides that.

#note Didn't know APYREtIC, which, well, basically means not having PYREXIA.
