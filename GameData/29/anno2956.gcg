>Matthew: EEGINOU -EGIOU +0 0
#note Something I knew was horribly wrong as soon as I hit the clock. EGIN is way better than EN.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ABFS 8G FABS +18 18
>Matthew: ADENORT 7F DO +10 10
#note It takes a while, but this does eventually sim to the top. After convincing myself there was no bingo, I wanted to make the fish that left plenty of lanes open.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: GNTW H6 TW.NG +16 34
>Matthew: ADENRRT J8 .TRANDER +63 73
#note Only bingo.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: DEOZ 15F DOZE. +45 79
>Matthew: EEHLLSW K11 HEELS +49 122
#note Best... WEEL does not take the -S.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: JOS 12H JO..S +40 119
>Matthew: ACLRTTW 14D TWAT +16 138
#note Blocked my big spot for CRAWL and doesn't leave me with much. TWAT loses out to 14E TAW. I can't see how a 4 consonent leave is better than a 3 consonent one. I guess the extra 2 points and better defensive position are huge. (-5.2)
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EINU D11 UNI.E +12 131
>Matthew: CEKLNOR 15A COK. +30 168
#note Barely, barely better is C8 CORNEL. More turnover, better defense. (-0.2)
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: IO 6E OI +9 140
>Matthew: AAELNRV C8 VERNAL +28 196
#note C9 VENAL for better score, better leave, better defense. But you need to be confident in your fives to find plays like that. (-7.0)
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EIRT 8A RI.ET +27 167
>Matthew: ?ABEIMU 6H .UBA +12 208
#note None of the bingos were coming to me (BERIMBAU, BUMELIAS, AEROBIUM) so I tried to make a play that would guarantee a bingo next turn. Opening a line while winning = stupid. (-22.0)
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EI 9H .I.E +10 177
>Matthew: ?DEIIMO 5A IDIOM +24 232
#note Baaaaah... MODIFIER. Couldn't find it. IDIOM is next best. (-31.1)
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: OR L8 OR +8 185
>Matthew: ??AEELQ M2 EQuALEd +81 313
#note EQuAbLE for an extra point. Oh well. (-0.9)
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EGIMNRU 2F MERINGU. +69 254
>Matthew: AACPUXY 1G PAX +55 368
#note Got to teach myself to look harder even when I think I've found the obvious move. I played PAX too fast. CRUX is better. (-10.2)
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: FY 5L F.Y +9 263
>Matthew: ACLOUVY N8 CAVY +24 392
>Matthew: ACLOUVY --  -24 368
#note Oops.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: HP D4 H.P +21 284
>Matthew: ACLOUVY N7 LACY +21 389
#note Assuming the worst case scenario (I in the bag and he has GNSTAEI), this is a winning block. Other plays won just by putting the score out of reach... B1 CLOUDY, A1 CLAVI.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AEGINST 3D STAGE +32 316
>Matthew: IOUV B2 VOI. +16 405
#note 10F VIGOR.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: IN E10 IN +10 326
#note -10 points for overtime.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand:  (U) +2 328
