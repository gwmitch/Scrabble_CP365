#note Opening short is wrong here. TWEEDY scores a hell of a lot more, as does YAWED. I'm overvaluing the leave, big time. -8

#note Quackle wants to dump an extra tile and play ENATE. Makes sense, I suppose, since DE is a more balanced leave than AET. -2

#note This is a really, really interesting position. Quackle wants to simply fish off the U for EMU 14L, which actually makes sense because I'm opening a bingo lane taking an S, and I have two natural ones plus a blank, so that's my lane for the taking. And there are more bingos possible there with that leave than I had suspected -- there's CASAVAS, CANVASS, AVGASES, SAVAGES, SAVATES, SALIVAS, SALVIAS,VASSALS and SAVANTS. A bunch of tiles can bail me out of trouble here. Quackle says -6 for SAU, and I'm beginning to see why. Fascinating stuff.

#note REIVED is best. I know the word, sort of, but there was a slight chance I was confusing the E-before-I spelling with something else, so I played DIVER just to be safe. Also, I don't know CERVID. -7
