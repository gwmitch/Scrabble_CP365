>Pete_Zeigler: AEHRVWZ 8D HAZER +42 42
#note Wow.  I did not know, nor would I have ever guessed, WHARVE.  Of plays I know, Duck slightly likes WAVER, which I considered, but I made the conscious decision to take the points.  I forgot how bad VW is as a combo.
>Jason: INNOPUY 7C YUP +21 21
#note Missing Y(A)UPON. (-6.2)
>Pete_Zeigler: IRRSUVW G5 WIV.R +16 58
#note   I was happy with WIVER, and it is just about even in SIM with VIRUS.  
>Jason: AINNNOS 10G NONA +18 39
#note This, ANON at 10F and ANON at 10D all sim within a hair of each other.  
>Pete_Zeigler: AERRSUX F4 RAX +56 114
#note See what happens when one practices rack management techniques effectively?  As if... I get really lucky on the pull, and when I saw NONA go down, I was ecstatic.  The no brainers are fun.  
>Jason: BINOOST J6 BONI.TOS +66 105
#note Knew BONITOES; wasn't sure it went the other way, too. Three spots for it, all better than this. This was scored as 65. (-14.5)
>Pete_Zeigler: ELNRSTV E3 LEV +32 146
#note I agonized over this play.  I was torn between a consonant fish saving the E for practically nothing (VOLT) or this.  Fortunately, I picked right.  The points were too much, and the spot too dangerous to leave much longer. Best.
>Jason: AEIKMST 13C MISTAKE. +82 187
#note As I put this rack in alphagram order, I looked for H1 plays, wasn't sure if KAMIS* was good. I thought "This is a rack I could make a mistake with," and then saw this. I don't know if the two thoughts were related, but if so it makes a darn good story!
>Pete_Zeigler: INORSTU 11A TURIONS +77 223
#note After his bingo-bango, I knew I needed some love with my leave.  At first, I though I missed.  Then, after I took a second look, I saw TURIONS.  Didn't see NITROUS til it hit me the next morning.  TURIONS is clearly better as per Duck.
>Jason: CGGGIST C3 CIGG. +24 211
#note If you're gonna phony, make it worth it. This saved me from an exchange; shocked when Bowman looked at the board after the game and said it was no good.
>Pete_Zeigler: DEIOQRW A11 .WIER +36 259
#note I do not get duck's logic here.  It has QI 14B first, with TWIER 2.5% behind.  It had TOWED as better, when it was 6 points less.  I didn't see a reason to be overly Q scared on this board, and TWIER scored the most while taking the most dangerous spot on the board.  Thoughts?
>Jason: EGILOST H13 .EG +24 235
#note Got off to a good start in six-handed poker, made it to the final three, payout $80/$40. Dallas has about half the chips; me and Pete close with the rest. Find A-K in the big blind and push. Pete insta-calls and I think "Uh oh. He's supposed to deliberate, call, and turn over something like A-5." Fine time to wake up with Q-Q and win the race, knocking me out on the bubble. So, Pete ... even? :)
>Pete_Zeigler: AADDEOQ K5 DADO +21 280
#note Best.  Still not too afraid of the Q, and this time Duck agrees.  I do in the back of my mind, note that the Q is leaving my rack next turn.
>Jason: EILOPST L1 PIOLETS +86 321
#note It's better at L3, but for whatever reason I couldn't be 100% that BAL was good. But what's the worst that could happen exposing a P and I? :) (-4.2)
>Pete_Zeigler: AEFLQUY 2H QUAL.FY +48 328
#note My favorite play of the game.  Took a while to find, once I put together the Q and the -IFY possibilities.  I almost panicked and did the Q dump with QI to block.  Despite retaking the lead and winning sim, QUALIFY only wins 38% of the time.  Duck apparently knows about my ability to blow games, and has factored that into its algorithm.
>Jason: ??ADMNN 12I M.AN +16 337
#note Grateful I wasn't missing a bingo; the only OWL word through the G is AMeNDiNG. Q likes M(O)NAD a bit better. (-4.0)
>Pete_Zeigler: ADEEILT 1L .EAL +28 356
#note So close, so far.  MOAN scared me; there were too many interesting spots on the board, that that play looked awfully fishy. I put him on a blank.  Duck likes PEAT slightly... As much as I have trouble with Ls, I forget DT aren't great together. 
>Jason: ??ADENR 15H .RANDEst +80 417
#note Surprisingly, of the 80-pointers, this sims best by more than a point. I hated dangling that S but didn't have the patience to look for something more defensive.
>Pete_Zeigler: CDEHIOT 3J HO.T +33 389
#note I saw two potential paths to victory.  1. Bingo (unlikely, but with the bag, Jason may not have a great block). 2. Score here, and catch UJ for JUICER and hope the 46 points let me outrun.  I should have committed to one way or the other, either fish with OI/QI (which wins sim, to my surprise) or HOOTED for 45, which scores more and almost assures the win with the JU draw. I went halfways, and it cost me.
>Jason: EEFIOTU 14M FIE +20 437
#note The counter-intuitive OI at 3G is best, setting up (R)EFUTE to go out and 14M plays if he blocks. (-19.0)
>Pete_Zeigler: BCDEEIJ 15A .EBEC +10 399
#note REBEC wins sim, blocking his only out and leaving J spots.  Although the game was lost, I took a lot of pride in finding this play.  RICED and others would have been better, but I was too unsure of JIBER.
>Jason: EOTU 11L OUT +5 442
#note (N)O is seven better.
>Pete_Zeigler: DIJ 6A JI. +13 412
#note and down I go.  Well done, Jason.
>Jason: E 6J ...E +6 448
#note Four bingos and I needed every one. Well played from Pete; I got lucky to stay unbeaten.
>Jason:  (D) +4 452
