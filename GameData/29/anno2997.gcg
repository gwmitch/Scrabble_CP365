>Trevor_Halsall: ESTYZ 8D ZESTY +54 54
>Andrew_Fisher: EGIKMOU F4 MOKI. +21 21
#note Tough move to start, with nothing that's obviously best. Q prefers threes ending in K that fit at 7F, 7G or 9G.
>Trevor_Halsall: ?ABELRX H1 EXoRABL. +110 164
>Andrew_Fisher: DEGILNU 1H .UGLENID +83 104
#note Didn't cross my mind, but Trevor's high-scoring play is no good...ouch! Sensors slightly awry there. I spent ages with DEGILNU knowing there was a bingo, eventually unravelling it just in time.
>Trevor_Halsall: DUW E3 WUD +24 188
>Andrew_Fisher: EINNTUY D4 YU +30 134
>Trevor_Halsall: FFIS D8 .IFFS +40 228
>Andrew_Fisher: AEINNOT 12D .ONATINE +59 193
#note There's also REANOINT, perhaps marginally better, but apart from the trivial TWS opening there's a reason for choosing SONATINE.
>Trevor_Halsall: CEHQU K7 CHEQU. +40 268
>Andrew_Fisher: EOPRTTW 8J T.ROWE +39 232
#note Mine sims best in the end, ROWT/CHEQUER is also pretty good, and WOT 13G similarly opens up the board, but for sevens rather than eights. Trevor gave me 5 for this play, but I haven't factored that into Quackle (I think it screwed up crosstables last time I tried)
>Trevor_Halsall: EIRV 13K RIVE +35 303
>Andrew_Fisher: ?AEIOPT 14E OPIATEs +87 319
#note I probably would have overlooked PATOOTIE had Trevor not provided a hook (not that RIVE is a bad move - on the contrary).
>Trevor_Halsall: ADEHT 15D DEATH +56 359
>Andrew_Fisher: EGIJMOR O12 GRIM +35 354
#note I felt it was best to pick off the RIVE hooks here, saving J plays at 7M for later (Q agrees).
>Trevor_Halsall: EIIPRST L11 PS. +32 391
>Trevor_Halsall: EIIPRST --  -32 359
>Andrew_Fisher: EEJLOOV 7M JOE +42 396
#note Finally some breathing space from Trevor's scoring onslaught, with the faulty S-hook to SONATINE. He mentioned PREDEATH after the game which would have been a cute play.
>Trevor_Halsall: EIIPRST 6B RIP +15 374
#note PREDEATH still looks marginally best, but Trevor finds an intriguing alternative which relies on the minimal front-hooks remaining to RIP. Not initially proposed by Q, it sims second at 42% win.
>Andrew_Fisher: EGLLORV A6 GLOVER +37 433
#note With only one E remaining, the choice of GLOVER over GROVEL is clear.
>Trevor_Halsall: BEINNST 3G B.NNIEST +76 450
>Andrew_Fisher: AACLNOS N10 CLA.S +33 466
#note Lots of guaranteed wins here, but my fairly obscure five seems best.
>Trevor_Halsall: AAADO 4K OD +14 464
>Andrew_Fisher: ANO 10D .ANO +9 475
#note KOBAN or GONNA, using two floaters, are better but not needed.
>Andrew_Fisher:  (AAA) +6 481
