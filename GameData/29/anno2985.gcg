>Jeremy: AEHRSSW 8B HAWSERS +84 84
#note -2.6 8D WASHERS.  Got fancy playing an obscure anagram trying to draw a challenge.  I got held for over a minute, but no challenge.
>Max: ?AESTUV G5 oUT.AVES +62 62
>Jeremy: BEINORR C8 .IRBORNE +72 156
#note -7.6 D5 BRO(W)NIER
>Max: CDITY H11 DICTY +42 104
>Jeremy: ?AGILMT 6F M.LTIAGe +68 224
#note -19 5D GLI(o)MATa.  Upset that Max has blocked both E lines for a giant M(E)GALITh play or a simpler M(E)TALInG, I forget all about the H at B8.  In any case, going up 100+ and not opening a 3x3x lane is huge.
>Max: EEMNORZ 12A ZO.N +46 150
>Jeremy: EKLQRUW 15A WE.K +48 272
#note -1.1 15A KR(E)WE.  There was a temptation to drop A12 (Z)ERK and stop looking, but this play is 3.4 equity points better than (Z)ERK .  A few less points to drop a W is worth it.
>Max: DEEFMRT M6 .XCITRON +100 250
>Max: DEEFMRT --  -100 150
#note This play scares the hell out of me.  I hold it for over a minute, and summon up the courage to challenge.  In 13 games, I do not believe Max has played a SINGLE phony against me.
>Jeremy: ALLQRTU M1 QUATR. +28 300
#note Simmed with knowledge of oppo rack: -13.5 M6 (e)LL.  Blocks the only useful X spot on the board.  Full knowledge greatly changes the sim.  My play is not really too bad (3rd), considering I draw 5 new tiles to exploit the Q in the triple lane which will be useless to Max.
>Max: CINORTX K5 C.ROTIN +36 186
#note A nice play setting up the leftover X at both L8 and 10J while scoring tons.
>Jeremy: ADLLLNS 2L L.LL +8 308
#note Simmed with knowledge of X on oppo rack: -22.4 10J D(I)LL.  First of all I am a little stunned that Max killed that A for the low probability L(A)LLANDS.  I am going to play the perfectly reasonable LALL at J10 to kill the X spot at J10, but I just think he'll score elsewhere anyhow, so I go about opening a scoring lane for myself.  Big stupid mistake.  It would serve me right if he 3x3x with A(L)EXINE right now.
>Max: AX J9 AX +52 238
#note Yeah.  Stupid.  Shoulda, coulda, didn't.
>Jeremy: AADENSU O2 .ANDAUS +27 335
#note -5.7 O1 U(L)NAE.  I play quickly.  I decide to just turn them over, get to the end of the game, and kill that rich line.
>Max: BEIOR H1 REBOI. +28 266
#note A good play that strings out a useful R and E for Max's potential comeback.
>Jeremy: AEEEOPY 14H .EPOY +16 351
#note -13.3 11C (B)EEP(ED).  I'm just trying to kill off bingo lanes.
>Max: EIOU 10A OU.IE +7 273
>Jeremy: AEEIMOV 15K MOVIE +43 394
#note Correct.  For the first time this game.
>Max: EF 11E FE.. +26 299
>Jeremy: AEFGJPT 2F JE.P +29 423
#note Many ply sim: Best.  Highest valuation and a 100% win.
>Max: DGINO 3B DINGO +23 322
>Jeremy: AEFGT B1 FA.GE +20 443
#note Championship player: -18 4A FETA.  I'm out of energy and low on time.  We're not tracking spread, so I'm just playing whatever.
>Max: ADEHIN D1 HA.D +24 346
>Jeremy: T N14 T. +4 447
#note -8 8J T(O).  Whatever.  WIN.  Spread is not tracked.
>Jeremy:  (EIN) +6 453
