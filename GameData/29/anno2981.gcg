>Matthew: AEENORT 8H OE +4 4
#note 8H OE and Exch. O are both very close. OE wins the sim barely in the end.
>Max_Panitch: AEY 7I YEA +19 19
>Matthew: ?ADENRT 6D TRANcED +76 80
#note I spent way too much time trying to find the 2x2. There isn't one. H8 (O)RDiNATE is 77 points, but sims pretty low. 6G vERDANT is best for 76 points and good board position. TRANcED wasn't bad. (-4.2)
>Max_Panitch: ?ACDELS L1 CAnDLES +81 100
#note Max misses a couple 2x2's: CRADLERS and SCRAWLED.
>Matthew: ABDGIIW 3H WADI.G +22 102
#note The best play doesn't mind keeping II: 9F BAWD. (-1.6)
>Max_Panitch: INTU 1H TUNI. +21 121
>Matthew: ABIOPRV 4D BRAVO +28 130
#note PAVIOR same spot is a cool one I don't know. (-1.6)
>Max_Panitch: FOU 5B FOU +11 132
>Matthew: IILPRSX 9F PIX +22 152
#note For a play that's supposed to be a semi-aggressive fish, it cort of blocks a lot of bingo lanes. Best is F1 IXI(A). (-1.2)
>Max_Panitch: EFO 10G FOE +21 153
>Matthew: ILMMRST 11I MM +10 162
#note 6L (E)LM is best! I guess I don't have that kind of balls. (-7.2)
>Max_Panitch: AELNRST 12C RENTALS +71 224
>Matthew: EILRSTV H12 .IVE +21 183
#note This play didn't feel right. I thought I could afford to lose the E as long as I left it in a lane. I wanted to score a few points. C10 VI(R)L was best, but I don't see how I am supposed to bingo after that with so few lanes open. (-8.7)
>Max_Panitch: EGIOO C7 GOOIE. +10 234
>Matthew: IILRRST 8A RI.T +15 198
#note Best.
>Max_Panitch: ADEEGNT 15B TEENAG.D +61 295
>Matthew: IILORSY 5L .ILY +7 205
#note Trying to open as many lanes as possible. Or at least distract Max from closing the existing ones. (-19.5)
>Max_Panitch: Q 10B Q. +31 326
>Matthew: EIIOORS N4 O.IO +6 211
#note OI(LILY) is better. (-3.2)
