#note I never see the word ZEBEC, ever. That leak in my game becomes problematic here. -3

#note Not to get all Kenji/Bihlmeyer about it or anything, but I guess I can infer that Debbie has no A's or E's. Look at 12A.
>Evans: ACEINST C8 ACETINS +84 165
#note I've been studying.

>Evans: EEGIIOT 12B T.GO. +28 233
#note Because this board is sort of crappy for bingos, I decided to worry less about leave and just take the (by far) highest-scoring play. Quackle would rather fish off vowels with GIE D6, and I'm not sure if I agree. -6
>Debbie: PRY 8A PR.Y +39 209
>Evans: ADEEIIT B12 .IE +12 245
#note Sims best. I thought about BINDI/IDEATE before realizing it was batshit insane.
>Debbie: UUU -UUU +0 209
>Evans: ADEIOOT M8 .OOTED +16 261
#note In addition to scoring (somewhat, given the circumstances) decently, this play blocks some of Debbie's bingo lanes, like from the L and from the D in BIND. A 50-point lead with the board starting to close seemed nice to me. Quackle prefers TOO A13, which takes out a nice scoring spot, but given how well Debbie has been grooming her rack, blocking bingos seems more important. I like my play somewhat, but I'm not sure. -8?
>Debbie: AEFN N10 FANE +35 244
>Evans: AIIKMNR 14E KI +18 279
#note This is second-best, behind... MINIPARK! Good lord. -40
>Debbie: ALM O13 LAM +19 263
>Evans: AIMNRRT 7D MIR +12 291
#note I really think Debbie has a blank, so I'm blocking the obvious bingo lane (the PRAYS hook). Quackle wants to play ARM A13, though, which makes a lot of sense. My bad. -10

>Evans: ABNRRUU 5B BUR. +7 352
#note Opp's bingo percentage is a minuscule 0.192661 percent after this play. BURP and BURR, into the P and R in PRAY respectively, are similarly good defensively.
>Debbie: EL C3 LE. +6 317
>Evans: ?ANRRUW B2 gAR. +14 366
#note Again, just trying to minimize Debbie's bingo chances by blocking the L. I don't really care about burning the blank, it's not like I'm bingoing and there aren't even that many ways of scoring with it. But I'm open to suggestions here... maybe GARB isn't the best idea.
>Debbie: E 3B ..E +3 320
#note This is actually sorta brilliant. Not an easy setup to block.
>Evans: GINRUWW D2 W.I. +20 386
#note ...but I manage to find a way. Finally, Quackle and I agree -- this is the best play and a 100 percent winner. No bingos from the W.
>Debbie: ?EHLNOT 15F sHOT +26 346
#note SLOTH is better, of course. But the best play is the uber-creative ON G13, which sets up an unblockable ONE/ETHYL out next turn.
>Evans: GNRUW 10B W. +13 399
#note GRUNT I11 is best by far -- blocks her outs (LENO, LENT) and guarantees multiple spots for me to play out next turn with my W.
