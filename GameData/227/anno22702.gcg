>Jonathan_Lindh: EMRSSWX 8E MEWS +18 18
#note 4th best! 8F SMEW and MEWS at 8G are better. This is -2.1. I probably do SMEW. Right idea though. My only winnable game of the day!
>Al_Helfgott: ?DEIINT H1 aDENITI. +77 77
#note 2nd best play for Al! DIRIMENT for 90 at E4 is best -13.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABKMRSX I1 MAX +43 61
#note Best!
>Al_Helfgott: GOV G3 VOG +33 110
>Jonathan_Lindh: BIIKRST E8 .IRK +20 81
#note 4th best play! D4 BIRKS is best! I agree. -6.6.
>Al_Helfgott: AQUY 12B QUAY +46 156
#note I get whacked with the Q again by Al. Tim and David whack me with the X.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDIINST 13A BIND +32 113
#note Best!
>Al_Helfgott: FI I6 IF +20 176
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIOPST 10A POET.IES +64 177
#note Best! And only bingo!
>Al_Helfgott: IZ A8 ZI. +42 218
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADFLNR J1 AD +20 197
#note J5 ALFA! I agree. I hated this turn. -6
>Al_Helfgott: GU A13 .UG +18 236
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFHLNRT J4 HALF +26 223
#note 2nd best play! 1H AMARANTH is insane! Nigel Richards ish! -9.8 but WHO FINDS THIS?
>Al_Helfgott: ACELO H10 .OLACE +27 263
>Jonathan_Lindh: ELNRRTT K3 RENT +21 244
#note Best play! For the 4th time today, I get torched on a best play!
>Al_Helfgott: AELRRSU L6 SURREAL +71 334
#note Best play! A strangely fitting word for getting torched on a best play! ALLURERS for 66 was his backup.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIJLRT 11J GN.W +16 260
#note Rack not recorded. I needed to open something fast so I count this as best!
>Al_Helfgott: IJ 13H .JI +18 352
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDELORT 15G R.BOLTED +62 322
#note PHONY! But since Al let it go, best play! 14H COD is best valid play! I also blocked ACONITE from his rack!
>Al_Helfgott: ACEINOT N11 NICA. +25 377
#note 14F COCA for 28 is Al's best play. This is -13.3. Good to know I'm not the only one who makes mistakes.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEEHOY G12 AH +29 351
#note -9.5 to Q but this or L2 HEY or YEH are best. I saved those for the next turn., So i don't think this is a miss. I say no equity loss.
>Al_Helfgott: ENORSTU D2 TENOURS +77 454
#note Things didn't work out this game!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEOOPY L2 YEP +34 385
#note Best play! However, I need to do C3 PAY for 31 to block Al's out.
>Al_Helfgott: ?EOTV E1 VOTEr +22 476
#note "Make this a D, R, or S." Al is always funny!
>Al_Helfgott:  (AEOO) +8 484
#note Excluding the phony and the GNAW play which I didn't record my rack on, my total equity loss was -24.5 and -14.7 excluding the ridciulous AMARANTH. The miss of BIRKS may have decided the game but Al just drew better to be honest.
