>Jonathan_Lindh: AEHJLPU 9F HALE +28 28
#note Yeah PUJAH 9D. Saw it. Chickened on it. Mine ended up being ok. Q says -15.7 but it worked out. You'll see why JPU isn't the kiss of death.
>Al_Helfgott: GOW 10E WOG +29 57
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEJOPU 11B JUPE +36 64
#note 2nd best play and only partial rack! 11C JEEP is #1. Mine is 2. -1.
>Al_Helfgott: AGHN 12C HANG +35 92
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EORTTV 10I TROVE +15 79
#note -1.9 but this ended up being bad.
>Al_Helfgott: EQSUY N6 QUEYS +50 142
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BDNORT M9 B.ND +20 99
#note 10th best play! I couldn't come up with M9 BETON. It's safer and scores more because of what comes next! -9
>Al_Helfgott: FILMY 13I FILMY +56 198
#note REALLY UNLUCKY!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BEIORT O1 rEORBIT +90 189
#note Best play! Actually I played REORBIT*. Oops.
>Al_Helfgott: S 8N .S +33 231
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDIILOV 2K VOIC. +20 209
#note 3rd best play! OVICIDE for 42 was a HORRIBLE MISS. -20.6
>Al_Helfgott: AO L9 A.O +16 247
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEILNTU 14E UNITED +25 234
#note 2nd best! DILUENT would play if I did OVICIDE. -.3
>Al_Helfgott: ADM 15G DAM +35 282
>Jonathan_Lindh: EFGILRR 3L IF +22 256
#note Liking FORGE here. I don't like what I did. -10.4
>Al_Helfgott: AET 15C EAT +6 288
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EGLRRR 4H GRRRL +22 278
#note Best!
>Al_Helfgott: EL 13F EL +12 300
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEEIRW 3G WAE +17 295
#note Best play!
>Al_Helfgott: NOT 5G TON +10 310
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEIOOR 6F OI +6 301
#note 6th best play! Maybe exchange? My play sucked and probably cost me the game! -3.1
>Al_Helfgott: CKTU E3 TUCK +27 337
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DEEORS D2 DE +5 306
#note 14L ES for 18 is an intriguing choice. There is another S out and that play neutralizes the spot. -10.7 but I NEED lanes!
>Al_Helfgott: AIINNSX C1 AIN +15 352
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEORSX D2 ..X +40 346
#note This is best!
>Al_Helfgott: AIINS 14M SIN +18 370
#note Al needs to do 7C NISI for 18 in order to block my outplay! This is 7th best.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEORS 7A AROuSE +19 365
#note Best play! Along with many other things!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (AI) +4 369
#note I went over by a minute. Good to know the score was correct. This was winnable. Around -72.9 lost equity but some of that was opening the board on DE so real total is -62.2. Not as badly played as I thought but should have won. Once again around -4 to -5 lost equity a turn.
