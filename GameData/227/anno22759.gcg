>Joey_M.: AAFMRUY 8G FURY +20 20
#note I liked this more than FUMY, since the M deals with AA pretty well.
>Mack: BCEIIUV 9C CIVIE +20 20
#note I could also play this at 7C, but the difference between the two plays is negligible.
>Joey_M.: AAEIMNO E8 A.ION +16 36
>Mack: BBEMOQU D8 B.MBO +47 67
>Joey_M.: ?AEGIMR 10G MAnGIER +71 107
>Mack: AEEQTUX J3 EXEQU. +45 112
#note 11G EX is a reasonable alternative I didn't see, but I would choose this anyway since I'd rather score more and go for the unseen blanks. Also, I generally fare better on an open board against Joey so this is better for offensive purposes.
>Joey_M.: ADGILRW 5E GLADI.R +36 143
>Mack: ADFNTWY K9 W.FTY +28 140
#note Or DRAFTY, but I wanted to get rid of the W at this point.
>Joey_M.: GNOSTUW M9 W.UNG +26 169
>Mack: ADEHNTV 3G HAV.NED +44 184
#note I strongly considered H10 ADVENT as well, but I liked this to turn over an extra tile for the blank and esses and also to block the H1 spot, which is much easier for Joey to use for a 40-point score than H10.
>Joey_M.: HILNOST 4L HOLT +29 198
>Mack: DEEINPT O1 PIT.ED +27 211
#note Or TEPID, but scoring 3 more points and turning another tile over seemed much more important than keeping a slightly more bingo-prone leave at this point in the game.
>Joey_M.: EINNSSZ H10 .ZINES +48 246
>Mack: ENORSTU 15A TONSURE. +77 288
>Joey_M.: AIINOOS 13K .O.I +8 254
#note I have most of the remaining hooks for this, so it's not overly dangerous.
>Mack: ADEEJOT 14B JOE +42 330
#note Unfortunately I can't do anything about the new lane Joey created, but I do have this high-scoring play instead. I also debated AJEE, but keeping an E seemed valuable here with few unseen.
>Joey_M.: ?AILNOS O8 tALIONS +80 334
#note That was a bit of an overkill draw.  I actually wanted something better scoring.
>Mack: AADERST H1 RE.D. +27 357
#note Apparently I'm supposed to fish off an A with WAW here, which I considered. The problem with that play is that Joey will often have a play like KEA at H1, giving him a small lead with one in the bag and nowhere for me to bingo. Unless I have an atrocious draw after READD, I feel like my chances of winning up 23 with one in the bag are pretty good. I should be able to go out in 2 and score reasonably well, especially if I pick up an E for NATES at I10. Quackle says READD wins only 45% compared to WAW's 65%, but I'm not convinced.
>Joey_M.: ACEKPRT 14G P.RK +24 358
#note PECK wins 6 out of 8 endgames, while PERK only wins 5 of 8.  Will that be the difference?
>Mack: AAAELST 13E STA.E +25 382
#note 1G AREAS followed by L8 TAEL wins by 7 instead of 3, but spread was totally irrelevant so I took the sure win with STANE once I verified that it was enough.
>Joey_M.: ACEOT 2C COATE. +15 373
#note The O was a tile of death, whether I had chosen PERK or PECK.  Oh well, kudos to the Mack truck!
>Joey_M.:  (AAL) +6 379
