>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAABIN H6 ABA +10 10
#note I guess aggro with my blank and set up an S rather than a B? Not sure I agree with Quackle's analysis here.
>Bernard: CFL 6G C.LF +17 17
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AGIIKN G6 .AKING +26 36
#note Ugh, I chickened out of PAIKING. Or forgot about it while looking for something I was more sure of! Bleh
>Bernard: NO F7 NO +14 31
#note This turn, I noted how the top left quadrant was basically completely closed at this point. Bernard said while playing this that he was reopening it. I thought "oh shit, if he hadn't said that I would have thought SNAB wasn't a word! I gotta review my 4s... Or could it be that he is confused with SNAB?"

I came to the conclusion here that Bernard was the one that was confused about SNAB*'s validity.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIOWXY H11 IXnAY +69 105
#note Would anyone spare the blank here and sacrifice 38 points with 10E IX(N)AY? Interesting.
>Bernard: ACO I3 COA. +9 40
>Joshua_Sokol: EJNOUVW 13G U.WOVEN +34 139
#note Took me forever to almost miss this
>Bernard: DEOR K10 DRO.E +18 58
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIJTTW 12J J.W +45 184
#note Of course! I'm setting up my T much more safely and for more points with the 43-pointer... Stupid rare positions not causing me to hesitate... :D 12J is better!
>Bernard: QV -QV +0 58
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEIOTT 14J T.E +23 207
#note hoping he has a bingo and then what, that I draw a consonant? Pretty volatile for wanting two sort of unlikely scenarios (especially paired together) to occur
>Bernard: ?AERSTU 3G Un.RATES +70 128
#note number one occured! TrEASUR(Y) plays at 15A!
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEIOTU L3 .UTEE +10 217
#note Deciding to play it safe here, but I was close to playing 2L ETUI!
>Bernard: GIINPRS 15L PING +42 170
#note Told me he considered SPRING 15K too! I told him that would have been a great counterintuitive play, setting up his IN being almost as valuable as keeping the S!
>Joshua_Sokol: BEHILOY H1 BO.Y +45 262
#note Not fun here to be letting him first dibs on two triple line bingos, but after a bingo the board will be nice for me and 
I won't have much to worry about besides getting outrun
>Bernard: GI 10E GI. +6 176
#note Bernard has other plans for this board :)
>Joshua_Sokol: EHILQRZ N1 QI. +24 286
#note 2M REZ sets up my Q and does the same thing as QIS without giving back 40 points. Though it sheds my Z, it is a better play I think. I got sort of paranoid here and wanted to close things down quick. But I failed to realize Bernard just set his A up, so there will be no closing down this board. Bad mistake.
>Bernard: DI O1 ID +45 221
>Joshua_Sokol: EHLRRTZ M7 HERL +21 307
#note not sure this was my rack
>Bernard: AM K3 .MA +18 239

#note oy
>Bernard: S J12 ...S +11 261
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEHLST 13C H.D +14 456
