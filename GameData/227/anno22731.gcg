#note Damn it. I always miss JESUIT. I guess I am indevout. And JEU is better.
>Norma: HRT H12 R.TH +24 133
#note Missing HURT. This will hurt.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEILSV 15A DEVILiS. +95 150
#note Actually she might have forgone HURT not to give me a T to play through. lol...
>Norma: IMO K10 MOI +20 153
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIILOY C9 CO.EY +44 194
#note I wondered if COZIE had a better static evaluation than COZEY! I knew that in this position it was close between the two, though. COZIE does have a better value, but COZEY is 6 more points! ILI isn't too bad with only 3 more I's to come. I think I prefer my play!

>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIIIR L11 DEAIR +24 248
#note missed IRADE! But I missed something even cooler that is probably the best play... IRADE would have gotten me a free turn I think.

#note Norma was blind to 14E. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINRTU G13 .U. +12 285
#note This turn was really really interesting! But fishing just had too much value, as it also blocking a big X-bomb. The other options were H1 AUNTIE and 5E UR(A)NITE for 28, marching on the part of the board Norma just opened.

#note damn
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEINRT 4I ARENITE +72 357
#note Oops, TRAINEE. Didn't see that it fit
>Norma: BOOPY M7 POBOY +26 306
#note or N2 POTBOY! 
>Joshua_Sokol: AGORRSV 8L V.GS +36 393
#note Shoot, missed O3 S(E)ROVAR. This was slightly paranoid, but I don't think I can easily lose after this. A 3x3 seemed like Norma's easiest way out.
>Norma: OU E5 .OU +6 312
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEHRRT 14F H.. +26 419
#note Norma can't bingo here, amazingly. So best to empty the bag with 13L (A)AH
>Norma: ?AEGGNO H8 .G +3 315
#note She has to give up here, or play M3 G(I). But the worst case scenario wasn't meant to occur. She has to assume I have the Q. Or else...
