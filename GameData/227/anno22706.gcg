>David: AMRT 8E MART +12 12
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENOQUW F6 QU. +32 32
#note 5th best play! Quackle says -5 but I like keeping the front hook.
>David: ELT E8 .ELT +12 24
>Jonathan_Lindh: AELNOOW 5E WAE +25 57
#note 10B WOOL! This was the highest scoring though. 10th best but I'm fine with my choice to take out the AQUA hook. -2.5 to the duck.
>David: MSTU 12C MUST +19 43
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?IJLNOO C10 JO.ON +28 85
#note 4th best play! I saw Quackle's #1 13A JOIN but I like C10 JOMON best because it gives less back. Plus he might be tempted to play JOMONS* which I would auto challlenge! -2.8 to the Duck but I like mine best.
>David: ?EINORS 15A VASE +39 82
>David: ?EINORS --  -39 43
#note REJECTED!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ADILOT 14B A.TIcOLD +66 151
#note 4th best play! I had a brain freeze on this one. D1 DILATOr for 75. My play gives too much back. -9.
>David: EIV H12 VI.E +33 76
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEEFFGN 9D F.E +20 171
#note 15G FEEB! I agree. Mine is 6th best. -4.1. Mine is highest scoring though!
>David: AY 15A AY +20 96
>Jonathan_Lindh: BBEFGNN -BBFGN +0 171
#note Play G13 BOB for 21? Eh exchanging is best I feel. 2nd best exchange. 4th best play but -10.2 to Q. I disagree.
>David: DEEHNPR 13G H.E +24 120
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EIIKNR 4G pINKIER +73 244
#note Best play! Along with dINKIER and hINKIER.
>David: BUY M2 BU.Y +18 138
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEEIIL 2J CEI.A +30 274
#note Best play! However for the 2nd game today I get torched with the X!
>David: OX 1K OX +36 174
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGILNRR 7H ERRING +12 286
#note  Mine is the most defensive option but J5 INLY for 26 is Quackle's #1. I like mine ok. -13.1 to Q but I'd do mine again.
>David: FI 5J IF +26 200
#note INLY doesn't give him cheap points here.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEELNOT D3 NOTE +15 301
#note I would do LEE the next play! -9.6 but mine is fine.
>David: ACDNRUW C3 AD +13 213
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEELLNT 6H LEE +20 321
#note 4th best play! I don't like 2A CEL. -3 but I do again. My play scores the most.
>David: H 13B H. +14 227
>Jonathan_Lindh: BCLNTUW B3 CUB +16 337
#note 8th best! 2A CUB is not defensive enough for me. Q says -4 but I go with mine.
>David: EIORRSS O2 SORRIES +84 311
>David: EIORRSS --  -84 227
#note ORRISES and SHO! This was a bad miss for David!
>Jonathan_Lindh: LNOPTWZ 8M OWN +21 358
#note 3rd best! A10 PLOW for 19 is best! I agree -1.7
>David: EIORRSS M7 ..R +5 232
#note Missing ORRISES and SHO which I neglected to block.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ALOPPTZ A11 ZAP +23 381
#note 7th best! 1N ZA for 44 DOH! However blocking has merits even if I'm convinced he doesn't know ORRISES. -13.9
>David: EINORSS 3H OI +8 240
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADGLOPT 10M POD +15 396
#note 5th best play! I like blocking more than D11 PUTTO because of his S's. -6.4 to Q but once again I disagree.
>David: DENRSSS 11J DRESS +22 262
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAGGLNT A5 ALANG +22 418
#note Best play!
>David: ISV A1 VIS +24 286
#note Best play! David originally forgot to take the V out of the bag. This was better than IS/CEIBAS which he played at first to go out lol!
>David:  (GT) +6 292
#note -85 equity in total but a lot of misses were intentional defensive plays which don't sim well in Quackle. Unintentional equity loss was closer to -50. Only around -5 a turn or -3 unintentional equity loss total. I am trapped in STEE ville!
