>Joshua_Sokol: EEILMNT L12 EM +22 52
#note I have to hope she misses her bingos here and gets frustrated. Otherwise if I think she will see something I should play EMETIN for 35. 
>Norma: ?AENSSU M12 SUN +22 60
>Joshua_Sokol: EILLNTT K3 LINTEL +14 66
#note Here is where I start playing extremely poorly due to tilt. SUN takes an N, dumbass! LITTEN/SUNN may draw a challenge.
>Norma: ??AEEES 15H rElEASE +72 132
>Joshua_Sokol: AABINRT O13 BAR +33 99
#note BRANTAIL... I vowed not to miss that word when I started watching Game of Thrones with little Bran (I think that's his name)
>Norma: AEHRU 3I HA.ERU +26 158
#note very nice!

>Norma: IL O1 LI +17 175
>Joshua_Sokol: HIINPTV I11 HIP +17 152
#note 4G PHI for the same amount of points is definitely better positionally. and I12 HIV(E) might be the perfect play for the position I'm in. Prepare for a closed board, with either a comeback or a late bingo.
>Norma: OSW L1 WO.S +26 201
>Joshua_Sokol: DINOOTV 1H INDO. +27 179
#note I was kicking myself after this play for missing DIVOT. Jeez
>Norma: ACDI 2E ACID +16 217
>Joshua_Sokol: DOOTTVW E2 .VOW +20 199
#note At this point I'm probably going to have to catch up without a bingo. Therefore I shouldn't allow many scoring spots the time of day, so I need to sacrifice 3 points to keep it more under control
>Norma: GMO M7 MOG +20 237
#note not sure why she didn't play it at D4. Big mistake
>Joshua_Sokol: AADOOTT O7 DATO +30 229
#note Really close here between keeping the T and playing it. I slightly favor playing it in hindsight with DATTO instead.
>Norma: EENNORR O4 FO +20 257
>Norma: EENNORR --  -20 237
#note ouch
>Joshua_Sokol: AABKOOT D4 BOOK +33 262
#note time to set it straight. Got the break I needed.
>Norma: FO 6B FO. +14 251
>Joshua_Sokol: AACDEGT 14D CADGE +14 276
#note this was a bad play! I didn't realize the Z was still out, which would allow her to outscore me relatively easily here after CADGE. I have to play GAD(IS) at 4H.
>Norma: R E14 .R +2 253
>Joshua_Sokol: AALNRTY 8A NARY +51 327
>Joshua_Sokol: AALNRTY --  -51 276
#note Figured she could only have one rack, EEINRS. I am wrong. The only reasonable rack for her is PENISR, going for FIREPANS/PANFRIES. She wouldn't indiscriminately fish and also miss REFINERS. So FEZ is in the bag before her play. The only thing I need to worry about is (Y)EZ, but YAN(K) was definitely my best play. I got really greedy and wanted there to be an 100% win. In fact, I didn't even need to worry about YEZ, as it leaves her with PRINS, so I can just go out in two and win. 
>Norma: EEINPRS 3C RE. +23 276
>Joshua_Sokol: AALNRTY B6 .ATLY +19 295
#note But I could still win! Whew!
>Norma: EFINPSZ 13E FE +14 290
#note one of the ugliest games I have ever played.
