>Naween: DEGHILR L7 DRE.GH +24 69
#note KITH for 19 is the standout favorite here as 8/26 combinations result in a bingo on row 11 in addition to the floaters on row 10.
>Tony_Sim: BOY 11J BO.Y +39 138
>Naween: CEEILUU 8K U.EIC +21 90
#note CURULE which I didn't know is best here but only marginally.

>Tony_Sim: AE 10E AE +20 178
>Naween: EFHLOSZ D10 FEZ +36 142
#note Ordinarily I'd play ZHO for 40, but Tony's previously play suggests a strong leave so I try and take out one of the bingo lanes despite being 70+ behind.

#note Not the best time to run out of vowels - all I can do is try and score as much as I can.
>Tony_Sim: ADELPTT 4H PLATTED +84 287
>Naween: ?EGJLRS M3 J.E +20 199
#note I'm in serious trouble now. I use my only vowel to feign an opening. Quackle like GEL for 21 at F12 which I don't agree with.
>Tony_Sim: AIR 2M AIR +17 304
#note Tony takes out one spot
>Naween: ?EGLQRS N1 Q. +11 210
#note I don't even know what I'm doing anymore...surely this can't be right, right?
>Tony_Sim: NO 5J NO +10 314
>Naween: ?EGILRS 14A GRISLEd +71 281
#note PLaying the bingo here is correct.
>Tony_Sim: ?AEIIOR 15F LORIONS +77 391
>Tony_Sim: ?AEIIOR --  -77 314
>Naween: ?AAFOOV 15F FAVA +36 317
#note My draw is terrible except for the blank, however I get thrown a lifeline and I can also workout the 11 remaining tiles in the bag. FAVA is easily best.

ROSINOL was the play earlier...
>Tony_Sim: ILNOORS A8 LOOSIN. +27 341
>Naween: ?MMNOOV 2L V... +7 324
#note I wasn't expecting Tony to make such a bold play and with only about 8 minutes on the clock, I'm under massive pressure.

VAIR sims very strongly with the two bingo lanes open and can outrun QI/IRE if I draw well.
>Tony_Sim: CEEIRRT 14I TIERCER +74 415
>Tony_Sim: CEEIRRT --  -74 341
#note So obviously I'm happy to see this come down. Now I figure that Tony figures that I have two unblockable spots to bingo hence he's tried a phoney bingo.
>Naween: ?IMMNOO 13C Me.N +40 364
#note I'm looking for 7s and I can't for the life of me see anything I'm confident with. I'm thinking MONOMIC*, MORMION* etc and then I see something that may just be able to outrun QI/IRE...

What I didn't see was the spectacular OMNIfO(R)M with the multiple overlap.

Tony tells me after the game that he actually mistracked and tried a desperation phoney thinking I had two unblockable spots.
