#note Same position as my first game with Norma, at least this time I am in a relatively favorable position. I think she will find a bingo no matter where I play, but J1 TRAILER is definitely best. I can't believe I missed that. My biggest thing here was leaving E(SCUDO) open, since I don't think Norma knows/sees it.

#note I made a counting mistake here, giving her 308. Norma had made the same mistake or a similar one, it seems, her having herself at 308 after this play. :(

#note Normally K9 (R)ITZ comes down, but this is a cute Z setup and gets rid of those annoying I's once and for all. And keeps a huge Z-bomb at A11 alive, although that one is quite unlikely to occur. Hey, at least I can see plays like this at the dwindling hours of the night.
