>Joshua_Sokol: ?FLORSW H4 FOWLeRS +82 82
#note Wow! Can't believe this position came up again! And I'm revealing the correct play to the world. Play FOWLERS with EFLORSW as a first rack, as you should be the only person at the table that knows its 3-letter extension, BAT(FOWLERS). You can use that to your advantage, so that makes the difference. Also, WILDFLOWERS/WILDFOWLERS! And WATERFOWLERS... Crazy words. If you play FLOWERS there are far more extensions, and if you want to study those up, you can do so as well, but your opponent is likely to know a couple.
>Ella: AADEKMO -  +0 0
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEIOT 10B COATEE. +17 99
#note I liked this play for its long term benefits of closing much of the right side, but overlapping with G5 TOEA also has its benefits. CO(S)IE is the spread play. Play that if you don't mind losing a few games you wouldn't have lost if you played more conservatively.

#note Now that I have a B, time to go for it!
>Ella: ADP B13 PAD +27 57
>Joshua_Sokol: ABCEEIN 4H .IANCEE +24 230
#note so close! But this was a horrible, horrible mistake that I will never forgive myself for making. I played this instead of the anagram, which might a) get challenged and is b) less likely to be overlapped, blocking what I am fishing for.
>Ella: Q I3 Q. +21 78
#note And in a few seconds, my life was crushed. I actually banged the table and yelled "F*CK!" when she did this, as I had already seen that I could have played FAIENCE. She knew FAIENCE though.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABETUY E8 BU.TY +37 267
#note Cause I HAD THE EXTENSION. I was so pissed off that just waiting one second to see FIANCEE's anagram, I would have been able to play BATFOWLERS for the second or third time in my life. I don't know if I'll ever get the opportunity again. Ugh.

#note was pretty sure RETES* was phony cause of RETEM. But I didn't care. I was PISSED!
>Ella: EH A14 HE +33 137
>Joshua_Sokol: NOOPRTU 13I PUNTO +36 382
#note RETES --> RETEST should never happen ever again. OK guys? 
>Ella: MU 14J MU +22 159
>Joshua_Sokol: GIIIOOR -IIIOORV +0 382
>Ella: BDERV 14M DEV +21 180
#note she almost blocked me by playing 15K BRED. That would have been even more devastating, which is really impressive after BAT(FOWLERS) being blocked that I could get even more frustrated.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGOSTT 15E GjETOST +79 461
#note Obviously GhETTOS and GETOuTS are better, but I was not missing this word again. Now I have erased something else off of my bucket Scrabble list.
>Ella: BDN M3 B.ND +14 194
>Joshua_Sokol: AFIOORY 6J FOO.Y +28 489
#note phonying again cause I'm still mad
>Ella: GMNU 5D MUNG. +16 210
>Joshua_Sokol: AAIIIOR 6C OI +6 495
#note This is the best endgame I could find after many minutes of deliberating. Obviously she could have missed ZIRA(M) but she could also miss VIVA which makes OI best even if she misses ZIRAM. Can you find a better endgame? Quackle thinks it can but it cannot.
>Ella: AGIIRRZ 4C ZA +32 242
#note -17 to blocking VIVA with VIVA :)
>Joshua_Sokol: AAIIR O12 .I.A +30 525
#note -2 to blocking GRI(Z) with RIA. Oops.
>Ella: GIIRR N2 GI. +12 254
#note -17 to GRI(Z)
