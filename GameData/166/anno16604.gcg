#note this would turn out to be the most heart breaking game of the tournament. I thought going into the game that Evan might be more of a TWL player, but was definitely proven wrong, evidenced also by his strong top 20 finish. I also blame Evans for everything because he made me drink coffee.

#note I realized shortly afterward that WAGONS must be a better play.

#note this was the play that convinced me that this guy knew him some CSW

#note it is crazy that I got away with this, but he didn't even hold. given NOUNY# I guess I just assumed this was good!

#note I really shouldn't have challenged, but I was frustrated that he bingoed on this closed board and blocked NURDIEST# all at once!
>JD: DEINRSU B10 U. +12 218
#note my third missed bingo of the tournament, and for the third time, a CSW natural bingo that I had never studied. BURNSIDE.

>Evan_Cohen: OP 14A OP +21 299
>JD: BEHLORS 2F BL..HE +25 353
#note it seemed important to dig into the bag as much as possible and pick up a blank. there must be some big play that I can draw into with EHLRS because otherwise I don't get why that would be such a wonderful leave to keep.
>Evan_Cohen: ?AEIKLO N5 KEItLOA +79 378
#note oh no! he still had BOATLIKE at K7, but this was still rough luck on this dead board
>JD: CDEIORS O1 DORISE +42 395
#note unfortunately, he also failed to give me a spot for DISCOER#/SCODIER#. the question is whether I should fish or not - playing shorter leaves him with a tougher decision, and I still bingo about 50% of the time, which seems to be my winning chances in this situation. Instead, I went for taking out the big scoring spot at the top-right and trying to draw the blank or maybe an outplay, figuring that it would be difficult for him to score enough to beat me. in retrospect, if I play OD at 2A, then he would have to play at O11 to block my best lane, and I might be able to outrun him from there by playing at the top-right.
>Evan_Cohen: AAEGPRR O11 APGAR +35 413
#note nice play, one of his 4 that wins the game.
>JD: ?ACNOU 14J CANOl. +26 421
#note I did actually draw outs (RANCOUR and CANDOUR) but I still lose by 3 points. Under time pressure, I melted down a bit and go over by two minutes.
>Evan_Cohen: ER E5 ER +10 423
#note would he have seen MARE/AMENE#? if not, then RANCOUR would've been a tie. a tough loss either way.
