#note Q likes 13C FIN best, gives it a win percentage of 44.67 over 5k iterations 3 ply. My play didn't show up, but gets a wp of 36.88, and enjoys the top 'valuation' of 24.6. Fin's valuation is 6.4. Embarassed to say I dk what this means, fully. 

I chose RYA for a few reasons; Felt the E column offered the best scoring opportunity for my opponent, and that the leave of FHIN gave me some nice possibilities on the next turn. If I draw an O INFO 8L is worth 43, and the IN is also good for ING bingos in column B.

#note Saw the best play (15 A) WOLVER and chose against it to block the tws opening and holding on to the L hoping to bingo on row 15 later. Ugh. Terrible.
