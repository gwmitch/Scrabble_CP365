#note BYPAST is really pretty! I missed it. This is probably better, though. Stronger defense, and PRST is gold if I hit a vowel or two. Sim likes this.

#note Playing from behind with the blank might call for a little more aggression. Sim recommends swinging the triple-triple wide open with INIA L12.

#note Burning the blank here is wrong. Very, very wrong. The best play is NEW 2H, according to a 4-ply sim - score a lot now, score with the J next, and leave the board nice and open to bingo two turns from now. Didn't think of it.

#note Doesn't matter, I'm gonna lose either way. He's got FOREHENTS# even if I don't give him this N.
>Evans_Clinchy: ABCMNUW 10B CWM +30 380
#note This at least gives me a ghost of a chance at bingoing? I guess?

>Evans_Clinchy: ABCLNTU E11 BUNC. +24 404
#note Best is CEL N12, setting up BANTU# to go out. If he blocks, I have TABUN 6A as a backup plan.
