#note DEET at 11E is much better than TEED because it doesn't open a nice new bingo line for him to use.

#note argh! in the 28th game of the 2013 SCT I miss my first TWL bingo, the cakewalk TUBEROID. bah! I bet I was trying to look for some weird collins word through that R instead.

#note dreadfully terrible play because SPAWED# is good, which I realized about 20 minutes after hitting my clock!! I didn't want to play L3 because I worried about cheap overlaps.even in spite of that this play sucks because it doesn't score enough. Quackle's fave is TWO which bingos a whopping 46% of the time next turn (although I think that number might be too high). this felt like a big mistake with both blanks unseen. I could also play POWRE# at F2 or just OPTED for points. With all said and done, I think POWRE is the move. if I see it, but at least 20 other plays sim within 5 points (my play is nowhere close).

#note lucky I get to close this and keep AGONE
>Trevor_Hovelmeier: ?EGINOO N1 IsOGONE +81 274
>JD: AEGHLOR 1J HOAG.E +33 273
#note I have a chance at the blank and I keep the L for AWEEL#. 
on the other hand, if I play OH at O1 then I keep AEGLR and I have a shot at hitting AGONE if he doesn't block. I'm ok with this course of action.

>JD: AALPRTY O7 LYART +32 305
#note missed bingo number 6 of the tournament is a real doozie - LAPTRAY# for 97, almost certainly clinching the game. Again, not a word that I had ever crossed paths with before.

>JD: AEILMNP 11A LIP +25 330
#note the key to this position seemed to be drawing the S or blank for column A. He most likely has them already, so I tried creating some counterplay at A11. maybe KILIM is an upgrade because it makes it much easier to bingo if I do draw the right tiles.

#note 13 worse than playing LIPAS#/ANOMY

#note I did not play close to well enough to deserve to win this game. too bad.
