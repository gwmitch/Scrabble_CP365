#note Sims best. AXIOM D11 is a lot of points but kinda reckless.

#note IRONY sims best. It's not a very bingo-friendly board, so maybe the right move here is to score points and hold onto the M for scoring.

>Evans_Clinchy: AGINNOR B2 OARING +34 182
#note It's between the scoring play, OARING, and the fishy play, ONY# L4, for 12 points less. I went with OARING for two reasons - one, I didn't expect him to open the board for a bingo if I fished, and two, I liked the idea of digging into the bag to draw the unseen blanks. The sim agrees.

#note QUEP# is way way way better. I don't know why I was so opposed to the ENNW leave.

#note Or PIANI#. Thought about it, couldn't think of what difference it made. Quackle can't either.

#note Pretty sure this is best. It opens a nice S-hooking lane for a bingo, and IRS is an awesome leave with AAAAEELLLOOOTTTT? in the pool. Very bingo-prone.

#note Blah. I'm in terrible shape now. Quackle recommends ALSO 12L, since it scores a bunch and at least gives me a hook that's tough to block. Even that is only 5.3 percent to win.
