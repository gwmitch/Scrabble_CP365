>Rafi: FINNRST 8G FIRN +14 14
>Cecilia: DEGLNVW H4 WELD.NG +16 16
>Rafi: AENORST K4 TREASON +72 86
#note Spent about 4 minutes trying to determine whether WELDING took an S... made the correct decision here. The S hook on TREASON is not a threat - 16 points extra is just like hooking ZINC or something, and the other bingos give up more dangerous spots.
>Cecilia: BEEEORV 6D BEVE. +18 34
#note Cecilia: OVERBED is cool
>Rafi: AABHITX 5C BAH +30 116
>Cecilia: DEOPRSY L1 PYRO +28 62
#note Cecilia: OY J5 seems fine here
>Rafi: AIMTTTX 4B MATT +32 148
>Cecilia: DEGKNQS 11I DESK +34 96
#note Cecilia: KEG or KEGS 3A look much better, don't know why I didn't play there!
>Rafi: ILOSTVX 1H OXLI. +42 190
#note Glad to see this, which is better than VOX.
>Cecilia: ?EGINPQ 3A PEG +28 124
>Rafi: EIRSTVZ A1 ZI. +42 232
#note Things are looking quite good, as I'm up 112 with a great leave and a vowel heavy pool to help my ERSTV.
>Cecilia: ?AEINNQ 12L AN +16 140
>Rafi: ELRSSTV N10 VETS +18 250
#note This was an agonizing turn. SL to VERST was annoying, and with only one vowel I have no way to block both openings. This is one of those turns that could make or break the game... I'm still 95%+ to win, but with Cecilia's imminent bingo, I'm really more like 80-85% I suspect. Board dynamics are serious considerations here, and I wasn't sure exactly what to do. VETS/BEVELS is one option, trying to just outrun whatever Cecilia comes up with. But I think blocking is necessary here. I played VETS in order to try to devalue Cecilia's bingo and also because bingos on the left side all conflict, and lanes would be easier to shut down than after a bingo hooking AN. The main downside is that LRS is on the low end of possible leaves, and my bingo chances plummet. VERTS/KAS might be better, but my worry was that there would be minimum 2 bingo lanes still available after Cecilia bingos. This position makes me feel like a STEE. VETS for 29 wins the sim.
>Cecilia: ?EEINQU M3 ENQUIrE +91 231
#note Scored as 89, and pretty much worst case scenario, as this lane is very hard to hit.
>Rafi: CILLORS 12H COL +13 263
#note Quackle hates this... I'm not ahead by enough to revert to blocking, especially because this opens up a juicy scoring spot on a board devoid of any. I'm also getting a little low on time after thinking awhile on VETS. (N)IL setting up my case L/S sims best by a longshot! Never would have considered that over the board. With 35 tiles unseen, Cecilia is only 20% to have the blank, and would need to specifically make it an L or S in order to cash the spot. NIL looks pretty awesome to me. Just to set a sense of the numbers, Cecilia is only 8-9% to bingo regardless of what I do, and COL reduces that to 2-3%. So with a bigger lead or a near empty bag, COL would be awesome, but with 35 tiles to go and CFGHJUUUWY unseen, I need to keep scoring instead of slightly reducing bingo chances.
>Cecilia: ?DGIRTY H12 .ITY +27 258
>Rafi: EILORSU 14F OU.LIERS +62 325
#note Extremely lucky.
>Cecilia: ?DFGOOR J5 OF +28 286
>Rafi: ADMORUU 2H DUO +22 347
#note I also have AURUM A7, which I didn't see and would never play.
>Cecilia: ?CDGNOR N1 COG +16 302
#note Very nice. This game has gone from blowout to nailbiter in a hurry. And I just learned a new top-1000 9! (Thought NAILBITER was two words)
>Rafi: AAEIMRU 8M .IA +6 353
#note Getting panicky... not sure what to do here. An S bingo is not THAT likely. Something like AMI(G)A to take out the G and set up a scoring spot for myself might work??? MIA(O)U is also simming well... takes out the G and big 6s to the triple. RIA is surely over-paranoid. 
>Cecilia: ?DENRTW 13C DREW +21 323
#note Cecilia: Truthfully I didn't have much of a plan here, but the sim favors DREW for 13 on the bottom row. I guess Rafi could have trouble blocking both columns C/D and row 10. I remember thinking I could get GUARANTY on row 15, but that isn't too likely.
>Rafi: AAAEMRU C8 MARAU. +10 363
#note Low on time, freaking out after my AA draw. AU(R)AE is the obvious win here (and AURA/AURAR work). MARAUD luckily is also a 100% win, but it's not bulletproof, as GAIJIN plus a spaz could eke out a win for Cecilia.
>Cecilia: ?AIIJNT 15A gAIJIN +66 389
