>Gunnar_Andersson: AEKMNRU 8G UNMARK +34 34
>Gunnar_Andersson: AEKMNRU --  -34 0
#note this was his actual rack, he didn't know UNMAKER.
>JD: CLOOTTW 8G LOWT +14 14
#note I was unfortunately exposed to the draconian WESPA overdraw procedure on this turn...the poorly-designed tilebag fell off the table and onto the ground, and two tiles fell out. Unfortunately, those counted as an OVERDRAW and my RS went back into the bag. Arghhh. I can understand the intention of the rule (it could be intentional) but it still sucked.
>Gunnar_Andersson: AEKMNRU J6 MU. +11 11
>JD: CDIOSTT 9H DOT +20 34
#note my fourth missed bingo of the tournament, and for the fourth time a CSW bingo that I had never studied.
>Gunnar_Andersson: AEIKNR K5 KIN +20 31
>JD: CGISTVW L3 TWIG +28 62
#note nice GVW draw there
>Gunnar_Andersson: AENRY 3J EN.RY +16 47
>JD: CDORSSV J2 D.V +11 73
#note sacrificing too many points, I do bingo a lot next turn but CODS looks like the play at 10F, I still bingo 20% of the time next turn and DEV doesn't improve my percentages that much.
>Gunnar_Andersson: AEEJ 10E AJEE +31 78
>JD: ACIORSS 11A SCORIAS +83 156
>JD: ACIORSS --  -83 73
#note ugh, I really thought this was good. My word confidence took a pretty big beating at this tournament. knowing more collins down the road will help.
>Gunnar_Andersson: AH 11E HA +29 107
>JD: ACIORSS I1 SOC +25 98
#note the best play here is SIROC#, which is not a kind of vodka but rather an alternate spelling of SIROCCO/SCIROCCO, which is a wind. with the two blanks still out there quackle likes turnover a bit more in general on this move.
>Gunnar_Andersson: AILNPS 1D PLAIN. +33 140
>JD: AINORSX 2E OX +52 150
>Gunnar_Andersson: CDEIR 3C CIDER +32 172
>JD: ABINRSU 12D NIB +28 178
#note I liked playing this to set up the S
>Gunnar_Andersson: FFO 2M OFF +36 208
>JD: AEGIRSU 13B GAU +10 188
#note ooh, looks like I forgot about ACIDER#. Instead I killed off my own S hook. not good.
>Gunnar_Andersson: EINQU 14A QUINE +39 247
>JD: AEIRRRS C3 .ARRIERS +62 250
>Gunnar_Andersson: AEHVY 15E HEAVY +47 294
>JD: AEEELMO 11H AMOLE +19 269
#note trying to draw one of the blanks - AREOLE sims a little better, being able to play an M- bingo on row 14 seems handy on this closed board (and the M just scores better)
>Gunnar_Andersson: ?EGNORT 5A sT.ONGER +66 360
#note COREGENT# at L8 looks like the play, tough find
>JD: ?DEELTU A1 DELU.TEr +122 391
>JD: AEIPS (challenge) +5 396
#note phew!
>Gunnar_Andersson: ABIOSTZ 12L SITZ +50 410
#note he held me for a long time, he had already found SITZ (but not ZIBETS!) and figured the challenge wouldn't hurt him because it wouldn't put him over the edge. but actually, if he plays ZIBETS and doesn't challenge DELUSTER he wins!!
>JD: AEIPS O12 .IPS +45 441
#note completely the wrong play, I saw SEPIA but recounted under time pressure and thought it was better to play ZIPS. wrong! even better than SEPIA, I have PETSAI to go out!
>Gunnar_Andersson: ABO 14I ABO +16 426
#note intense game against the friendly Swede. lucky I had the 3x3.
>Gunnar_Andersson:  (AE) +4 430
