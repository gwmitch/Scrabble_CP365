#note Meh, why keep the E? It's 6 extra points. I can always draw more E's...
>Peter_Armstrong: DR 5C R...D +13 55
>Evans_Clinchy: GILNOSS I2 LOSINGS +71 144
#note Quackle likes LASSOING a little better, but with the early lead, I liked how this bingo kept the board more closed-ish.
>Peter_Armstrong: Q G7 Q. +21 76
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIOSSY G2 OY +25 169
#note Can't go along with Quackle's suggestions of OY/YO at J5/J6. I know this scores less, but I have to keep the board relatively closed in this situation.
>Peter_Armstrong: COT 1G TOC +32 108
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEIOSS 9G SO +18 187
#note Missed the best play here - (BOR)EA(S) is very strong here. Scores decently without giving anything back, and the EIOSS leave is pretty good. This is a ways back. Weak play.
>Peter_Armstrong: EZ 6B ZE. +34 142
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEEIIS F8 .IAE +12 199
#note Pretty sure this is best - it's crazy open, but I don't have any other ways to get rid of these vowels. Trading? Nah.
>Peter_Armstrong: CRTU 11B TRUC. +14 156
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEINSV 7C V.E +22 221
#note Ugh, EAVE in the same spot is 10 points more. What a boneheaded miss.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?EHINPR H12 HE.N +42 333
#note SPHERING is 23 points more but wastes the fantastic leave of IPR?. Is it worth the 23 points? Quackle says HEWN is best, but a human opponent is much more likely to block the obvious bingo into the G, so it might be wise to take the bingo now while I still can. Then again, there are also bingos through the T in TRUCE possible, or maybe I even get something in line O overlapping whatever blocking play he makes in line N. In the end, I decided 42 keeping the blank was just too juicy to pass up, so I took the chance.
>Peter_Armstrong: ADEF K2 DEAF +31 348
>Evans_Clinchy: ?BEIIPR 12A BIER +26 359
#note Not a good draw, but I'm still in decent shape. This scores well enough to take the lead... with the blank still in hand...
>Peter_Armstrong: ?EJOP 15A POtJE +68 416
#note ...BUT THEN HE PLAYS A PHONY FIVE AND I LET IT GO AND SUDDENLY HE'S WINNING BY A MILLION. OH MY GOD I AM THE WORST PLAYER IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?IPRTTY O10 sTRIPY +46 405
>Evans_Clinchy: ?IPRTTY --  -46 359
#note Because this wasn't going terribly enough already, I decide to play yet another phony.
>Peter_Armstrong: DHNOU M1 HOUND +31 447
>Evans_Clinchy: ?IPRTTY N10 .RITTY +20 379
#note Best is NIFTY 12K, apparently, but at this point I just want to finish the game and leave the room and go cry somewhere.
