#note Just BY for 40 is better. I thought I was desperate to get rid of an E, but the DEEET leave actually hits a decent number of bingos.

>Evans_Clinchy: EEENOTU B2 E.EU +12 194
#note Pretty sure this is best - it keeps a good leave and a volatile position, which I need when down by a bingo. Sim likes it too.

>Evans_Clinchy: DEEORTT 11H TETRODE +71 341
#note Thought for a long time about my bingo options here - this, RETORTED for 68, OTTERED for 69. Eventually decided on this one because no matter which bingo I choose, I'm at a tempo disadvantage, still an underdog to win the game. TETRODE is volatile as I might get lucky and hit the S hook next turn. I need something fortunate to happen. Sim agrees - this is 37 percent to win.
>Cameron_Farlow: AOV 12H AVO +20 355
>Evans_Clinchy: CEEINPQ N10 P.NCE +30 371
#note Not bad, but there's another play that gives me a better shot to win - NEP# 10L. Scores 26 and sets up QIS for 42 if I draw the S. That's 27 percent to win; this is 19. Not looking great either way, but still a missed opportunity.
>Cameron_Farlow: DIIORSU O7 DORIS +31 386
#note Best is IRIS, followed by UDOS B7 for 19 and out.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEIQT 13F QAT +17 388
#note My best play is PIE to block his PIU, but that doesn't win. Instead I'm going to hope he misses PIU. If he takes QI and I go out with ICE 13M, I win 400-399.
>Cameron_Farlow: IU 5E .IU +5 391
#note Naw, he's not missing it. Nice game.
