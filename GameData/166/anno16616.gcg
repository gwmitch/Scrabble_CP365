#note Sims best, just a hair ahead of PAEAN.
>Dylan_Early: AKLN D8 .LANK +22 22
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AELNXY 9F EX +36 56
#note I thought it was correct to pass up LARYNXES, but the sim says EX is a couple points worse. Even with the super-potent ALNY? leave, my average score next turn is under 63. I guess bingoing isn't a guarantee, and even if I do hit, it might not be a high-scoring one.

#note Sim prefers OAF K9, but I don't like it in this situation - I'm up by a bingo and he kept a strong leave, so I'd rather close bingos than open them.
>Dylan_Early: AORS C3 ORA +24 118
>Evans_Clinchy: AABEESW B2 AWA +26 217
#note Sims best, though it's admittedly risky (note MARID# is a word).
>Dylan_Early: DEOOST 13H TO.EDO +16 134
>Evans_Clinchy: BCEEEES H11 CE.ES +24 241
#note Oh wow - EE# C9 sets up a huge BEACH play for next turn. Nigel Richards would see that. Also: BETES#, dummy, not CETES.

>Evans_Clinchy: BEENRRV L8 VERBE. +32 273
>Evans_Clinchy: BEENRRV --  -32 241
#note VERBING# is a word but VERBED* isn't? No fair...
>Dylan_Early: III -III +0 168
>Evans_Clinchy: BEENRRV L10 VEN.ER +22 263
#note Best - scores well without giving back anything dangerous.
>Dylan_Early: II 10J .I.I +8 176
>Evans_Clinchy: BPRRTVY -BPRVY +0 263
#note No reason to trade - with the board closed like this, leave isn't as important. BRACH 10B scores 18 and sims best. It also blocks bingos from the MARID# spot.
>Dylan_Early: EILMS A4 MILES +41 217
>Evans_Clinchy: EJMNRTU M9 J.N +20 283
#note Sim prefers more aggressive plays like MUIR# K8 and MURREN# 15J, but again - closing bingos, not opening them.
>Dylan_Early: GUVY 14B VUG.Y +42 259
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIMRTU 15L .IME +18 301
#note Ugh, chickened out on RIMU#! Obviously it's way better to stick a U out there than an E. Also, I missed EMERIT(AE) in line H. The sim says that's best, but it seems a little reckless to play that way with a lead.
