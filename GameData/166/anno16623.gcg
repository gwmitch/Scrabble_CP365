>Michael_McKenna: EFOPRST 8G FOP +16 16
#note Where should one study to by probability...why, to whatever point the next bonus you miss is (FORPETS is 10621 but seems to come up a lot more often than that. Perhaps somewhat more playable than probable).
>Edward: AAAENRW 9G AWA +24 24

#note ZANIED and ZENITH are both less risky.

#note Fate smiles while kicking dirt in Michael's face.
>Michael_McKenna: AAGITYY 12B YAY +28 224
#note Rack unknown
>Edward: ?EJOUWX 13A JEW +41 450
#note How dare JEUX be blocked! Selected because I wanted to cash in on the X next turn and then keep easy spots open for one or two tile plays (as happened). Not smart because there's opportunities galore for the X here with many of the tiles still to come that outweigh this.
>Michael_McKenna: AEGINQT 1A QAT +41 265
#note Michael is not sure of his rack here other than it containing QATIG
>Edward: ?BLOUUX 14A OX +53 503
#note Not sure of rack here, played this in all of about 2 seconds. May not have had the B?
>Michael_McKenna: EGILNST D2 .INGLETS +70 335

#note Stupid N!
>Michael_McKenna: AFINOOV 8A FOO. +21 356
#note Rack unknown
>Edward: ?AKLSUU B8 .UK +17 556
#note AUK? What, and block a bonus line? I'm greedy.
>Michael_McKenna: AGIINSV L10 .AVING +26 382
#note Can you spot the nine here?
>Edward: ??AELSU 15H mAUL.rES +113 669
#note Oh hi, this took me 12 minutes to find. EULOGIAS? What's that? The previous nine missed by Michael is 4f VAGIN(IT)IS.
>Michael_McKenna: EIIRSUV F10 ..IV +12 394
>Edward: BDDEIMR 3C D.B +24 693
#note Trying to get an outplay bonus here, so didn't want to empty the bag with BEDIM or EMBED... fancied the DIMER keep (two Rs to come though).  That said, there arre actually not very many draws that lead to a bonus as Michael has the last E most of the time. Shoulda done MODI... because UDS!
>Michael_McKenna: EINRSTU O1 .SURIENT +77 471
#note Well, EMBED would have allowed an outplay bonus anyway.
>Edward: DEHIMPR N5 PHI +35 728
#note I confess, i didn't know HEMPIE, always very poor on -Y words that can also be -IE. Or IMPHEE. Back to the books I go.
>Michael_McKenna: RU 14L .UR +11 482
#note Other than for inflating the record, it is really not worth going out in two here. Ur!
>Michael_McKenna:  (DEMR) +14 496
#note Played to Australian rules, so final score would be 721-489.
