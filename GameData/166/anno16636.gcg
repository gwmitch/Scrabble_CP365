#note The sim results are pretty messy here. Best is apparently PEE 9F, which I don't understand - the score isn't great, there's no plan for the X, and EUX? isn't that bingo-prone. I still like WEXE# since it angles for a wide-open board and a bingo next turn, but Quackle's not a fan.

#note Ugh, terrible. This seemed like the obvious equity play, but there's no reason to open the hook when I'm up by a bingo. I missed OJIME#, which is best, and ZITI 6F would have been just fine for dumping some I's without opening the board. Awful.

#note Ugh, terrible. The only way to lose is to let him bingo twice, so what I do? I give him a spot for his second bingo. The actual best play here is INTIME J5, which leaves 7 in the bag and forces him to empty if he gets his first bingo down. This is absolutely terrible. I blew this game by getting equity-greedy and assuming I had the win in hand.
