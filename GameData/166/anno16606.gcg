#note crappy play, just fishing EE makes it much harder for him to score any points and bingoes more.

#note big error on his part since he has row 7

#note quackle brings up an idea I hadn't considered, which is letting him have the cheap bingo and then setting up the 3x3 in row 15 by playing BRAG or GRAB. It's a nice thought, but this is a much lower variance solution (I was also happy just to find the right CSW bingo here)

>JD: DGNOOTW 7A WOOD +24 219
#note weirdly, after talking about DOGTOWN# getting played by Nigel the day before, I draw it with no spots on the board for it. I figured it was a good time to close a bunch of lanes and start sitting on my lane, but quackle likes WOOD at M4. I know his leave is random after ST, but I still think it's worth blocking on the left now while I have a good play there.

#note with the blank lurking, maybe TABU to see an extra letter

>JD: CDGLRTU M1 GLUT +12 324
#note my chances aren't great here, it basically felt like I had to draw the blank on my next play, hence maximizing turnover. Q also suggests GELD at M11 setting up the blank if I draw it, but turning over one tile less.

#note frustrating game, I didn't do much wrong except playing ONIE# which was a big mistake. Back to 12-12.
