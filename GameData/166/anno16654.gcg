#note Ugh, EPIBLEM#. Knew I was missing something here.

#note BOMBYCID is 8 more! That woulda been a sick-nasty find.
>Odette_Rio: WW H13 W.W +27 105
>Evans_Clinchy: EEJPRUY 10J JE.P +29 143
#note Lousy play - I have no idea why I thought ERUY was a good leave. It's best to take the points with a big play like PEERY K7 for 37. Save the J for later.
>Odette_Rio: AEFGLNS M2 FANGLES +84 189
>Evans_Clinchy: EINORUY L1 YONI +33 176
#note Missed PIOYE# M10, which keeps a more balanced leave and keeps lines for eights open for next turn.

#note In a close game, I liked the idea of aggressively setting up a spot for an S-hooking bingo. Might help me bust the game wide open. Quackle says HIOI# in the same spot might be even better, sacrificing 5 points for a more balanced leave. Also of note: I had no idea COMBINEDS was a word. HOISE and HOSE are available here, and I'm missing them.
>Odette_Rio: AAU 1A AUA +22 303
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIISTX E2 .IXIE +24 341
#note Yeah, like I said - COMBINEDS. I missed EXIST for 75.
>Odette_Rio: CO 4C CO. +24 327
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEGNST F4 AND +30 371
#note DAG 10F might be a tad better equity-wise, but I liked this for blocking bingos since I have a decent lead. (There's also the ZING fish, but that is crazy and insane and bonkers and wrong.)
>Odette_Rio: DL F8 L.D +8 335
>Evans_Clinchy: EGKSTTU J6 KU. +33 404
#note Besides TUSK and TSK and GUST and KEST# hooking COMBINEDS, I think this is best. There's TEGU# N2 for a lot of points, but that's kinda foolish. No need to open more bingos here.
