>Evans_Clinchy: EEISTUW -EUW +0 0
#note Sims best. Thought about a short opening like WE, but it's not worth it.
>Michael_McKenna: CIOPT 8H OPTIC +24 24
>Evans_Clinchy: AEIOSTV L7 A.TIVE +22 22
#note For some reason I wasn't excited about the EOST or AIST leaves, so I thought I'd get creative and fork open two S-hook lanes. Kinda silly. Just VIA for 18 keeping EOST is fine.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEIIISZ 11K A.IZE +34 155
#note Sims best. No one likes doubled I's or dangling an E in the triple-triple, but what am I gonna do? ZITI? It's 21 points less and gives back easy comebacks from the Z. I need some volatility anyway.
>Michael_McKenna: DEGO O8 OGE.D +27 189
>Evans_Clinchy: AEIISTY D11 AY +22 177
#note I have an unnatural attachment to the -ITIES leave. It's hit or miss - sim says I'm 51 percent to bingo, but if that doesn't come through, I might have to make a lame fishing play next turn. The better option might be ZITI, which opens an S-hooking lane that's most likely mine. ZITIS/EASY next turn is a guaranteed 38.

#note Well, that worked out.
>Michael_McKenna: BLOW 10G BOWL +25 248
>Evans_Clinchy: ABILRRT B2 TRIBAL +22 278
#note Not sure what to do here. I figured he might be angling for a bingo, since I have a tempo advantage now, and TRIBAL blocks his most likely bingo spot. ZARI# sims best, but that's too aggressive - I'd like that better if I was behind 37, not ahead 37. There's also RIB F12, but that might turn the game into a luckboxy race for esses and blanks.
>Michael_McKenna: FMR 4A F.RM +26 274
>Evans_Clinchy: AGHKNRU A1 HAU. +34 312
#note Best. The leave's not great, but this is turning into a gross board, so it might not matter as much.
>Michael_McKenna: LVY L3 VLY +26 300
>Evans_Clinchy: EGIKNOR 3I KNI.E +34 346
#note Dismissed plays like ZONK and ZERK and OZEKI# - the last thing I want to do is give him an easy bingo line. I liked this because it scored plenty and closed bingos rather than open them. I did miss KERVING# in the same spot, though. Does the same thing even better.

>Evans_Clinchy: GGOORUU O3 GOGO +16 362
>Evans_Clinchy: DDNRSUU (challenge) +5 367
#note I'm getting low on time here, just wanted to slap something down. This is decent but GOUGE 12H is better. Shuts down a bingo possibility and takes control of the board. Oh, and Michael challenged this. Spoiler alert - I never bother with inputting the +5 into Quackle unless it matters.

>Michael_McKenna: AENORRX M10 N.XE +33 403
>Evans_Clinchy: ACNRSTU 14K CURST +36 427
#note This is best, but it should lose anyway - by 2. Luckily for me, Michael was low on time and he miscounted in the endgame, thinking he had actually lost. So out of desperation, he challenged both words.
>Michael_McKenna: AORR 4F ORRA +11 414
#note Phew. Very lucky ending.
