#note I8 NOnDRIP is quite better than this. G8 PaDRONI was also missed

>Michael_Fagen: CDDER C8 C.RDED +20 83
>Joshua_Sokol: AELSTTT B2 TATTLE +21 76
#note Should I really fish here? I guess this gives back too many points. I could also play TESTA 10F.
>Michael_Fagen: DEEFORS F4 FORES.DE +68 151
>Joshua_Sokol: AELORSU 4F .OU +7 83
#note I think 4B (T)EAR(F)UL may be worth considering here. I hated playing this.
>Michael_Fagen: ?GINOTT 5H TONIGhT +66 217
#note Michael was wondering if this was his best play. We'll see.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEILRS B9 .EAR +19 102
#note L5 (G)ASALIER is a really bad miss.
>Michael_Fagen: EOP D11 OPE +27 244
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEILRS O5 SCALIER +85 187
#note This...
>Michael_Fagen: AEK -  +0 244
#note Is why TONIGhT wasn't Michael's best play. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILMNS 12F SEMINAL +87 274
#note Tables are turning
>Michael_Fagen: AEK 11K KEA +28 272
>Joshua_Sokol: ABBFLUV 13K FLUB +31 305
#note A1 BABU seems quite clear. I thought that maybe it would be a good idea to play BA(G)FUL L3 because Michael might have challenged it or at least played less confidently because of being incertain of the validity of a word on the board. This wasn't that good of a play
>Michael_Fagen: AAH N8 AAH +31 303
>Joshua_Sokol: ABINUVY A1 BUY +31 336
#note I played this because I thought keeping AINV and scoring 31, as well as taking away this scoring spot was a good idea. I also considred L1 VYIN(G) but I felt that I shouldn't add new scoring spots to the board and lose control. The sim is liking A1 NUBIA and A1 VINA best, possible VINA because the U may be of importance if I draw the Q and NUBIA perhaps because VY are decent scoring tiles on this board
>Michael_Fagen: UX 13G XU +38 341
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIMNVZ C2 AMI +31 367
#note Maybe Michael would have challenged J2 ZIN(N)IA. I missed it, but I only think it's correct if I think Michael will bite. Maybe I'm wrong though, I can't really argue why ZIN(N)IA is wrong, except that I can save 11B (ADO)Z(E) for later. Maybe I shouldn't play this with the imminent R(AMI) threat and opt for C3 MI.
>Michael_Fagen: AEINRV 1C RAVINE +36 377
#note :(
>Joshua_Sokol: EINOSVZ 11B ...Z. +30 397
#note He has just played 6/8 tiles in the bag. I assume this means he drew the Q. I thought this play was clear as day but apparently I should play 11F (E)VES. I don't know why. I don't see anything ADOZE loses to besides a Q draw.
>Michael_Fagen: GINOTWW 3H TOWING +25 402
#note This seems like the obvious play if he has the E, which i think he did.
>Joshua_Sokol: EINOQSV N1 QIS +35 432
#note how sick is that? TOWINGS is obviously phony but I can't believe I drew the Q there.
>Michael_Fagen: EW E5 WE +22 424
>Michael_Fagen:  (ENOV) +14 438
#note If he had the Q with TOWING, he may have had a chance, but if he drew it (50% chance), he lost. I was really frustrated that this happened, because although I made a blatant mistake by missing (G)ASALIER, I came back from a stupid deficit and baited a challenge of a word I knew to be good. Just for that, I think Michael lost much more win percentage from his mistakes than I lost from mine, and when it came down to a coin flip in his eye and a much better chance of winning in mine, the luck factor decided who lost the game.
