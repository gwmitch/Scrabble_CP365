#note Quite disheartened here as I had (R)OMAInE at K4 for 98 points to get me back into this.

>Art_Moore: AEFHQSU 10J QUA.H +45 300
#note I looked this one over for a long time having four decent options, all being QUASH.  All within six points of each other, I choose 10J for 45 points, conserving my S for either ATOMISES of NAZIS.

#note I grab FIRS from my rack to play at L11.  It would put me up one point, and after this game I should be pleased to reach this point.  Then I catch myself, return the R for the E on my rack and find this beauty.  Though not as many points as my opponent put up in three turns (80+81+53=214 vs 66+45+72=183) this completed the comeback.
