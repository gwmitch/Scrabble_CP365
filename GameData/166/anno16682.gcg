#note Playing off the R kills the equity here. Still, this play sims decently since it keeps the board fairly tight and gives him fewer cheap points. MAIN for 25 is the only clearly superior option.

#note This has the highest equity, but makes it very hard for me to bingo on my future turns. I still want to take out the triple and keep lines open at the same time, but it's really hard to do so without using the S, which is why FLANS is probably slightly superior to my play.

#note A really interesting play. I took very long on this play, as I was unsatisfied with GAT for 18. This looks very unappetizing at first, until it struck me that my leave bingos with all 5 vowels! Plus, I just manufactured a new high scoring lane for myself, and brett might not know GLAZIERS (turns out he did). Thoughts? Is this best?

#note Tricky situation. I thought I had to resort to fishing, but apparently LA(W)N sims best.

#note This, SHH for 28, or SHH for 30? I'm screwed either way, unless a miracle occurs.

>insidious: DEFHJRS E1 J.SHED +34 161
#note This sims best, but FRESH is a better spread-cutting play. My chances are just about 0 either way.

#note I don't like 4D OFAY, as the vowel situation is getting pretty concerning.
>brettjay: EIIORSV 12G VISI.OR +22 326
>insidious: ?ABDLNR G6 BA.D +31 225
#note Surprisingly, there are no available bingos.

>insidious: ?ELNORR D4 OR +16 241
#note Miraculously, still no bingo plays.

#note Q says don't bingo and play NIL at 13N. That makes a damn lot of sense.

#note This was a pretty unlucky game on my end, but still many interesting positions!
