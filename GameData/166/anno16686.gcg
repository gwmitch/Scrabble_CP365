>Evan_Cohen: AI E5 AI +9 14
>Evans_Clinchy: DEGNSSX H5 SEX. +21 69
#note The sim doesn't love SEXT - I guess DGNS is a risky leave on a board without vowels to play through. GEDS D3 scores the same and keeps only three consonants, including the juicy X. There's also GEDS I5, which sacrifices 5 points now for a potential X setup.
>Evan_Cohen: AAEIRST 4A ATRESIA +69 83
>Evans_Clinchy: ADGINOS 3F GANOIDS +67 136
#note I convinced myself DOATINGS# was not a word because I am stupid.
>Evan_Cohen: EEGN A4 .GENE +18 101
>Evans_Clinchy: EEMNRUY 3B UEY +23 159
#note Scoar moar points! MURREY C2 is 30. That sims best.
>Evan_Cohen: EHTW 2B THEW +38 139
>Evans_Clinchy: EMMNNRR J2 N.MMER +14 173
#note This is OK, but the sim slightly prefers just MINER. Keeping an M is reasonable with the B6 spot still open.
>Evan_Cohen: IQ H1 QI. +36 175
>Evans_Clinchy: EIKNORV D8 .OKIER +24 197
#note This sims really badly. I had spent a lot of time on NIMMER and was worried about getting low, so I slapped something down. A ton of plays are better than this, most notably SKIVER L3 for 28.
>Evan_Cohen: ACP 13C C.AP +16 191
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIILNV L1 VI.E +22 219
#note VISILE# is a little better, turning over more tiles to get to the blanks.
>Evan_Cohen: ??DNOTT B6 NOTaTeD +68 259
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIILNT 1L .EIL +21 240
#note Missed DEIL K3, which uses the same tiles for 4 points extra. Also opens a couple useful hooks.
>Evan_Cohen: AEHP A12 EPHA +34 293
>Evans_Clinchy: AEILNRT K6 RELIANT +68 308
#note A ton of bingos to choose from, obviously. Sim prefers RETINAL in the same spot. I chose this instead. I'm an underdog no matter what, so at least RELIANT gives me a chance to luckbox into ZO# and steal this one.
>Evan_Cohen: JO J10 JO +52 345
>Evans_Clinchy: BBGNOOR L7 BONGO +33 341
#note Quackle likes BOOB in the same spot, and I'm not sure why. Isn't it better to turn over more tiles and angle to go out quicker?
>Evan_Cohen: FIOUUVW O1 .UV +6 351
>Evans_Clinchy: BDDRUZ E13 .DZ +13 354
#note It's correct to block WOF# in this same spot. but DRAB is 2 points better.
>Evan_Cohen: FIOUW B14 OW +25 376
>Evans_Clinchy: BDRU 5C BR. +21 375
#note ...aaaaaand, I blew the endgame. Low on time, didn't look thoroughly, missed the VISED hook. DRUB there goes out and wins.
>Evan_Cohen: FIU E10 IF +27 403
>Evans_Clinchy: DU 8K ..UD +5 380
#note I'm the worst.
>Evans_Clinchy:  (U) +2 382
