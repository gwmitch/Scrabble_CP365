#note Opening up a new line with a Q play definitely seems correct. That way I will have both column B and the new lines. My concern is that he will block with a high scoring play on the triple and so he will outrun most bingos, furthermore pulling three or four tiles from the current pool has the potential to go very wrong. By fishing E here I attempted to hit QUINTALS, which in my mind is essentially unblockable. This was almost certainly the wrong fish. Upon reexamination fishing T hits EQUALISE a decent amount, not sure if there are better options.

#note Still going for QUINTALS. Considered AF(T) L7 but that gets blocked every time and yields no Q bingos.

#note After his phony I saw his remaining three tiles because he didn't put them down. This told me that the D was in the bag and so shit had officially hit the fan. I realized that if he managed to royally screw up I would have DILUTES M1.
