>Evans_Clinchy: ABEEFMW 8G FEW +18 18
#note Chickened out on WEAMB#. I suck.
>Gunnar_Andersson: ADLO 9G ALOD +21 21
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEHMSU 10E HUB +18 36
#note Ooh, HAME 10F is nice. 34 points, and it sets up another big S-hooking lane. Definitely best.
>Gunnar_Andersson: AFR 11D FAR +24 45
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEEIMS 12D EME +31 67
#note Stronger defensively and leave-wise than SEMEIA# in the same spot.
>Gunnar_Andersson: ORV 13B VOR +18 63
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEIOPS B12 A.O +12 79
#note Sim doesn't love it - weak defensively. POA 10I appears best - better score and doesn't give back anything too egregious.
>Gunnar_Andersson: DGINY A8 DINGY +51 114
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEINPS 10I PIE +20 99
#note This sims decently, though there's a bit more defensive value to a two-tile play in the same spot like EA# or PE.
>Gunnar_Andersson: IJN B7 JIN +15 129
>Evans_Clinchy: AAENPSX L4 PANAXES +104 203

>Gunnar_Andersson: EOT M7 TOE +21 237
>Evans_Clinchy: CEIOTTU M2 OUT +11 310
#note I thought I'd get cute and block a bingo line here, but the truth is I don't know which to block. Maybe I should just shrug and take some points. TOIT D5 scores 27 and sims best.
>Gunnar_Andersson: EEIINST 15B SIENITE +81 318
#note See? Told you I didn't know where to block.
>Evans_Clinchy: CEHIOTT 1L CHIT +43 353
>Gunnar_Andersson: ADIV D1 AVID +26 344
>Evans_Clinchy: CEEGORT 14F GEO +19 372
#note Panicked and blocked a Q spot without thinking. It's hard for him to have a 60+ play given the pool, and he's got a second 30+ spot anyway. I should just take the points with ERGO D6 for 34.
>Gunnar_Andersson: BLWY 1A BYL.W +39 383
>Evans_Clinchy: CDERRTU E3 CERT +21 393
#note Brutally difficult position. I chose CERT for a few reasons - it leaves one tile in the bag, it scores decently, and it keeps the U in case I need it for a Q play next turn. Pre-endgame solver likes RUCK 2H, which is interesting - instead of keeping the U, I can play it and set up the Q play (keeping QIN# 6J in reserve if it's blocked).
>Gunnar_Andersson: EILOSTU B1 .U +10 393
>Evans_Clinchy: DEQRRRU 6J Q.. +31 424
#note Best, blocking his Z spot and keeping EXODE in reserve for next turn.
>Gunnar_Andersson: EILOSTZ N4 SOZ +38 431
#note Also best - he's got multiple spots to go out next turn with EILT.
>Evans_Clinchy: DERRRU 8K ...DE +36 460
#note Yup.
>Gunnar_Andersson: EILT K10 .LITE +10 441
#note And yup. This was a cool game. Happy to sneak away with a win.
>Gunnar_Andersson:  (RRRU) +8 449
