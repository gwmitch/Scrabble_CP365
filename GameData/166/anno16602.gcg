#note LITAI is a smart upgrade to my play, the leave is only slightly worse and I make 7s tougher to play, as well as taking out an S hook.

#note not a lot of consonants to play through if I fish, so I figured I would blow up the rack with both blanks unseen and maybe draw another challenge.

>JD: AEINNRT A1 INANE +26 251
#note some interesting sim results...I was eager to dig into the bag and didn't want to get killed on column A, but I have two alternative plays - fish the N at 4A for 3 points, or extend GATHERS to INGATHERS. His rack is random, but I think after INGATHERS it is very rare that I get to 3x3, which I think is part of what makes INGATHERS perform so well on a sim. But just NA is problematic too because I leave myself with just one lane, on row 13 (unless I draw ATTAINER or something unlikely). I think my play is decent but maybe INGATHERS gives me the best chance of pulling off a comeback
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ARSZ 8K .ZARS +72 355
>JD: CDEMRTW C2 MEW +30 281
#note I thought CDRT was closer to a bingo than DMT, doesn't seem to necessarily be true. at least MEW creates a better lane than what was there before.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEELP 1K B.EEP +27 382
>JD: ACDLRTU M8 .CTUAL +22 303
#note big vowel shortage, ACTUAL does create a new lane (because of ACTUALS# which I would've guessed on) but either RUDERAL or just OLD seem to lead to more bingos.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADWY 12L W.DY +30 412
>JD: CDGORUY N1 .DGY +18 321
#note basically, at this point I decided I needed to hit an EX- 9 to win the game. There are not really a lot of bingos to be hit, but I could fish for blank-blank (odds - 1 out of 45) and draw EXECUTORY, but I couldn't figure out a good way to fish DG. This way I can at least draw EXCURSION if I pull IN? (odds - 4/120), with better odds but also emptying the bag.
