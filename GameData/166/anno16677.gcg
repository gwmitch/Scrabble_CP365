#note This is an experimental game between Elise's "quick move" evaluator and a new neural net evaluator in version 0.1.9.
#note All move evaluations (including end-game evaluations) by the neural net player are done by artificial neural networks.
#note At this point the TWL06 regular game neural net has been trained over a corpus of about 600 games (some of which it played itself in an earlier version). This is not the final neural net evaluator; it will learn from many more positions before release.
#note Endgame evaluations are done by a separate neural network, trained over about 1,600 endgames (this will also improve before version 0.1.9 is released.)
#note The regular game neural network may provide an alternative opponent, stronger than the normal "quick move", though not as strong as a deep-ply simulation.
#note The endgame neural network may improve the endgame heuristics already used by Elise while simulating through the endgame.
#note Enjoy!

#note The neural network is capable of playing moves to setup future moves; at this point, though, 2 Gs are still unseen.
#note Normal simulation puts this move's win probability somewhere around 43.5%.
