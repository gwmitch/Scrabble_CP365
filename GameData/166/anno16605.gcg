#note I had not really tried playing any semblance of defense to this point, which I think is fine, but he would start cutting into my lead pretty quickly

#note Q says STIVE at B2 so I get out faster, I figured I might have a shot at getting something like VISITEE down if he didn't block. but of course, he always will, so STIVE would just help me get out faster.
