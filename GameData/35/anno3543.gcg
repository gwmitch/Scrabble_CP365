>David_Koenig: ?AHIKRS 8F dARKISH +84 84
#note After winning big in Round 13 vs Dave, I find myself in a favorable position in the standings. I'm now a win and spread ahead of him, so we know he's gotta win by 91 to tie me for 3rd place. If I win, I can get 2nd if Marlon loses. And it's important to note the payouts:
#note 2nd = $400
#note 3rd = $250
#note 4th = $  0

#note His first play immediately makes things even more interesting.
>Rod: CINNOUZ 7E COZ +46 46
#note If I' d thought of ZINCOUS, I'd have strongly considered it. 10 pts might be just a little too much to give up, but the superior leave and greater turnover is tempting here.
>David_Koenig: BII K5 IBI. +12 96
>Rod: GIINNUW I5 WIN.ING +17 63
#note I had to expect that WHINING gets blocked. This isn't a bad alternative. It pries the board open on two sides, assuring it'll stay open for a long time.
>David_Koenig: EPR 9E REP +27 123
>Rod: AEEGLOU 11I .OUGE +14 77
#note GAOLER H3 blows my play away. I simply didn't recognize the COZ-E-N opportunity. Can't forget to look *everywhere*.
>David_Koenig: UV L11 .UV +14 137
>Rod: AAELPST 4C PALATES +86 163
#note A lot to look at here, but surprised to learn that I did not make the best play, which was very findable if hadn't overlooked the N as a bingo line.

#note However, it works out even better for me after Dave challenges the play. I actually had some shred of doubt when I put it down, and I felt worse about it after his rather quick proclamation: "I'm gonna challenge that." Pleasant-ly relieved to see the green checkmark at the computer.
>David_Koenig: EEEEGNR -  +0 137
>Rod: BDJLMNT D3 J.MB +15 178
#note Ugly post-bingo draw, but the consonant dumps available score just enough to justify playing through. I'm comfortable with my choice, though Quackle prefers BLAM F1. My guess is that the rich vowel pool makes for a high likelihood of cashing the J at H1 next turn. I'd rather move on and let the vowels help me bingo with DLNT.
>David_Koenig: AQ G2 QA. +13 150
>Rod: ADEELNT N5 LATENED +71 249
#note AEE was a pretty ideal draw. At this point, I'm feeling pretty good about finishing in the money.
>David_Koenig: EEILOST 14F ETOILES +69 219
#note I figured Dave had to be close by now.  The board becomes nuclear, but with a ticking clock - it'll suck two moves down the road, so as long as I can score something now, I'm in great shape. I'm again consonant heavy post-bingo, but that works well in this spot.
>Rod: CGHNORV 15E CHON +40 289
#note Highest scoring play, and probably best. CHON H12 keeps a vowel, but it scores 4 less. I'd rather take the points, get in the bag, and add a little defensive value to that quadrant of the board.

#note Immediately after hitting my clock, Dave bemoans, "I guess it just isn't my day." I guess I just blocked his bingo.
>David_Koenig: AEFMNOR O4 FORAMEN +120 339
#note A minute or so passes, and Dave whistles a different tune: "Oh, maybe it *is* my day," and proceeds to lay down all seven tiles.

#note Needless to say, the flow of the game has shifted seismically.
>Rod: GNRRVXY -GNRRVY +0 289
#note Given my rack, I immediately recognize that my changes of winning this game have all but disappeared. I must exchange, and fully expect to be down 80+ on a worse board. I've already gotta start thinking about containing the margin. Holding out hope, but recognizing the reality.
>David_Koenig: AUY 2G .UAY +24 363
#note This play surprised me a bit. I know Dave needs to make his number (91+) to catch me for 3rd, but this play seems increase my chances of winning straight up. Tough call, and I don't know his rack, so it's hard to say.
>Rod: FIORTTX L2 FIXT +30 319
#note FIXT is by far the highest scoring play and the best leave. But it isn't a no-brainer in this KOH scenario. By this time, I've figured out that Marlon has indeed lost, so 2nd place is there to be taken. But FIXT probably means I can kiss 2nd place goodbye. OTOH, it goes a long towards locking up 3rd. And hey, maybe a timely draw lets me bingo...
>David_Koenig: ARVY 13C VARY +29 392
#note Aggressive play by Dave, which creates all sorts of problems for me.
>Rod: DEGIORT 5B GE.OT +26 345
#note I wasn't happy with this play at all, but I needed to make a decision. After a long turn and with time ticking down, I knew it was at least a reasonable choice. In hindsight, GRIOT looks right. OLEIC scores best, but the pool seems to short on vowels for that. EDITOR just looks insane... no way I'm giving him free run of bingoing down the A column. 
>David_Koenig: DEOOW B11 WOOED +29 421
>Rod: ?DIINRU A7 DIURoN +28 373
#note The blank arrives, but I'd have to be crazy to fish now. I can't improve the board and anything I draw is absolutely going to be blocked... assuming he can't bingo himself. Down 76, the only sensible thing to do is race out. Score well now and deny him 2 turns. Concede the game, but lock up the cash. I'm comfortable with that :-)
>David_Koenig: DEELRST 10G SE.D +31 452
>Rod: AI A14 AI +17 390
>Rod:  (ELRT) +8 398
#note Nice win, Dave.
