#note dave is a very solid player who's been studying a lot. i think one of the only thing he needs right now is a method for never missing the real high prob bingos. i use anamonics.. but i can understand seeing this in alphagram and if you don't see it right away you're not gonna keep looking.

#note oh of course.. should kill the QI spot. once in a while he'll have it and i'll end up losing and getting pissed at myself for playing so fast. (-3)

#note my move blows as there's a significant number of ways i can assure a win. this is the quackle that doesn't have the win% bug fixed yet though. for example, if David has FOVEATE D1, that's 89 + 22 from my rack for a final score of 498-495 in my favor. so i THINK this still wins 100%, but it's not smart. there might be a better bingo. and i also didn't quite calculate this during the game, i thought i'd still win comfortably. L3 BAH is a lot smarter. (-22)

#note he told me he was very close to fouette, which only loses by 3. D6 FETA would block a higher scoring play for me.
