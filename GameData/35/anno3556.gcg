#note Play is obvious, placement not so much. Ducky agrees, even if I did end up getting hit on both sides.

#note Q clearly likes KO at 9F. Can't say I agree. (-7.1)

#note Not only is EPIGONi simming better, but it might've drawn a challenge. (-1.2)

#note Wasn't sure, but decided to take a chance. Call it the "Jeff Clark theory". When you put a questionable word on the board, three things can happen: 1) Opp lets it go. 2) Opp challenges and it's good. 3) Opp challenges and it's bad. Two of those three are good. If I put odds at 50/50 on him challenging, 50/50 on it being good, there's a 75% chance it stays on. Did not know WHERR(I)ES, simming vastly better. (-4.7)

#note So far, pretty nondescript and it looks like I'm cruising to 5-0. But my mistakes are coming and this game's gonna get interesting.

#note A WTF play, which I knew at the time. Too bad CWM(s) was blocked. I'm at least pleased to see this sim higher than all exchanges. I hate passing up by about 70 ... at least this makes bingos a little harder and the H1 triple harder (and Z plays) a little harder to hit. Q likes the point grab with GI(T)S at 11D. Don't know why I didn't. I take the advice next turn. Meanwhile, William misreads the play and says "the calm before the storm..." (-12.1)
>William_Shipe: AEFORTY 6H FOY +42 258
#note (William's exact rack here.)
>Jason: ACCGIMS 11D MA.S +32 337
#note D'oh! Recognized A- front hookage when I played BRIDGE, but must've forgotten. MICA at 2L's clearly the star play. (-12.3)
>William_Shipe: ?AEERTV 5B oVERATE +74 332
#note Ruh-roh.
>Jason: CCGIOTV D2 CIV.T +20 357
#note Wow, Ducky really hates the CG combo. I know it's bad, but I'm really getting hit for not breaking it up. Duck likes VOIC(E) or VOGI(E) at D1, but I felt that gave up too much. And I really should've kept the I here. Neither of us were great on time, though. (-11.6)
>William_Shipe: IORS 2J .ORIS +28 360
#note This is one of those plays that I didn't like at the time, but now I think it's brilliant, so brilliant I'm not even sure Bill knows how good it was. :) If Bill's leave includes AT or AU, it's a great Q setup should he draw it. Should I have drawn it, I'm forced to ditch it for 22. And if he has it, good chance he can cash in big, with the AAATU unplayed, with 22 as a backup plan. I originally read this play as him not having the Q, but now I think I maybe shouldn't have made that inference. Meanwhile, I'm sensing this game slipping away and I hate blowing triple-digit leads.
>Jason: ACEEGOO 5J .O.E +23 380
#note OK, so what to do? I'd guess each of us are under four minutes (Bill maybe even under three) and time's ticking. At the time, I was happy with this play. I figure if Bill has the Q, that I can't waste time making a play like OE to block QAT or QUA ... he plays Q(I) for 22, goes up 17 with endgame tempo. Meanwhile, I'm not ready for the Q. I'm hoping it'll surprise him on his last draw. So, I need to score, ditch vowels, and play short. Surprisingly, I can do all three. CP likes two plays I should've seen, but didn't. GOO at 1K scores semi-decently, blocks the Q spot, and makes him empty on the number with Q(I). Not as sure about CO(C)OA, the valuation leader. GOO wins 40+%, this less than 25%. (-15.8)
>William_Shipe: NR 3C R.N +6 366
#note F*ck.
>Jason: ACEGOOQ C5 .AC +13 393
#note (T)EG at 6D loses by four. This is supposed to lose by 23. For whatever reason, I felt like blocking OY at 6A was a priority. Five consecutive double-digit errors rarely win games...
>William_Shipe: AAORTUY 12M .A +2 368
#note He has boatloads of better wins here, but short on time he played this for whatever reason. It took embarrassingly long for me to notice it was a Y setup. I can't remember if he went over on time this turn or the next one.
>Jason: EGOOQ O12 GO +11 404
#note I remember having about 40 seconds after this play, because I originally counted it as nine, then immediately saw it was 11, so I had to recount it on my time. Somehow best ... I'm only supposed to lose by 14, four with Bill over time.
>William_Shipe: AORTUY O12 ..RY +24 392
#note Now he's supposed to block the lone Q spot with OY and outrun. I know by now he was over, though.
>Jason: EOQ B5 .E +8 412
#note Q(I)'s my only winning play ... I stupidly didn't see my outs with OE and was still in "one-at-a-time, maximize points" mode. Supposed to lose by four with time penalty. Down to about 15 seconds.
>William_Shipe: AOTU D11 ...O +8 400
#note Playing off OT or OU is best. Leaves outs if I play off the Q or elsewhere if I don't.
>Jason: OQ M1 Q. +11 423
#note I finally get it right, even though I was so short of time I didn't even know if it won.
>William_Shipe: ATU 1M .UA +38 438
>Jason: O 10M .O +5 428
#note Weird game. Bill becomes the second player to outscore me and lose on time (Kevin Leeds in Dayton).
>Jason:  (T) +2 430
