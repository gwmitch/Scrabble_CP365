#note Terrible play, missing INH(A)LED. 
>Dave_Wiegand: BDEGU B6 BUDGE +24 66
>Noah: ADEIILN A6 ANI +24 39
#note Saw LIANE, but wasn't absolutely sure. I even thought ANI might outweigh LIANE. LIANE looks like the better play here, says sim.

>Dave_Wiegand: ENW C12 WEN +21 107
>Noah: ?INNOPT 7H PONTINe +64 141
#note Thought about NONPoINT/NONPrINT, but wasn't sure of them at all.

#note Stupid!
>Dave_Wiegand: AFNR L7 .NFRA +16 171
>Noah: ABDEOOR K10 OBA +20 183
#note Quackle prefers BOO, I think for the superior leave and plenty of aggresive hooking potential (BOOR, WEND).

>Dave_Wiegand: AMRTY 5J TRYMA +31 219
>Noah: EEEFUVW 14H FEW +22 240
#note This sims very close wih CUVEE and WEE,  which I thought about. All are good options.
>Dave_Wiegand: GU L3 GU. +14 233
>Noah: EEIMSUV 4H VIE +12 252
#note This is a terrible play. I need to be blocking the C line, not this line. I love Quackle's choice of ABUSIVE 6A, which I didn't think of. That would have ended up blocking all of his bingos for this turn. A bunch of other stuff is better than this as well.

#note YOGEE 4J is 15 better.
>Dave_Wiegand: ALOTV M1 AVO +18 385
>Noah: EIOS O8 .OSIE +8 334
#note Thought about something like OSE 9G, but found this to be slightly better. I didn't think to put OSE at 5E though. That's two points better.
