>moh: ?EINUYZ 8G ZIN +24 24
#note Interesting opener. How often is there a legitimate question between exchanging and scoring 52? I considered throwing the UY back in the back, being assured of a good score on my next play with the Z, and probably (about 70% of the time) a bingo. There's also the possibility of scoring big now with a play like ZINgY or ZINkY, although they spend the blank and keep the undesirable U. I decided to take the middle road with 8G ZIN 24. The exchange wins the sim.
>Dave: DENOY J5 DOYEN +24 24
>moh: ?EEGJUY 5H JU.GE +28 52
#note I absolutely must get rid of two of the tiles from the JYU trio (all three if it were possible). JU(D)GE is the easy way to accomplish this and the clear winner.
>Dave: AEFILRW F6 FLAWIER +87 111
#note Nicely done, Dave. The only bingo.
>moh: ?AAELSY K8 SAYAbLE +85 137
#note Lots of options (AnALYSE, pA(R)ALYSE, A(I)SLEwAY), but the best is SAYAbLE.
>Dave: ADIK M3 KADI +34 145
>moh: AEEPRSU 14J P.REA +26 163
#note REPAUSE? I don't think so. My P(E)REA turned out to be pretty bad. The computer likes several setup plays (10K (Y)AUP, 3L U(K)E, 3M (K)UE), but I think the best play is L9 PEREA (and the five-word overlap). I wish I'd seen it at the time.
>Dave: AEOT 15G TOEA +16 161
>moh: BEEEGSU E5 BEE +17 180
#note The all-star play is 12D BU(R)GEE, which has the stellar ES leave and scores well enough. While my E5 BEE 17 isn't terrible, the L9 placement is better.
>Dave: MOO E11 MOO +20 181
>moh: CEGINSU 14B CUING +30 210
#note Easy and obvious, CUING is best. For the newer players, why is CUING so obvious? While it scores pretty well, what makes it obvious is that it (a) has no positional drawbacks (it doesn't open anything up on the board) and (b) the leave is excellent (ES one of the best two-tile (no blank) leaves). 
>Dave: ?EHIIST 3G SHIITa.E +66 247
#note While Dave's find is nice, the nine-letter 12A HIST(OR)IEs is best. Also available was M8 EIgHTI(E)S. While it might seem nitpicky to criticize a bingo, the willingness to search for better bingos is one of the things that separates lower players from strong intermediate players. The numbers say it all: SHIITa(K)E wins about 45% of the time, whereas HISTORIES wins more than 60%.
>moh: EILRRST 6D R.. +6 216
#note LISTER goes with almost all of the remaining tiles, so my R(EF) gives me a great chance to bingo past Dave next play. With the T(REF) hook down column C, and the (SHIITAKE)S hook down column O, I'll likely have a place for the hoped bingo.
>Dave: FO H1 FO. +27 274
>moh: EILLRST O3 STILLER +89 305
#note Just as hoped!
>Dave: BCU M11 CUB. +16 290
>moh: ANOORSU 15M RAN +20 325
#note The best play was 9D RO(W)AN 23, which scored well and left the reasonable (even for a Sooner) OSU leave. 1H FOU is also interesting, as it keeps the great ANORS leave and kills the worrisome J2 hotspot (the X is unseen). My play was pathetic compared to those.
>Dave: ADERTWX -  +0 290
#note My bad play paid off! Dave challenged CUBER and lost a turn.
>moh: AOOOSUW N8 WOO +15 340
#note I considered an exchange, but WOO scores just enough to justify playing though this muck.
>Dave: HPT C12 PH.T +18 308
>moh: AEOSUVX 2J XU +52 392
#note The key tile is mine! That should seal this game.
>Dave: DI O1 DI....... +30 338
#note Very nice play! that keep Dave just close enough to have hope.
>moh: ADEOQSV H7 Q. +11 403
#note A Q-stick is one way this game could turn sour. Good riddance!
>Dave: MN N2 M.N +21 359
>moh: ADEIOSV D4 VA.S +21 424
#note I became obsessed with blocking the T(REF) hook, but the best play was D8 VIDEO 43.
