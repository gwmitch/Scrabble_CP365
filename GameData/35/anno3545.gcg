#note One of my great failings as a player is sensory overload.  If you give me too many decisions in a short time frame, I start to make some pretty crappy ones and I tend to rush through other ones so that "my brain can recharge".  This is a perfect  example, where I have a lot of decisions and as a result my brain tries to rush through some simpler looking racks that aren't so simple and I make a lot of second-best plays.

#note This is a pretty tough play, and you can make a good case for a number of plays here.

#note Missing EXPIATOR.  Played way too fast.  Little did I know I would miss another bingo in THE SAME GAME.

#note While WATAPE also opens another lane (and actually another 2 lanes), I don't think I have the time to rebuild my rack. I need to hit something sooner rather than later.  Bogowin is indifferent.  I think there's a big difference.

#note It's nice to make one good play when I've already made one horrible play and am going to make another horrible one later.  While this looks like an absolute donkey play, it's actually best by quite a ways, and it's not just because I'm playing against Quackle.  In fact, this would work even better against a human.

#note Missed HONEyBUN.  This is a very crippling miss, and I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't look for very long on this play either.  A bingo starting with H on this rack?!
