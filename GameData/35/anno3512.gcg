>Mellow_Max: AEPTY H8 PEATY +28 28
>Evzone: AGHOPRW 11E WAR.HOG +56 56
#note  Saw WHOP (g6, 30), looked for something better.  Bingo.
>Mellow_Max: CEE 12D CEE +17 45
>Evzone: EGIOPRS L5 PORGIES +77 133
>Mellow_Max: EEKW 10C WEEK +44 89
#note  He took an awfully long time playing this, suggesting a blank was among his remaining tiles.
>Evzone: EFIIRRU 8J FI.URE +30 163
#note  Even if I really think he has a blank, what's the use of bottling up the board? And let's not forget the goal: to score more points than the other guy.
>Mellow_Max: ?EGINRT O1 GRaTINE. +77 166
#note  REiGNIT(E) scores three more.  Good for it.
>Evzone: ADIILOR K3 DIOL +20 183
#note  Ends up pretty even in the sim with IDOL in the same spot.  I preferred the D up top in case he had a bingo ending in that letter that won't hit the DWS.  (Slightly silly logic, I know.)
>Mellow_Max: DMOO G6 DOOM +22 188
>Evzone: ?AILQRS 3I QA.IS +50 233
#note  Good thing he didn't play DOOM for one more point (j2, 23) or else it's a much lower scoring Q-move.
>Mellow_Max: AILV F4 VAIL +16 204
#note  He originally placed it as VIAL and then swapped the vowels.  Why create a hook when you don't have to?
>Evzone: ?ELORUZ J10 Z.O +32 265
#note  Thought about Z(A) (j2, 31), but didn't mind shedding an extra vowel.
>Mellow_Max: ATX 3E TAX +26 230
#note  Thanks a bunch.  Spot the bingo he blocked.
>Evzone: ?AELRUU I3 .UALE +15 280
#note Had I seen ULU (n4, 13), I would've considered it.  QUALE isn't bad either.  (nEURULA(E) was the answer for last turn.)
>Mellow_Max: DIIN 13J NIDI +23 253
#note  When I had decided on Z(O)O, I figured it would only hurt if he had the remaining M (since he'd almost be wasting an S if it wasn't a bingo).  Whoops.
>Evzone: ?ACDJRU 5C JUR. +22 302
#note  With the unseen vowels trailing the consonants by a 2:1 count, I was hesitant to use any vowels.  J(EWE)D or CR(EWE)D could have achieved that goal, but the points mattered more.
>Mellow_Max: BHOTY N7 B.OTHY +20 273
#note  I've seen this somewhere before...hold...BROTHIER any good? Nah, couldn't be...
>Evzone: ?ACDRTV -  +0 302
#note  Smooth move, moron.  (At least I was right that BROTHIER isn't acceptable.)  I probably shouldn't have challenged in a close situation, but I couldn't help but feel a negative vibe coming from this word.  If I had a solid o12-15 play, then I probably would have held back.
>Mellow_Max: EMNO O12 OMEN +27 300
#note  And now we really have a game.  Quick, time to focus...
>Evzone: ?ACDRTV D4 D.CT +14 316
#note  No way this is correct.  With 2 Ss unseen, there's an easy chance for 30+ underneath.  C(U)D or D(U)CAT through the same U is preferrable.  Even the CR(EWE)D option makes more sense.
>Mellow_Max: AEEST 8A TEASE +27 327
#note  So he's emptying the bag and using a bunch of pretty good tiles.  I didn't ask him after what his other two letters were, but it might have been better to go short.
>Evzone: ?ABNRUV 14F VARUs +28 344
#note  With him running out of time, I didn't waste too long.  Of course, I had to make sure there was more than one outplay.  Check.
>Mellow_Max: AFILNNS A3 INFAN.S +11 338
>Evzone: BN G13 B.N +8 352
>Evzone:  (L) +2 354
#note  Wow.  So I screwed up twice late and still came out on the right side.  I love this game.
