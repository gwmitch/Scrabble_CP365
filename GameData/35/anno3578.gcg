#note I want to keep the board open when behind and bingo as fast as possible, even at the expense of some equity.  I think OH is the right play here.

#note I do like this okay.  There aren't a lot of 3x3 to fade and I need to be comfortable in case of o4.  I also kind of like the REX-PREX setup long term.
>Opponent: CIJMNOU 13A .OM.JI +36 318
>Kenji: ?CEPQRU 1G PUlQ.E +51 414
#note Maybe QUERCiNE or PUlQUE at j1.  CR seemed to save me from more of the disaster draws that you come, and the sim reflects this.  Tough call.  I'd go with PUlQUE at 1j in hindsight allowing me to play at 4k more safely next turn, but I wanted to protect bingos more for this turn and I figured the equity would be nice. 
>Opponent: CDEEINU 4H NUC.EI +18 336
>Kenji: AACIIRT 2I AI. +19 433
#note Pretty much nothing I could do about the impending doom to follow.  I figured that I'd at least get NECTAR next turn and this should outrun plays like FLIGHTS, as that would let me win by 3 (FLIGHTS-NECTAR-DEX).  DADO first wouldn't help either.  I'm pretty sure I just ran into the ultimate disaster scenario.  I didn't even see what was to come as a possibility.
>Opponent: DEEFGHS 6B H.. +21 357
#note Great play.
>Kenji: ACIIRTT H10 .ITRIC +27 460
#note Ouch.  Not as improbably as it seems, but still, ouch.
