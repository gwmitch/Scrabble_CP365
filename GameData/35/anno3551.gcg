>Rob_Robinsky: ADFILNT 8D FLINT +24 24
>Jim_Kramer: ?EIMQST F6 Qu.ETISM +90 90
#note You know, if this Kramer guy sticks around, he might just have a future in this game.
>Rob_Robinsky: AADIKTU E11 KA +26 50
>Jim_Kramer: PWY 12D W..PY +34 124
>Rob_Robinsky: AADITUV 6E A.UAVIT +21 71
#note Quackle slightly prefers H12 YAUD, which I would like more if I had an S in hand.  Because I'm down and I don't, I prefer the turnover.
>Jim_Kramer: AIOPR H1 APORI. +27 151
>Rob_Robinsky: BDMNOOR G1 MOB +25 96
#note This and BROOM 5A are about equal.  BROOM makes a bit more sense, especially now that I've slightly complicated the S for the board...extra eight lines increase the volatility, which I need.
>Jim_Kramer: INO H12 .ONI +21 172
>Rob_Robinsky: ?DIJNOR 5B DJIN +28 124
#note A D in hand is better than no hook at all.  I shouldn't have been as concerned about vowel/consonant balance as I was.
>Jim_Kramer: AAEL F1 ALAE +23 195
>Rob_Robinsky: ?AFGORW K2 FAGO. +18 142
#note Right word, wrong place.  10B is clearly better, I just missed it.  Though as it turns out, this helped me.
>Jim_Kramer: EILNORT 10F .ROTLINE +60 255
>Rob_Robinsky: ?DORRWX M9 R.DOX +28 170
#note A tough choice.  L4 OX scores best, but bingoing next turn still isn't very likely.  M9 REWORD looks to be best by a hair.  I'm giving too much back with REDOX, but at this point I'm starting to feel a bit desperate.
>Jim_Kramer: AEU L13 EAU +13 268
>Rob_Robinsky: ?DEENRW B2 WoN.ERED +78 248
#note WANDERED sets up the Z, which is why Quackle likes it a bit more.  Given the inevitable hotspot at A8, maybe it's right...I still don't really like it.
>Jim_Kramer: EGOS L3 GOES +41 309
>Rob_Robinsky: CORSTUZ J1 COZ +36 284
#note I still don't like WANDERED.
>Jim_Kramer: BEY A6 BEY +45 354
>Rob_Robinsky: EHLRSTU N4 HURTLES +77 361
>Jim_Kramer: CETU O1 CUTE +27 381
#note Quackle's choice in the endgame loses by 2.  I prefer to try to steal the game, which requires nonlinear thinking -- what is the likeliest way to induce Jim to make a rare endgame mistake?
>Rob_Robinsky: AEHINRV K8 NA.VER +28 389
>Jim_Kramer: DEGIS M1 IDS +36 417
#note In order for me to win, Jim needs to overlook my highest scoring outplay.  In playing NAIVER, my hope was that Jim would take his highest scoring play and be happy with it.  I was shocked when he did.
