>Rod_MacNeil: EHIMRST 8D HERMITS +82 82
#note RM: I don't mind an occasional layup to start.
>Jason_Keller: AEFKLOO D8 .OOKA +24 24
#note JK: Sim likes 7C KOA or 7G OKA, but this is close, and I prefer to turn both Os over.
>Rod_MacNeil: AENOSTU 13D SOUTANE +72 154
#note JK: At this point, I think I've already told Rod to stop it.
>Jason_Keller: CDDEFLR H12 F.RD +36 60
>Rod_MacNeil: ?BEIIOT 7H BIOtITE +69 223
#note JK: I think I chuckled a bit when this went down.  Third straight layup.
>Jason_Keller: CDEELUX 15A EXCLUDE. +110 170
#note RM: Okay, maybe not a runaway. 
#note JK: I was glad that I played FARD rather than CALF on the last turn.
>Rod_MacNeil: GLNRSUZ J12 L.Z +32 255
#note RM: Scores well, eats up at big hotspot, and probably the best leave I can hope for. Given the letters available for 8s, I'm even optimistic I could bingo next turn.
>Jason_Keller: AAEGHMO 14A HA +33 203
#note JK: I'm surprised that this play simmed so badly.  6H OGHAM wins the sim here.  I saw it in my rack, but didn't see where it went on the board.  I didn't think the TLS at 6J was that juicy, and I still wanted to keep the board open being behind.
>Rod_MacNeil: GJNRSUW N6 J.W +29 284
#note RM: This was a tougher call than it might seem. I hated to go short again, and JEW is a lot less defensive than it may appear. It could get in his way... or maybe make it more accessible. Ultimately, the leave wins out, and I like that the open I is now isolated and likely to be available next turn. 
>Jason_Keller: AEGMNOT 6B MAGNETO +73 276
#note JK: Highest-scoring...  I gave myself an extra point by accident.
>Rod_MacNeil: GNNRSUV L4 UNR.G +16 300
#note RM: I never considered GUVS. Big oversight. I'm not afraid of V and I hate keeping duplicate Ns, but the score/defense combo is significant. 
>Jason_Keller: ADFIORW O8 OW +30 306
>Rod_MacNeil: CENPQSV -PQV +0 300
#note RM: Good news, bad news. Pleased to see a good vowel, but CPQ added to the mix forces an exchange at a critical juncture. I've lost the upper hand, but at least I can trade short.
>Jason_Keller: AADEFIR E10 FAD. +36 342
>Rod_MacNeil: BCEENNS 14J .EBEC +36 336
#note RM: Gotta keep up, and this is the only thing that does it. Holding the S is great, but NN with it makes me less than optimistic about cashing the hook next turn.
>Jason_Keller: AEGIORV O1 VIRAGO +42 384
>Rod_MacNeil: ?ANNNSU 5A NUN +9 345
#note RM: The arrival of the blank is welcome, but now I can't score anything. I'm forced to pry the board open and start thinking bingo. Not how I wanted to this endgame to develop.
>Jason_Keller: DEELPST O12 PEST +46 430
#note RM: Game changing play. I clearly needed to beat him to the spot. Now even a bingo may not be enough. Wow, this game sure seemed to turn in a hurry. Didn't I open with 3 consec. bingos? 
#note JK: Obvious, but something that I don't play a few short months ago because I hope to get a bingo. And yes, Rod, you did start with three straight bingos.
>Rod_MacNeil: ?ALNRSV 4B VAN +23 368
#note RM: Went with VAN based on keeping the R as a better bingo tile. It is, but doing so will force me to use the blank to hook ANA (which I need to do to make a bingo worth anything). Shoulda played VAR, keeping the N, which retains the full flexibility of the blank.
>Jason_Keller: DEELRTY 10M DYE +21 451
#note JK: Rod needs to bingo here.  I figure that I have to take this line out with a blank and an E still out there.  Sim say N2 LEY...  Really?
>Rod_MacNeil: ?IILQRS K11 QI +24 392
#note RM: Bad time for the Q to show up. Glad I can at least dump it for a mediocre score and stay in range.
>Jason_Keller: EIILPRT L11 IT +21 472
#note JK: This was the play that I was least happy with for the game.  If I make a play that leaves one in the bag, I don't really need to worry about this spot.  CP says E3 PEIN, which makes row 3 bingos harder, and near-guarantees the win.
>Rod_MacNeil: ?AEILRS 3C mAILERS +74 466
#note RM: Friendly vowels give me what I need here. It's all I can do, but I need the Y to be in the bag, or he's scoring way too much.
>Jason_Keller: EIILOPR H1 PO.E +21 493
#note JK: I've tracked correctly, but my board vision fails here.  Find my lone winning play, which is not this.
>Rod_MacNeil: AY 9G YA +26 492
#note RM: Fun game, enjoyed it. 
#note JK: Well-played, Rod.
>Rod_MacNeil:  (IILR) +8 500
