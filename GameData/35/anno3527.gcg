#note This is an interesting position. QI for the bingo. F3 QAT for the shot at an out next turn. Half of the time I draw into A, E, or O for PASTER/PESTER/POSTER at O10. Really I wasn't even considering not doing QI. I thought I needed to bingo to win. QAT is high win%. QI high valuation. What would you do?
