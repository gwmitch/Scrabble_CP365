#note Not the *type* of play you want to make keeping RS, but it's basically the only option. LAV is the only other play that's even palatable.

#note There's a bunch of reasonable options here, and I'm not very good at differentiating between them. It seems like I can go in a few different directions here. A play like WAIST or LWEIS on the N column goes for points and decent leaves on a wide-open board. WE N6 plays for the bingo now, but I'm not sure I have to do that against Frank. It also (along with the other column N plays) opens a big scoring lane. A play like WITE or WIDE 11K, which I considered, sort of goes in between and is more defensive short-term. I'd appreciate any opinions on this play--I don't know what Quackle's biases are here for each play. If I had a redo right now I'd probably play LWEIS, but I'm not happy or unhappy with any of the five main options. Maybe a play like TELIA 8K is better? I just don't know what's right.

#note Completely missed LEUCEMIA.

#note UNION F2 looks like a nice play.

>Frank: BEHIOUW G3 BOW +26 347
#note Quackle really prefers BOWED 11I, but this takes away the main bingo line without giving many bingoes back. 
>Sam: DGMOTUY H1 GUY +28 313
>Frank: EHIORUX 11K R..UX +26 373
#note Pretty risky play with four Es out. Both Champ. Player and a sim like EURO I3, which looks like a terrific play to me. 
>Sam: DEEMOQT -QEMOT +0 313
#note Not on Champ Player's choices, but rose to the top of the two-ply sim. I like this play a lot, but open to hearing other options.
>Frank: EHILNOP B6 POI +17 390
#note I don't like this play at all. Quackle suggests something like HELO or HELP I2. This gives the opponent one shot at the unlikely ING bingo or a bingo ending in A or I. HELO seems alright to me. Frank only took 9 seconds on this play--I think he should have looked harder, it was a key mistake. No offense, Frank, if you're reading this :)
>Sam: ?CDEIOY 1A DECOYIn. +95 408
#note Didn't know the cool GYnECOID 1H, which is surely better. Could have been a game-losing error.
>Frank: AEEHLNQ O10 E.HALE +60 450
#note Frank and I talked about this play as the game was winding down. Even though it leads to an inevitable Q-stick, EXHALE has to be right, and Frank has to hope he can withstand the Q-stick by a few points. 
>Sam: EEMSTTZ C3 MEZES +41 449
#note I believe I could have wrung some spread points out here by slow-playing, starting with JOWS 5E. I was happy taking the assured win, though.
