>Matthew: ADGGSUV 8F VUGG +18 18
#note 8G, 8E, 8F all very close after a long sim. (-1.0)
>Deen_Hergott: ?EEINVZ F6 VI.E +18 18
>Matthew: AABDDRS E9 BAD +16 34
#note DAB for one point less wins the sim. Is the -E hook on BAD to blame for this? (-3.2)
>Deen_Hergott: ?AENOOZ D9 OZONAtE +101 119
#note Deen is wary of a CHE(Z) or PRE(Z) if he takes the D7 placement. Quackle says it's not worth the 9 points and opening the triple lane, though.
>Matthew: ADEERST 15A RES.ATED +131 165
>Deen_Hergott: EENOOST 6F .OE +6 125
>Matthew: CEIJLOR 13C C.JOLE +32 197
#note Turned down REJOIC(E) fearing the triple lane. But Quackle says it was best. (-2.3)
>Deen_Hergott: EGNORST A8 STRONGE. +80 205
>Matthew: AADIIOR 12H OIDIA +17 214
#note H1 ROADI(E) is a silly miss. Easy to ignore vowels on the board with a rack like this. (-2.2)
>Deen_Hergott: ?HIKNOS J2 HONKIeS +83 288
#note H1 HONKI(E) is 54 keeping S?.
>Matthew: ABFRTUY 3I F.RBY +34 248
#note H1 BARYT(E) is a miss. I think I know that word. F(O)RBY sims below a bunch of plays. (-11.8)
>Deen_Hergott: EILNNNU L3 .UNN +12 300
>Matthew: AAERTUW 5H WA.E. +29 277
#note Ugh. Somehow I saw this and missed 5G WAU(K). And I looked all over the board for a spot to dump AUW. (-8.1)
>Deen_Hergott: EILLNRU C6 NULL +13 313
>Matthew: AARRSTU J12 .URA +7 284
#note I11 A(I)R. CAJOLER wasn't something I was sure of. (-7.7)
>Deen_Hergott: ADEEIMR D3 DREAM +22 335
>Matthew: AEIPRST L8 SEPT.RIA +62 346
>Deen_Hergott: EIMQTWY 8L .WIM +27 362
#note You could have done 4A QWE(R)TY, Deen! But don't worry, I'm sure you'll get another chance to play that word five years from now.
>Matthew: AFHIIPT 14F PI +24 370
#note Surprisingly there's nothing better.
>Deen_Hergott: EIOQTXY C2 QI +28 390
#note Okay. I think there's no winning endgame for me here. The best I can probably hope for is a loss by 1. But we're gonna go ahead and try for the best sequence anyways, because there's no guarantee the opponent will make the best play. I spent quite a while on this one. Try to find the best moves. There might be more than one way to go about this, considering we're technically working with a 0 win%.
>Matthew: ACFHILT N6 FL.T +15 385
>Deen_Hergott: EEOTTXY E4 EX +38 428
#note One point less than 2M OXY, but Deen couldn't be certain I didn't have some big play through the Y like *HYIC or something.
>Matthew: ACHI G2 CHIA. +27 412
#note Another option would have been to do 8M WHA last turn hoping that Deen wouldn't see the massive CLIFT setup. I might have tried that if I had seen it.
>Matthew:  (EOTTY) +16 428
