>Dallas: AAEIOTX 9G OX +29 29
#note Quackle's 3rd, but highest scoring, choice.  I like it best.
>Mary_Kay_Quinn: EELR F9 LEER +16 42
>Dallas: AAAEIIT -AAII +0 29
#note I should've played AT(AX)IS here.  It's almost as good as my exchange, and gets rid of almost the same tiles.
>Mary_Kay_Quinn: AGNT 7H TANG +22 64
>Dallas: ?AEESTW L7 SWEATEr +82 111
#note Best, although WETwA(R)ES might have drawn a challenge (if I knew it).
>Mary_Kay_Quinn: CDER 11D CR.ED +16 80
>Dallas: EGIILNR 8L .ING +24 135
#note Quackle likes LI 6I best, but I'll take the points.
>Mary_Kay_Quinn: AQ 11J QA. +24 104
>Dallas: DEEILRU 12I RID. +19 154
#note U(N)DERLIE - another missed bingo.  Dang!

>Dallas: IIILNRS 1K .IN +6 183
#note (B)LINI would've been good, if I knew it.  I played this as a block.  But, I failed to account for . . .
>Mary_Kay_Quinn: EG 1K ...GE +24 185
#note . . . this.  Pretty dumb.
>Dallas: HIILORS 6I HI. +21 204
#note ROSHI or RISHI (learn the 5's, Dallas) would've been better.  Wow, if this tournament showed me anything, it's the absolute essentiality of the 5's.

#note I'm trying to clear my rack here, in the hopes of a bingo.  But, I should have gone for a scoring play first, and looked to clean the rack up second.
>Mary_Kay_Quinn: ENT D3 TEN +12 254
>Dallas: ADIKNRT 3B KA. +14 264
#note The back and forth continues.  For the only time in this tourney, I have major ratings points on the line against a lower rated player, and I'm passing up scoring to try for a desperation bingo.
>Mary_Kay_Quinn: FLOO B9 FOOL +17 271
>Dallas: DEINRST 14F TINDERS +72 336
#note And, like a little luckbox*, I get the bingo.  As a bonus, I draw the last blank when I replenish, so this game is truly over.
