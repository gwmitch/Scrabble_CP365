#note OK, this gets strange. David played 2M REI/RERADIATED/EX for 35. I challenge. Since RERADIATED is 10 letters long, we agree that the long list needs to be consulted. It isn't in the long list (though it's in the OWL2), so it comes off the board. It is only after the game is over that the directors realize the error, and David is awarded spread points, though this ruling will ultimately cost him the game.

#note Steal victory from the jaws of defeat, though it's clearly a tainted win, given the misadjudication. Keep in mind that this game took place shortly after the new dictionary took effect, but before the new long list was published. We both agreed that the word should be looked up in the long list, and neither of us even thought to consult the OWL2, though in hindsight we obviously should have...
