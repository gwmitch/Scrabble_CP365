>Dallas: AHKLNOO 8D HOOKA +32 32
#note My best play.
>Tim_Smith: DNO 9C DON +13 13
>Dallas: ELNRSVW H7 V.W +9 41
#note Second only to (HO)VEL.
>Tim_Smith: ILO 7D OIL +14 27
>Dallas: EEILNRS C1 RELINES +71 112
#note Let the bagging begin!
>Tim_Smith: JSU 10F JUS +36 63
>Dallas: AAEILNR 1C .ENAIL +21 133
#note I wish I knew (V)ALERIAN.  That would have drawn a challenge, I'm sure.

>Dallas: ADEIRSW E3 W.D +14 147
>Tim_Smith: EIT 3E .ITE +8 83
>Dallas: AEIRRST 4H TARSIER +69 216
#note Quackle prefers ARTSIER.  But, I chose TARSIER, because I know Tim, and . . .
>Tim_Smith: ?BCHIIM -  +0 83
#note . . . I thought a challenge was very likely.  He did not disappoint.
>Dallas: BHOOTUX 3K OXO +35 251
#note How do I not know HOTBOX?  I really wasted some prime opportunities for some smack down.
>Tim_Smith: INQU B8 QUIN +20 103
>Dallas: ?BGHITU A10 BUG +14 265
>Tim_Smith: OP 11F OP +17 120
>Dallas: ?HINTVY E11 THY +28 293
#note VINY 12C would have been much better here.
>Tim_Smith: AEEIR 12G AERIE +11 131
>Dallas: ?AEFINV K9 FAV. +20 313
#note Quackle wants me to use my E for 10 more points.  When I'm up by almost 200, my instinct is to build towards a bingo.
>Tim_Smith: ?FZ J8 FiZ +69 200
>Dallas: ?EILMNU -  +0 313
#note UGH.  Not only do I challenge a Z 3 that I should've known, Tim tells me I challenged the same word about a year ago.  And, for good measure, I could've played (R)ELUMINe (or RELUMING) if I knew it.
>Tim_Smith: ACG 13B CAG. +20 220
>Dallas: ?EILMNU B4 .UM +25 338
#note O.K., I'm back.  The duck says this is best.
>Tim_Smith: AB 12C BA. +26 246
>Dallas: ?EEEILN 5E .EE +4 342
#note Not the draw I was looking for, but I cleaned up the extra E's.
>Tim_Smith: GIT I11 T.IG +6 252
>Dallas: ?AEILNP 10J ..P +14 356
#note I saw and passed up ALPINEs, because I thought it was no good.  One of so many that I could've played.
>Tim_Smith: AMSY 15F YAMS +33 285
>Dallas: ?AEEILN N4 .EALINEd +61 417
#note Why not (R)ENAILEd?  It's the same stupid blank designation.  Oh, well.
>Dallas: ?AEEILN --  -61 356
#note And he used his free challenge correctly.
>Tim_Smith: DDNORRT L12 ROD +20 305
>Dallas: ?AEEILN N4 .ENAILEd +61 417
#note Ah, that's better.
