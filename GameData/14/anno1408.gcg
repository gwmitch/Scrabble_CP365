>Steve: ?CEOOSV 8F VOE +12 12
#note Wanted to trot out COVOtES*, but didn't like it's chance of being elected to be good by my opponent.
>Elaine_Glowniak: MNW G7 M.WN +16 16
>Steve: ?CEOSUU -UU +0 12
#note Missing two bingoes thru the N, neither of which I knew.
>Elaine_Glowniak: CDIIT 10F I.DICT +17 33
>Steve: ??CEIOS K5 COrdI.ES +82 94
#note Bittersweet to draw the other blank on the last pick. To top it off, I underscored the play by four points.
>Elaine_Glowniak: Q I9 Q. +21 54
>Steve: AGINPXY 8K .YING +36 130
>Elaine_Glowniak: EEOO 5K .OOEE +7 61
>Steve: AAIKLPX O1 ALIK. +42 172
#note I'm starting to like my chances, which have suddenly climbed to 92 percent.
>Elaine_Glowniak: EF 6M EF +28 89
#note Takes away the best X spot, but I didn't get the E I coveted, anyway.
>Steve: ADLPSTX N1 PAX +41 213
>Elaine_Glowniak: DEELNOR O8 .OLDENER +83 172
#note Aaruuuga, Aaruuuga. Comeback alert.
>Steve: DDELSTT -DDT +0 213
#note Thought about (I)DLED, but figured it was weak at this stage in the game. Duck deems DELT at 11c best.
>Elaine_Glowniak: ITZ 11D ZIT +26 198
#note Figured her to have held back an A here, with all that were left. Little I could do about it, though.
>Steve: EHLMSTW L11 THEW +32 245
#note My first thought was that I probably should have also thrown back the L last time. Top three plays are all close, with this being one. MEW and HEW at N12 are the others.
>Elaine_Glowniak: IT D11 .IT +24 222
>Steve: GLMPSUU 15H LUPUS +36 281
#note Not the vowels I was hoping for, exactly. My play rates a shade behind GULPS or PLUGS in the same spot.
>Elaine_Glowniak: OV 14L .OV. +20 242
#note Her reaction to my play tells me I may have blocked a bingo along row 14. She's definitely close, and continues to fish.
>Steve: AGIJMRR 14F GRAM +17 298
#note More defense. GRIM 14b scores 10 more and is a tad better. I may have played it, had I seen it, but still like the idea of making her come to me.
>Elaine_Glowniak: F 12D .F +10 252
#note She must be really, really close. No time to open a bingo line.
>Steve: ADEIJRR C12 RAJ +30 328
#note I liked this play over J(O), and it's best. It scores, rids the extra R, and sets up non-bingo scoring plays on row 15 that are better for me than her, if she has the one pointers I think she does.
>Elaine_Glowniak: DEG 13H GED +16 268
#note She underscored the play by two points, and I didn't catch it.
>Steve: DEIORTU 9M DU. +13 341
#note Didn't draw one of the many remainin A's I was hoping for, and she doesn't open a line for my bingo. It's now right to block row 15 by playing DUO or UDO at 15D. The mistake cost me about four percent in winning chances, from 96 to 92.
>Elaine_Glowniak: ABNR 15A BRAN +32 300
#note Not too much of a concern, as I can't fathom a bingo ending in B. But it does draw her closer and leaves less chance for error.
>Steve: AEIORRT M11 AER. +21 362
#note Delighted to balance the rack and score at this point, while keeping the board in lock down mode.
>Elaine_Glowniak: AY J6 YA +27 327
#note Scores, but once again give me nothing to worry about.
>Steve: AEIORTU 3L TA.. +22 384
#note Didn't like opening a bingo row, but felt it scored enuf, that if she hits I'm going to be able to outrun her. (D)A(P) J13 is best by a wide margin, but beyond my board vision.
>Elaine_Glowniak: S I9 ..S +12 339
#note I know two things - she's ever so close, and she has the case S. Flashing red neon lights are going off to shut down the bingo row I just opened.
>Steve: EINOORU L3 .O. +6 390
#note Another one of those counter-intuitive situations that make this game so compelling. Give yourself five stars if you emptied the bag and played OO(T) or OU(T). Both win over 99 percent. OE at 12G wins 88 percent, while my blocking play only wins at a 68 percent clip. Double wow.
>Elaine_Glowniak: EHILNST 13B H.. +6 345
#note Brilliant. I realize I'm screwed, but go two minutes over trying somehow to find a block.
>Steve: BEINORU H5 BRI. +10 400
#note I'm not upset about losing this game because I was unable to find OU(T) or OO(T). I am upset that I opened the board with TA(XI), however, and feel that's what ultimately cost me the game.
