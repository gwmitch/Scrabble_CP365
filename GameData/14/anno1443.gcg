#note A point and a half better than OE at J3.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ACDHLNU 8B LAUNCH.D +65 105
>Steve: EEPQRSX D7 Q.EERS +30 55
#note P(L)EX comes out 4 points better in the valuation, and 2 better in win percentage (21-19).

>Linda_Hoggatt: EGHIOT 5A HOGTIE +25 154
>Steve: ?CDINPT A1 PITC. +45 141
#note Was debating here between this and DITCH. This wins the sim comfortably. Never saw PINCH, Q's second choice.
>Linda_Hoggatt: IKNO J1 IKON +33 187
>Steve: ?DINSUV C3 VU. +14 155
>Linda_Hoggatt: EOOR 1G OOR.E +15 202
>Steve: ?AADINS 9F AI. +18 173
#note Don't feel too bad about the missed bingos here, other than I need to beef up my study. My play is best among the non-bingos, which is a little bit like asking Mrs. Lincoln how she enjoyed the play.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ?GIIORS K4 SIGnORI +71 273
>Steve: ?ADINSY L10 DAY +17 190
#note A couple more missed bingos here, but nothing that will hit my study regimen anytime soon. Best play is a nonbingo, anyway, (D)YAD at I9. I chose DAY over PITCHY mainly due to the board dynamics.
>Linda_Hoggatt: BDDEGU J10 BUDGED +31 304
>Steve: ?AEEINS 15H AN.ESItE +131 321
#note This took way too long to find, about five minutes, but I'm happy I stuck with it and didn't just give in to playing an 80 point bingo.
>Linda_Hoggatt: IMV 2F VIM +22 326
>Steve: LMNSTTW -LMTTW +0 321
#note Q prefers holding back just the S. I liked also holding on to the case N.
>Linda_Hoggatt: FOP 14F FOP +20 338
>Steve: AILNOSZ 6K .INZO +35 356
#note Had about six minutes left on my clock when this turn began, and I used almost all of it before making the wrong play. Saw the right play, just didn't think it thru well enuf, probably due to time pressure. Blame the extra time it took to find the triple triple, or blame that I was a letter off in my tracking and wasted two minutes trying to find the error. I never did. (I thought both W's had been played.) Best play wins 87 percent, a few others come in the mid 60s, my play at 62. Interestingly, GINZO comes up as Q's first choice before the sim. Guess you could say I play like the Duck when we're not given the time to think.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ERTW O4 WR.TE +36 374
>Steve: ALLMSTU M10 SLAM +26 382
#note SMALT(I) in the same spot is better, but not enough to win. 
>Linda_Hoggatt: AELTT 15B LATTE +11 385
#note I also went a minute over in time, making the final 399-372. Q made an adding mistake after her play of FOP. Don't understand how that happened, if you know, please fill me in.
