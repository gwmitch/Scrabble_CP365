#note I saw this word first, eyeing it at H1 or H8 before his bingo. Then I spent at least 3 minutes looking elsewhere, for 9s or overlaps, thinking there had to be something better. But there isn't!

#note Should have seen 4K PHONY for 48. I played this thinking I'd still get ZONES next turn.

#note Wanted to play EVZONE for fun, but this is best.

#note I'm playing scared again! I have to stop this. I should have taken L10 AFT or D10 FAVE.
>Ken_Dutch: ADHNOR D1 HADRON +33 232
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?ADEEFT C2 FEAT +31 333
#note I thought FED(EX) would open an easy overlap spot, and this is only 1 point less.

#note Now things get silly. I chickened out on the BOMBE hook, and I convinced myself COQUET is no good, thinking it was just COQUETTE. If I play either of those words, I get 78-80 points. Sheesh.
>Ken_Dutch: EGIILOU N8 .OIL +6 307
>Brendan_Sullivan: ??EEIOT N2 TI +15 425
#note Again avoiding the BOMBE hook, otherwise TOITED for 30 is best.

>Brendan_Sullivan: ??EEO O13 OsE +16 441
#note Too many possibilities to narrow down, and I had only 1 minute left now.

#note I get all the goodies this game, and I still could have won by like 60 more if I play COQUET.
