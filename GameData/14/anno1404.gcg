>Dallas: ?DEMNPV H7 D.MP +9 9
#note V(A)MP would've been much better.

>Dallas: ??EFHNV -FHV +0 9
#note Two blanks, and no bingos.  Sigh.
>Midge_Skwire: APSS -  +0 44
#note This was where the fiasco of my playing out of turn began.  Midge didn't record my exchange, and I scored my next play on her side of the ledger, so neither of us caught the mistake until it was too late.  I hate to profit from my mistakes.
>Dallas: ??AEENO 12D dOANEEs +72 81
#note I should've played AENEOus or ENOlAsE or any of the other valid bingoes.  I am so lucky she didn't challenge this crap off.
>Midge_Skwire: IL 10F LI. +7 51
>Dallas: EIOOPRU H12 .URO +12 93
#note I thought this was a good rack cleaning move, but Quackle put it beneath several other plays.
>Midge_Skwire: EI 14H .EI +5 56
>Dallas: EFIMOPT E11 F.P +16 109
#note FOMITE for 47 was clearly best

>Dallas: AEKNRTY 15J TANKER +35 196
#note I keep having near bingo racks, and making good, but not best, plays.  Still, at my level, this is pretty solid play, and I'm trying to run up some points as defense against a bingo, as Midge can strike at any time.
>Midge_Skwire: DENOT L8 NOTED +27 131
>Dallas: AHIIOXY 8L .IXY +42 238
#note The best play.  Not that it's hard to find.  This was pretty obvious.
>Midge_Skwire: FI N6 FI. +21 152
>Dallas: ABDHIOR 14N HO +22 260
#note From this point on, my sole objective was to keep a tight board tight, and not give Midge any openings to bingo.  I made sub-prime Quackle plays over and over, but I was staying up substantially, and giving no openings, so I'm satisfied with how I did here.  I'm always open to advice as to how I could've tightened this up better (although this did work out for me this time).
