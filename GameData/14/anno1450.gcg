>Jeff_Clark: DEFOO E5 FOO.ED +20 20
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAIJMNS F4 JAM +33 63
#note Didn't spot D1 JASMIN 53. I would still play JAM, though.
>Jeff_Clark: NOW G3 WON +25 45
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEINSY H3 EYEIN. +43 106
#note Almost kept the IN, too.

>Jeff_Clark: DHU F10 DUH +20 65
>Brendan_Sullivan: BEIORST 13C BO +14 133
#note Wow. Saw ORBIEST but not the opening.
>Jeff_Clark: ADEHR B11 HEARD +23 88
>Brendan_Sullivan: EFIIRST A8 FIRE +26 159
#note Many options here. Thought about going defensive with 15B DIF, or going even fishier with G12 IF. Seems like Quackle favors A7 SIFTER for 38, maybe because the S isn't so useful on this board.
>Jeff_Clark: ?EEILNO -?EEI +0 88
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIPSTTU 15A A.IT +18 177
#note Couldn't leave the 3x3 open any longer. I1 PUTS opens everything up too much for my comfort with this score situation.
>Jeff_Clark: EGM G11 MEG +17 105
>Brendan_Sullivan: DINPSTU H10 UP +11 188
#note Again, I1 PUDS or PUTS seems too risky. Had I seen A6 UN(FIRE)D, I'd play it in a heartbeat. As it was, this is the best thing I saw, and it blocked a big overlap play from H12 to the TWS.
>Jeff_Clark: BGOS I1 GOBS +35 140

>Jeff_Clark: AZ 14F ZA +38 178
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEIOORW 7G O.O +14 285
#note Just playing paranoid defense.
>Jeff_Clark: UX H14 XU +46 224
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEIRTW B2 WAsTRIE +77 362
#note Lucky draw.
>Jeff_Clark: ?AILQTV 3A Q.T +24 248
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIIILTV M1 .AV +12 374
#note Thought long about exchanging but didn't know what to keep. Maybe AIT or AILT? Then I thought I'd make it really hard for him to bingo. IIIL is awful, but I just liked what this did to the board.
