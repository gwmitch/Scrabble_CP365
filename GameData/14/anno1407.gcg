>Jeff_Clark: AQT H7 QAT +24 24
>Steve: AFGOOTW I8 WOOF +19 19
#note Took an extra minute debating the merits of FAGOT. It's better defensively and might play well to the WO leave. Q says my play is best, however, and by a surprising margin (five points).
>Jeff_Clark: ALOP J9 OPAL +30 54
#note Scores well off the tls.
>Steve: ABGIKLT K11 BALK +38 57
#note Here my decision was on whether to play BALK or BILK. With two A's and no I's on board BILK seemed right. But the G in my leave leads me to keep the I in hopes of drawing an N. Duck says BATIK in the same spot is best by two points over BILK and by three over my play.
>Jeff_Clark: IX L12 XI +40 94
#note Note that BILK on the previous play wouldn't have given up this easy 40 point layup.
>Steve: DGIRRTU 14F TUGRI. +15 72
#note Best.
>Jeff_Clark: EILRSSU F7 SURLIES. +60 154
#note He didn't even thank me.
>Steve: CDENRTU G3 CENTU +24 96
#note Hated to blow up a nice rack, but this is the best scoring play and it opens what is quickly becoming a difficult board. Q says CU(E)D, 12D, is best with a winning percentage at 13.9 percent. CENTU and DUN at M13 are in a dead heat with winning chances of about 13.1 percent.
>Jeff_Clark: AAEGINR 5F A.EARING +68 222
#note Jeff held my play, then found the bango. Again, no word of thanks.
>Steve: CDDGPRW 12D DR.W +16 112
#note Not looking good, down 126 points and without a vowel. Duck says my winning chances after this play are less than one percent. It likes an exchange, slightly, keeping CR or CD. I felt my play or GR(E)W to be preferrable since it scored a few points and blocked the big hot spot at H12. 
>Jeff_Clark: AJ M3 JA. +22 244
#note Seeing the J come out validates my last choice if Jeff has a G, U, or S in his leave.
>Steve: CDGMOPR 4C COMP.D +39 151
#note Delighted to get this many points.
>Jeff_Clark: DMO N2 DOM +25 269
>Steve: ?AEEGHR C2 RE.HAnGE +78 229
#note Was 90 percent on this being good. Saw RE(C)HARGE, but thought there was a small chance he'd challenge my play. Winning chances are now up to 12 percent.
>Jeff_Clark: EEY B5 EYE +33 302
>Steve: AEFIIOY 2A AE.IFY +40 269
#note I was really happy that I found the best play here, because I didn't immediately take the first thing I saw, which was the 43 easy points of FOY in the O column. Nonetheless, winning chances have now dipped below 10 percent.
>Jeff_Clark: DENSS 15K SENDS +32 334
#note This play telegraphed that Jeff didn't have the other blank, and was now trying to outrun me to the finish line. It also seemed likely that he kept two consonants.
>Steve: EINORVZ A1 V.IN +24 293
#note Took at least five minutes deliberating on what to play here. VIZORE(D) sims best with 21 percent winning chances. I saw the option and liked that it gave me six chances at drawing the blank if it were still in the bag. I liked keeping the Z, however, because it allowed for big plays like ZEROE(D) in addition to bingo possibilities like IRONIZE and IONIZER.  I didn't see Q's second choice of N(A)ZI, and rejected Z(A) due to its complete lack of turnover with the blank still unseen. Winning chances now at 17 percent.
>Jeff_Clark: ETV O1 VET +31 365
#note Consistent with the theme of trying to outrun me to the finish.
>Steve: BEIOORZ B9 BOOZIER +94 387
#note Wow. I choose the worst of four possible placements for the bingo. Every other play scores over 100 points. I jumped at the first thing I saw. Terrible. It's the difference between being a slight favorite, and an underdog (45 percent). But what's puzzling is how the duck could prefer the 1F placement above all. It scores 16 points less, but thru 18k iterations comes out ahead in win percentage.
>Jeff_Clark: ALNOTTU 1F ALTO +17 382
>Steve: ?EHIIN A13 HaE +27 414
#note I get lucky again to find the blank waiting for me in the bag. I didn't make an out play here because I wasn't completely, absolutely, positively certain of HINNIES or HEINIES. HI(N)NIE(D) is also good, and best.
>Jeff_Clark: NTU 2I NUT +7 389
>Jeff_Clark:  (IIN) +6 395
