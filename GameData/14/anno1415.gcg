>Jason: ?ABBLLO 8D BALLBOy +76 76
#note I saw BOxBALL, but I liked BALLBOy* better. Shows what I know. Hey, I didn't get a peep from Steve!
>Steve_Pellinen: AEEJ 9B AJEE +25 25
#note Given that the J didn't go at 7I, I wonder what his leave was. Scored as 24.
>Jason: GIIKOUZ B9 .ZO +32 108
#note For whatever reason, power-tile fives have been KILLING me lately. (A)ZUKI's about a billion points better.
>Steve_Pellinen: EEMOT 9H EMOTE +22 47
>Jason: AGIIKOU 10J KI +34 142
>Steve_Pellinen: EENN 11I NENE +21 68
#note Whoa, Steve, save some of those E's for me! :)
>Jason: AGIIOSU 8L AGIO +21 163
>Steve_Pellinen: ADENRRS N3 REDRA.NS +63 131
#note He put down DRAINERS, then REDRAINS, then DRAINERS, then REDRAINS...
>Steve_Pellinen: ADENRRS --  -63 68
#note ...so it was hard to challenge. I had him on hold a while, playing mind games. "REDRAINS* is a famous phony, right? When you do this rack, you always go DRAINERS, REDRAINS ... oh, shoot, SERRANID. It's just DRAINERS, SERRANID. Right? RIGHT?!?!" Nobody answered. In the end, TKR was mentioning the night before how she has to stop going: "Well, why would he phony, he had this and this and that, which were as good or better." I've got the same problem. In the end, I just had to trust myself and it worked.
>Jason: IOSTUVY N8 .VY +17 180
#note Blocking all his bingos, smart.
>Steve_Pellinen: ADENRRS 12E DARNERS +73 141
#note Letting him phony me here, not so much. I saw ?OKER and saw the blank as a T. No excuse for that. (This would be his last E, BTW.)
>Jason: HHIOSTU C11 HUH +23 203
>Steve_Pellinen: OY 7H OY +26 167
>Jason: AIOOSST 11B ..IA +20 223
#note OSTIA at A11's best, but that requires knowing IOTAS has an anagram.
>Steve_Pellinen: GINRRTU -GINRR +0 167
>Jason: MOORSST 7C MOT +16 239
>Steve_Pellinen: AUV 6A VAU +12 179
#note It was at this time Brockmeier, playing Linn next door, put down ALLEVI(AT)E. I think Bob's raving started as the play was going down. "You stinker! You stinker! How did you do that? That look like five seconds! How did you find that so fast? You stinker! I thought I had this board shut up! I can't believe this! It took like five seconds! How can somebody find a nine that fast? You stinker! He's trying to get back in the game! I can't believe this! You stinker!" Steve took a good 15 seconds (while thinking here) to look at the board, all three of us chuckling while Bob rants. Definitely the coolest play I saw all weekend. Bob bingoed a few turns later and won, which only proves there's no justice in this game.

>Jason: CEEEISS 15H ICES +30 352
#note Figured it made it harder to cash in at 14J. Steve said he saw INTERST(ICES) as a potential play given the unseen pool. But he doesn't get FPS like me.
>Steve_Pellinen: S 5C ....S +6 259
#note Forced to dump the case S to open the board...
>Jason: ?AEESTU 4G AUSTErE +66 418
#note ...and I thank him for it.
>Steve_Pellinen: ILT H1 LIT. +12 271
>Jason: EGLNPTU N7 T... +10 428
#note I have no defense for this play. I mean, I'm keeping the U so I don't get Q-stuck, I'm keeping the P for a 14J play ... but am I that worried about emptying the bag here? This is the best I can do with EGLNT? I have no idea what I was thinking. At least I have an excuse for not playing PUNGLE: I don't know it. 
>Steve_Pellinen: AQ J2 QA. +32 303
>Jason: EFGLNPU 14J FEN +29 457
#note Now missed FUGLE in addition to PUNGLE. I'll learn words eventually, I say.
>Steve_Pellinen: CINRRW K1 WIR.R +29 332
#note Not a good play; C-sticks himself.
>Jason: GLPU 2A ...UP +22 479
#note Didn't like it, but I had free plays to work with. He didn't even hold. (Power-tile fives ... I used to have them down. I blame the new words.)
>Steve_Pellinen: CN B9 ...N +15 347
#note Obviously should've blocked this.
>Jason: GL H6 L... +6 485
#note Could've got 7 for the L. Tough find, though.
>Steve_Pellinen: C -  +0 347
>Jason: G L7 G.. +4 489
#note Could've got 6 for the G. Not a tough find.
>Jason:  (C) +6 495
