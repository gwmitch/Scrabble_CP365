>Stefan_Rau: IISTZ H4 ZITIS +48 48
#note When it took Stefan so long to play this, I figured he had a garbage leave. Turns out he left the blank. Just took so long because he was worried about what ZITIS would give me (specifically the S to the triple and potential double-doubles) and considered ZIT or ZITI.

#note He held. (OK, so it was just to turn the board around and make sure I spelled it right. But I can make it sound like I was about to take my courtesy draw when he accepted!)

#note "Baby bingoes," Stefan said after the game. "They get the same 50-point bonus," I said. (Thankfully for me, usually.)

#note Was curious why he was playing off the case O and case A with six E's unseen...
>Jason: NRRSTUV D11 R.N +15 287
#note ...especially since I don't have one. Q thinks I'm on the right track, but should also play the T. Probably right.
>Stefan_Rau: EEGN B1 GENE +18 425
#note He played G(R)EEN at 5K, saw it gave up a big XU play, so played GENE, which he scored as 16. Guess what two tiles he drew after this play? :)

#note I knew I was probably p*ssing away spread here, but I figured I had bingoes in two spots with E and L draws and the pool was ugly enough there was no guarantee he had a bingo. I was happy Q agreed with the play.

#note Took my free challenge. (Hey, this was my only phony chart entry all day. Needed the exercise.)
