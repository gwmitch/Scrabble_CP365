#note OK, these are the types of boards I've wanted to play all week. As long as he doesn't have an S bingo, and he's just played off five...
>Nathan_Benedict: ?EEHINS N4 INHErES +88 126
#note ...well, so much for that.
>Jason: CDEJNRT O1 CRED +32 85
#note I can rationalize this one. For whatever reason, I had CRED as like high-30s and was disappointed when it came to 32. I almost picked it up to play DJ(I)N but then I had to factor in that he would know three of the four tiles in my leave, and I didn't think DJIN was that much better to warrant that. Plus, I thought I could draw more than one vowel in a four-tile pick. Ha!
>Nathan_Benedict: AEGIRT 12G TRIAGE +35 161
>Jason: EFJNRTT O7 FET +28 113
#note Q had the top five choices within less than one percentage point. Basically, Q agrees with your play here.

#note I know it's Memorial Day weekend, but VFW draws are not appreciated.
>Nathan_Benedict: OQTU 6J QUOT. +37 232
>Jason: AGINNRT H12 .ANG +15 128
#note My first play Q really hates. It wants to fish off the N (RATING does take almost everything), but then what? Even if I create a spot by playing the N at K5, fish and minimal-scoring bingo does bupkis for me. I mean, maybe (maybe!) I make a play like that against a 1300s player (hope to get back in range and maybe they'll make a mistake or two for me), but against the Benedicts of the world, I've got to keep scoring and open the board.

#note Why does this rack look familiar? I'm perfectly willing to concede that this was an emotional mistake borne out of frustration. L(I)NY at M3 is more than fine. This is why I've started not exchanging enough, it seems that most of my exchanges were unnecessary, so now I'm taking it to the other extreme and only exchanging when I have to.
>Nathan_Benedict: ELORRSW 15H .ROWLERS +89 374
#note If I'd had a white flag, I'd have waved it.
>Jason: EIINRST G7 I. +3 153
#note It's pretty sad when, with 24 in the bag, Q gives you 0.00% chance at winning no matter what you do.

>Jason: EIINRST D4 IN.ITERS +74 227
#note Why does this rack look familiar? After I hit my clock, Nathan said "Boy, you must've been ready to shoot yourself when you drew the I!" (Another reason I like playing experts.) I answered: "Especially after I drew the Y after fishing it off!" I said, pointing to YOM. Probably too whiny of me, but eh.
>Nathan_Benedict: DEHO 14J HOED +39 434
>Jason: ?EGJKLO C2 JOKE +38 265
#note Hey, thanks for showing up, blank! You're about nine turns too late. Plus, WTH were you when Cahnmann ??SSSS-ed me? And when Rau bombed me into next week? And when I could've used you in the Fiszbein game so that I could've breathed in the second half? No, seriously, thanks. Now I can use you for less than 20 in the endgame. Thanks a lot. I'll make a play just for you/this game in general.
>Nathan_Benedict: EPXY 10B PY.EX +39 473
>Jason: ?DGLPTU B10 .ULPiT +18 283
#note Knew it sucked, but couldn't find a better play that guaranteed a decent out.
>Nathan_Benedict: AEILSU A13 USE +20 493
#note SUI(T)E's 8 better; blocks my best out and stops me from 300. Perhaps Nathan took pity on me here. Or maybe he was bored by his complete lack of competition.
