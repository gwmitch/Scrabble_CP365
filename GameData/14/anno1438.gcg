>George_Viebranz: LMNNORW 8G MOWN +18 18
#note Best.
>Carolyn_Easter: GJ H7 J.G +11 11
>George_Viebranz: LNORTXY 9J ORYX +24 42
#note I did see the best play... right after I hit the clock.
>Carolyn_Easter: MO 8L MO +26 37
#note I was afraid she'd score MO points here.
>George_Viebranz: BEEILNT 10J BE +23 65
#note Best!
>Carolyn_Easter: DIV 11K VID +26 63
>George_Viebranz: DEIILNT N10 TEIND +24 89
#note I haven't really studied this, but I do remember learning DEINST as a stem, and TEINDS was the base.  I remembered it meant roughly the same thing as ALMS, so when she held me, I thought maybe it couldn't be singularized.  
>Carolyn_Easter: IIIIIII -  +0 63
>George_Viebranz: AEILOUW 14J WOUL. +17 106
#note Second to LAUWI(N)E 13I.  I thought it might be fun to fork it up.
>Carolyn_Easter: IIII -IIII +0 63
>George_Viebranz: AABEIOP O7 OBEA +20 126
#note UHHHHHHHHH
>Carolyn_Easter: ?RRSTTU 10B TURReTS +70 133
#note She chickened out on TRUSTeR.  
>George_Viebranz: AEIIPST D8 PA.ITIES +78 204
#note This took me way too long to find.
>Carolyn_Easter: EEGNR 15H GREEN +31 164
>George_Viebranz: ADEEHLN 15A DEA.H +27 231
#note ALE(P)H 8A is best.  I was drawn to the bottom corner.  I did feel like I was missing a great play, though.
>Carolyn_Easter: FHLS 14B FL.SH +55 219
#note Beautiful. 
>George_Viebranz: ELNNPTZ 13L PE.T +21 252
#note I didn't even think this would be on the list.  It's third behind P(U)L and P(U)LE C9.
>Carolyn_Easter: CO 7M CO. +23 242 
#note At least I know the blank is out there... somewhere...
>George_Viebranz: IILLNNZ -ILLN +0 252
#note So let me get it.
>Carolyn_Easter: AUY 8A YAU. +27 269
#note Getting nervous here..
>George_Viebranz: AIKNORZ B6 ZO. +32 284
#note I would happily offer the Z to the tile gods if it meant I would get the second blank.  Unfortunately, I am a tile god atheist.
>Carolyn_Easter: AGIV C3 VIGA +27 296
#note Starting to think she has that blank.  So I just need to make sure my leave is good, so if she bingos, I can bingo too.  Right?
>George_Viebranz: AEEIKNR 13G RAKE +20 304
#note What was I thinking? AKENE 13F is much prettier and better.  At least I feel like I'm playing in the right spot.  
>Carolyn_Easter: DTU 4A DU.T +14 310
#note Um, okay... guess she doesn't have the blank.
>George_Viebranz: CEFILNQ -FCQ +0 304
#note Somehow I still think this is justified.
>Carolyn_Easter: ?AEINRS 3A IN.AdERS +68 378
#note Really?  ARSINE blank?  That's how I'm going to lose this one?  Beautiful fit, I will admit.  
>George_Viebranz: EEIILNN 5C .EN +11 315
#note Meanwhile I'm in a bit of time trouble, so I kind of phone it in from here.
