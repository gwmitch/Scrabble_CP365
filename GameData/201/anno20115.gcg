#note I played too hastily here. WINNOW D8 opens the board. This keeps a mediocre leave and allows Joel to close. Against Joel down a bit I definitely want to open with WINNOW.

#note Thought about FIAT 4K, or FAIN to set up the T. FIAT blocked too much for my taste and FAIN did too -- the T setup isn't that great when you're keeping II to go with it.

#note Really wished I could make something like BAA or BARES A11 in this spot but the board is way too easy to control after those plays. I could just go for spread with BARES but felt I still had a fighting chance.

#note Joel is pretty likely to have the A here because of TAXI. It seemed like this play was best because it gave me an out in one all the time, and often a good out in one, while also blocking OGHAMIST. Compare to something like ETH C11 which scores a lot but doesn't block OGHAMIST or let me go out much, or HAND, which same deal really except it scores less. I can't find a better play than this, though it could exist. Also thought about THRONE but it seemed like the higher scoring outs would make this better, which is indeed true.
