#note 8F placement sacrifices two points, but is said to be best.

#note Lost challenge
>Steve: CEGIILX C3 XI +38 215
#note Best play is C9 EXILIC. I saw it, but decided to go with this, which comes up second. The highest scoring play is 3C C(U)LEX for 44, but that comes with a terrible GII leave and sets up big plays starting at 2F.
>Jeff_Clark: BEN B4 NEB +14 70
>Steve: ACEGILR A6 AGILER +25 240
#note No place to land GLACIER or GRACILE. Second non-go of the game. Tough to break up this rack, but now I'm just trying to run to the finish line with the big lead. Didn't realize I was playing a phoney. A6 ARGIL is best, mainly due to the CE leave. 
>Jeff_Clark: DESZ A1 ZEDS +50 120
#note Jeff's setup play pays off.
>Steve: CEEGINW 5D .EWING +20 260
#note Takes out the 2x2 line, burns tiles, good leave. About even with 5D NGWEE; the latter scores an additional point, and takes out many 8 possibilities thru the N and O files. The 2x2 line only stays open to bingos ending in G.
>Jeff_Clark: HO B9 OH +28 148
>Steve: CCEEKNS N7 N.CK +20 280
#note Just learned CODE takes a C on the back end. This is best, however.
>Jeff_Clark: QTU G3 QU.T +23 171
>Steve: ?CEEOSV 11H COuVEES +83 363
>Steve: ?CEEOSV --  -83 280
#note One available bingo here, which I didn't know, unfortunately. Thought this was good when I played it; Jeff was smart enough to challenge it off.
>Jeff_Clark: JO I3 JO. +19 190
>Steve: ?CEEOSV J2 VOE +25 305
#note Still don't know CORVEES a turn later; burning off the S here adds 12 points and might draw a challenge. SEWINGS is good.

#note Figure I'd take out the easy bingo lanes. 13B FROGME(N) scores 28 and wins a 2-ply sim.
