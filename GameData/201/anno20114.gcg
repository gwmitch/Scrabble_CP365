#note INU is bad and I gave serious consideration to CURIO, setting up a decent J spot. Problem was that it seemed like J plays on column 11, if I got them, would give a lot back to Conrad, and that seemed like by far the best J spot on the board post-CURIO. There are also a bunch of other plays using the J, which are hard to decide between. Hm.

#note Thought about a V stick, but I must have misadded, as I thought of O(DE) - oA(K) but thought this was better. O(DE) is best, and I also missed ARcO 2J.
