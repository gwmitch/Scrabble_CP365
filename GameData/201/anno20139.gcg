>Jason_Idalski: ADIQS 8D QAIDS +50 50
>Steve: ACINNSY 9C YIN +23 23
#note Saw the 7, but alas no home.
>Jason_Idalski: ENTV B6 VENT +22 72
>Steve: ACMNRSU A7 MU +22 45
#note E5 ARC(AN)UM scores 44, and it even takes an -S hook. Didn't know either. Too arcane I suppose. <rimshot>
>Jason_Idalski: ACELR 7E CLEAR +22 94
>Steve: ACNRSST E4 CAN...S +22 67
#note Extension is the right idea, but this isn't right. D8 (QI)NTARS for 32.

>Jason_Idalski: NORU C9 .OURN +16 110
>Steve: ?GPRRST 11A TR.G +5 72
>Jason_Idalski: AEEEGTU -AEEEG +0 110
>Steve: ?INPRSZ 4B ZIN. +30 102
#note Briefly thought about burning the blank to play (T)ZaRS. Lucky I didn't, since Jason told me he had REA(C)TIVE ready to go down for 84 in this spot.
>Jason_Idalski: AEEIRTV A11 .RAVE +27 137
>Steve: ?ABKPRS 6H KAB +24 126
#note Beautiful 8 here of So(A)PBARK, but maybe it's a bit too dangerous. Still, it edges out KAB just slightly according to C player.
>Jason_Idalski: EHO F10 HOE +27 164
>Steve: ?DEIPRS K5 aSPIRED +96 222
>Jason_Idalski: EJ 10J J.E +26 190
>Steve: ADIILOU M10 DULIA +24 246
#note A bit more defensive than AUDIO in the same spot. AUDIO has a better leave, tho, and it doesn't leave me hanging on whether it takes an -S.
>Jason_Idalski: BDENR 8J B.NDER +30 220
>Steve: GILLOOS 5G LOO +14 260
#note Obvious play is IGLOOS, only I was terrified of having DULIAS get challenged off.
>Jason_Idalski: FI B2 FI. +30 250
>Steve: AGILMOS 3A L.MO +22 282
#note Wow. Totally whiffed on the 7, altho I probably would have passed on DULIAS again. Saw the 8, but wasn't sure enough of it for some reason. Major blunder.
>Jason_Idalski: EGOTU 14J OUT.GE +18 268
>Steve: AFGIOSW 15G WAIF +35 317
>Jason_Idalski: ATX 2D TAX +29 297
>Steve: AGIOOPS A1 PO. +20 337
#note C player says GOA at 14F, which was never on my radar. (P)OOP was its second choice, which blocks many of the bingo lines. A sim, however, likes 14E AGO. My play is URP!
>Jason_Idalski: EWY O13 Y.W +27 324
#note Possibility of EYEWaTE(R) for 101 exists. Now that would have made me cry.
>Steve: AEGIOST O3 GAITE. +8 345
#note All winning plays have to block the R. 
>Jason_Idalski: ?EEEHIT M1 TImEHEE. +74 398
>Jason_Idalski: ?EEEHIT --  -74 324
#note No winning plays available.
>Steve: OS 12C .OS. +14 359
#note I would have tried DULIAS this time if needed. Jason lost 30 points on time looking for a bingo. 377-294 final.
>Steve:  (EEEHIT?) +18 377
