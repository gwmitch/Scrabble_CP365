Maybe I should play FOE at I3. I didn't see that, but it looks pretty good. I also considered F8 OAK or OAF, but I didn't want to make esses and blanks very important early on. At least leaving 9F open ensures that I don't need to draw well to win the game. FOE also has the issue of making the S essential. I preferred the flexibility FAGO(T) gave me, giving me multiple ways to win the game.

>Karl_Higby: ?ACIRTY --  -74 50
#note took him 8 minutes to find this phony. He had 4 awesome 9s available. He also had 4 7s that are findable. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIINS B3 .I +6 109
#note he was already at like 12 minutes here, so I decided to play fast, since it looked like he had stuff that I couldn't block. I wanted to block the easy ic(k)y play he had. Something that is quiet likely after having spent 8 minutes to play a phony. 
>Karl_Higby: ?ACIRTY A4 AY +9 59
#note He still has all of his options. I noticed I gave him a better spot for sATYRIC but I doubted he would see it. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEINOS 8F O..A +5 114
#note I missed, I think this is the right play though, since I block a lot of sevens.
>Karl_Higby: ?CIRT 5H .R +2 61
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIINST 10A TINEIDS +79 193
#note So the question is, should I bingo here? Should I have let TYRAnIC go and played S(C)IAENID? Is putting the I in the 3x3 better than the T? Turns out either way is disastrous.

He has 30 words available through the T and 32 through the I if his leave includes CITE?, which is very very likely. without the E he has even more, but it doesn't look very likely he will 3x3. Maybe something like 1/4.
>Karl_Higby: ?CEINRT A8 IN.ERaCT +140 201
#note Turns out he would have had CRINITEs if I put the I there instead. Re(T)ICENT is 158.
