#note I was in a really shitty mood here. I completely missed 7H FEZ, which looks fine. I was just so unhappy to make a play that scored nothing.

#note I didn't think UN(F)ANCY was a word, and given the volatility of the play I preferred not to think about it. I considered CUNNE(R)Y* but also chickened out. CANNE(R)Y was somewhere in the back of my mind too but I didn't want to think about it either. (F)UNNY was the other consideration. I just decided to take points, give back little and hope big. UN(F)ANCY is probably the play. I was tired of losing challenges.
