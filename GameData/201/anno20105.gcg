#note Thought about VITAE but that opens up a nice scoring spot and no good lanes, and just generally develops the board worse than this. Didn't play LIVEN because I wanted to open the E.

#note This does block off lanes, but I can't do much else here if I want to score, and scoring is very important at this kind of deficit. I can open the bottom of the board as I like later -- it's hard for him to preempt openings down there and hard for him to block them once they're open.

#note I liked this better than WAB because I could play ANT on row 10 next turn, but TWOFER does the same thing while scoring more and not keeping so many pesky consonants.

>Noah: ANRRTTT 11D T.RANT +9 179
#note Time to open! Something like TOFT is okay but keeps a poor leave and there's no real reason not to open now. Chose this over DART because NRTT is usually going to flop on this board and he could get time to close stuff down while I'm wading through that.

#note I thought of PREGNANtS* but dismissed it as no good...however, it has merit because if I play KILOS draw an E he can't challenge unless he's near certain it's phony, as VELD beats him. However, there are a lot of situations where he doesn't lose even if he unsuccessfully challenges after KILOS, so I'm not actually sure a play there is better for spread.
