#note The rest of the game is quite interesting! This play may seem strange but I liked it. I wanted to make this game a tactical, closed one about getting small edges and keeping things tight because I think this is good for me against Dan. Dan plays quickly and makes a lot of aggressive openings that I can capitalize on. I didn't want to make one of the many plays making ABOMINATED because they all opened something up for Dan. Besides those and OKE, the other strong play looked like DODO 6I. However, I thought this was better because it scored more and because DDOR actually looked quite good for scoring in this position.

#note HOOKED is sweet, and I didn't see it, but this has to be right.

#note Hm. I thought of this and MIB here, but not of BAWD, which is a worthy option. It definitely looks better than MIB. I think I still like this play over BAWD. Though it doesn't but me up that much, I think I have a pretty good advantage on this board. As long as he doesn't bingo, it seems like I am winning the game a lot of the time. This stops more bingos than BAWD does. However, BAWD does stop scoring plays that are going to help him win sometimes. Of course, if he doesn't use that scoring spot, it also helps me. Hm. I'm not quite sure here.

#note Here's an interesting play here. I want to block rows 10 and 11, where Dan can get moderate, important scores, while not opening another play for him (so no MONIED). MINED, LIMEN, MIG, MINI, and DOGIE all seem like options. The O seems pretty strong here, because few J plays are available, and J(EF)E is one of the better ones. The E doesn't seem especially good here. Tossing it should be fine. So MINED over MINI and MIG because of the extra points. LIMEN vs. MINED? I think MINED. The D is good for ROOKED but I can already score decently on the board with QI and ROOKED uses the O which seems like it will be useful. So MINED makes sense. Unfortunately this isn't how I thought about the position at all in the game. Have to practice more pre-endgames, I suppose.

>Noah: ?DEIOSU N9 US +15 335
#note I wanted to score while keeping the O and leaving two in the bag to counteract J(EF)E. QI seems like an altogether better play here though. Maybe DI(S) over QI because that is timed better vs. RAJ/JEFE, but still, why did I make this play? Again, not really thinking straight. Hmm.

#note Not nearly enough time to figure this one out. E(R) appears best, winning 75%. If I want to really play these pre-endgame/endgame situations well I have to practice, practice, practice.

#note Some nonsense in the last few turns. I have to figure out how to fix this.
