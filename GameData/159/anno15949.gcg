#note The State of Tasha vs. Quackle Episode 10 - Game 48/50, Set 2.  I played 300 games against Quackle and this one is my personal favorite.

#note Mom walks in on this play and decides to watch the ENTIRE game.   Moms is the most annoying person in the world to watch a movie with because she always asks questions and makes irritating commentary about what's going down on the big screen.  And she always gets details horribly wrong.   Like this one time we were watching The Princess Bride and she somehow thought Prince Humperdink (sp?) was the four fingered man.   I mean, isn't she PAYING ATTENTION?  Her watching me play was a similar experience.

#note Awhile ago I would have exchanged DGKR without a second thought.  The idea here is not to exchange but to play off DGR and KEEP the K.  CK goes good together.

#note (Mom:  "You have COASTER!")  I saw all the bingoes at 3E, but didn't think it was right to play them.  However, I didn't see 14E OCREATE  (I mean, I saw the word, but only at 3E) and I would have played it because it's 75 points.  The other stuff was too low scoring and Quackle isn't THAT far ahead.  (Mom:  "That was stupid.  You should have played COASTER!")

>Tasha: AEEGIQU K9 AGE +19 412
#note I spent nearly four minutes on this rack.  The very first thing I considered was AGUE, but that can't be right because it gives up the U when I have a Q.  Then I considered A5 QI but that can't be right because I have a Q with a U.  I almost went with G12 QUAI but that didn't feel right either. (Mom:  "You taking too long.")   I then just closed my eyes and wondered aloud "What would NIGEL do with this rack?"  (Mom:  "Girl, who's Nigel?") Six seconds later, I play AGE and click the commit button with no hesitation.     It takes me four minutes to see what an expert would have saw in 30 seconds.

#note This is why AGE simmed best.  Sets up a big Q play with the right draw.

>Tasha: EEEOST 4I TOES +18 522
#note Nigel would have played N9 OSE.   I missed OSE, and I did look there but all the plays I saw on the N column LOSE.  OSE wins by a point.  Then again, I thought TOES wins by two...
>Quackle: AFMO N7 FOAM +29 518
#note I thought I was going to win by 2 after FOAM - 522-520.  Math has never been my strong point, but I made sure my calculations were correct.  And I was looking at the right FOAM.  I eventually noticed 2*(EE).  For some reason, I thought I had five tiles instead of six and only counted one E!!  I seriously need to start paying more attention, especially during endgame!
>Quackle:  (EE) +4 522
#note Out of 300 games, this is the first of two ties.  The other one was a bit different because I was on the losing end.
