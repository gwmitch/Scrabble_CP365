>Jason_Broersma: DMOO G9 MOOD +27 27
#note Seems like most times when I open with the Y next to a DLS thinking it's safe my opponent has an M or a B... :P
>Joshua_Sokol: BIOOSTU F12 OUT +9 27
#note No good options means time to be aggressive.

>Joshua_Sokol: AIIMRSZ L12 IZA. +26 143
#note I knew there were a lot of A's left but I didn't like anything else.
>Jason_Broersma: ?DELSTU B8 .UTLEaDS +70 191
#note C1 SEDULiT(Y).
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMNRSV I13 V.. +10 153
#note I considered kK10 VIM but I thought it gave him 3 extra points most times. 14I (AX)M(A)N is cool.

>Joshua_Sokol: AACENRS 6D CARNA.ES +65 246
>Jason_Broersma: GHU K10 UGH +19 254
#note This seemed weird given that he had HUG 5J for more. I thought he maybe had the Q and some more consonants.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADGIINW 5J WADING +31 277
#note I considered WADI, same spot, but it really seemed useless to keep ING. Sim agrees.
>Jason_Broersma: AIINOSV N4 I.VASION +71 325
#note This was unfortunate.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHIQT O7 EH +32 309
#note Here's where things start to get difficult. I know that there are many Q spots now but that there are bound to be less and less as turns go by. I think this cuts Jason's score by too much to consider dropping the Q at this points. The sim doesn't agree at all. I actually like 8K THE(S)E now that I see it. Quackle prefers 10J Q(U)A.
>Jason_Broersma: EF 15N FE +31 356
#note Probably because this is still available after EH.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIJPQT 4I JAPE +43 352
#note Another really difficult move. The bag was getting slim and I knew Jason could pre-block my only Q spot next turn if he felt it was needed, but that this was still my best shot. I also considered L1 JAPE(D) which gave me another Q spot but I felt Jason would hit the J on the triple more often than not. My play is way ahead on the sim, but that's because Quackle doesn't think that I will get Q stuck.
>Jason_Broersma: A 9M A. +3 359
#note I was surprised he did this, but he was probably paranoid, and rightly so. I had to make believe I didn't have the Q after this play by playing one tile as well.
>Joshua_Sokol: ILQRTTW 7M W.. +10 362
#note This is where I can't listen to Quackle, cause I need to act like I don't have the Q either. I know Jason has the other A, or else he wouldn't play A(I) for 3 points. I feel doomed but maybe Jason will make a mistake.
>Jason_Broersma: EE A13 .EE +24 383
#note He didn't bite the bullet...
>Joshua_Sokol: CILQRTT 10J C.T +11 373
#note I didn't know precisely what he had. This is bad, I guess.
>Jason_Broersma: AEFNPR 5E FA +22 405
#note This, on the other hand, was even worse. FE is the play, same spot.
>Joshua_Sokol: ILQRT F4 T.. +3 376
>Jason_Broersma: ENPR O10 PEN +12 417
#note PRE(INVASION) and RE(INVASION) were available, and may have saved Jason a lot of spread if he had attempted one of them, since I probably would have challenged.
>Joshua_Sokol: ILQR G3 QI +23 399
>Jason_Broersma: R L3 R.. +4 421
#note Oops, I could have stuck him with the R. I had mistracked and didn't even consider it. Good thing I wouldn't have won anyway. 
>Jason_Broersma:  (LR) +4 425
#note My mistake made up for his.
