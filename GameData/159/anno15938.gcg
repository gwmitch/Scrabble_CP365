#note Somehow didn't think of HOMEY, which is also a good choice. HOMEY wins in a sim.

>Noah: AEEIMNT 7G ETAMINE +70 98
#note Seemed better than MATINEE because of the scoring spot MATINEE opened...but MATINEE sims evenly with this because this allows a lot more bingos! Not something I thought of here, but it makes sense.

#note Exchange was a thought, but setting up a likely Z play for next turn seemed strong.
>Geoff_Tongue: AY 4J AY +12 274
>Noah: DEESSTZ 14J ZEDS +40 293
#note Interesting! So I thought about ZEES D1, ZESTE(R) 12H, ZEDS 14J and DITZ 4B. Another worthy option is ZED D2. I didn't play DITZ because it scored the same as ZEDS but didn't block the bottom, and blocking the bottom looked good here. Similarly, I didn't play ZESTER, which didn't block the bottom and also offered Geoff plenty of plays using the Z. ZEES would work out OK if he bingoed, often allowing me DITZ, but it seemed like there were also a lot of bad scenarios. Even if I do get DITZ, a scoring play by Geoff through his bingo seems likely, given the pool. All this considered, this seems to put me in decent shape. I think I also like it more than ZED because it blocks bingos.
>Geoff_Tongue: AAIR 15G ARIA +23 297
>Noah: EEIQSTW 4B Q.S +24 317
#note I wanted to play quickly here, because he was pretty low on time. I also thought about playing WEET and QI, but QI didn't look worth it at all and WEET keeping only 24 for next turn didn't look good to me. EEITW is actually quite strong here, it seems.
>Geoff_Tongue: ?EEJR 12H JEERe. +40 337
#note I was pretty sure this was good, but not positive, and I held for awhile, making sure I could win.
>Noah: EEIOTTW 13G WOT +23 340
#note The second winningest play. What's the best one?

#note This game had more board vision mistakes.
