#note I was scared of the bingo, but I shouldn't have been. This was bad.

#note BIcOLOR, BROcOLI, OBLIgOR and (S)ORBItOL missed... I wanted to keep the OVUM spot open.
>Heather_McCall: AMR J2 AM..R +13 167
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACOORZ 3L ZA +38 103
#note I still liked the OVUM spot for bingos, so I chose ZA over ZOO.

>Joshua_Sokol: DFGIIRU M6 FIG +24 332
#note I considered TURGID but I wasn't too sure. I was also paranoid at the JO spot. H10 TRIFID, FUG/FIG at N1 all look decent here.
>Heather_McCall: EF C12 EF +20 397
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGINRU N1 DUG +23 355
#note E(N)DURING blocked. I didn't know what to do here other than score and keep a decent leave. I guess I have to go with (T)URGID.
>Heather_McCall: EHI 1L HI.E +36 433
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEINOR M10 .AI +6 361
#note I didn't see ANEROID. lol. But of course playing it is an instant loss. I played this with hopes that I drew the L and another tile to bingo and she couldn't score enough. It isn't right. I'm supposed to play H10 (T)O apparently. If I draw the X I'm in good shape I guess.
>Heather_McCall: AILOPTX 13J AXIL +30 463
#note She chickened out of OXTAIL. I saw (T)AXI blocking me completely. She also had OXLIP.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEINOR 14D ANEROID +76 437
#note Saw it this turn for some reason.
