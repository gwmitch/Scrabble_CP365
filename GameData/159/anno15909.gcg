#note Awesome that my choices are symmetrical! I thought about this for a minute or two, realized this had to be quite close, and then just impulsively slapped this down because I still had no idea which was better. Thought maybe he could miss the ACRED hook was my only (vague) reason. The other placement sims better, FWIW.

#note Chris: This board's pretty closed, so I think I'll take out this hotspot and hope to cash in the power tiles later.

#note Chris: Apparently 3H GOX is better, but this seemed more defensive.
>Noah: ADEEITV 2H DEVIATE +105 286
#note Chris: Apparently not! Nice fit.

#note Chris: Once I convinced myself that there were no triple triples, I looked no further than this play, because I thought it took an A. I figured my only chance to win was to try this in hopes that by some miracle Noah would miss or not know the hook. As a matter of fact, this is the only bingo, and it wins about 11% according to the sim. 13K GAUNT does best (about 15%), but my chances are pretty grim even without playing a phony net turn.
>Noah: ABINOOO D1 BOO +22 446
#note I had a fair amount of time left but figuring out 8 endgames while leaving time to MAKE SURE I don't misplay the endgame is not something I'm practiced at. Need to practice it more if I want to do it better! This ties when he has AABLPUY provided he comes up with PULA A7, and wins everythign else. OBIA A7 wins everything. BOO A8 ties two games. 
>Chris_Grubb: ABILPUY O12 LIPA +48 452
>Chris_Grubb: ABILPUY --  -48 404
#note Chris: Hooray, he didn't block!
Oh noes! 
>Noah: AAINO M12 ANO. +18 464
#note Chris: For a moment there, I thought I had come up with a brilliant way to steal a victory, but I was foiled again. The best valid sequence is LIPA at A7 followed by BUY which loses by four. Nice job Noah in finding the best out-in-two. One last chance for a win next round.
>Chris_Grubb: ABILPUY O3 .IBULA +36 440
#note UPBY is best.
>Noah: AI 10F AI. +16 480
#note Chris: Pretty good effort against a player I still haven't beaten in 9 tries!
