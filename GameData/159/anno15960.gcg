>Joshua_Sokol: AKNQSYZ H8 YANK +22 22
#note This was an aggressive play. I like playing aggressive against Bernard. It doesn't seem worth it, though.
>Bernard: ADFO I7 FADO +26 26
>Joshua_Sokol: EIQSUYZ 12D QUEYS +49 71
#note I drew such crap! Which is great for what I left!
>Bernard: AHM J10 HAM +30 56
>Joshua_Sokol: CIITUUZ K11 TUI +14 85
#note QUIZ is too dangerous. Maybe I should play ZIT 13C.
>Bernard: AIIN J4 INIA +11 67
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEISUZ F10 ZE. +32 117
#note My dreams are crushed! I've always wanted to play CAZIQUE or BEZIQUE!!! And I missed likely my only opportunity to do it!! :(
>Bernard: EEEINRT G2 TEENIER +65 132
#note INTER(N)EE and RETINE(N)E missed.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIOSUV 2C CAVI.OUS +67 184
#note I thought it was good
>Bernard: HOO F4 OOH +31 163
>Joshua_Sokol: CDLPTWW D1 W.WL +28 212
>Bernard: AGINS 13B GAINS +38 201
>Joshua_Sokol: CDDIPRT H1 P.D +21 233
#note If I draw an E I have C(ON)TE(N)D, which is why I really liked this play.
>Bernard: EELT L9 LEET +21 222
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CDINRT 7I ..RD +8 241
#note I saw what LEET dangerously opened. I wanted to stop worrying about it.
>Bernard: ELPX 4I P.XEL +28 250
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACINOT B7 COATIN.s +74 315
#note I saw both (C)OACTIoN and (C)OACTINg and didn't think they were good.
>Bernard: FIIMNR 1J INFIRM +47 297
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEOOR C1 O.A +25 340
#note K3 O(X)O is looking better.
>Bernard: TU 5J .UT +26 323
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEEORR 8A B.RE +21 361
#note I felt the need to keep a consonant here, but also block the biggest hotspot on the board.
>Bernard: BL 1A BL.. +27 350
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEEORV N1 .EV +12 373
#note This isn't doing well on the sim since a perfect played could probably outscore me if I play this. Bernard isn't a perfect player, but that is a good reason not to play this. I saw (M)ORTGAGE and PIXELS/STORAGE in the pool, so I wanted to block both.
>Bernard: EGJORST B3 JOG +24 374
#note Bernard had one winning sequence. E6 GOR and then either 5A JETS or H14 JETS if I block. This wins by 1 at least.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADEGOR E5 EGAD +33 406
#note Correct.
>Bernard: ERST 3L RE.S +21 395
#note I guess I could have no outplay or make a mistake, which is why plays like this aren't terrible.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?OR M12 tOR +9 415
#note 10B (T)RoO(Z)! Also M9 ORs which I missed...
>Joshua_Sokol:  (T) +2 417
