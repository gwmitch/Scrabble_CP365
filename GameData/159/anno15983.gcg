#note I have never beaten mishu in the 5 games we have played. I wasn't very happy with this rack, obviously.
>mishu7: ?INOPRW I3 PINWORm +78 78
#note Didn't know this one, but mishu doesn't usually phony and has a very extensive vocabulary.
>axcertypo: AAAIIMU -AAAIU +0 20
#note I actually exchanged AAAIIU here. Maybe keeping MA was better?. I hated U(N)AI.

#note True that this isn't a very offensive play, but what else could I do? VERMI(N) I guess, or FIREME(N)? I'm setting up FE this way.

#note 3 ply sim is liking UREMIA 14I, which I missed. Also I(XI)A, 5K MIRI for some reason, 14F I(F), J1 URI(C) and exchanging iiu or iu better than my play. I thought I would need to open and bingo next turn to have a chance, which is why I played LIEU. I overestimated the value of my leave.
>mishu7: ILNRTTY 11E T..LY +16 221
#note K2 TR(U)LY is very likely better.

#note 12C ATA(XI)A, missed it.
>mishu7: ?GINRTW F1 WRIT.NGs +65 286
>axcertypo: AGHHOQS O12 HASH +51 174
#note Wow. HOG(W)ASH. That's obviously the play here. What a cool miss. I didn't like my chances after K3 S(U)Q as much as with HASH, since I felt the need to keep the board as open as possible.

#note Hopefully drawing an A next turn for GAZOO(s). 
>mishu7: ADEINTV 8A NAIVE. +36 346
>axcertypo: AGOORSZ C4 GRAZ.OSO +79 290
#note At first I was pretty unhappy that GAZOO(s) was blocked, until I saw this!

>axcertypo: ACDEERT A5 CRE.ATED +74 364
#note I wasn't sure of this, but I had to play it. Luckily it's good. I actually have a chance of winning!
>mishu7: ADEISTT 12D TA.. +24 398
#note 6L (E)T looks like a surer win, but I guess in the off chance he draws K or B he felt the need to score.
>axcertypo: BEEKNOO D1 KENO +32 396
#note I knew my chances were really really slim here. I was going to play D1 KOBO until I saw OBE J6 and KENO D1. I figured that KENO was a better idea so that I might threaten going out next turn if he doesn't bingo or just be able to outscore. The sim is liking 13I BO, J6 OBE or E3 K(I) (for BOTONEE). Of course, a competent enough player would never lose after K(I) as he/she would see BOTONEE if it were possible and arrange for it to be unplayable, even if he/she could bingo, and mishu is a competent enough player. I think I need to hope for the S at any cost anyway.
