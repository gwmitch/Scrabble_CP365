>Joel_Wapnick: AP 8G PA +8 8
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIJTVX H5 JAV. +14 14
#note I inferred a pretty good rack here, pretty surely an S. Therefore I wasn't quite sure what to do. This is probably really bad. I just wanted to be able to come back after a bingo and block most things if he had a blank and not an S or something.
>Joel_Wapnick: AENRSST 6B SANTER.S +62 70
#note A(PA)RTNESS is cool. Not sure why Joel didn't just take the 12 extra for SARSNET/JAVAS. I don't think it's correct to fear an S here. Maybe he thought it was British. The sim isn't favoring SARSNET by that much, interestingly enough. I don't think I score much more with this placement, but maybe I score a good 10 points more. Who knows...
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEILTX E3 TeX.ILED +80 94
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEILTX --  -80 14
#note This is the second time I've played this phony. Hopefully that means I won't play it again. Joel snap challenged of course, which really had an intimidating effect on me :P. I think JILTED is really unproblematic here.
>Joel_Wapnick: ADMUY D3 MAU.DY +32 102
#note Not sure what he has here but I think knowing what I have, 5C YAUD is always better.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEILTX 8A DEX. +45 59
>Joel_Wapnick: IQ E2 QI +15 117
#note I guess he chose this for it's better defense than the 9F placement. I think that's worth the two point difference. Joel was visibly frustrated to have drawn the Q after playing a U.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BILOST 5H .OB +14 73
#note First big misses of the game. I saw STROBIL but I thought it was only STROBILE. I didn't know BRISTOL, and if I saw it I would think I'm confusing it with BRISTLE and the city in the U.K. Also, I did look for disconnected 9s thru S_E such as SIEST words, but for some reason missed BLOUSIEST/BLOWSIEST. I also missed a really weak (P)OTBoILS, which I shouldn't have missed but also shouldn't have played had I seen it. At least I made a good setup that is likely to work unless Joel sacrifices a lot to block.
>Joel_Wapnick: EILW F1 WILE +27 144
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HILNST 1F .HIN +30 103
#note Huge failure number 2. I'm 3/3 now. I looked for 9s through MI, SE and PA before he played this, as I didn't know (E)THINyLS. When he played WILE, I just gave up looking through MI. If I had kept looking through MIL, I would have easily found the 10, and I would have found it, even though my play sims better. 
>Joel_Wapnick: ?GINORR I8 ROaRING +64 208
#note Big miss here for Joel. 8G (PA)RROtING would have probably decimated my chances at coming back with a 2x2. B8 (E)RIGeRON is dangerous, but if I don't hit the 3x3 and hit the 2x2 he will usually score far more. But (PA)RROtING seems clearly best.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AELSTY K5 StYLATE +112 215
#note I didn't want to get challenged, but I also was pretty sure this was valid. I also saw STAtELY but I was a bit more unsure. Had I seen STALElY I would have played it, as I was looking for sure STA?E or STEA? adjectives to add LY to. So just like that I'm back in it.
>Joel_Wapnick: DEIKNNO 11B DONNIKE. +76 284
#note Damn...
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGIORV 8K .AEVO +27 242
#note I thought this was a good play, as it opens up more lanes that can't be blocked by an overlap and that will almost never be blocked with a play through the V. Even if they were blocked I would still have what I was going for, the I(N)G. Also, there's the lane on row 2. I think this was a better play than Quackle thinks, though it's ahead of VI(N)EGAR by a tiny amount. I don't like VINEGAR at all. It tastes bad and I would need to get really lucky to pull off the comeback.
>Joel_Wapnick: II -II +0 284
#note Exchanging 2. I'm scared, he must have another good rack.
>Joshua_Sokol: BGILNRU 14B BURGLIN. +78 320
#note At least I hit this. Joel held for some reason. I had to hope he didn't hit what he was fishing for.
>Joel_Wapnick: AEEIRST 15I SERIATE +82 366
#note I had no business challenging him. I didn't see his other spot for SERIATE/AERIEST, nor did I see EATERIES. I thought this was his only spot and that he was confusing all of the INGS Collins words... Had I not challenged, I would have had a chance to win still. I guess I was blinded by really wanting ROARINGS to be Collins only.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIOPTT -  +0 320
>Joel_Wapnick: EGMOT M3 GEMOT. +20 386
#note Nice blocking play.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIOPTT N6 PI.OT +30 350
#note OK, I went through 4000 iterations of this play and it's simming 5th, behind N4 TOP, 15A TOPE, COPE, COTE and 12A COPE, which are all almost a % point higher than PI(V)OT. I played PIVOT in the hopes of outscoring rather than bingoing, as I thought my chances to do the latter were minuscule. But so are my chances to outscore, so that logic is a bit flawed. I thought Joel would usually score too much on column N with the F or the W and block the lane anyway, but this way he can block everything, so my only hope seems to be to draw big with the Z to outscore.
>Joel_Wapnick: ADEFL 12C DEAF +30 416
#note I think this is better than L1 DEAF. He laid down FEAL at the same spot but IL was in the way.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEIRTW 15A WITE +33 383
#note I don't see how fishing can win here, as he'll just block the only available lane. I felt like I had to hope for the Z and a miracle play to win. Also, Joel was getting low on time so I had that on him. This seems to win around 3% of the time, even though it empties the bag. It's the best scoring play on the sim that I saw, besides L2 CAW. Maybe CAW is better, but I think Quackle is intending for me to bingo, which again, isn't going to happen, as I also checked for disconnecteds on lane B, which there are none available.
>Joel_Wapnick: CFHLOUU O10 OUCH +14 430
#note His best plays block CZAR. He was low on time.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEORZ L1 CZAR +43 426
>Joel_Wapnick: FLU L11 FLU +17 447
>Joel_Wapnick:  (EO) +4 451
#note TEXTILED* and losing a challenge with ROARINGS were the things that seem to have put the largest X on my winning chances.
