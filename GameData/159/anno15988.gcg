>Matthew_Larocque: AGLNRRU 8D GNURL +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: AGLNRRU --  -16 0
#note Saw the possible 8 of GRANULAR, so I threw down this word which I was pretty sure was no good.
>Eric_Tran: CEHTV 8D VETCH +34 34
>Matthew_Larocque: AGLNRRU D8 .ULGAR +20 20
>Eric_Tran: GUV 11B VU.G +18 52
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAABNR 10D .AB +14 34
#note Sad, I saw (H)ABANeRA but figured it was just a misspelled HABANERO. Other words I had no chance of playing were BARRANCA, ABRADANT, and CARNAUBA.
>Eric_Tran: DIILMOS 9H IDOLISM +68 120
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAILNR N7 LA.INARs +72 106
#note Terrible phony that could be valid if I change the blank to a Y. By some random miracle, Eric Tran does not challenge.
>Eric_Tran: ERZ J6 ZER. +33 153
>Matthew_Larocque: AKOORSY O4 KAYOS +59 165
#note Didn't like OKAY/S because of the T hook, and this scores good while putting the akward K at the top.
>Eric_Tran: JRU 12K JUR. +22 175
>Matthew_Larocque: CINOQRT L8 Q. +21 186
>Eric_Tran: EMO 13K OME. +29 204
>Matthew_Larocque: CINNORT O10 NOT +21 207
#note The C is helped by the K, giving me at least 20 points next turn.
>Eric_Tran: DEPRY 13C P.EDRY +26 230
>Matthew_Larocque: CGIINRW 4L WIC. +26 233
>Eric_Tran: ASTW K4 SWAT +41 271
#note Crap, *SWICK. Thought about holding, but Eric didn't hesitate much when he played it.
>Matthew_Larocque: DGINNRT 9C N. +3 236
#note Very poorly thought out fish, just play R(Y)ND for 27. The only thing I can hope to draw is DARTING - 3 As and a blank left. 
>Eric_Tran: BDFI M1 BIF.D +22 293
>Matthew_Larocque: DGINORT H13 .OD +21 257
>Eric_Tran: ISX 14B XIS +35 328
#note Held, was 50/50 on VULGARS but the game seemed like it would be totally over if I lost my turn.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINORT G1 GERONTI. +63 320
>Eric_Tran: ELNPU 1D PUN.LE +36 364
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEEHO L2 HO.E +27 347
#note Obviously I would have kept the H in hindsight.
>Eric_Tran: ?AENOTT 3C ATTO.NEy +66 430
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEEEI A14 AE +17 364
#note N1 scores 20.
>Eric_Tran: FI 5E FI. +12 442
#note O14 IF.
>Eric_Tran:  (AEEEI) +10 452
#note -10 on time. I probably didn't have a chance here, but N(U) was such a bad play... and not playing a valid bingo with the blank was pretty weak.
