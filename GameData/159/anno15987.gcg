>Matthew_Larocque: BBEEHIT 8F EBB +14 14
#note I didn't know EBBET.
>Mike_Ebanks: AEFZ F7 F.AZE +37 37
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEHIOT 12D HIDED +43 57
#note Held but no challenge.
>Mike_Ebanks: INQU 13B QUIN +33 70
>Matthew_Larocque: AEOOORT 10F .OO +12 69
#note 3 vowel racks are risky, but went for it becauase I expect Mike to score big on the Q next turn.
>Mike_Ebanks: NW 11E W.N +27 97
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINORT 14B INTO +45 114
#note I remember a time when I wouldn't break up a RETINA rack for anything, not even 45 points. Best in the sim, and only play with >50% chance to win.
>Mike_Ebanks: AHLOT E3 ALTHO +21 118
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFIRRS D3 FA +19 133
#note I hate those moments when you look and look, and still miss a bingo you should find without even trying. Much time was wasted here, and Ebanks is one of the opponents I always have a hard time beating.
>Mike_Ebanks: LUY H12 .ULY +24 142
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIPRRS I2 PRICERS +71 204
#note Thankfully I draw another bingo right away.
>Mike_Ebanks: ERTTY 2I .RETTY +26 168
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGGGIO M2 .EGG +12 216
#note Tough rack to deal with. Even if I knew (L)OGGIE, no way am I playing that. Sim likes it way better than anything else though. *shrugs*
>Mike_Ebanks: AAM L1 A.MA +24 192
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIILO K4 GIE +13 229
#note Bleh.

>Matthew_Larocque: EILMTTU 3B TU.. +14 279
#note Thought I might as well keep the M for J6 ME.
>Mike_Ebanks: NN -N +0 225
#note Uh oh.
>Matthew_Larocque: EILMNRT J6 ME +23 302
#note This gives me enough of a lead to withstand a bingo and messes up the hooks on the E. (C)L(I)N(G) is a cool play I missed, though.
>Mike_Ebanks: AOR 5E .ARO. +17 242
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IILNRT 4A LI +5 307
#note Crap, missed NITRILs. I should see that because I once phonied with *CITRILS.
>Mike_Ebanks: KNS B2 S..NK +38 280
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CINORT K9 CORNIsT +72 379
#note This should be a terrible blunder, but Mike thought I had played CORNIEST so he didn't challenge. I know the 3 words here, but I got confused with HORNIST I guess and didn't think hard enough.
>Mike_Ebanks: JW 10J J.W +29 309
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEILOV M7 VIOLAtE +92 471
#note Sorry Mike, you didn't deserve that.

>Matthew_Larocque: EERS 15K .REES +18 489
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AINS) +8 497
#note I lost -10. Drawing well enough to cover my stupid errors.
