#note One of the advantages of playing Quackle so many times is that it does wonders for your psychological state.  If this were a tournament game played a few months ago, I would be ready to shove the tile bag down my opponent's throat.   But I'm now used to Q's shenanigans and can now remain stoic throughout an entire game even when the score is 281-451 in my disfavor.

#note It took me about three minutes to figure this out.  Although it's tempting, I can't play RAZOR.  It's not worth blocking 10D VAMP either.  I'm actually pretty glad I found this play as I was very close to playing  ZAG.  G8 REAR wins the sim because it blocks Q's play on row 10.  However, if I'm going to block that spot, I think REB is better.  GHI doesn't appear on the list but when I added it's the runner up play, four points below REAR.  I played out the REAR sequence using the top recommended plays (and playing GHI is part of it) and it's this long and retarded affair in which I get stuck with the Z and Quackle gets stuck with the V.  So yeah I like GHI.  Since I decided that it's not worth blocking the plays on row 10, I made it a goal to go out first and maximize my points.     
>Quackle: AMPTTUV 10D TUMP +30 508
#note I was expecting VAMP, leaving TTU.  But I considered TUMP and just UMP too.  TUMP keeps the A and sets up 11C VAT as an outplay.  
>Tasha: ABORZ E10 .RB +10 369
#note Blocking VAT.  RAZOR also blocks the outplay and I'll break 400.  And I'll get the V instead of the T.  However, since I'm supposed to be practicing doing the "right" thing in endgame, I decided to make the technically correct play.   However to be completely honest,  in a tournament game I would have decided the spread difference was insignificant and played RAZOR. ...and then been pissed off when I placed second in said tournament with 3 spread points keeping me from winning.   Had I just played URB like I was SUPPOSED to, I would have won by one spread point.

#note Even when playing RAZOR, I could have still won the tournament had I played this at 4G instead.  Wait a second....no.   I'm not even going to delete that.  I'm just glad I noticed my mistake BEFORE I posted this.
