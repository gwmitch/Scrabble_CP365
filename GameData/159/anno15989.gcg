>Paul_Avrin: AIVV 8E VIVA +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEELRT E5 TRA.ELED +98 98
#note Paul originally was going to play VIVA to the right, then changed his mind. You could say that I had the right rack at the right time.
>Paul_Avrin: AZ 12D A.Z +26 46
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIOTUU 10D U.U +5 103
#note I kind of like taking the gamble with G10 UTE in hindsight.
>Paul_Avrin: EIIIIII -IIIIII +0 46
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEEIOT G12 ED +19 122
#note If I had played UTE last turn, I probably get to play the D hook this turn.
>Paul_Avrin: ?DLNSTU H5 UNS.LTeD +78 124
#note Nice fit, Paul.
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEEIOT D2 DICE +16 138
#note I was lost this turn, but after Paul drew 7 letters I didn't want to risk (Z)ED or (Z)OIC. (N)OTICED is up there in the sim too, going for pure turnover. I thought about playing CODE at first but that seemed to offer a huge overlap. Of course DICE sets up the X, so nothing seems truly safe here.
>Paul_Avrin: ABF C1 FAB +27 151
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENOST 6H .EONATES +62 200
#note Ever since I learned this bingo, it seems to get played at least once per tournament either by me or against me. 
>Paul_Avrin: ACEHW O4 CA.HEW +51 202
>Matthew_Larocque: FMPRRTY L4 TR.MPY +32 232
#note That A saved my life.
>Paul_Avrin: INNOO M9 ONION +18 220
>Matthew_Larocque: FHIRSTU B1 IF +29 261
#note Whoa, SH(AD)UF! 14B FRITHS/FIRTHS is also a lot of points. I still like this play though.
>Paul_Avrin: EJY 12L J.EY +36 256
>Matthew_Larocque: GHRSTTU 14I THRUST +40 301
#note Points, turnover, obstructs some bingo lines. I missed TRUTHS 14B which is even better for the extra defense. Sim also thinks something like 11G T(e)UGH is worthwhile too, but I wanted to try and just outrun him instead of fishing.
>Paul_Avrin: BI M3 BI +10 266
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGGLOO 15H GOA +19 320
#note Keeping an O for O(BI).
>Paul_Avrin: IPW I3 WIP. +17 283
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLORR 2J GALORE +27 347
>Paul_Avrin: K 1A K.. +30 313
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IIIOOR 15N OI +8 355
#note This was a mistake. I just forgot about ED. I should play 13C OI instead. Or (Z)ORI it's 18 points.
>Paul_Avrin: AEGLNRS 14A ANGLERS +74 387
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIIORX A11 IXI.s +57 412
#note Luckily the X comes to bail me out. I also notice he is Q stuck, so I'm really fortunate my failure to block ANGLERS didn't cost me.
>Paul_Avrin: EMNOQ 1N OM +26 413
>Matthew_Larocque: EOR 2B ...O +8 420
#note Overthinking this one. I figured his best play was EN in this spot, but he still has other plays for 10+ points. Prolonging the game just costs me more spread, just play ROE and get it over with. I didn't see 15D ORE.
>Paul_Avrin: ENQ L12 .E. +12 425
>Matthew_Larocque: ER 15E RE +6 426
#note No time left, miss about 5 better places to go out.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (NQ) +22 448
#note Squeaked it out, but forgot the basic rule that going out asap is almost always the best course of action.
