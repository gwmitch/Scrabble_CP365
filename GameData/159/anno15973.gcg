#note I guess QU(AI). Also W(AI)F which I missed. I wanted to set up points,
>Gabriel_Gauther-Shalom: ?AELLPR 10F sPALLER +70 132
#note D8 (C)ALLiPER is probably too dangerous.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEOQSUU M4 AQUEOUS +77 162
#note This was cool.
>Gabriel_Gauther-Shalom: ADEILRS K4 REALIS.D +86 218
#note This was not.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADGLTY L2 GAY +26 188
#note I saw FROWsY but I didn't think playing there was more points. I should have played GAYAL there, or GLADY even.
>Gabriel_Gauther-Shalom: EIMMN H10 .MMINE +39 257
#note It would have blocked this, a word I unnecessarily challenged.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDHILT -  +0 188
#note ADHIB(I)T would have been fine.
>Gabriel_Gauther-Shalom: ACEKNP 13C PEACN.K +42 299
#note Of course when he plays an actual phony, I don't challenge. We both confused this with the E-less REFUSNIK and thought this was an alternate spelling.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDHILT D4 BLAT.H +26 214
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDHILT --  -26 188
#note What am I doing? I thought this was good for some reason.

>Joshua_Sokol: ABDHILT D5 DIT.HABL. +84 272
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDHILT --  -84 188
#note I guess this wasn't worth trying either. Silly silly me.
>Gabriel_Gauther-Shalom: ?EIUV 15L .IVE +30 364
#note I saw some of his tiles by accident.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDHILT 14A BLAH +27 215
>Gabriel_Gauther-Shalom: GORTTU 11A ROTGUT +25 389
#note Missed this cute hook.

>Gabriel_Gauther-Shalom: OX B9 OX. +53 442
#note :(
>Joshua_Sokol: DIRRTYZ 13K R.TZ +26 321
#note I liked this play but apparently D(I)RTY and N6 TRY are the only better shots.
>Gabriel_Gauther-Shalom: FT 8M .FT +18 460
>Joshua_Sokol: DIINRTY 15A YID +50 371
#note Considering I knew he had the blank, it wasn't worth fishing for it with just (B)Y.
>Gabriel_Gauther-Shalom: ?DEGHIN O3 kNIGH.ED +63 523
#note Bleh, that's what happens when I lose 3 turns in a row...
