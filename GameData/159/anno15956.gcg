>Rafi_S: EIPTY 8H PIETY +28 28
>Kolton_K: ADEILLZ L4 DIAL.ZE +40 40
#note I laid this down pretty fast. Figured I would need a volatile, open board against Rafi. LAZIL(Y) sims about the same.
>Rafi_S: AEIRS 11J AIR +27 55
#note Said he set up his S here.
>Kolton_K: CLOPRTU 10F CROUP +31 71
#note OCTUPL(E) is a little better. They score the same--- but R is better than LT
>Rafi_S: IKST 12L SKIT +62 117
>Kolton_K: ABELSTU 6G TABLE.US +64 135
#note If he didn't take that spot, I would've passed on the bingos and played STUB there. But alas.
>Rafi_S: BIV K3 VIB. +29 146
>Kolton_K: ?CNNNSU N8 CUNN.NgS +72 207
#note Wans't sure about this. It is good. And the only bingo.
>Rafi_S: EIW 15L WI.E +33 179
>Kolton_K: AADEEGO 14J GOA +13 220
#note EDGE(WISE), crap.
>Rafi_S: AQ 4I QA.. +14 193
>Kolton_K: AADDEEGR 5A DEGRADE +72 292
>Rafi_S: FO 6A OF +29 222
>Kolton_K: AFMOSTV 7E FOAM +21 313
#note D1 FAVO(R) and D(3) FO(R)MAT are a wee better.
>Rafi_S: ?EGILMT 12D GIMLETs +74 296
>Kolton_K: DINNSTV H10 .V.N +7 320
#note I'm glad Q agrees with setting up the case S
>Rafi_S: JOO F12 .OJO +29 325
#note Rafi wanted to play (DO)JO but was afraid of the lane that I just set up
>Kolton_K: DEINSTW 8A TWINED +41 361
#note IN(DO)WED sims best. I like my play better.
>Rafi_S: ERY 15F .YER +21 346
>Kolton_K: EHHLSTX A5 ..L. +5 366
#note HHSX is going to be very helpful to score in the endgame. I was afraid of a bingo starting with T and with all the vowels left, dumping a consenant will be useful.
>Rafi_S: AEIOORR F4 E. +3 349
#note I think this was his rack. He said his only shot was fishing off the E and praying that I didn't have the S (which was very unlikely given the OVEN inferrence)
>Kolton_K: EEHHSTX M1 HEHS +35 401
#note This sets up the X
>Rafi_S: AIOORR B8 .OORARI +24 373
>Kolton_K: ENTUX N1 EX +41 442
#note Missed A12 NEXT for 50
