#note Though I looked through the O, I didn't spot the slightly higher scoring COVETOUs. I also didn't think of CUVEE. While this seems (and sims) a bet better than CUVEE, it's still a worthy option I should've considered.

#note It seemed like he could've kept tiles like R and S with JATO, so I went with this over TRAGIC (didn't see GARLIC). To be fair, this was a bit of a mistake -- I also thought about him having tiles like BMY, which if I had reviewed further would've realized JATO likely didn't keep.

#note This is best but I(SO)ZYME is sick!

Mistakes this game were pretty straightforward. I need to work on board vision.
