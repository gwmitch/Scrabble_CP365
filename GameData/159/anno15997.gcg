#note I wasn't 100% on either of these. OSTLERS too.
>Glenn_Dunlop: ADEV 4K .AVED +22 46
>Joshua_Sokol: EINOPTU J5 UPO +25 116
#note Possibly my worst miss of the tournament, as a Montrealer. I am embarrassed at myself. POUTINE. Also, F3 UNPOETI(C)...

>Joshua_Sokol: EINOSTX N1 OX +41 181
#note 14G TOXINES and F8 EX(C)ITONS seem like too much of a risk, not that I saw either of them. (I might have seen TOXINES and decided against playing it, I don't quite remember)

>Glenn_Dunlop: ??EGINW 15A WIdGEoN +85 185
#note 15B sWINGlE is static's favorite, and in second 15D GWINE keeping the 99% bingo percentage next turn. Those first two options are very close in the 3-ply sim.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGHNRRZ L13 H.R +12 264
#note Trying to balance my rack and hit a good Z play next turn.
>Glenn_Dunlop: ADEFTT 13B FATTED +30 215
>Joshua_Sokol: EGNORRZ 12A ZONE +57 321
#note Worked out quite well.
>Glenn_Dunlop: CIJNOO G3 COJOIN +27 242
>Joshua_Sokol: BGIMORR 4D BRO.M +24 345
#note I don't think there's an especially good play here. I kept GI for maybe getting GLIT(Z) later on.
>Glenn_Dunlop: IKQU E1 QUI.K +36 278
>Joshua_Sokol: AGGIIPR 1E .I +11 356
#note I didn't like the fact that there were two u's unseen and I had none of them.
>Glenn_Dunlop: EELY 6B EELY +31 309
>Joshua_Sokol: AGGIPRT B2 GRAP. +16 372
#note I had a feeling that EELY took an S, but I was unsure if it took anything else. I was kind of worried. Again fishing for GLIT(Z).
