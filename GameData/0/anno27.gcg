#note I think I must have missed the best bingo here. HEADGeAR didn't seem worth playing despite the advantage of blocking the J10 QI threat. But HAnGARED for 86 is definitely the play.

#note Interesting. WAB seems like the normal play in this position, but it sims poorly. Hard to say what is best here, any comments?

#note Poor play - POI (B12, 19) to block Z plays is much better, despite emptying the bag.
