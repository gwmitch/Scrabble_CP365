#note Interesting...I thought this was a pretty clear choice at the time, but playing the Q sims quite a bit better, as does exchanging just the Q. Definite food for thought.

#note Saw, too late, how O-heavy the pool was, making FOB the indicated play. Of course I was punished, as OUTSHINE would have played next turn.

#note Bad, bad endgame blunder - luckily I could afford the carelessness this time. Totally missed opponent's outplay, and fixated on blocking LEEK/REEK. RIPER (12J) is best.
