#note Dang! 101 would have been bad enough. Luckily, allowing the 3 point overscore didn't cost this time.

#note Bad mistake here. At this score, winning chances are pretty much nil, so I should try to cut the spread instead of trying to open.
FEN J2 would have been a pretty nifty way to try for a 58-pointer.

#note Another rather poor move. I guess FLEY instead of FLAY indicates I was thinking about drawing the Z, but then why not keep the F (for FEZ or FUZE)?
