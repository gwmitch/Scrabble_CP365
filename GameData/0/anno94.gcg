#note Why put the V on the star? Well, why not. It's unlikely to cost much, opens both halves of the board, and who knows, the unconventional placement might induce opponent to do something bizarre.

#note I thought this was a good way to put the pressure on...I was pretty sure opponent didn't have an S or a Y (and anyway, it seemed doubtful that someone who would try "UVEAE" would know OVERWEARY).

#note Crap, what happened? After turn 2 it looked like this would be an easy win. I kept waiting for the Y for CYST or something, but of course it came one turn too late.

#note There's the break I needed. Interestingly, opponent had originally put down GLIDING, and then switched it to the word he thought was less likely to take an S...
