#note I was pretty faithful this was a good word. Alas, it is not. It also sims pooly, with YO winning. That makes see.

#note Sims ever so slightly behind VAT-probably because of defensive reasons.

#note Quackle prefers COG C2 as well as CORD and COD there. I wanted to play this because I had a feeling I wasn't going to get to play the Q for a while on this board, ESPECIALLY not after COG. It was still a tough call though. I'm not so sure I agree with Quackle. I'm pretty sure he's bingoing soon because of all this heavy fishing, so leaving a good leave seemed important. Quackle prefers keeping just CR-I felt like CDR was stronger since I'll likely pick plenty of vowels.
>Ron_Southwick: KNU 5J .UNK +16 134
>Noah: CDIINRX 6B XI +30 253
#note Quackle likes waiting to play the X with someting like DICK (not one of my favorite options) or IRIDIC 3H. I looked there, but didn't see it-and I really like IRIDIC. It scores decently and really controls the board well.
>Ron_Southwick: EE M3 EE. +14 148
#note I think somewhere around now was when he slammed his pen on the table.
>Noah: CDINORS N1 CORDS +30 283
#note Not even on the static evaluators choices, but rises to the very top of the sim.
>Ron_Southwick: EO 5A OE +11 159
>Noah: DEINTUU 1K DUN.E +27 310
#note An awful miss of stuff like DUCI an EDUCT, which are clearly better. Stupidly enough, I only saw UNCI here.
>Ron_Southwick: GO F12 .OG +8 167
>Noah: EGIITUW L4 G.U +18 328
#note I remember passing up plays like WIG and TWIG to keep a more consonant-vowel balanced leave and block the board. Quackle disagrees.

#note Quackle doesn't like this. I probably should have thought about this endgame like, more than a tiny bit. ID 15J seems like a sharp play, seems to win all the time.
>Ron_Southwick: ?ABLOQT 3C QAT +28 263
#note The best plays all block my out. BOLTs M11 is best.
