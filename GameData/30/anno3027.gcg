>Matt: DUW 8G WUD +14 14
#note Another Matt (surname Graham) once said to me that when you can play WUD it's usually the best move.
>Dave: EEHINNO 9F HONE +21 21
>Matt: AS 10F AS +17 31
>Dave: BEEINNV E10 VINE +20 41
#note I don't buy the static evaluator's preferred choices here.
>Matt: GO 7H GO +13 44
>Dave: ABCEENN D11 BEN +20 61
>Matt: APY C12 YAP +28 72
>Dave: AAACENS 15A CASA +30 91
#note Clearly preferred to AA 10I because I know that he has an S and that he's been grooming his rack for several turns.
>Matt: DOOR J9 DOOR +16 88
#note I like the way the kid plays.  He has not drawn many scoring tiles, but he milks points off the board the best he can, keeps shaping it the way he wants to, and doesn't get rattled.
>Dave: AAEENOZ J5 AZO +36 127
>Matt: DENRRST 5G STR.NDER +68 156
>Dave: AAEEILN K4 A.A +14 141
#note INANE K4 might be better here, but it does give him nice scoring possibilities at 8K-8O or the L column.
>Matt: AEOR L1 OREA. +18 174
#note Overall, I am very impressed with how fearlessly Matt played in this game.  However, considering that this wasn't a really high scoring play, I might have considered something not quite so wide open.
>Dave: EEHIILN 2J HI.EE +32 173
>Matt: BEFI H1 BEFI. +33 207
>Dave: ?IKLLNX M2 .X +36 209
#note I briefly toyed with LYNXLIKE* here.  Even though my leave doesn't look great, it's got bingo potential.
>Matt: ELPT K11 PELT +22 229
>Dave: ?IIKLLN 2A LINeLIK. +76 285
#note I considered LIONLIKE as well, but I decided that, since A column plays or S hooks onto one of the triple lanes were likely in response, I wanted the extra volatility.
>Matt: IQ 1B QI +24 253
#note After playing bravely for many turns, Matt opted for safety over the extra points from QI 6F.  Considering the score, I think I would have taken the points. Yes, I will likely hit the A column, but more bingo lines will be open for him to come back afterwards.  Of course, I don't know the rest of his rack, so take my words with a grain of salt.
>Dave: CGIMMNR 1N MM +22 307
>Matt: EIVW 12J ..VIEW +32 285
>Dave: CDGINRU C1 ..DUCING +26 333
#note DUCTING 14H and CUEING N10 are reasonable options that I did not see during the game, but they both have the big drawback of allowing something like JADE or JAGS six-timing the J.  My play is also strong and definitely better than something cowardly like WING.  The chance of him bingoing to the W is low, and turnover is so good for me now, to try to beat him to the blank, S, and J, and end the game quickly.  Taking out the column B spot for sevens was another factor in my decision.
