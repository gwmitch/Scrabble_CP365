#note Very odd move on my part.  The same word plays for more points at two places on the L column. I was considering both of them when, before I had managed to tally up the scores, Seth made his play, distracting me with the R hook.  I looked to see if there was a way to make a play hooking both EIDE and HOPLITE.  When I didn't find it, I settled on this play, forgetting about the plays I had previously considered.  This one is a little better defensively, but it's not worth sacrificing six points for.

#note Interesting choice here.  Of course, LAUNCH or LUNCH is natural.  It scores well and takes out a big scoring zone for him, but I really don't like keeping the J and Z together.  However, considering that I've got a decent chance of pulling an E for JEEZ K11, it may not be so bad.  My play keeps some letters that are not so bad themselves but don't compliment the J very well.  I figured that I was likely to have the 6F spot for a while if I needed to dump the J.

>Dave: CIJLNNU A8 LUNC. +30 268
#note Now this play is clearly merited, and the fact that I'm one letter away from an extension favors it even more.
>Seth: EELRV N2 ELVER +34 305
#note Nice play by Seth that blocked my big JIVES.

#note This was a pretty dumb move.  I was caught up on taking out the O column and missed that this word plays for more points at N9, while still partially blocking the column.  Those plays parallel to the blank can be hard to spot.  YE N10 might be even better.  Still, considering how dead the board is after my play, I guess it's not so bad.
>Seth: P 9A .P +4 358
#note In spite of my previous move, my draw was so good that Seth was doomed.  Even if he hadn't played this, I had several bingos that fit.
