>Bob: NOORTU 8G NOTOUR +14 14
>Andrew: ADDNVWX 9H DAWN +22 22
#note Tough call with WAX 9H for 31 on offer, but using the extra consonant is correct (Q also rather likes the humble VOX J7)
>Bob: ADNOR 10F RADON +26 40
>Andrew: ADILMVX 7K MAX +27 49
#note What a beauteous play I overlooked here, MIXDOWN J4 for 36. Mine is next best but seven equity points in arrears.
>Bob: EMST 6L TEMS +24 64
>Andrew: ADILPVV O1 VIVDA. +45 94
#note Curious that Bob should play at 6L rather than 11E, which allows a giveaway comeback from me. Perhaps he was retaining a blank or something. 
>Bob: ENST 5J NEST +22 86
>Andrew: IIJLPTU K2 JUP. +13 107
#note Another hard call with Bob clearly sitting on at least another S. My play kept it tight, but Q has a fancy for the dangerous MIL/MAXI, or PIU/NU - inferring S, none of the plays offer more than 46% win chances.
>Bob: GOY 6H GOY +28 114
>Andrew: EIILQTU 11C QUIET +32 139
#note So perhaps Bob was setting up his Y instead. QUIET is best, but Quackle still has a liking for MI and MIL at N6.
>Bob: AINW 12A WAIN +37 151
>Andrew: AGIILOT A12 .AIL +21 160
#note Simulation likes AGLOW keeping IIT, even with the S-inference. I wasn't so sure and stuck with an anaemic alternative.
>Bob: RS 13A .RS +32 183
>Andrew: AEGIOTT 12G TOGATE +19 179
#note No play exceeds 19 here. My choice turns over the maximum number of tiles and keeps the board difficult for Bob.
>Bob: ADEFR H1 DEFRA. +36 219
>Andrew: ?EEEIKU 11K EEK +20 199
#note Possibly EEK or EUK G3 are marginally better, but I fancied having access to the R at 4H.
>Bob: CCHNO 5C CONCH. +26 245
>Andrew: ?BEEIRU 1A REBUrIE. +83 282
#note This or RUBEFIED
>Bob: EILP 2B LIPE +25 270
>Andrew: ABEGILO 3C BOG +34 316
#note OK, perhaps BOI or BOIL are a little better (I must have skipped over the REI possibility)
>Bob: ?EHIORZ H12 .OZE +39 309
#note Apparently Bob missed the spot for HEROIZE or RHIZOME here. But Q (simulator) doesn't recommend the bingos, instead going for an unexpected OH/JO at L2, 19 points! Somehow that produces an 82% win shot compared to 71% for RHIZOME or 46% for HEROIZE (not sure I trust those numbers). OH also spends the H which would work well at F6 - I don't get it. Bob's choice to play three tiles cedes any bingo chance, so I wouldn't go for that either (I'd probably just whack a bingo down. Would Logan/Richards do any different?). Edit - Championship Player goes for RHIZOME, followed by (ET)H K11.
>Andrew: AEIILSY I2 SYE +26 342
#note CP proposes GYAL I12 here, blocking the outplay but leaving EIIS and thus extending the endgame too long for my liking. My choice is second best, also 100% winning.
>Bob: ?FHILR 6D FaH +37 346
>Andrew: AIIL N6 .ILIA +22 364
#note Bob would be slightly better off with FILCHER but still I have the game.
>Andrew:  (ILR) +6 370
