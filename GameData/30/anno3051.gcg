#note Lloyd was visibly disappointed after our game 23 in Albany, but later e-mailed me congratulations. He congratulated me before our game here and I thanked him. "Jason the sensation," he said. "Apparently it's not a fluke." All I could think of to say was: "I *guess* not."
>Jason: CEIMOSU 9F COM. +23 41
#note Very close between this and (J)UCO. (-0.4)
>Lloyd_Mills: AB J6 BA +21 54
#note I didn't know Lloyd was coming until I saw him talking with Carol and Knappster in the parking lot. "Did you see there's a legitimate 1800 here?" Knappster asked in the playing room. He then said something like: "He likes you. I asked 'Can you believe he finished third in Albany and is 1800?' He said you played very well in your game." "Must've disappointed you," I responded. "I had to move on to someone else," he said. :) (Scored as 22.)
>Jason: EILOSTU K1 OUTLIES +80 121
#note Now this game gets interesting. I know he's just fished but I can't exactly pass up my only bingo.
>Lloyd_Mills: AEINPRT 1H ATR.PINE +167 221
#note Ruh-roh.
>Jason: DEFLNOT J9 TENFOLD +74 195
#note I always miss this rack in study; somehow saw it here. Missed playing it at 2B, a 6.1-point error, but I'm back in the game!
>Lloyd_Mills: ?DHIILN 2B HILDINg +75 296
#note Or not. Only playable bingo, and it doesn't go down if I hadn't whiffed on the better TENFOLD spot. Gah!
>Jason: AAAIOTT 1A IOTA +25 220
#note HILDINg set me up well, though. At this point I've kissed off winning high game with my 484 vs. Fiszbein.
>Lloyd_Mills: BEIMU 15E IMBUE. +33 329
>Jason: AACEGGT 4J C.AG +14 234
#note Didn't know (D)AGGA at E2. (-6.5)
>Lloyd_Mills: DNO 2M NOD +17 346
>Jason: AEFGOST 13H FO.TAGES +76 310
#note Missing OF(F)STAGE. (-8.8)
>Lloyd_Mills: KQUY L11 QU.KY +50 396
>Jason: ?EEGNRR N7 GREENi.R +70 380
#note I saw aNGERER(S)*, ENRaGER(S)*, GREENeR(S)* and RENEGER(S). I decided to play the one I was more sure and forgo the extra seven. (-10.6)
>Lloyd_Mills: AIIUVWY 8L WI.Y +42 438
#note Argh! Lloyd told me his rack after the game when I asked what I missed to the S (RENEGeRS, ReGREENS). If I'm down ten with ANORTVW while he has this drek ... if, if, if.
>Jason: ANORTVW 3A WON +24 404
#note It's a surreal feeling, to have played four bingos in eight turns but knowing you'll probably need number five to win. Should've added the T; didn't see it. (-5.1)
>Lloyd_Mills: ADEIV A3 .AIVED +42 480
>Jason: AHPRRTV 14D RAH +31 435
#note PATH at 14C leads in valuation. I'm surprised VA(I)R at M6 wins 10+% of the time. I'm hoping for PRIVATE(R). When the first two I looked at were EA, my heart momentarily stopped. Alas, another A. (-19.6)
>Lloyd_Mills: SU 14B SU... +16 496
#note Lloyd must've had the I, 'cause he said he didn't see any playable bingos and decided to set up the X.
>Jason: AAEPRTV D12 VA. +12 447
#note I passed on PAVER because it set him up for the X, but not that much. If I do that, under optimal endgame play we hit 1000 easy. (-8.0)
>Lloyd_Mills: EILRSX 4C SILEX +28 524
#note Or XIS at 15A.
>Jason: AEPRT B7 REAP +17 464
#note Gah! Missed TREPA(N). Saw this was two less than TAPER(S) so I played it just to contribute to the high combined score. Before you turn me into the NSA, I didn't see it as any different than sacrificing a couple equity points to, say, play a nine. (-2.0)
>Lloyd_Mills: R 13D .R +5 529
#note What a game. The combined score beats my 538-441 loss to Peter Armstrong in Chicago. But rushing with TENFOLD and not playing ReNEGERS hurts a little. Still, hard to complain.
>Lloyd_Mills:  (T) +2 531
