>Demigod: ABEEEGJ 8F AJEE +22 22
>Noah: CENRTXY F7 R.CY +17 17
#note Didn't see options like NECTARY (which I like). Quackle likes ANY by a lot though. I guess it's because CERTX is the best bingo leave by far (say the sim details)? I guess. 
>Demigod: BCEEGSV E10 BEG +19 41
>Noah: DEINOTX 9I XI +34 51
#note Quackle likes COX 9F by about 7 points. I guess the DEINT leave is a lot better than DENOT. I didn't see COX.
>Demigod: ACEOPSV 7H OVA +29 70
>Noah: DEINOOT 12A DOIN. +18 69
#note Quackle says play TOO 6J, INGOTED 12C, or NOODGE 12A. I like INGOTED the best out of all of these options, although Quackle likes TOO best. Didn't think of INGOTED.
>Demigod: CEENPST C8 PECT.NES +76 146
>Noah: DELNOOT 15C .NOOLED +27 96
#note Wasn't sure if STOOLED was good. It certainly looks better. Quackle also likes SNOOTED, which I considered because of it's giving of an L hook for OVAL and further board opening. Quackle also likes NOODLED A9 to close triple-triples I guess? I like SNOOTED, even though it sims about equally with this.

#note Debated between this and TWIRP. TWIRP is much more volatile. As much as I kind of liked it, I didn't want to take that much risk with three esses and two blanks out. I think I can get up with careful patience. This turns over one more tile than TWIRP and keeps me with decent chances for next turn-I will probably get to play at 6J anyway, or opponent will open it up for me by playing there itself. Sim prefers TWIRP by a little.

#note I saw FARLE, but didn't think it was good. Quackle clearly hates this play. It likes plays that aren't playe here, probably to conserve this spot. It's favorite non-bingos are things like MONAD and MON 6J, which I saw but thought were unneccesarily volatile. It also likes ROOM B11, hating this play.
>Demigod: EGINRTU N7 TRUEING +70 326
>Noah: AEINRSS 3B ...S +7 231
#note Quackle says I should not just fish off the S. I say, screw it, I'm opening the board as much as I can. Of course Quackle likes ENS O8 and SAIN K9, but those seems stupid because they start to close down the board. I know they score more, but I NEED to bingo like twice here.
