#note OAK 7E seems clearly superior to me. Why didn't I play it?
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: LN G7 ..LN +9 35
>Sam: AILLOWX 6D LOW +29 59
#note Spent a while deciding between ALOW, LOW, and OW on this turn. Still can't see much difference between this and ALOW, which Quackle very slightly prefers. Even if I hit 7C it'll give him huge comebacks. This seemed like it kept the most balanced leave. Sometimes I find it hard to differentiate between close plays like these.

#note Couldn't remember if it was KILNY* or LINKY. Easily best if accepted. Marge held, but let it go because of...
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: DEIINRS L4 INSIDER +86 167
#note ...this.
>Sam: ?EIOPRS K9 PORgIES +72 195
#note This was a bad play. Why not PROSIEr 11I--any bingo opens up a triple anyway. POISERs 11I is another consideration, probably a stronger one. PERIDOtS B1 as well.

#note Completely whiffed on DOJO 8L, instead deciding between FJORD and OF J9. This is important because...
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: ?AEMOST 1B .OrMATES +86 283
#note FOAMiEST is three more points
>Sam: AEINORU D8 .OI.E +20 247
#note I don't know if I saw UREA 4A or not, but that looks alright. Same with EAU M9. VOICE sets up a nice line, but there's already eights through O or gI, sevens on column M or row 2 or 14--there are bingo spots on this board. Get rid of that U! I like UREA.

>Sam: ACDEENN 4A C.ED +30 304
#note I was just playing for spread here. Something like DENE M7 or DACE J8 should do just as well.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: TW 9C W.T +12 407
>Sam: AAEENNV 8L .EVA +24 328
#note I'm not going to win here no matter what. Might as well play this over something like VANE J8.

>Sam: AAEENNU N5 UNE.EN +13 341
#note Lol, Champ. Player sucks. It likes AVENUE N7, which I put on the board but took back for good reason. UVEA N7, which might be better than mine, wins the many-ply sim.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: BEOPRST O1 STROP +28 465
#note See why AVENUE was a bad idea? REBOP O1 is 10 points better than this.
