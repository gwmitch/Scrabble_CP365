#note Fail. I didn't realize QUACKY, and I think I would have chickened out on it anyhow.

#note I debated between this and ODEA. I thought the merits of keeping and E were good, because the pool doing pretty well in terms of consonants, and the T, S and N are all good consonants to play through. Quackle's sim suggests ODEA is better by a point though.

#note Of course, now I wish I had played ODEA.

>Noah: AEEIIPS 5J .IE +12 213
#note Debated between this and EPIC. Quackle likes that and AI 7A better. I don't know why AI is preferable (maybe because it doesn't give opponents as many scoringspots?). At this point, EPIC seems like the right play, but I hate the dea of getting mired in more vowels, even though the pool is much more consonant heavy.

>Noah: AEILPSS O1 PALSIES +89 302
#note Didn't see ESPIALS, which Quackle deems as better. I don't mind PALSIES though, and I think the difference isn't that big between them.

>Noah: AEENTUV L10 AVENUE +23 350
#note This is the thing I saw that gave me the best chance at an out-in-one. Seeing VAUNT(I)E would have been nice though. Actually, I think I chose a bad strategy. There's pretty much no out in one that wins this game, I don't think (think longer, Noah!). Really, the only thing that gives me hope is to play off one tile and hope to draw a bingo.  Something like ER 13C seems like a good option, giving me possibilities like VAUNTERS and some other stuff. Quackle's champ player results are in, and it says FEU L4 bingos the most. VETERANS, NAVETTES, VENTAGES, AEENSTV? Oops. This was a bad play and probably never wins. Of course, the worst is when your opponent does...
