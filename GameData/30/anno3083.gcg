>Eugene_d'Eon: EEGSUYZ 8G GUY +14 14
#note Quackle liked it too.  nice.  GEEZ is obvious, but the leave sucks.

>Eugene_d'Eon: AAEOOST 11E OA. +14 62
#note I was consider O(V)ATE.  Glad I chose OA(K).  It's a bit better.  Didn't see A(W)A, which Quackle like's best.

#note RAM(B)L(E) is preffered, by about 5 equity.
>Eugene_d'Eon: HIILLNP 3G H. +20 152
#note Bad choice.  I saw 11I HILL, but saw Jerry's letters all together and he wasn't moving them, and he just opened some lanes, so I thought the block of (A) lane was worth the 1 point and worse leave.  11I HILL is best by 8.
