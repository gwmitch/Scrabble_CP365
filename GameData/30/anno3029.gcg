>Jason_Keller: CEGJLOO 8G JOG +22 22
#note JK: Considered 8D COLOG briefly.  Glad I reconsidered.
>Jason: ?EEMORT J2 METEORs +77 77
#note JI: So happy with this, I miss the 80-pointer (O)dOMETER (or OrOMETER).
>Jason_Keller: CEGLOOU 5D ECLOGU. +20 42
#note JK: My thoughts with this rack were (i) ECOLOGUE is probably not good and (ii) get rid of as much as you can and start over.  Second in valuation to 4H OUTGO, which leaves pretty nicely, and also behind 9B COLUGO in win %.
>Jason: AHIIOPY 9E AHOY +26 103
#note JI: A bunch of better options; 4A plays like HYPO, AHOY, HOYA, OPAH. H(E)APY for 34 in two separate spots. (M)YOPIA's gutsy, but he has just played six. Not a terrible play, though; sims about 5-6 pts. behind, albeit behind about 10 other plays.
>Jason_Keller: AFNOOST 4A FANO +26 68
#note JK: Pretty bad miss.  I saw the -S hook on ECLOGUE and didn't think overlaps through.  K1 FANOS is the obvious play.
>Jason: BDIILPR 10D DRIB +30 133
#note JI: Looked for plays through the F for about .14 seconds and missed FIBRIL, about 6-7 behind this. DIB, which I never considered, is also better by about three.
>Jason_Keller: ILOOSTU A4 .OLIO +24 92
#note JK: Duck seems to like A4 FLOUT and FOLIOUS ahead of this?  The US gets six more points, so no to that, and I prefer keeping STU to IOS.
>Jason: AIILNPT 3B PITA +23 156
#note JK: Immediately seeing this post-mortem, he missed PINTAIL B8!  Minus eleventy billion points! 
#note JI, in Shelley/Stewie voice: "I'm Jason Keller and I'm way better than Jason Idalski 'cause I got 10 more than him on the Jeopardy! test and I know PINTAIL!"
>Jason_Keller: CINRSTU B8 INCRUST +82 174
#note JK: Held, but let go.  What I would have given for a challenge and a "Stinkeroo!" 
#note JI: What I would give for this guy's sevens knowledge...
>Jason: ILNRRTX A12 XI +36 192
#note JI: Hoping for a vowel. Inadvertently messing Jason up, as you can tell.
>Jason_Keller: AADEMQW C13 MAW +28 202
#note JK: H1 DAMA(G)E is a little bit better.  Not so hot about leaving QW, though.
>Jason: ALNNRRT 3I L.ARNT +14 206
#note JI: Easily best, with the added bonus of helping to neutralize the -S hook to ECLOGUE.
>Jason_Keller: AADDEIQ L1 DA.ED +18 220
#note JK: Totally should have played N1 QAT.  I got too scared of replies.  N1 DATE is also interesting if he leaves row 1 open. 
#note JI: Like I told him while going over this play: "Don't be afraid to gamble when the odds are in your favor." It's pretty obvious I didn't keep an I after LEARNT ... even if I should hit IN or IT for 41, it's not a deal-breaker. Plus, while he shouldn't be scared of the Q, the board isn't exactly Q-friendly now.
>Jason: EENRSUY 1L .ENY +24 230
#note JI: Missed the cute ENSUE at 11E. Somehow Q runs the ultra-ballsy ENSURE very close to ENSUE, this about six back.
>Jason_Keller: AEIIOQS -AIIOQ +0 220
#note JI: Pool's consonant-heavy enough you can make a case for an AES or EIS keep. The three of them sim closely.
>Jason: DEERSUU D10 .UE +8 238
#note JI: U(L)U's the better fish, but I don't mind having a U at the ready with the Q lurking. Like about half my plays this game, a 5-6 point equity loss.
>Jason_Keller: EEEISTT 11D .TE +18 238
#note JK: 15B SWEETIE is best, this is next.
>Jason: ADEKRSU 12F DUKE +22 260
#note JI: ARGH!!! I was like 75+% on WARKED, even if WARKED is no good, he still has to challenge it off, and I don't play it! Minus eleventy billion! (OK, Q says about 25ish...) WAUKED is better still. I blame Keller for distracting me during this play ... he knows how.
>Jason_Keller: EEGHIST 15C .EIGHT +42 280
#note JI: Finally the spot gets used.
>Jason: AAAORRS 14F AA +14 274
#note JI: I fully deserve the AAOR draw into ARS for my stupidity last turn. Sim puts this, ORA at 11I and AR(E)A in a near dead-heat. I played this, JK likes AR(E)A, I prefer ORA. Dowhatchawant.
>Jason_Keller: EEILNSZ F5 .EZ +14 294
#note JI: I see a lot of the 1500s-1600s me in JK (sans the awesome word knowledge), like here. I've noticed he sometimes plays for the bingo too much, a problem I've better getting better at lately. On the surface, this looked like a good play, but SIZE/(DUKE)S almost certainly wins, simming about 15 points ahead of anything else. In Jason's defense, he didn't know I was sitting on the case A, case O and case R's.
>Jason: ABOPRRS 13H ARBORS +27 301
#note JI: Q gives this about a five-point equity hit. 50 is more like it. Awful, awful play. Had no clue what LEZ meant. If I can correctly read it as a fish, I know the 11-tile bag before LEZ (which contains FQVVW) is full of garbage and play short. But, four power tiles to draw, not easy to play off two and score, meaning he'll prolly empty. Sims fifth, behind 11I plays ORB, BOP, BRO and ARB at 13H. This play is the equivalent of running directly into oncoming traffic. Fortunately, the bag spared my life.
>Jason_Keller: EFILNSV 11I FIVE +26 320
#note JK: I needed to think more about this play with the Q unseen.  I don't like this play, even though CP seems to. I was thinking that saving the I is a good idea in case I do get the Q.  Thoughts? 
#note JI: In the post-mortem, I thought this was an excellent, excellent play. Should he get the Q, it's hard for me to block the 31-pointer while going out first. If I have it and play Q(I) I'm only up 12 while again he has the inside track to going out first. Near the tops in win % and in valuation it's about 20 points ahead of anything else. I think it's a great play.
>Jason: ?EIINPW J10 P. +10 311
#note JI: Championship Player says WIs/(FIVE)s for the unblockable PINE/I(WIs), but this looks to be better from where I sit, esp. having used CP to play it out in both instances.
>Jason_Keller: LNQSSV B2 S..N +14 334
#note JK: I11 (FER)NS if I want to limit the damage. 
#note JI: I think we both (well, me, anyway) need to work on limiting/maximizing spread in decided endgames. Jason was obviously frustrated by the QSV draw, but you gotta keep making your best play. That being said, no shame in missing (FER)NS ... it's a tough spot.
>Jason: ?EIINW M6 WINIEr +20 331
#note JI: He's not just Q-stuck, he's QV-stuck, so bleed him. (FER)Ny or (FER)Ns. 13-point error. But yeah. I kinda needed dumb luck to win this one.
>Jason:  (LQSV) +32 363
