#note Error - PEG 14E or GEEZ 14G sim best. I completely missed that spot (but I did consider things like AGEE/GRIOT).

#note This was a really bad play. I couldn't decide what to do, but practically anything would have been better. Probably something like AIR or AIRN M12 is best.

#note I was hoping for the D in the bag. There are a couple of plays that win with the A in the bag: OVINE or OVINES 3C. I guess OVINE is the best play as it loses by least on average.
