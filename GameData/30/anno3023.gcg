#note Knew ANDROID, but not DROID. DIGHT is simming basically equally anyway, and I wasn't afraid of putting tiles in the triple lane against this opponent.
>Robyn_Key: ?AQS A1 SQuA. +45 87
>Sam: ADGRRXY 9B DRY +26 160
#note The sim prefers such things as GRAY in the same spot, GOX, GRODY, and ORYX F8. This wasnt too bad, I think, though GRAY does look a little better.

#note Missed POGEY--obviously didn't know that word like I should.
>Robyn_Key: ADENO L2 ANODE +33 175
>Sam: EMOPRUU 2A .UORUM +46 281
#note Oops, scored this as 40 not 46.
>Robyn_Key: ADEINR B9 .RAINED +22 197
>Sam: BEJLPRT 12A J.BER +44 325
#note Given the pool, JIBE seems alright also.
>Robyn_Key: AINR 11D RAIN +14 211
>Sam: EGLPRST A14 PE +25 350
#note Doesn't show up in Quackle's choices, but is second place behind SPELT H11 in the sim. There are some big hits I could take at this spot (JAPE, JEFE, etc.). Was wishing I had the A.
>Robyn_Key: F 3G F.. +17 228
>Sam: GHLRSTT 2K H.LT +14 364
#note The sim is liking something like GIST or HIST F10, or GARTH E10. Just threw this down when I didn't see anything better. Any of those three seem somewhat better. I don't hate HALT though.
>Robyn_Key: INT 8J .INT +5 233
>Sam: CFGMRST C1 F.G +14 378
#note FISC F10 another possibility, or just trading FGM, which might be best.
