#note I want as open of a board as possible. I also figured that I was the only one who knew the extensions, if they show up, and I think that this opponent is very likely to challenge words he doesn't know.

#note Since my opponent has now x3'd and fished, I'm guessing I'm up against at least a decent rack. This board doesn't have an S yet either. Also, USQUE kills the U, and in the long term I'm going to want to at least have the option of opening that top right quadrant.

#note I actually like seeing WUD as it gets the top right back into play. However, I think this is a pretty colossal error. Obviously, my opponent is still fishing. Because of the speed of which he played, I was pretty sure there wasn't a blank, and in fact I was guessing he was pretty weak, as I learned from watching that my opponent fishes a lot. I do want to try to beat him to the blanks here. However, I think keeping QUIS is better. It leaves as a good defense to my opponent's likely plays, and since I think my opponent is weak, I should make things difficult for him and not try to race. Even though my spread is crappy, I don't need to race just yet: it's still early. Volatility is still bad: a safe leave is clearly better here.

#note This isn't good. I guess I got punished for keeping the wrong exchange. Now I'm in a mess. I can play ROM 3e for 20 points, but I could also try and phoney. The best phoneying options I see are DROME* a4 and LOWERER* e6. I think my opponent is a little challenge happy but maybe not so much as this score. While DROME definitely scores better, it has a higher likelihood of being challenged. Plus, I figure there is a good chance that he may hook the S to LOWERER*. In addition, he probably doesn't know FLOWERER and might challenge that. I think this is the best shot.

#note While this is a bit risky, I don't think I'm the favorite anymore, especially after my opponent plays AA and looks like he's fishing again.

#note He takes a long time, seemingly like he has a blank. There also goes my F. :(

#note I think there's a chance he might not know SQUARK, but he also might, and I can't really stand the alternatives. I really am starting to sense a blank after ROOF, considering that he started playing a little slower.

#note This is really not looking good. He's thinking a little bit too long for my liking here, and he's fishing. I really think he's got the other blank here too. UGH. This would be a really good spot for a phoney but I just don't see one. Maybe MAYTOP*, but I think that's pushing my luck.

#note He holds forever, and I try to sell this as a phoney, but alas he lets it go.

#note While SIB is clearly better ideally, I think it's easier for him to just take H and block. This gives him a better chance to completely screw up. Maybe VIS, but I don't see that working either.

#note If the E is in the bag, I have a chance, as he will need to block and use multiple tiles. Maybe a long shot chance with SITTING or something too, though then he should just block line 14, but I think that is unlikely.
