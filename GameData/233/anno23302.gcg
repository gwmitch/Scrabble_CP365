#note a substantial mistake - I have the option of playing WOOF which both blocks the M and makes it harder to use column N. OWE sims better, but I think WOOF is thematically better.

#note great phony by ed!! he bumps his win percentage from sub-10% to 32%. I never even suspected.

#note JADE is the equity play but it seemed prudent to shut down the great lane on row 15 - he still has column N, but that spot will score less and give me more points.
