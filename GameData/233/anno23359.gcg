>Caesar_Jaramillo: DEFLNOS 8D FONDLES +80 80
#note Well this tournament isn't going to turn out well for me...
>Matt_: BEGILQZ J6 QI. +32 32
#note I guess I'll just wall myself in and take the equity?
>Caesar_Jaramillo: DF 7I F.D +20 100
>Matt_: BEGGLPZ E7 B.GGLE +20 52
#note Boy I sure love word games.

>Matt_: EIILPYZ D12 PILY +34 86
#note I was so unsure of this word, I'm so bad
>Caesar_Jaramillo: AEMS 8L SEAM +34 164
#note He spent a really long time here... blank?
>Matt_: EHIMPUZ 7C ZE.U +32 118
#note Missed HI(L)UM, which seems quite good. I was excited to set up another 30 next turn with the 6F spot but that just seems silly since 30 is just an average score...
>Caesar_Jaramillo: EIV 4L .IVE +15 179
>Matt_: HIIMNPT 15A PIN. +27 145
#note I felt pretty good about setting up H possibilities at 14B or holding it for 6F here. Figured Caesar would probably play at O1 most of the time. 
>Caesar_Jaramillo: ??EGIIU O8 .IsGUIdE +80 259
>Matt_: AHIMNRT 13B TH.RAM +39 184
#note I love how this play a. scores 39 points and b. opens up lines for 7s along the 14 row without allowing many easy blocks unless he's got an S. 
>Caesar_Jaramillo: NRTU 14F TURN +14 273
>Matt_: AEILNOS 12G ANISOLE +71 255
#note Whoooo nice pull, me!
>Caesar_Jaramillo: ACRX O1 CAR.X +42 315
>Matt_: DEEHNOY N2 HO.EN +47 302
#note I feel like I've probably played this "word" 10 times and still haven't learned it's no good...

#note Is it better to play BEDSTEAD for 64 to prevent AVOWS or VROWS comebacks?
