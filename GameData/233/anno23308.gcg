>Erik_Eisner: DFNOU 8D FOUND +26 26
#note Another club game!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFIIMUW E5 MIA.W +20 20
#note Best play!
>Erik_Eisner: IIRV H4 VIRI. +13 39
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEFILNU F3 CUIF +34 54
#note 2nd best play! Best play for humans. 2nd best play and catastrophic blunder for Nigel Richards. 6B LUCIFERIN for 76? I did not know that one and I know quite a few common 9's. I don't feel bad about missing that one! -38.1.
>Erik_Eisner: AAJ 6H .AJA +27 66
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEELLNN K6 .NNELLED +68 122
#note PHONY! Best valid play is 5K LEND for 14 which I strongly considered before I went for this. I really thought this was good. Erik did not even hold.
>Erik_Eisner: BINZ 12H ZIN.B +52 118
#note Maybe Erik allowed my phony because it gave him ZINEB?
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEOPRSU 10H POU.DERS +65 187
#note PHONY! Again! PROFOUND at 8A is best valid play. I really thought POULDERS was good. It is POLDERS.
>Erik_Eisner: KOU H12 .OUK +51 169
#note Not even a hold by Erik. Probably because he had this nice comeback off of the Z. Maybe he was like me and thought the last two words were good? I thought they looked convincing.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BCEIOOR O8 CO.IER +27 214
#note This was a moderate size mistake. Blocking this line is ideal. However, I don't see O4 CORBIES for 42. Mine was 13th best. Not a good turn for me. -16.5.
>Erik_Eisner: AAW D3 AWA +17 186
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ABGHOS 14F BO.GH +25 239
#note 6th best play! This was even worse than the CORBIES play! I missed BAGHOUSE at M3 and 14C and HOGBACKS at 15B. I've seen both of these words at sometime or another. L4 BAH for 31 is probably a better non bingo play than mine too but I'm not so sure. My play forks the board in a shape that would make a difference later. -18.4
>Erik_Eisner: EEGGIR 15J EGGIER +35 221
#note This is new! I shouldn't be giving Erik cheap points like this, but this was a good find by Erik.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AHLOST M4 HALiOT.S +61 300
#note This was horrible once again. My turn has a lower equity than many of the non bingo turns. I don't know how I miss LOATHERS M5 for 82 which I should have seen in 5 seconds, but I spent 5 minutes on this play. I still playing ANY bingo is right here as the board is closing down. HALIOTES is another new word, but I was off this game. 16th best play! -21.
>Erik_Eisner: ATT L3 TAT +18 239
>Jonathan_Lindh: EELNRTV K2 TEL +11 311
#note N12 NEVE for 18 is best equity play, but blocking is appropiate here as Erik is telegraphing an S. This is fine.
>Erik_Eisner: DIS N2 DIS +15 254
#note This play seemed odd to me, but Erik may have has double S's. Incorrectly scored as 15. I was also worried about a QAT setup.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EENRVXY 15A VENERY +46 357
#note Best play! This is how BOUGH affected the board shape later! This play cancels out EGGIER.
>Erik_Eisner: AA O1 AA +9 263
#note Maybe Erik missed what he was fishing for?
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEMPQRX 14B REM +20 377
#note I think it's appropiate to block here. However, I'm not sure this is right as there is a high chance I get Q or X stuck. I don't know.
>Erik_Eisner: ?ENOSTY 8A OuT..... +33 296
#note C2 STOREY for 38 is supposedly best. This may even be better I think.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIOPQTX B6 EQ.IP +23 400
#note That was a dumb endgame. EXPO for 39 at C1! I got the 2nd best play at least! -10.8 UGGH!
>Erik_Eisner: ENSY 11B SYNE +30 326
#note Erik still has YENS at B10 or SYNE or SNYE at B3 to go out if do EXPO, but EXPO was still a terrible miss.
>Erik_Eisner:  (OTX) +20 346
#note LUCIFERIN can be forgiven. CORBIES, BAGHOUSE/HOGBACKS, LOATHERS, and EXPO misses are less forgivable. Oh well, still got the W.
