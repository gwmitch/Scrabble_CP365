>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ILMTY 8H MILTY +28 28
#note A good start by Tim and I already am in trouble.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BCCINNN L4 NINN. +16 16
#note Somehow this is best. I considered trading BCNN which is 2nd best. 
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?DHIORT 9C THyROID +73 101
#note Best play for Tim!
>Jonathan_Lindh: BCCERUY K3 CUB +24 40
#note WOW! D8 CHERUB for 32! Mine was 3rd best and CUBE is better in this spot. I considered CUBE but wanted a vowel. -5.5
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AZ 10B ZA +33 134
#note CHERUB blocks this.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEELRY 11A CARLE +28 68
#note 7I YE is beest due to leave. Quackle wants to fish here? Mine is OK but I need to do EARLY in this same spot if want to play here. -10.5
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AILM A11 .LAIM +30 164
#note EARLY or YE prevents this.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGOOTWY K8 .OWY +20 88
#note J4 TOWEL is better somehow. Mine is only -4.4 back so okay!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EHIRSTW 15A .ISTHREW +101 265
#note Best play! I'm getting hammered for CARLE but in all fairness, WRITHERS is available and Tim saw WRITHERS.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGGIORT M3 GIG +19 107
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: DEO 12D ODE +15 280
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEJNORT N2 JOT +27 134
#note OOH! OBJET for 35 14H! Maybe I should keep that lane open though. Mine is best of non OBJET plays. -7.7
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ALUU 13F LUAU +8 288
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEGNNR O3 BEGAN +21 155
#note Quackle likes 7G NAB best but I like this as it opens a bingo line and cuts volatility of the triple. -8 to Quackle and 6th place, but I do again.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: FOR N6 FOR +29 317
>Jonathan_Lindh: ANRSSVX 7G NAV +27 182
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AER L10 EAR +16 333
>Jonathan_Lindh: EORSSUX 6E OXER +35 217
#note 6F XU is apparently better. I see why. EORSS is powerful and I have two lanes open. This is -7.8 and 3rd best.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EV F4 VE. +13 346
#note OXER does cause Tim to do this.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DDKPSSU 5C DUP.D +30 247
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EO 9M OE +10 356
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIKNSS 14I SKEINES +94 341
#note PHONY! Just SKEINES which I considered. Maybe I should do O9 SKEINES but that might get challenged because Tim has no snapback. I'm glad I got away with this one as no valid bingo plays.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AEEFPST O12 FE.T +33 389
#note Probably why Tim let it go.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEIOPT C3 PO.IA +18 359
#note I think this is best. Kills Tim's 28 point outs as well as QIS/STAR for 40 while setting myself to go out if Tim cannot.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?IQS 7A Qu.IS +18 407
#note Best play! Tim finds one of two outs in this spot, the other being QUASI for 18 as well. Well played endgame on both sides!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr:  (AET) +6 413
#note Score recorded as 423-359. We added an additional 10 when he played MISTHREW. I don't think this game was winnable and I kept it as close as I could but who knows? The CHERUB miss could have made a difference in the outcome.
