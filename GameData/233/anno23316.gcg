#note Missed Bingo alert! Through the N on the board. I didn't know it.
>Dan_Stock: ARX 4D RAX +43 141
>Steve_Grob: BDEOPRS 5A BORED +30 116
#note CP likes the simple BO at G1. I considered it, but being behind opted for the more dynamic play. ORBED is even more daring, but I didn't see that.
>Dan_Stock: NOR A5 .ORN +18 159
>Steve_Grob: AAEHIPS 1G HA +30 146
#note Another missed bingo, and one I should have seen: APA(T)HIES. 

There's another great play available here: SHIP(BORN)E for 57.

There are nine different 4-letter front extensions for BORN if you care to look for them.

#note Finally find a playable bingo, although OPIATES is safer.

#note Moving it down to M3 scores two more points and blocks bingos along row 10.

#note Wanted to play WOOE(R), but wasn't entirely sure it was good.

#note cp says M10 (E)JECT gives me the best chance to win, at 78 percent. Likely due to the fact I'm keeping back the case A for an ensuing hook possibility.

#note I didn't see Dan's out play.
