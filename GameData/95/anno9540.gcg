#note no As left, so I figured I'd set up points for next turn here, just incase she bingoes again.

#note So going into this game, Leesa was 5-0 + 208, I was 4-1 + 27X, and Jerry was 4-1 + 26X. I noticed that Jerry had won his game, and since Noah seemed peeved, I wasn't sure if Jerry had blown him out. So I spent a ton of time here trying to find a way to set myself up for points but not give her a chance to bingo through the T. I couldn't come up with anything. As it turned out, Jerry won by only 50. I realize this play doesn't seem very good, but I could have easily missed a playable bingo potential for her through the T (there was none), and I'm pretty much committing to Jerry not winning a blowout. I think that justifies this play. Okay that and I spent 12 minutes on it.

#note This ends up 3 better than Champ's best option, even with Leesa's optimal play.
