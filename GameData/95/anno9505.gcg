>Mike: ADHKLNS 11D KH.N +22 108

>Lorraine_Burton: GIP 10A GIP +25 134
>Mike: ADELOST 13F .SOLATED +72 180
#note not playing SOLATED G1, DIASTOLE 1 spot short of TWS, or SODALITE one spot short of DWS.  this was best
>Lorraine_Burton: EH 14I EH +36 170
>Mike: CEINNRY 12J YIN +27 207
#note this is what i get for playing this right away instead of looking harder and playing it 2 spots to the left

>Lorraine_Burton: ADDDEIO -  +0 234
>Mike: ?EEILNR 2B REvELIN. +70 333
#note among the best in the same position.  i like that this further kills an already ruined board, so she's pretty much not coming back
>Lorraine_Burton: DIJ 13A DJI. +24 258
>Mike: AAGILUU 11I GALA +29 362
#note highest scoring.  only the best hold IUU
>Lorraine_Burton: AEMT 1E MATE +32 290

>Lorraine_Burton: AWW 1A WAW +34 324
>Mike: ADEOORV 10J RAVED +39 401
#note another freakin awesome play wihch also as a result, even if she bingos to the D, she won't hit the DWS so it probably won't be enough
>Lorraine_Burton: DERR 4H ..RDER +18 342
>Mike: EFMOOPU 3L POUF +26 427
#note PROOF M3 was best.  this was next behind it.  i didn't think this was really being risky
