>Jim_Burlant: EEGHKNR 8H GREEK +30 30
#note Loath to burn both of my E's, but this rack leaves me no choice.  This is best.
>Matt_Hodge: CHIR L4 CHIR. +28 28
>Jim_Burlant: AABHNOZ J6 OB.AH +20 50
#note The only other play I seriously considered was ZOEA J6, and I saw 2 problems with that.  Besides the ABHN leave, I didn't like the potential for 10 unseen E's and 4 unseen L's to back hook it.  Q agrees that this is a better choice than ZOEA, but I whiffed on the star play:  BANZAI 6G, which scores 37 and is clearly best.
>Matt_Hodge: ADIOU K10 AUDIO +17 45
>Jim_Burlant: AGLMNQZ 14J Z.NAL +68 118
#note Bailed out of my previous mistake.  Nothing else worth consideration.
>Matt_Hodge: AEY 15H YEA +29 74
>Jim_Burlant: CGMQUVV M13 V.V +18 136
#note Yuck.  If I've got to keep this dreck and not exchange, I'd rather keep QU and get rid of the Vs.  Q says to play M12 QUAG, keeping CMVV.  Pfft.
>Matt_Hodge: ALO 15L O.AL +29 103
>Jim_Burlant: CGMOQSU 12H QUO.S +50 186
#note Q has disagreed with my in-between plays, but so far I've been benefitting.  This is best, nothing else worth considering.  I'm winning 78%, but some bingo prone tiles would be nice.
>Matt_Hodge: ENW 5K W.EN +20 123
>Jim_Burlant: ACDFGMP 14F CAM +20 206
#note Of the available choices, CHAMP 10I - which I missed - looks like the best option of a weak lot.  I saw CAMPO 6F and didn't like what it did to the board.  While this is not a terrible play,  CAMPO would have turned the extra tile, and CHAMP would have preserved the vowel - critical with this much dreck and no bingo-prone fragments in the rack.  I'm still winning 75%.
>Matt_Hodge: EFINS O1 NEIFS +47 170
>Jim_Burlant: DEEFGOP N2 OPE. +25 231
#note An aside: one of the telltale signs you're having a rough game is that, the only two times you have a pair of E's in your rack, your best play requires you to unload both of them.  Q prefers OPENED for 10 more. I had been so vowel-starved that I got too protective of my E's and didn't look for plays unloading both of them.  Hence, I didn't see OPENED.  OPENED looks right.  This is the runner up, but it gives up too much both on the scoreboard and in lack of turnover. 
>Matt_Hodge: EJNOS E10 JONES +32 202
>Jim_Burlant: DDEFGGT D11 GED +20 251
#note Or DEF.  I wanted to unload one of my G's.  If I'd known what I was going to draw, I'd have dumped the F for the extra points.  Seriously considered DEFOG 11B to clear this rack, but felt it gave up too many points for a weak leave.  Q says this or DEF are identically strong plays.  I'm still winning 61% in a short sim, but that's about to plummet.
>Matt_Hodge: ?ILNRTT H1 TuRTLIN. +77 279
#note Best bingo for Matt, who's still only winning 50%.  But that's about to go way up.
>Jim_Burlant: DFGITTT -DFGTT +0 251
#note Q prefers throwing the I back in - I wondered whether I should keep the I - but it was definitely right for me to exchange. 
>Matt_Hodge: ?IORTUW 4B OUTWRI.e +70 349
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIRST F2 RA.ITIES +62 313
#note Still alive - barely.  Short sim says I win 6% with this, the only bingo.
>Matt_Hodge: BDIL C3 B.ILD +20 369
>Jim_Burlant: EEFNOTX C12 FOX +40 353
#note How badly I needed the Y.  Matt told me post-mortem that, if I'd been able to play FOXY, this game would have been much closer.  Besides the 12-point swing in the spread, he would have been addled with the G.
>Matt_Hodge: AGM B13 MAG +37 406
>Jim_Burlant: DEENPTY 15B .YP +29 382
#note Best.  Have to block 14A TA.  
>Matt_Hodge: AEIRTU 1H .RUE +4 410
>Jim_Burlant: DEENT D7 EN +6 388
#note I can't win this game, but Championship Player indicates this or D7 ET is best.  Have to block both of his outs.
>Matt_Hodge: AIT 6B A.T +8 418
#note Best play for Matt is 10C TAJ or E3 TWA.
>Jim_Burlant: DET 10J ..TED +13 401
#note L4 CHIRKED 24 saves 1 more point of spread.  Post-mortem:  I  benefitted from missing BANZAI, so this game came down to my plays of CAM and OPEN.  My inability to manage the racks on those turns left me no margin to withstand his ensuing draws.
>Jim_Burlant:  (I) +2 403
