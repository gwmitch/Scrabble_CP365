>Jim_Burlant: AEIIRVY 8H IVY +18 18
#note Obvious choice, and best placement.  8G and 8F placements are 2 and 3-1/2 points down in a short 2-ply sim (< 500 iterations).
>Fran_Silver: ET G7 ET +13 13
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINPR F6 PA +12 30
#note Not sure why I was so worried about taking out easy front hooks on row 6.  Q prefers J8 YAP by nearly 4 points to this - looks right.
>Fran_Silver: AEILRW E7 WAILER +24 37
>Jim_Burlant: ACEGINR 10C RE.ACING +67 97
#note Best bingo - only other bingo option is CLEARING, which scores 65 at 10D.
>Fran_Silver: MOST 8A STOM. +30 67
>Jim_Burlant: EIOORUY 12B YOU. +14 111
#note Thought I might have missed a better play at the time, but there are no good options available.  This is best.  Nothing else sims within 4 points.
>Fran_Silver: HO 13B OH +25 92
>Jim_Burlant: AEIORSZ B6 ZI. +32 143
#note Best.  AZOTE B5 scores 34 and leaves IRS, but potentially opens up too much at A1.  
>Fran_Silver: AGRU C3 RUGA +21 113
>Jim_Burlant: AEORSTW 4B O.TWEARS +74 217
#note Had trouble deciding which of the anagrams was the best choice, but Championship Player agrees:  this is best, winning just under 91%.
>Fran_Silver: EGNST H10 .NGEST +27 140
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEFITU 3G FEUDIsT +94 311
#note The only row 15 plays are airballs in the low 60's.  This is best, winning 99.7%.
>Fran_Silver: BNORU 14B BOURN +40 180
>Jim_Burlant: ACEILOO 12H .OALIE +14 325
#note Bleah.  The star play is GOO 5C; I was too preoccupied with trying to do *something* to start shutting down the board.  Not sure what I was thinking here, as this doesn't really defend and it doesn't score.  This isn't one of the original kibbitzer choices, though it does sim as one of the top 5 plays.  That it sims that well is more a reflection of how limited my options are than of any strength of this play.
>Fran_Silver: IJM L1 JI.M +40 220
>Jim_Burlant: ACHOOPQ 11L QOPH +31 356
#note A little dangerous, but I figured that against this opponent I could get away with this.  One other play I considered that wasn't one of the kibbitzer choices was CHEAP M10, giving me the exclusive O back hooks on row 15.  I passed on it because I didn't like my chances of being able to play the Q if I then had to take a second turn out to play on row 15.  Q says  either this or CHEAP are best and their win percentages are practically identical.  QOPH sims with by far the best valuation of any of the possible choices.
>Fran_Silver: ADEKNSV O10 K.EDAS +45 265
#note Fran initially put down HAVEN before pulling it up and putting this down.  Play incorrectly scored as 42.
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEFNO N13 OF +23 379
#note This is best statically, but mid-pack in the sim.  I wasn't particularly concerned about Fran bingoing on row 1; I thought that if I put down JADE or JEON, it would be too easy for her to extend that down the O column with the unseen blank, so I thought that long-term that this choice would preserve more spread.  Q wants me to play JEON or JEAN.  One interesting option I didn't see was M1 OFTEN.  OFTEN is the sim bronze medalist (it concedes nearly 3 points to JEON), but it looks like the best choice given the score and the board.
>Fran_Silver: ?BEELNV -?BE +0 265
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEINX I12 .X +34 413
#note So stuck in my  "I cannot extend the J" mentality that I missed the no-brainer best play:  JINX!
>Fran_Silver: L 13G L.. +11 276
>Jim_Burlant: ACDDEIN 1L .ADE +36 449
#note Q prefers JEAN by a hair - whatever.  Everything wins 99.99%.
>Fran_Silver: ?EEENRT 6F .RETEENs +64 340
>Jim_Burlant: ACDILNN O1 .NCINA +9 458
#note Best is ANTICS M1 followed by ELAND.
>Fran_Silver: BIV H1 VI.. +21 361
>Jim_Burlant: DL K5 L.D +8 466
#note F9 DAL Scores 9.
>Jim_Burlant:  (B) +6 472
#note Final score recorded as 472 - 358.
