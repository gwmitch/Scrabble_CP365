>Jim_Burlant: ADDLRUX 8G RUDD +12 12
#note Q prefers the 8H placement by a hair.  I understand why, given that I'm sitting on the X, but my experience is that it's all too easily snuffed out by my human opponent.  This isn't far off though, and Q agrees that this wasn't the turn to play the X.
>Jeff_Reeves: BEV G6 VE.B +13 13
>Jim_Burlant: AALNOOX F9 AXONAL +35 47
#note Best.  Interestingly, AXON is only a 2-1/2 point dog in the sim; I'd have figured that, not only is the slightly vowel-heavy ALO leave nothing to write home about, but the defensive liability of this play - the E backhooks - would make AXON a much weaker choice.
>Jeff_Reeves: ?ADORRT 11E T.ReADOR +82 95
#note Best bingo for Jeff.  Of note:  TRApDOOR 11A.
>Jim_Burlant: GLOOOOS 10I LOGO +19 66
#note Nothing really good here - I didn't like what this did to the board, but I didn't see much else.  Q prefers G13 GOO by a hair.  I figured I should just turn tiles to clear this crap as quickly as possible.  I'm winning just under 27%.
>Jeff_Reeves: EJ E9 JE. +31 126
>Jim_Burlant: KNOOQSU M11 SUQ +33 99
#note Maybe I should have heeded Quackle's advice here.  Q wants me to build a rack around the QU combinations with SOOK 12L.  Too bad I only saw SOUK, SUK, and this.  This is the second straight play that I hated because of what it did to the board, but I didn't see much of an alternative.  SOOK looks right.
>Jeff_Reeves: ?EEHMOO 14B cHOE.OME +74 200
#note The legitimate bingo in this set of letters is HEMOCOEL.  Not only does Jeff's play put me down 101 points with the blanks out, but it also blocks a 45-point EVOKE.  If ever there was a situation made for desperation challenging, this was it.  After holding, my completely incorrect logic was that if he only cashed that combo of letters for 74, let him have it.  Shame on me!  
>Jim_Burlant: EEKNOOV J3 EVOKE. +24 123
#note As for this position, Q says I should take out 15G with EON.  Maybe I should have. My thinking behind this was that it was imperative to open the northeast quadrant and unload the junk, as I didn't see myself getting very far if I kept EOKV.
>Jeff_Reeves: AHT 15G HAT +37 237
>Jim_Burlant: AIINOSZ 3I Z.INS +48 171
#note Hmmm.  Q prefers N13 ION for 17.  Interesting, especially if he doesn't have an S.  I saw this and felt 48 points were just too much to turn down, AIO leave notwithstanding.  I'm winning 5%.
>Jeff_Reeves: EGGIL L3 .IGGLE +18 255
>Jim_Burlant: ABFIIOP N13 IF +21 192
#note Q prefers N12 PIA, 13I FIB, and 15C IF.  I saw them and passed - while they score decently, they don't do much for this board, which isn't going to stay alive much longer if Jeff has his way.  I have to open, Quackle be damned.  
>Jeff_Reeves: AST O13 SAT +26 281
#note As he put his down, Jeff's comment about my IF play:  "That was a very reasonable risk for you to take given the situation."
>Jim_Burlant: ADFIOPW 13I WOP +22 214
#note Missing D12 WOOF 28, which wins not quite 5%.  
>Jeff_Reeves: CIINNNR -CII +0 281
>Jim_Burlant: ABDFINR 12L B.D +29 243
#note Q prefers 15C IF by 1-1/2 points; I'm not liking my bingo chances on this board, so I might as well maximize score.  I'm back up to 11-1/2% winning chances - woo hoo!
>Jeff_Reeves: ITW C11 WIT. +20 301
>Jim_Burlant: ACFINRY 2M ICY +18 261
#note The leave is yucky due to the F, but this gives me a line he can't shut down so easily. 
>Jeff_Reeves: ERY O1 E.RY +42 343
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEFNR 6E FA.A +12 273
>Jeff_Reeves: INRU 5C RUIN +20 363
>Jim_Burlant: AEENRTT 1G ENTREAT +77 350
#note Back to 21%.
>Jeff_Reeves: EEILNNU C4 U.INE +6 369
>Jim_Burlant: ACIIMPS 3C PICAS +36 386
#note Against the computer, I concede the loss and play CAMPS or CAMPI 3A to minimize spread.  Jeff has 3 outs:  LONGE 5I 12, GLEN 6L, and the very clever LINEN 12B.  If he misses LINEN and LONGE (a long shot here, I know), this keeps MI in reserve for B6.
>Jeff_Reeves: ELN 12B L.NE. +21 390
#note Obviously, the long pole in the tent was letting the phony stick.  Do I win this game if I challenge it off?  Maybe, maybe not.  Not much else I could do about the rest of this game's progression, but you can't give away free plays like the phony.
