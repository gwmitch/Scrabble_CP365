#note I don't really love ENLIVEN, though EELNN isn't anythng to hoot about either.
>Jerry: EEEGV N6 VEGE.E +18 49
>whatnoloan: EEJLNNU 14I JU. +12 110
#note I saw the high-equity play of JUN(KI)E, but I didn't like the volatility it opened, especially after Jerry just closed stuff. I think I am probably just strapping myself too much here. Good scoring plays can let Jerry come back, while my rack is bad. What would you play here? I got a bit too controlling here.
>Jerry: HIP 10E HIP +32 81
#note Any number of similar plays just cripple me after JUN, that's why it's so bad. Maybe something JUNKIE is really best. 
>whatnoloan: EEGLNNT E10 .ENT +14 124
#note Missed (JUN)GLE, but I'm not sure why I picked this over TENGE.
>Jerry: ABHRSY 14B BRASHY +52 133
>whatnoloan: ?EGIILN C7 cLINGIE. +68 192
#note GLINtIE(R) is similar but scores more. I played too fast.

#note Again, what is my rationale for this? It didn't make sense, and CALF is clearly better.

#note I missed CO(O), really low on time at this point.
>Jerry: ?DEILSU E2 aUDILES +73 339
>whatnoloan: AACERRS 7L AR. +4 278
#note I didn't want to setup so big with AR(F), though I suppose I draw the X and come close if I do that. He can play there, but then maybe I'll get a bingo. 
>Jerry: ANOT F3 NOTA +17 356
>whatnoloan: ACEERSU 4D U.. +8 286
#note Just no idea what to do here, I couldn't come up with a viable play. So I thought about nothing for about 5 minutes.
>Jerry: ADDNOT 7H DAD +15 371
#note He played NOTA and drew NOTA, apparently!
>whatnoloan: ACEERSY A5 YER.A +10 296
#note I was so low on time that I just made a random play and went over anyway. Meh.
>Jerry: AWX B4 WAX +59 430
>whatnoloan: CEORS L3 OCRE. +14 310
#note Tried to beat the time here, but I couldn't.
>Jerry: NORT 3I TRO.N +12 442
>Jerry: NORT --  -12 430
>whatnoloan: S H7 ..S +16 326
#note -10 (time). I haven't played a game so badly in awhile. Board control is good, but I have been overdoing it a bit, perhaps.
