#note Surprising sim result.  Q says that 8H or 8D WATAP (which I didn't consider) is best, and that 8D AW comes within 1 point of that.  This comes in 1 point down on AW.
>Darrell_Day: ACINUV 7D VICUNA +26 26
#note Play incorrectly scored as 27.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEELTY D4 LEA.Y +30 46
#note Another surprising sim.  Q thinks that, between the ADELT leave vs DET and not opening up 4's starting at A8, it's worth it for me to trade the 11 scoreboard points by playing 9H YE.  The difference in the sim suggests it's stylistic preference and not really right/wrong, as YE wins by not quite 1 point at 1000+ iterations.
>Darrell_Day: EEMPRST 6I TEMPERS +71 97
#note Darrell can't bingo without slotting the 3x3; Q feels this is better at J1 for 77. 
>Jim_Burlant: DEFIOQT O6 .OFTIE +27 73
#note FISTED O4 scores 42 and wins the sim. I saw this and decided it was worth taking the chance to see if I could set up a huge Q play, as an ADIS or AANT draw could score 100+ if he didn't take the spot out.  Q docks me 4 points relative to FISTED, which says that it was worth giving up roughly 10 points on the scoreboard to set myself up.  This is the 4th best choice.  O3 FOISTED and 5J FEOD are the other standouts.
>Darrell_Day: AX -  +0 97
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: DGJOQTU M2 QUOT.D +36 109
#note SOFTIE was a nice idea but this wasn't the draw I was hoping for.  Having said that- the kibbitzer suggests a really good play I didn't see, as I was too dead set on unloading the Q:  JUDGE J2 30.  Not only does it unload most of the crap, but, since it floats the U, it practically guarantees a Q play on the next turn.  The sim says that it's style preference as to whether this or JUDGE is better, and the two plays sim identically; I think the duck is wrong, and that JUDGE should have been my play, and you'll see why in a couple of turns.
>Darrell_Day: AAAERTX N9 AX +52 149
#note When I saw this come down, I was shocked that he had challenged SOFTIE on the previous turn.  Darrell was as irritated with himself for having challenged as I was shocked.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGJNOS L4 JA.E +49 158
#note Best.  8A JOEY gives up a few too many scoreboard points for the sake of leave.  I'm 47% to win.
>Darrell_Day: EGIT N1 GITE +44 193
#note My one reservation a couple of turns back was the easy counter plays that QUOTED gave up if Darrell had an I.  This is why I think JUDGE should have been my play.
>Jim_Burlant: FGNNORS 8A FOG. +33 191
#note Not crazy about keeping duplicated N's but 33 points were too much to pass up, and I felt the S was too valuable on this board to burn it to only score 27 with FRONS 9E (the sim runner up).  Q agrees; FRONS sims 4 points down.
>Darrell_Day: WY 5C Y.W +18 211
>Jim_Burlant: NNORRSV -NORV +0 191
#note His play of YEW hurt a lot, as it blocked my intended play of ROVEN.  As for this choice - you gotta know the word to play it.  The only play worth making is a word I'd never seen:  (PAW)NOR 8G 27.  The next 7 options are all exchanges.
>Darrell_Day: ?AILMRU A8 .ILARiUM +89 300
#note The legitimate bingo in this rack is FLUIdRAM.  As for my letting  this go:  familiar with FILARIA and FILARIAL, I could have absolutely sworn that I had seen this played somewhere and checked it to be good.  I didn't even flinch when this came down.
>Jim_Burlant: DINOORS 12I INDOORS +79 270
#note Looks like I came out ahead by exchanging; if I play PAWNOR on the last turn, I'm sitting on NRSV and 3 of DIOO, so I probably don't get the bingo.  Anyway - this is best.  I seriously considered SORDINO J8 for the volatility, but felt the extra points with this choice made the game close enough that I didn't need the extra volatility.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Darrell_Day: DHNST M11 D.TH +16 316
#note Post mortem, Darrell told me that, had I playd SORDINO, he'd have played HINTS through the I, as he was saddled with 7 consonants.
>Jim_Burlant: CEIILNS 14J LIC.EN +26 296
#note My best scoring play.  This is terrible statically, but over several hundred iterations it percolates towards the top and is as good as anything else.  My thinking at the time was that if I forced him to defend row 15, this would leave rows 10, 11 or 13 open for bingos.  Maybe the sim is right - while this sims within 1/4% and 0.8 points of the best choice, Quackle gives a slight nod to short plays like HIC 14M or 14L CHI, keeping EILNS together.  
>Darrell_Day: BNSZ I11 B.Z +24 340
#note Again, Darrell had zero vowels.  All LICHEN wound up accomplishing was giving him a lifeline - now he could dump his Z and not have to worry about what I could do to him if I had an E.
>Jim_Burlant: ABHIILS 15F ALIBI +23 319
#note What we'll never know - what would my rack have been had I kept LINES together by playing short on the last turn? As for this play, I felt it was time to go for broke; maybe panic on my end, but I felt that I needed a huge play and the only chance was to hope he didn't have the K.  Q prefers C8 GHIBLI, which I didn't know, but it likes this quite a bit - this sims in the upper echelon of choices.  And, if I really luck out, a draw of NOOK to my remaining SH could ice the game.
>Darrell_Day: INOV 11A .VION +16 356
>Jim_Burlant: EHKORSU 14E UKE +35 354
#note Well, 2 out of 4 ain't great, but it's workable.  The sim is a tossup between this choice and a word I always miss, OKEH 14E. Having said that, I might have passed on OKEH had I seen it - I was dead-set on following this up with OS or OSE O1, so keeping the O was a priority with only one unseen.
>Darrell_Day: ENR 8G ...NER +27 383
>Jim_Burlant: ADHNORS O1 OS +27 381
#note Hmmm.  The two-ply sim doesn't like this at all and says I should dump off the H for 26 with HM/HAT.   I was concerned that Darrell would hit me with OSE O1, and he told me after the game that he was going to do that had I not taken the spot.  Championship Player agrees with my choice and says that either this or HM/HAT are equally strong.
>Darrell_Day: AEEGOST 9F GOES +24 407
#note This is Darrell's actual rack.  Championship Player says 10D TOGAE wins with highest valuation.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEHNR 12C sHARD +29 410
#note I can't win, but any of the 5's (sHARD, sHADE, etc.) are my best play.  Disappointing to lose this one, but this was probably the best and most enjoyable game of the day.
