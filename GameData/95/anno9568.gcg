>cesar: ACEISXZ C2 ZAX +53 180
#note dicing is an interesting move for brian after my last two plays. he told me he was bracing for a bingo and ZAX kinda confused him. the draw confused me too, but i'll take the ICES leave and 53 pts!!

>cesar: CDEITUV K3 DUCI +25 245
#note jesus christ, i guess i need to study 9s to be good. that's what this came down to. i get ADDUCTIVE down and my chances of winning are definitely big. (-51.5) I DID GET MY BINGO AFTER ALL.

>cesar: ABEEEET 7A BEE. +15 280
#note i'm pretty sure i need to bite the bullet and do 8L BEET. a moment of lost focus here that basically makes my chances of winning near zero. (-2.5) but probably much much worse than that. i kind of realized i wasn't going to win.

#note 4J MUMBLE! but 8L PEEL is betterest. i'm not sure what quackle is doing. (-3.5%)
>brian: ?AEFRSS O3 FEARl.SS +61 407
#note and freesias would ahve gone down if i'd done mumble. wasn't my game after missing ADDUCTIVE.
