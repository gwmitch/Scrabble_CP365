#note this is something i call dumbfense, it's not quite defense, or it's defense done badly, or something. D11 NAIVE sims best, which is kind of nuts, so i'm not sure what to do. i went for leave, but maybe i need points. (-6)

#note two choices that do two very different things sim at the top here; 11 QI and 10D EFFS. i thought about dropping the S, but was worried that it may leave him with the case. still, it's 15 more points! (-7.5)

#note i spent a lot of time on this move and in the end i'm not sure what the best play is. i decided to go for points; this time, i need to catch up. i am not a big fan of 13K NIM. i guess i still have XIS, and it may limit his scoring options a bit, but i'm likely going to be down after the next turn. how do i better think about this move? (-7.5)
>will: ADGO M9 DOG.A +22 398
>cesar: CIIINNO N6 INION +16 401
#note my chances of winning are rotten here.. and actually, this is a good case for NIM over MAXIS. DOGMA scores like nothing but pretty much any score at that point would give me a low chance of winning unless i drew something awesome after MAXIS. NISX is a better leave which may be what i needed. in any case, this move was interesting. first off, i disagree with K3 NORI; whatever bingo or move i may draw will be blocked by him, so the simmer is wrong there because it uses the static evaluator. H10 NIB scores too little and also goes for the bingo. maybe i get something like INCISION. my thought about the move was the following: i need both the T and the S to win, and possibly other things to go right too. additionally it will be hard to vertically overlap at O8 as only the N goes there (if i draw the T and the S). so it limits his scoring. if i don't draw the T and the S i'm lost, so might as well assume i have drawn them. also, INION could serve as a distraction if i draw them.
