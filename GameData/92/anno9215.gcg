>Jim_Burlant: ACDELRU 8G CUD +12 12
#note Hmm.  Ran this sim twice.  First time this choice came out a 4  or 5-point dog to CAULD 8d.  Second time this won the 2-ply sim.
>Cecelia_Le: ?AEMNTU 7H MANTEaU +67 67
#note Play incorrectly scored as 64.

>Jim_Burlant: AAEMORT 6M AM +21 115
#note Q prefers H1 AMEBA by a hair and docks me a handful of points.  If I was going to play at 6M, I probably should have played the other A off as well.  Not sure why I was so tight with it.  Then again, this did work out even ifthis play wasn't quite right.
>Cecelia_Le: ADINOTY 10G NODA.ITY +72 165
>Jim_Burlant: AELORTU 5B TORULAE +68 183
#note Or at 11B - either one is as good as the either in Quackle's eyes.
>Cecelia_Le: BGRU 3L BURG +21 186
>Jim_Burlant: ?CGIOPV D1 VIGO. +26 209
#note Clears out the junky V and G, and maximizes score at the time - clearly best.
>Cecelia_Le: DEENP H10 .PENED +30 216
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACDIPS 14B CAPSIz.D +78 287
#note Any number of really cool plays available here.  14G PERACIDS, PEDICABS, 14B SPADICES or SPICATED.  I chose this because I liked that, by placing the C at 14B, it eliminated any potential comebacks at 15A.  Sim prefers 14B SPADICES by roughly 1 point.  <<shrugs>>
>Cecelia_Le: OVW 3G VOW +31 247
>Jim_Burlant: EFHNORR B2 FRO.H +38 325
#note Three plays stand out here:  this choice, FROTHER, and FORTH, all at B2.  Sim says the difference is really stylistic preference more than anything else
>Cecelia_Le: IQ A1 QI +38 285
>Jim_Burlant: AENNRWX A6 ANNEX +41 366
#note If you don't know my rack, this looks like a terrific play.  While 41 is nothing to sneeze at, I missed an even better play on the east side of the board:  WAXEN O6 scores 66 and is clearly best.
>Cecelia_Le: EGIO 1D .OGIE +27 312
>Jim_Burlant: EIRSTWZ O1 ZI. +39 405
#note Very tempted to play WIZES E10 to take out the easiest bingo line, but the one problem with that is that if she bingos for big points on row 15, I may find myself in an unwinnable end game depending on the draw so maybe it's better to leave this open in case we both have bingos?  I dunno.  Q says that this choice is best, but I'm not so sure.  Regardless of whether or not Quackle is right, this is one of two factors that conspired to make my next turn much more difficult than it otherwise should have been.

#note You have to know the bingo to play it, and I had no clue there was an 8 to the S in this rack. TROUSER is good, TROUSERS (of course) is good, and TROWSERS...but no TROWSER*.  And this is so low in probabiilty (> 15000) I wouldn't have seen it in study yet.   If I know TROWSERS, this is a no-brainer.  Since I didn't know it this was a tricky position.  I have a nice lead, but Cecelia has done an excellent job of hanging around and I can't just mindlessly move tiles to end the game.   I saw two possible threats:   a SATINE bingo to the S down the E column (AEEINST, AEHINST, AEINOST) , and another possible rack is EIKNOSS.  The latter would result in DOESKINS on row 15 for 107 and clinch the game.  TOWERS M11 certainly blocks, but if I guess wrong and she has AEHINST, I've just emptied the bag and she bingos out to win that way.  Of course, if I'd played defense with WIZES on the previous turn I'd just play from  M10 to block rows 12, 13, and 15.  Anyway - I had to figure out a way to block the biggest threat, take the bag down to 1  and make sure that if she did bingo down the E column, I could still have enough scoring to hopefully pull out an end game.

#note Looks like I'm not the only one who didn't see O column plays.  HISN O5 is Cecelia's best play.
