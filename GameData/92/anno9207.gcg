>Quinne: EEIMOPS H3 EPISOME +78 78
#note I was a little hazy on EPISOME, but knew EPISOMAL was good for sure, so this made sense as the noun. Best.
>Darkwing: ?DEFLOO G3 FOLiOED +95 95
#note Crap.
>Quinne: ?DEEINY I7 NEEDIlY +80 158
#note I saw YEEDINg# pretty fast, but looked for a while for something more defensive before remembering the anagram of DYELINE#. Best.
>Darkwing: AAEERTU I2 AUE +16 111
>Quinne: IKLOOTX J1 OX +50 208
#note Straightforward and best.
>Darkwing: AAAEERT H12 AA +10 121
>Quinne: EIIKLOT 2I ..LIKE +34 242
#note A sim prefers F8 TIKI by about a point. I concede the leave is better. Nothing else is close. Static evaluator has the hilarious G13 KOI in first. Either way, the duck says my winning percentage is above 92% now.
>Darkwing: AEEHNRT K2 .EATHERN +72 193
#note This only cuts it to 84%.
>Quinne: AIOORTU M2 .OUROI +22 264
#note Easily best in an array of bad choices.
>Darkwing: AAGPRTW 13C PARTW.. +38 231
>Quinne: AGNNTTV D12 V.NT +16 280
#note Another crap draw has my winning percentage down to 72%. One might not want to be this risky with a small lead, but there aren't any other choices. This at least gives me two spots to bingo, through the T and hooking (A)VANT, and a decent leave to do it. Best.
>Darkwing: ACDEGIV 11C VAGI +24 255
>Quinne: AEGNORT 15B TE.RAGON +77 357
#note Sweet! This placement is clearly preferable, as it doesn't open a hotspot at 14J. Quackle claims my winning percentage is now 96%.
>Darkwing: CDEEIMS N7 DECIMES +67 322
#note Ouch. Well, Quackle still only thinks it has a 9% chance to win, but it hasn't seem my rack.
>Quinne: BGILNNZ 12K ZIN.B +38 395
#note Oops, I've got no reasonable blocks of O3-O8. The good news is that all the Es (IDE#) are gone, as are two esses. But Quackle could still have something like QUASH or QUIST#. All I can do here is try to score. I'm pegged at an 88% chance after making my best play.
>Darkwing: DIQRSTU O4 QUIST +82 404
#note Oh no!!! Worse still, even if I could have blocked, Quackle has a 75-point play on the other side of the board that I completely missed (see if you can spot it.) The duck retakes the lead and now has a 36% shot at victory.
>Quinne: ACGLNTW L9 ACT.NG +11 406
#note My bad rack means most conventional plays are now poor shots to win. My eyes were drawn to the F column -- I've got LW, and there's a J in the pool, so there's the potential for W(I)L(T)J(A)# for 40, a huge blow on this board. I could play W(I)L(T) to set up an even huger JA or JO overlap, but the duck has a good chance to hit that too. If I'm going to set that up, it may be better to do it once I know opp doesn't have the J or an I to block it. I decide to fish off all my tiles except LW with ACTING -- I'd prefer to keep A, but I can't. This gives 5 chances for the J, but also 5 chances to S-hook ACTINGS, in case WILTJA gets busted. I'm also creating another J spot at 14J for the same contingency. In many ply, this comes second to GANTL(OPE) 4B, but I don't want to play that -- I want order, not chaos, in the pre-endgame against speedy player.
>Darkwing: ABDFLOR 3M .F +10 414
#note Static suck. The two best plays -- F10 B1 and 10E AB -- both block WILTJA. This standard effort to avoid emptying the bag knocks the duck's winning chances from 71% to 30%.
>Quinne: HJLRSUW F10 W.L.J. +40 446
#note I have to go ahead and take WILTJA -- I can no longer set myself up, not having drawn a replacement vowel. The sim bizarrely recommends I play HU(G) first, presumably deigning not to block me. But I'm not going to take the chance.
>Darkwing: ABDILOR 5C BAIL.. +16 430
#note The duck can't win now. This order at least keeps me from blocking an outplay, not that I would have seen it as I didn't know this word.
>Quinne: HRSUY 6A SHY +24 470
#note I did the math wrong -- SHY at 15L to block BORD is two points better than blocking ROD. But having somehow won this game I'm beyond caring.
>Darkwing: DOR O12 .ORD +23 453
>Darkwing:  (RU) +4 457
