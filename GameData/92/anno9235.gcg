>Jim_Burlant: AEINOTY 8G YO +10 10
#note Interesting dilemma - play long with ATONY or short with this rack?  I opted to play short, and the sim says it's the right choice - either this or OY 8H are the best plays.
>Chris_Cree: CDEOU 9C COUDE +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIKNT 7A bEATNIK +81 91
#note Many better choices than this, specifically ANTINUKE on the 2x2 for 94, which I'd have never found.  7G KYANITE is also a better choice.
>Chris_Cree: AEW 6B WAE +31 49
>Jim_Burlant: AHILRWY 5D WHY +30 121
#note Not bad, but again there were better choices, most notably A7 BRAWLY, which I missed.  I should have turned more of this rack with WHIRLY if I was going to play at 5D.  This is the bronze medalist.
>Chris_Cree: ?EEHIMO A7 .OEHMItE +86 135
#note Fantastic find!  This is the only bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEILRR B13 AR +9 130
#note No really good options - plays like EARLIER break up too much of this promising rack for nothing and still give back way more than they get.  Sim likes 14A EARLIER, with this choice roughly 4 points down.
>Chris_Cree: ASV C13 VAS +25 160
>Jim_Burlant: AEILPRX 15C .PIRAL +33 163
#note Sim results indicate this is a very strong choice but there was a better one I missed:  DIPLEX F9.  This is roughly 1 point down on DIPLEX, and  nothing else comes within 3 points of this.  
>Chris_Cree: IJNO 5A JO +15 175
#note Chris initially put down JOIN I5, picked it up, debated about whether he should exchange, and eventually put this down.  Too bad he didn't stick with JOIN - would have made it a lot easier for me to make my next play.
>Jim_Burlant: AELORTX C9 .OX +12 175
#note Q prefers the 4F placement, which I considered but rejected as reckless -  both if it gave him somewhere to bingo for huge points or if he could back hook it with an H1 play.  This is second best in the sim and everything else finishes a few points down on this.
>Chris_Cree: INQ E14 Q. +11 186
#note Just lighting it up here - a rather unusual game - how many times do you see QXJ played for a total of 38 points between them?  
>Jim_Burlant: AELRTTU D11 UT +13 188
#note Right after I hit the clock, I realized I'd played this rack too quickly and hadn't looked hard enough to find the bingo.  TUTELAR plays at I7 for 66, and this had me concerned. You just can't make mistakes like this against players of Chris's caliber and expect to get away with it.
>Chris_Cree: GINOZ I6 GINZO +32 218
#note Small consolation:  if I play TUTELAR he still has GINZO for 37 at J3.
>Jim_Burlant: AEFGLRT J10 FLAG +29 217
#note Missing a bunch of better plays as I'm too busy grooming the rack. J9 AFT is best.  Surprisingly, this sims only 2-1/2 points down despite giving up 9 on the scoreboard, such is the strength of the ERT leave compared to the EGLR leave.
>Chris_Cree: DILR 12H DR.IL +16 234
>Jim_Burlant: ABEELRT 4F BLEATER +77 294
#note Was able to relax when I saw this rack; had he screwed up row 4, I'd have still had RATEABLE on row 12.  This is the only playable bingo, and it wins 81% in a short sim (250 iterations or so).
>Chris_Cree: ADEO 3C ODEA +18 252
>Jim_Burlant: BFGIRTT 2F GRIFT +29 323
#note Debated between this and BRITT and figured that it would be better to unload the G and take the 3-point hit on the scoreboard.  This is a marginally conflicted sim - BRITT 2F wins 1/2% more often than this, but sims 0.6 points down.  K3 BEFIT is also a decent choice but I felt that it both gave up a little too much on the scoreboard, and also didn't turn the extra tile - essential with SSS still unseen.
>Chris_Cree: EM 1H ME +29 281
>Jim_Burlant: ABENSTV M10 VEST +21 344
#note This position illustrates one common criticism of Quackle in that, at times, it is not defensive enough.    Quackle's preferences are BOEHMITES for 36, and M2 VESTA, and at a different stage of the game those are sound choices.  Problem is,  Chris's play of ME suggested he was closing in on something, and my first priority was to control the board.  I couldn't shut all of his lanes down, but I could limit where he could play.  By putting down VEST, I've made it impossible for him to hit row 14 if he doesn't have 2 S's.  (Not that I knew this at the time, but a check of Zyzzyva shows the only bingo he can play on row 14 from this pool is TENSORS). If he hits the M column as I expect him to, anything he puts down is going to have to give me something back either at O1 or O8.    As for why I played VEST instead of VAST - no A's left in the pool, and 2 E's are unseen.  I'll take my chances that I can land an E.
>Chris_Cree: CEIINOS M2 EOSINIC +80 361
#note Best bingo for Chris (other optiion being L2 SORICINE).  He's ostensibly winning 49% in a short sim, but his next rack reduces those chances to 0.
>Jim_Burlant: ABDENPS 8K PA.ED +33 377
#note BECAP scores 36.  Whatever.  Everything wins 100%.
>Chris_Cree: INNRTUU N5 TUN.R +15 376
>Jim_Burlant: BNS 2L N.BS +12 389
#note Should have milked spread with NEB or BEN, then BOEHMITES for 36.  This punts spread.
>Jim_Burlant:  (INU) +6 395
