#note this is where i lost the game. something about the way he was acting and playing made me think he had the -S. i knew i shouldn't open up the stupid triple lane, but i couldn't fiture out what else i wanted to do. this is second to GOX N1 in sim.

#note Tthis was so hard. vaw for 13 at 7c or or vim for 26 at I9. vaw blocks off the B lane, doesn't feel like i can draw that many bingos, and gives up points. vim blocks off the lane through the U, gives me more shots at drawing an A to let me play in that B lane, and scores more.

#note where did joel horn get all this excellent board vision? it's killing me.
>k8: AENNRST B1 NA +12 265
#note i want to play an N and make a lane, but there's no way to do that. q says fish off the N without making a lane, and i guess hope i draw U for bingos in both spots (urbanest/centaurs).
