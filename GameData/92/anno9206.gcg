>cesar: ?ABEPRY J6 BE.RY +36 42
#note i didn't think it was possible to miss three thousand bingos in a turn, but i was proven wrong here! OPERABlY/PAsSERBY are words i should be able to find. will i ever regain focus? STUPID HUMORISTS. (-26)

>cesar: ?AAALPR 4D PALAbRA. +68 110
#note i found the lowest-scoring, but coolest bingo. (-1.5) it means 'word', rolando told me.

>cesar: AEELMNU K10 EMU +15 188
#note after LOW, it seems right to either try to block, or set up a scoring spot. there's a hard-to-block lane at N, and the L, and maybe LOWE, so it seemed ineffective.

#note it's annoying becuase he's going to score three thousand million off of the R

#note this should telegraph the other S. i had MISTRACKED HERE and thought he just got rid of the case S!

>cesar: ABDDEOX C9 B.AED +39 358
#note some cool moves here. N1 ABODED (which is never gonna stay, so shut up quackle...) and BOX absolutely never occurred to me. i just thought of BOXED. i'm still a severe underdog. (-4.5%)
>rolando: FIST 11E FIST +40 419
#note OH THERE'S AN S OUT????? actually, i realized it during the inevitable retracking i had to do.
>cesar: ACDNOUX N2 COAX +35 393
#note i am extremely disappointed in my play here. first of all, i should try to force a win any way i can. i even thought of baiting him into BEVIL* but it didn't occur to me that i could play COXA then instead of COAX! he said he would have played BEVIL if i'd played COXA!! ARGH!! (-25) for not playing BEAU which is cute, i guess.
