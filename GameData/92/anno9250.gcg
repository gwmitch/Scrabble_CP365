#note i had no recollection of this word at the time. about three turns later, i came up with the definition in my head. oh well.

#note hard choice. EX for two more points leaving the 3x3? DEX? NIX? PREBIND? quackle thinkgs BRED is better than BINR by enough to make it the preferred play even tho it scores 3 less.

>k8: BDINRTU E6 TURBIN.D +72 270
#note i need points. but i scored this as 76. so now the score is actually 2 less for monk, and 4 less for me than what we have recorded.

>k8: DEELSSU O7 DE +18 288
#note this is a totally pathetic play. there is nothing left that threatens to score in this spot, there is a blank unseen, and i am behind - i need points. SEDUM F8 is so pretty.
>monk: EILOU D2 LOUIE +12 303
>k8: CDELSSU 2B CU.LED +22 310
#note not a great setup, but seemed interesting enough to give up the 4 points and play the word here instead of one over.

#note so in the game situation, the score is 400-411 after this. this play wins. i have like 15 minutes left, and i've found this, and figure it's fine. win by 1. phew. logically, i should spend part of this 15 minutes recounting to make sure this is true. but i'm already gibsonized, and it's the last game. i actually have two winning plays with the real score. it's reasonably likely that i would've found them. maybe. on a good day.
>monk: ?NRRSTV 14J Ve.RS +30 428
#note so instead, i wait until it's monkey's turn, and while i wait for her to figure it out, i recount the game. i find her scoring error, tell her (yay, i win by more!). but then i find mine. (oops! i lose!) - i tell her that, too, and she goes out and we laugh for a good couple minutes. and then i buy her dinner, because that was the agreement after this crazy best of six monkey vs me.
