#note hard. felt like i should try to conserve the Y because it scored well in a bunch of places. but, also like i should block the bottom hook to impaste. but also i only thought of impastes and not impasted. if i had considered that, maybe i would've played soy? but then dhows scores so much at 2J, and i don't have a great comeback after it, so that's why i chose this. it's fifth best in sim. based on what was actually in the bag, i think i was gonna lose regardless, but those of you who are good at endgame can prove me wrong.
