#note Playing David, I decided on this over RAFT and AFT because this one spread out the bingo lanes.  An underlap play on AFT gives him an easy chance to score and control how the board is laid out, where this might make him have to choose one side or the other.  Q likes AFT for the leave and FLARE(UP) which I did not see.

#note Missed TATE and didn't see LAZARET so no bingoes for Brett.  :o(  Knew it was going to happen, but I had the cool LATERAD quadruple underlap til he blocked it.
>David_G: BL E5 BL.. +12 87
>Brett_H: ?AEILRU 5C RE.UrIAL +59 132
#note There is one bingo from the B, which I missed for some reason.  Another miss with the blank as a power tile.  hmmm...   I did like the diverse scoring potential left after this play.
>David_G: ALORV 12J VOLAR +31 118
#note Takes the Y, but nothing else.
>Brett_H: BCEEIMT 13K BITE +32 164
#note I liked the leave here better, but Quack perfers TIME.  Maybe because of the very good potential of drawing an I for a BICE underlap.
>David_G: DENS 14K SNED +37 155
#note He said he passed up a bingo for this.  He had the blank and did not want to open the triple lane.
>Brett_H: CEMNVWX 4B MEW +28 192
#note This is where my barin started to hurt.  The whole rest of the game is crazy hard.  Quackle agrees here.  No rush to play off the X.  If I draw an O I have VOX or COX down low-left, or OX to the bottom right triple.  If I draw the I, I have NIX.  An A or E still give me AX/EX for 35 up top.  Plus Cs and Vs could be useful for board control late.

#note best, but every other play suggested is an exchange.  Really want an O at this point and there are 6 unseen.
>David_G: ?ADENSS K3 dESANDS +84 283
>Brett_H: ACKNRVX 8K .RANK +33 247
#note still 6 Os out and now 2 places for good X plays.  turnover and hope for the best.
>David_G: DHOO L1 HOOD +31 314
>Brett_H: CGISVWX 1K W.IGS +36 283
#note I am holding the case S so the SMEW hook isn't as much of a threat as the H.  play WHIGS, get points, hope he tries to block elsewhere and I get one of those damn Os.  Also an E for (S)EX or EX/REDE would be good and a U is an OK consolation prize for XU/UDO.
>David_G: CGIOO N4 COOI.G +11 325
#note He blocks my XE(N)IC with this.

#note Quackle says play off one, but I don't have a winning option.  I considered trying to play AN setting up a possible UVEITIC, but he would just shut it down and score more.  Hoping for the out in 2 here.  Q says AVE has a 5.56% chance of winning.  Yeah right.
