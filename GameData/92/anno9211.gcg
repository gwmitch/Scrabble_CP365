>Jesse_Matthews: AAJNN 8D JNANA +40 40
>Jim_Burlant: AIQRTUU E5 QUI.TAR +64 64
#note How sweet it would have been to have had an E instead of a U, but hey, this still ain't bad.  This is the star play; the next best play sims over 20 points down.
>Jesse_Matthews: EGL F10 GEL +17 57
>Jim_Burlant: ABEIRUW D10 WAB +26 90
#note Bad miss - JABIRU D8 scores 41.   Didn't even occur to me to consider plays that didn't unload the W.  This is decent, but much better plays were available.  
>Jesse_Matthews: CFLORRT -CFLOR +0 57
>Jim_Burlant: EEIORSU 5E .UERIES +32 122
#note Best.  The other choices give up way too many points on the scoreboard.
>Jesse_Matthews: EIKLNR 4J RELINK +34 91
>Jim_Burlant: CDDIOOP O1 POC. +36 158
#note Best play is KIDDO O4; not sure how I missed that.  Runner up is an interesting play I'd never find, a non-bingo 7 of DIPODIC for 36.  This scores well, but the leave is iffy.
>Jesse_Matthews: AINPV C11 PAVIN +30 121
>Jim_Burlant: ADDIIOU 2K AUDI. +12 170
#note From the standpoint of leave AUDIO 3G is best.  I took a couple of minutes on this turn before choosing this.  I figured Quackle wouldn't like this, but I had my reasons.  Without a good play on row 15 (I didn't see DANIO and might have passed on it even if I had because of the DIU leave) I felt I needed another triple where I could score after Jesse probably came back for 30+ on row 15.  Q prefers AUDIO 3G.  Anyway -  perhaps sensing a threat I didn't have, Jesse responded very defensively, which prevented me from getting burned.
>Jesse_Matthews: AOTT H1 OTTA. +18 139
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEGIOO B5 GOODIEs +68 238
#note There is nothing on row 15, and this is best.  Only other bingo options are 9H GOODIEs/bOOGIED and 7H bOOGIED.
>Jesse_Matthews: ALMS A6 SLAM +35 174
>Jim_Burlant: ?BIMSTY 15A TI.Y +33 271
#note I figured I might have missed something with this rack - SYMBIOT plays at I8 for 80, but it turns out that Quackle likes my choice a lot  - Championship Player says this choice has the highest valuation and only wins 0.2% less often than the bingo.   
>Jesse_Matthews: X 14B X. +36 210
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEEFMS 6D B.MF +32 303
#note Best.
>Jesse_Matthews: TUZ 12F .UTZ +14 224
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEIRS 3A wEARIES. +66 369
#note Confusing the blank W with a real W caused me to think this was safer.  In other words, I kept thinking that if he had OFT in his rack, he'd come back for 39 instead of 27.  Whoops.    
>Jesse_Matthews: DOW D1 WO.D +24 248
>Jim_Burlant: GHILNOT 1A GLO. +24 393
#note Saw LOATHING, couldn't remember if the 7 was LOTHING* or THOLING, so opted for safety.   7H or 9H tholing is obviously best.
