>Matt: EEIKMNO 8D KOINE +28 28
#note Glad to get an easy rack to start off against Gibson. This is the clear choice.  
>David: ELVW E7 V.WEL +22 22
>Matt: AEEGIMO F10 MOA +23 51
#note Nothing looked spectacular here, so I decided to kill the hotspot.  MAE doesn't take as many back hooks, so that might be better than MOA.
>David: BIRTU 13B BRUIT +20 42
#note Could've been worse.
>Matt: EEGIIUW G5 WIE.IE +16 67
#note Ugly rack, and was going to exchange until I spotted this.  David complimented the play.  This sims ahead of all the exchanges, even though GU is ugly.
>David: EILOV H1 OLIVE +41 83
>Matt: EFGRSUY B10 RUG.Y +26 93
#note GULFY 2F gets rid of all the junk for 2 points less than my play.  RUGBY is definitely more volatile, which will probably be more useful to me against David.  
>David: AHORT F2 TORAH +37 120
#note Big back-to-back turns here put me on the spot...if he bingoes soon I'll be in big trouble.
>Matt: AEFINOS A7 FANO +23 116
#note I'm trading one bingo lane for another, but this allows me to end a bingo in ES.  KAF 24 is the star play
>David: DFL 5D FL...D +26 146
>Matt: ?EIISUY -IUY +0 116
#note There aren't many I's left now, so I don't mind keeping one on my rack.  I wanted to bingo ASAP while the board was still in decent shape.
>David: AHLO 4A HALO +32 178
>Matt: ?EEINST B1 bET.INES +75 191
#note Several bingoes score 75, plus ONErIEST at 74.  I liked this one best since it obstructed the A1 spot.  It's possible he could get IbEX, but more likely is something like JOSH or CAPH.  David also liked this play for that reason, as opposed to bingoes hooking KOINE.  VEINIEST and the like are too volatile at this juncture.  
>David: BEJ D12 J.BE +28 206
>Matt: ADEGPRT 1G P.RTAGED +64 255
#note I was disappointed there was no E to play through for PARGETED, then remembered that PORTAGE took a D and was happy.
>David: OX A14 OX +32 238
#note Must be missing either an I or E, thankfully.
>Matt: AEIRSUZ 15C S.IZURE +48 303
#note No N for SUZERAIN.  Debated between SEIZURE, RESIZE, and GAUZIER.  Decided that SEIZURE was worth the points and the bingo lane it created.  The duck agrees, this is clear of everything else by at least 9 points in the 2-ply sim. 
>David: ACEMNSU J9 ACUMENS +86 324
#note He originally played this at 14I for the same score, then thought better of floating an S in the triple lane.
>Matt: ?ACDGSY 11I G.Y +14 317
#note Thought CADGY looked familiar but didn't want to risk losing a turn at this juncture. I wanted to leverage my blank and S towards a bingo.  Quackle says CADGY wins about 88% while this is at 75%.  Also considered EDGY to ditch another cosonant, but thought that actually devalued my S on this board.  
>David: AIINRTT 4H .ITRAIN +23 347
#note An unusual play for David here, the rack is real.  After my play of GUY, he deduced I had at least the S, if not the blank as well.  He was concerned about unduplicating the T's and blocking bingoes ending in S.   We spotted VITTA later; that does the same job but leaves one in the bag, and doesn't provide an S hook itself.  Quackle likes MATIN best.  This ended up being a worst case scenario for him.
>Matt: ?AACDOS O4 SCAlADO +92 409
#note Best and only (can be played at 6I as well).  If he plays VITTA though I can probably out run him with COMAS 12I for 32.  Even if I draw the Q, I keep AD? and there are plenty of places to ditch it.  It becomes a lot closer but I think I can still pull out a win.  Honestly, I saw COlADAS first, and didn't anagram it correctly until he was putting down VITRAIN.  Crazy game.
>Matt:  (DENPQT) +36 445
#note Missed a point when counting SCAlADO, final score recorded as 444-347.
