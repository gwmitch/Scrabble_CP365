>george: IIIII -IIIII +0 0
>hecky: DEEENUZ 8G ZEE +24 24
#note Quackle agrees. Something like ENDUE or UNDEE would clean up the rack fully, but -DENU isn't the worse save, four unique letters that have some synergy.
>george: AGMPRS J3 GRAMPS +30 30
#note I asked CP on this six-tile rack and it suggested GAM 9F, then ARM 9G. If I assume the extra tile was a second S, it goes with GAMS 9F or PAMS 9F. If the tile was a second R, it opts for ARM 9G and GRAM 9E. 

One thing I do like doing in games, especially early, is playing what I call "Ubeika Scrabble" - don't get too hung up on esses and bingos and remember it's a game about points above all else. Bingos will come. Don't get too fishy. Yap, yap, yap. 
>hecky: DENNUUW K5 DUE +22 46
#note I flushed about four WP pounts and nine valuation points here; several better choices. UNDREW 4G wins the sim, something I saw but was unsure on. Didn't see UNAWED 5H, which is another good way out of this mess. I considered UNDUE H4. Those first two plays are clearly the way out.
>george: APY 9E PYA +21 51
>hecky: ANNNRUW -UNNW +0 46
#note Lazy turn. UNWRAP E4 and GNAWN 3J are perfectly acceptable. I need to be more patient with this sort of rack. 
>george: AFIL 10B FILA +19 70
>hecky: AINRRST 3C STARRIN. +72 118
#note RESTRAIN at H7 is just suicidal. STARRING wins 63 percent of the time. 
>george: AEHSV 8A HAVES +41 111
#note Looking at the incomplete rack, there are a lot of choices: HAVE 11E, SHIVE H1, HAVES 8A, SHIVA H1 and SHIV H1. I think I prefer HAVE downstairs over HAVES without a second S, but with a dup that could change things.
>hecky: ILNOOUU 11D ONO +20 138
#note Earlier I exchanged when I should have played through; here, Quackle says, definitely, exchange now. I guess I worried too much about that 11E hot spot. I also considered NOLO but couldn't remember if it was good. Briefly considered FOLIO B10 and OLIO L2 (rack to the F). Another mediocre play here. 
>george: DEGGMOS 12B MOG +20 131
#note Two good spots for MOGGED, L4 and 12B, both scoring 40. I forget the SPANG hook. I also forget what MOG meant, it's a verb. MOG also scores 26 at 12C. 
>hecky: BIILUUU -BIILUUU +0 138
#note Miraculously, there's one good play here, one legitimate on-board play, before the parade of exchanges comes raining down. CP recommends keeping the B on the exchange, for some reason. I'll put the ridiculous play on the next frame. If you can find it, you're a lot better than I am. 
>george: ?DDEGRS 13C DoDGERS +82 213
#note The bingos from the L2, L3 and L4 are are a little better, scoring a couple of extra points and offering less counterplay. Also, DoDGERS at 13C was misscored as 84, not 82, fwiw. 

As for my last rack: Quackle sats (F)U(M)ULI at B10 for 22 is the way out, scoring 22 and drawing to BIU. Board is super-volatile after it, but that's what it says.
>hecky: ACDJORU H11 JU.OR +39 177
#note Quackle agrees. Seems logical (obvious really), score, get some picks, dump the J, park the R in a good lane, good save, etc. I'm still a 4-to-1 dog in this spot, though.
>george: FILOO L1 FOLIO +28 241
>hecky: ACDNTUY H1 DA.NTY +33 210
#note Not a bad play, but there are better ones. ACIDY H1 is CP's pick (didn't see it), followed by UNITY in the same spot (I wanted to go longer). I saw JANTY but didn't see JAUNTY, which looks good too. Still need some breaks to win, WP around 17 now.
>george: CEHV D1 VE.CH +34 275
>hecky: ACEIITU 1L .UCI +27 237
#note I insta-played this when I saw it. The second chouce is JUICE 11H, though FUCI wins the sim. I need more lines open, even with the extra vowel in the leave.
>george: AAEEIIO -IIAAEEO +0 275
#note Well, there's a break for Michigan (not sure what you had here). But I'm also concerned that Ohio is pulling seven in a bag that still has the blank.
>hecky: AABEITX E5 AX +28 265
#note The X is such a timing letter - generally you love it, but not now. Hate that I can't shed the B as well in this turn. Felt AX E5 (which wins the sim) would likely lead to an I graft later, with all of them left. 

The sim's second choice is interesting, BATHE 5A (sets up giant X that's already in-house). But that's too suspicious looking with a human on the other side. Quackle, forever on the offense, won't make the inference. I wonder what you do next turn, given that you're bingo is going down. I suppose you have to let the X go, let the chips fall where they may. 
>george: ?AEIORT 15A AnTERIO. +74 349
#note Cesar would like you to kindly play AEROLITH A1 (tough find, no doubt). Silly to consider JAROSITE 11H. ANTERIOR should end the game, barring some crazy ending. WP's now in high 90s.
>hecky: BEI 11H .IBE +26 291
#note I don't know why I didn't see JIBB, though JIBE wins the sim easily, anyway.
>george: ITW F5 WIT +28 377
#note There's the X graft.
>hecky: ABENNOT 10I BAN +19 310
#note I decided to go for a Q stick here. If I cover the I and maybe draw the U on the pick, there's a chance, right? I don't know.

And get this - I actually have a bingo this turn. It's a sweet fine and a word I don't know. Freaking sweet though. If I bingo, I've got a 1-in-4 chance to win, says the duck.
>george: EL 7A EL +9 386
#note Looks like you're blocking QUA. Wish you drew the Q, hoser. 

Bingo last turn - BUTANONE 12G. Look at that fit, that's obscene. I need to see those spots as possible, too often I don't - even for a shorter word. 
>hecky: EINQU N1 .INQUE +38 348
#note Quackle prefers QUIET 2A (saw it) and COQUET N1 (didn't) to CINQUE. One of the pitfalls to CINQUE is that it opens up potential for an easy-hooking outbingo. With a pool of EEILKNTW, NETLIKE ane TWINKLE are both possible; a 3-in-8 chance (the bingo plays if I open the spot and the W is in the bag, or either E.)
>george: EEIKLNT 1A KEL.IN +39 425
#note KELVIN is the best nonbingo. Obviously I had heard of the KELVIN temperature scale, but I did the math and saw I had a slight win coming, so I have to challenge if not 100 percent (well, in theory). Spread is meaningless where I was at. 
>hecky: OTW -  +0 348
>george: ET 3L .E.T +8 433
#note Had I accepted the play, TOW or TWO scores 20 in the O column.

Nice game. Better player won, plain and simple.
>george:  (OTW) +12 445
