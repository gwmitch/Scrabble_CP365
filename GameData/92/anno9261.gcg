#note i guess if she had a good rack she may not have passed, but i still felt compelled to take out the triple lane. lame. many better plays at 12a and 11b.

#note i like dawn d12. tings that made ZOON gave too much back after a fishy play.

#note mmm. this is kind of a risk. i want to set up my G and hope she doesn't take the spot if she has a G. voguer and any word i have seems to give too much back, so i'm also taking out her scoring opps there.

#note i seem to have forgotten voguer is a word. or maybe i wsn't 100 percent on it in the moment and didn't want to risk it. also i can't read my writing to figure out what all happened for the rest of this game. i won. the end.
