>JD: DEJMNOS 9C JO +20 105
#note trying to block the G since it will cripple his EIKNR leave. scored as 22 erroneously.
>Martin: EIKLNR F6 KR..L +21 41
>JD: DEEIMNS 11D DESMINE +80 185
#note this is the most defensive of the bingos - SIDEMEN at the same spot allows a few more points per turn evidently.
>Martin: EILNTW 10J WELT +28 69
>JD: ADHLNTU 12I UNHAT +24 209
#note I considered DHAL at 10A, but way too nuts with a big lead
>Martin: BIO 13K OBI +23 92

>JD: AADFIRS 10B FAA +29 259
#note as a bonus, seals the bottom-left quadrant of the board. quadrant? why does that word leave me with foreshadowing?
>Martin: BO G5 BO +10 133
>JD: CDFIRSS 12A FIDS +38 297
#note with both blanks out I felt that I couldn't sacrifice to block the new opening, and should instead play for equity.
>Martin: ?AEEHNX 4D HEXANEs +89 222
>JD: CIORSUY H1 CUR.Y +37 334
#note argh, I thought of the YCLEPT hook when I played it but then forgot about it when the time came to cash in.
>Martin: DUW 3C WUD +22 244
>JD: EEIOOST 1H .OOEE +8 342
#note I was somewhat fixated on playing off vowels here, but the bag is not so terribly unbalanced. COOTIE blocks bingos from the C and ends the game faster - that looks like the play.
>Martin: ?AEIIRT L3 InERTIA. +66 310
>JD: EIILSTZ 14M ZIT +36 378
#note a lot of my other Z plays seemed to have the potential for brutal snapbacks from the Q, whereas here the worst-case scenario was QUOTA at O11 or something analogous.
>Martin: AADNQRU O7 QUADRAN. +107 417
#note ZING!!! so much for my careful evaluation of risk. martin thought he was still in bad shape because there are two esses unseen, but all he has to do is draw one more big play and he completes the 166-point comeback.
>JD: EILOOST 15N OS +65 443
#note on my end I felt great after drawing a bingo but now I'm the underdog! in fact, this is supposed to end as a tied game!
>Martin: IMPSV 2H .MP +27 444
#note his actual play is worse than UMPS for 30, because by playing the S he saves VIDE as an extra out at E1 - and all of a sudden I can't block his out! Instead he only leaves DIVS available...
>JD: EILOT A12 .ILO +21 464
#note with DIVS as his only out, I can block with a play like DIOL saving TE/WELTED. But I calculated that FILO would be enough to outrun his out so I didn't go for a blocking play in case I had missed an out somewhere. after DIV I'm forced to find FLITE at B10 to secure a tie, else I lose by 1 point!
>Martin: ISV C12 .IVS +16 460
#note my apologies to martin - tremendous comeback from 166 down! instead listed as a 466-464 win for me.
>Martin:  (ET) +4 464
