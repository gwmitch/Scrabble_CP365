>Evans: ADGHTUZ D12 H.G. +16 312
>JD: AADILTU K1 .ADULA +14 445
#note TULADI does the same thing but scores a little more, and also keeps an L instead of the D with 2 more left.
>Evans: DEHZ 2J H.ZED +65 377
>JD: DIKORTY B12 K.Y +30 475
#note this play is suboptimal, but good enough. I should cover the Z hotspot with ZIT and save my scoring letters.

>JD: DIMORTT O10 MORT +10 485
#note I had seen the possibility of him having RICINUS and needed to block with very little time on my clock. the cool way to do it is DITTO at O11, but this works.
>Evans: CIINRSU 14L CRIS +30 409
#note right play although he underscored it

#note went over on time, so no 500 game for me
