#note only one of the remaining 14 tiles can go after this, so I figured it was the best shot that still scored well. 13G FOR is the safer option that I underestimated. CERV seems like it will be a crappy leave on this board unless I take CURVE later, and G7 COVER is not ideal for giving F10 as a HAJ spot. not sure here

#note ouch!
>Avery: EFNOORR 13G FEN +29 479
#note It didn't take me long to figure out that UNROOF doesn't win, but I almost ruled out FEN until I realized I had good potential with ORDO on top of it. The other RO combination was a bit tougher, but amazingly, I found the optimal sequence. I knew it didn't win against 2B HE, but it was all I could that really existed.
>Quackle: AEHIQ 3L .EI +12 505
#note Apparently, this is the best losing play. Any of 9F AI, 2B HE or M1 ANI will do the tie. As I said, I only thought of HE, but it worked out.
