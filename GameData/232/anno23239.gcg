>Steve: ?GILOOW H13 WOG +26 50
#note Missed WOOINGLY, GOODWILL.  Just didn't see them within the 2-3 minutes I gave myself to find something, considering I should find something in the next turn or two.
>Matthew_Ridout: AKP 10G PA.K +20 87
>Steve: ?EILNOR K4 NEROLIs +72 122
#note Picked this over the several 3x options (other than LONICERA which I didn't see) for defensive reasons (namely, beating him to this spot).

>Steve: IMNOORY J5 ROM +28 263
#note Considered MORION, didn't like how it opened things up after his 2 turns of fishing.  Considered MORAY too, but I guess I just liked the fanciness of this better.  Plus keeping the Y could be useful.

#note Didn't know R hook to DETHRONE.  Other than those and (FA)Y, which I considered, this isn't too bad, as he's got to be pretty close to a bingo by now.
