>Avery_Mojica: INOOOTV -OOOV +0 0
#note Thanks to Avery for providing his racks and some commentary.
>Charles_Reinke: ?EEGMNN H7 MEN +10 10
#note C: Probably spent too long on this turn making sure I wasn't missing a bingo.
>Avery_Mojica: AEINNOT G7 ENATION +70 70
>Charles_Reinke: ??EGKNO 11B rEvOK.NG +72 82
#note C: Again spent too long. I think I was down to fifteen minutes after this play. I did see the highest-scoring bingo (I4 KerOGEN for 76) but wanted to block the H12 spot.
>Avery_Mojica: AEIIIRV B6 RIVIE.A +13 83
#note A: Static likes this second behind the glaringly obvious 6G VAIR. I debated between this and VIREMIA for some time, but I don't know how good turnover really is considering that both of the blanks have already been used. A 1000-iteration sim puts VIREMIA ahead.
>Charles_Reinke: BEEOQSS A12 BEES +34 116
>Avery_Mojica: CDEIIRU 8A I.IED +30 113
>Charles_Reinke: BLOOQST 7A Q. +22 138
>Avery_Mojica: ACPRRTU D2 CAPTUR.R +74 187
#note C: Held for a bit, not sure why, it's good and even if it wasn't, it's too plausible to challenge.
>Charles_Reinke: BLOOSTT I5 BLOT +16 154
#note C: E3 BOOT is clearly best. Missed it. This blocks the easiest bingo lane. Not good.
>Avery_Mojica: AAEEFIV H11 .IEVE +32 219
#note A: I figured static would like this best, but I considered FACIA and FACIAE for some time also. He took a while on BLOT, so I figured a bingo might be imminent. NIEVE comfortably sims ahead.
>Charles_Reinke: EGJLOST 3C J.G +22 176
#note C: Blocking some more bingo lanes, although this time it's justifiable.
>Avery_Mojica: AAAAEFT -AAAF +0 219
#note A: I hastily exchanged this after flipping over all the A's. I really need to take points here for something like ALFA or ABAFT.
>Charles_Reinke: DELOSST 5I .OLD +14 190
#note C: Setting up another bingo lane is a priority on this turn. Quackle indicates 6H O(L)D which does much the same thing. Perhaps ELSST is better than ESST. I think my play is fine.

>Avery_Mojica: GINO 4C O.ING +20 265
>Charles_Reinke: EFFOSTU N9 OFFSET +42 308
>Avery_Mojica: AANORWY O6 WARY +36 301
#note A: I chickened out of NOWAY here. AWAY is also a lot better than this stupid play, even though a sim says it's only a 1% difference.
>Charles_Reinke: ADIPUXZ B14 XI +38 346
>Avery_Mojica: AADNOOW O13 DAW +26 327
#note A: I remember waffling between DAW and DOW, and I can honestly say I have no clue why I chose this. DOW is way better. My chances are already bleak, but I need what I can get. Championship player puts DOW at 6.82% and DAW at 4.24%. I remember us both also being below 5 minutes at this point.
>Charles_Reinke: ADIPRUZ 13M Z.. +26 372
#note C: Apparently I can play L1 IZAR(D) without any fear of a bingo from Avery, given the remaining pool. Quackle hates this. I don't remember my rationale for playing it other than perhaps I was trying to restrict/limit possible scoring spots. I'm also pretty sure I had around two minutes left when making this play. Hint: don't Quackle games two weeks after they've happened.
>Avery_Mojica: AHNOOUY L2 YON. +22 349
#note A: I had basically conceded at this point. This has the highest win percent at 2.42%, but I don't know how that can really be done at this point.
>Charles_Reinke: ADILPRU 14H .APID +17 389
#note C: Bad since my only out is RUL(Y). Should see PRI(ZED).
>Avery_Mojica: AAAHMOU 10I AMAH +18 367
#note A: I should really block his out.
>Charles_Reinke: LRU 2I RUL. +9 398
>Charles_Reinke:  (AOU) +6 404
