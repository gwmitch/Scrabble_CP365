#note hard to tell what to do here. I took his last couple of moves as a sign that he could be close to a bingo, but there's probably no reason that has to be true. top-simming play is RIZ/ER/HI but I thought it would open up too much while keeping a poor leave. perhaps LIFER to score more?

#note not playing AAL really hurt here because my lanes are all very week. as a result, this is the only play I could find that really seemed to threaten something unblockable - specifically, either on row 15 or through the N.
