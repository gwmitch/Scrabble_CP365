>Wayne_Clifford: FORW 8F FROW +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIOOOZ 9C ZOEA +28 28
#note It's funny when a 35 point play (FIZ) doesn't show up on the list because the leave really is that bad. Somehow I see virtually everything EXCEPT ZOOIER, which has to be the best play. That's right, I saw OOZIER too. I don't even know. Geez.
>Wayne_Clifford: DOU 10F DUO +19 39
>Matthew_Larocque: IINOORX 11D OXO +28 56
#note Again, I have a 37 point play in NIX, which I pass on to unload more vowels. NIX also gives him easier, more likely points. Both plays are nearly equal in the sim though.
>Wayne_Clifford: IP 12D PI +25 64

#note How.....why..... cannot fathom.... no words....
>Wayne_Clifford: ?ADEILR K2 DERAILs +75 139

>Wayne_Clifford: INSW B10 WIN.S +34 173
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIORSS 14D SOIREES +67 153
#note Fun fact: This rack only makes one single eight! It also plays and is probably better than SOIREES.
>Wayne_Clifford: ALT H12 TA.L +15 188
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEHIKS 4F HACKE.S +38 191
#note I chickened out of HACKIE, which scores 59 without using the S. I also entertained SHACKIER, which turns out to be a new word, and scores 94. I also see CH(E)EK 5 seconds after I play this. Which is still a bad play but at least it keeps the S. There's also SHAKE for 53. HACEKS/HAICKS are words too. What a disaster.
>Wayne_Clifford: ACY 3E CAY +26 214
>Matthew_Larocque: FIRT 2F FRIT +38 229
#note I played this fast, didn't get rack.
>Wayne_Clifford: DIM 1H MID +32 246
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEPQTU A8 QUATE +55 284
#note I didn't add the E, because I don't want to create a bingo column.
>Wayne_Clifford: ENR 7A ERN +19 265
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEOPY D4 ABYE +22 306
#note I'm quick playing, PA(R)E(U) is pretty cool! 
>Wayne_Clifford: HM C3 HM +18 283
>Matthew_Larocque: BEJNOPV 7H JO +25 331
#note I see JOB 3 seconds after I hit the clock. But JO does have the benefit of stopping bingos through the I.
>Wayne_Clifford: DG 6J G.D +9 292
>Matthew_Larocque: ABENPRV B2 BEAR +22 353
#note Not sure, just hoping to outscore Wayne since he only scored 9 this turn. Apparently every possible play is better than BEAR. Ah well, you can't win them all!
>Wayne_Clifford: ELU 2K .UEL +10 302
>Matthew_Larocque: GNPTUVV M1 V.G +14 367
#note Really P(E)NT? I guess it does score 23 points and I can dump a V next turn.
>Wayne_Clifford: ET 1M .ET +20 322
>Matthew_Larocque: NNPTUV F13 V.N +6 373
#note Saves (I)NPUT if for some reason that stays open and Wayne doesn't go out. I noticed (Y)UP after, though, and Wayne pointed out A14 UP.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?INOT 11J .aTINO +10 332

#note I won, but I really, really shouldn't have. -10
