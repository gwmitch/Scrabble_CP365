#note HADED and HALED sim about even because of DR synergy, the fact that there are no more Ds in pool and 3 more Ls to come. but best simming play is actually DZHO keeping ELFR which did not occur to me.

#note well, a GGNV draw was not quite what I had in mind. after CLUNG it seems that my only win is to draw the A, which is crucial because it means he can't use the ASPIRANT hook to score. he has to play carefully if I draw the E, but only the A is a definite win for me.

#note many sequences win.

#note I'm already stuck with the V. Quackle likes keeping the L to save it for AXLE at 14E.

#note he should ultra-slowplay me. but he has the win stitched up anyway.
