>JD: CDHRSUZ D11 .UCH +26 42
#note the odds of it working may not be great, but I thought it was worth going for the giant Z play and also setting up the MUCHO hook - if he plays there this turn I might cash my Z, if he doesn't think of it at all it could be valuable down the road. the alternative is CZAR this turn, but I like this.

>JD: DEHNRSZ H4 ZEND. +25 67
#note as often happens I failed to come up with ZHO as an option - it would be the perfect play, setting up a great D hook to cash in. too bad I missed it, it cost me immediately this time
