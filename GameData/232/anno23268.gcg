>Teri_Tereault: APR G6 RAP +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEGGNT I6 TEG +18 32
#note Unfortunately no bingos. Drawing that third G was really annoying.
>Teri_Tereault: BBELRU F1 RUBBLE +18 34
#note Better to play RUBLE or something that gives less back?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGHIN 1C HEA.sING +86 118
#note I missed the 95 point AdHE(R)ING. I exhausted a lot of time trying to find a 3x3. I played this to go for the RE next turn, although I kind of knew it was a silly gamble because it is so likely for him to have it as well.
>Teri_Tereault: FKNY H1 .NKY +15 49
>Matthew_Larocque: AILMNTZ 2B ZIN +31 149
#note I did not like playing this, because he's sure to score even more with it than I did. Also apparently ALMN is a better leave.
>Teri_Tereault: DFFORVW -FFOVW +0 49
#note Whoa. He said he had a rack like this. Surely WO(L)F for 29 is worth it?
>Matthew_Larocque: ACELMTU 3A CAM +41 190
#note MAC
>Teri_Tereault: ADIORUV A3 .ARDIO +30 79
#note He missed/didn't know (C)ORVID.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILTTU J5 TIE +16 206
#note My intended play was (C)UITTLE, now I don't have much. I forgot about TEGU, TEGU/TEGU looks good.
>Teri_Tereault: UV 9H .UV +14 93
>Matthew_Larocque: ELTUY B8 YULE +14 220
#note Instead of the other YULE to make bingoing harder.
>Teri_Tereault: ADEPW A11 PAWED +40 133
>Matthew_Larocque: CEHILST C9 HIT +26 246
#note Er, HIC? It's not even a new three, Matt.
>Teri_Tereault: AFT E5 AFT +22 155
>Matthew_Larocque: CELLOSU B13 OLE +18 264
#note The sooner the better.
>Teri_Tereault: NOT K4 TON +13 168
>Matthew_Larocque: ACFLQSU L2 QUA +28 292
#note I avoided K9 SUQ just because almost any bingo with an S will play for moderate points. However I didn't see 12C SUQ for 31 which I like.
>Teri_Tereault: IRRT 13A ..RRIT +18 186
>Matthew_Larocque: AACFLSV 1L ALFA +38 330
#note Well that was lucky.
>Teri_Tereault: EJSS 10F JESS +41 227
#note He seemed extremely disgusted with this play. 
>Matthew_Larocque: CNORSVX 11E VOX +44 374
#note Well that was lucky, again.
>Teri_Tereault: ?EEEIOS N1 .EE +12 239
#note "Wow. I seriously can't even believe this game." - Teri Tetreault
J9 (V)EE!
>Matthew_Larocque: CEMNORS O3 MOC +12 386
#note No bingos, blocking the obvious high scoring spot.
>Teri_Tereault: ?EINOOS K8 ISOgONE +70 309
>Matthew_Larocque: DEINORS 15E DINEROS +81 467
#note Tried to write down all the anagrams quickly, missed INDORSE, only 99.9% sure on ROSINED. 
>Matthew_Larocque:  (D) +4 471
#note Good drawing and pefect timing for most of my racks. Teri was audibly upset at the "brutal" score of 308. He hadn't plummeted to those depths in eons!
