#note a little too clunky of a leave, Q prefers TUTU which I considered or TUND# at G6 or LUST at 14B which I didn't think of

#note I felt the lane on row 2 would help if I intended to mount a glorious comeback.

>JD: ABEESTX 8J .EX +18 174
#note doesn't show up on top 15 static, but sims as well as EX at 2E or DEX - the board is kind of anemic without this play

#note probably should sacrifice 6 points to play YAWN, the N would be much easier to triple-triple through which is my most direct path back

#note I believe this was his actual rack
>JD: AEFRRSS 4D FAR +25 331
#note lame play - FAYRES# looks like the choice, putting the S on column O legitimately gives me a chance
>Nick_Ball: FNNOOOO 15L .OOF +30 435
#note quite the rack!
>JD: EIRSSTU F10 US +21 352
#note it won't win, but STOURIEST is available! I wanted to hit some kind of miracle out-bingo on column O, or maybe something on column H. I'm 70% to bingo after just fishing here tho.
