>doug: ACFIL 8H CALIF +28 28
>cesar: DENOOOT L8 .OOTED +20 20
#note -3, 7K TOO. i misunderestimated the leave. (even FOO sims comparably to FOOTED). 
>doug: AHI K11 AHI +24 52
>cesar: EGJNOOV K5 GOJ. +24 44
#note i was a little flustered because of my screwup against jerry and i remember playing unfocused. this is when i make lots of little mistakes. like i don't quite weigh JO vs GOJI -- GOJI is making it much more volatile. -3
>doug: EIK J8 .IKE +21 73
>cesar: EINNNRV L2 VENIN +21 65
#note i saw VENIN and NERVING, and i inexplicably chose VENIN. i knew it was probably worse, but when i lose i get flustered and paranoid. it's something that i recognize i should work on. at least these aren't giant screwups, but they add up; my style of play does demand precision and i don't have enough of it... -2
>doug: EIRW 2J WI.ER +38 111
>cesar: ANQRTUW 10F QUAR. +38 103
#note QUA seems like it's a little better. -2 more imprecisions.
>doug: IPZ 11E ZIP +43 154
#note all of these minor mistakes are adding up to big plays for him; this is why it's important to stay focused, and why i often lose in streaks.
>cesar: ILMNOTW 3I MOT.L +31 134
#note maybe MOW, right? yet another imprecision. -1
>doug: AMX 1M MAX +43 197
#note he's punishing all my little mistakes severely.
>cesar: ADINRUW 4E UNDRAW +24 158
#note ok, i need to change trajectory here. let's start over. luckily the J is gone for JWOW.
>doug: BPY G9 B..PY +21 218
>cesar: ?AEGITV 8H .....ATE +39 197
#note i did see AGENTIVE, but thought CALIFATE was slightly better. as long as he doesn't bingo through it.. although BUPPY isn't a good sign for me. -5
>doug: ACELNST O6 CL.ANEST +61 279
#note boom
>cesar: ?DEGIIV F2 VI.E +15 212
#note i set up desperation hooks, but this isn't a good play. however i think quackle is going over the top with J13 VIE or VIG. maybe i would do VIG. i don't know. i guess my chances of winning here are super low. -5.5
>doug: AEY N10 AYE +19 298
>cesar: ?BDGGIO 13C BOGG. +24 236
#note at this point quackle likes me to open  triple triple with F13 BOG or J13 BOG. 6F DOG is also available but I hate it.
>doug: AFRT 12A FRAT +30 328
>cesar: ?DEIILR A8 wILD.IRE +149 385
#note holy crap
>doug: DEO B9 DOE. +17 345
>cesar: ?EHORST C3 HORsTES +77 462
#note yes, i completely forgot about the OVINE hook. pretty lame, milhouse. (however, this doesn't sim as far down as it should, because i'm inadvertently blocking NONUSES).  -5
>doug: ENNSSUU B1 SUES +15 360
>cesar: O 1A O. +6 468
#note ovine is not a word. -2
>cesar:  (NNU) +6 474
#note my super flusteredness turns into a miraculous, undeserved win here. let's see if i can regain my focus for the final 3 games.
