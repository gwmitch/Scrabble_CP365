#note HELP!
CP says TRENDIER on the column is best, if not by much.   Seems to me not slotting the E next to H12 woul be a big plus

#note ...because I was clueless as to whether or not PYOIDS* was valid and would've chanced it had I not gotten this opportunity.

MAROON from 14A beat it

#note David mentioned after game that he'd had no vowels on this rack.  His lack of them is what most cost him game, more than things i was doing

CORN 14 A rated best here.  I'm curious why my play was not light years worse.  In defending bingo lane 14, I knew I was just setting up game-changing K-points here instead.

#note OHIA F10 now my favorite, but mine wasn't far back

(Quackle said mine and many moves put me 100% to win, yet after the next play David is listed with a good chance again of winning.  Weird.)
