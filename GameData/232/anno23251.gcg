#note ugh, tremendous greed - really had doubts about this being good but decided it was a variant of SAULIES#. this is even worse because he can maybe block SAURELS next turn.

#note time to blow up this nice rack in search of a blank. this move is doubly painful for george because there is only one N left so I may get to score again at H1 next time
