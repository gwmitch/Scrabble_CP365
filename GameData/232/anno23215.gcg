#note VIVAED looks rather nice
>Alastair_Richards: IPRTU E7 R.UPIT +16 44
>Andrew_Fisher: AEMRRTU J9 ERRATUM +65 87
#note Slightly preferable to MATURER as the R would be much more flexible to play round

>Alastair_Richards: AACDLRY 13G DAC.YLAR +88 198
>Andrew_Fisher: ADGMOST 15J .ADTOM +39 169
#note After Alastair's great find I seem to be in trouble. I don't like leaving H12 uncovered but the score here is hard to resist. DAGO H12 comes second on the sim
>Alastair_Richards: EFS H1 EFS +39 237
>Andrew_Fisher: GGHLSWX H12 H.GG +39 208
>Alastair_Richards: ANQU 12A QUAN. +48 285
>Andrew_Fisher: AJLLSWX B10 WA.LS +32 240
#note It would be nice to dispose of either J or X, and the sim gives a slight edge to WAX C11 (11% win vs 10% for WAULS). But the AJLLS leave isn't too appetising anyway on this board.
>Alastair_Richards: AEHP 14L EPHA +43 328
>Andrew_Fisher: EGJLNSX L10 JEL... +28 268
#note Alastair keeps piling on the score as ever, though after this point he said he was plagued with vowels (not surprising given my run of consonants). JELLED definitely the best option here but the win% is around 6% now.
>Alastair_Richards: ADELNOO F10 ODA +30 358
#note ADELNOO the actual rack - he considered DOOLAN/EEN to block bingos but that wouldn't have paid off.
>Andrew_Fisher: ??GINSX M10 aX +25 293
#note Ooh, tempting possibilities from 1G here. A few contenders crossed my mind but luckily I spurned them all. I liked AX here because of the JAG follow-ups in addition to top row bingos, but for some reason the sim goes for GoX in the same spot - seems unnecessarily restrictive
>Alastair_Richards: LOO 9M LOO +14 372
>Andrew_Fisher: ?GINSST O4 SIGNp.ST +77 370
#note Nice choice from Alastair, giving himself counterplay if I bingo on row 1 (especially something like FIZ 8M). So I played in column O to stymie him, which sims best
>Alastair_Richards: EEIINOR 6I .EERIN. +15 387
#note I think EEIINOR was the actual rack, based on postgame discussion. Unluckily he cannot score more than 16 (NAOI C11), though sim slightly favours LIE 13B over his ultimate choice
>Andrew_Fisher: EENNTWZ L4 NE.TZ +48 418
#note Suddenly my win% has skyrocketed, having snared the vital Z. I could leave one in the bag with OW/JAWS 34, but after some mulling I went for the higher score. ENTREZ also possible and has a minimally superior win%, but I wanted to keep a vowel
>Alastair_Richards: FINOOUY N9 .Y +34 421
#note Alastair is struggling now as I happen to have several outplays. If not blocking my final play, best is probably FOY E3 although this works almost as well
>Andrew_Fisher: EEINW M2 WIEN.E +27 445
