>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ADEEIYZ 8D ZAIDY +56 56
#note There was an idea floating around at the Whole Foods club that it would be cool for one game a week to be annotated with one person recording both sides racks and offering commentary. I recorded the last game between Tim and Dinesh. This is the best move by a ton and really the only play worth considering. Tim had the game on cruise control after this knockout punch!
>Dinesh: IIINTUW -IIW +0 0
#note Dinesh draws a terrible opening rack with the kiss of death (UW!). D6 WIZ for 15 and exchanging IIUW leaving INT are basically identical. I would exchange and leave INT. Dinesh leaves INTU which is 5-6 equity back of the before mentioned top two plays. This was a slight mistake. This was his 12th best play.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: DEEGPQT F7 Q. +11 67
#note 6th best play for Tim! E7 PAGED for 18 is apparently best holding EQT. Tim's play is reasonable but -6.9 to Quackle. About 10 moves could work here of which Tim's is one.
>Dinesh: AINNOTU 9D AN +15 15
#note Another terrible rack for Dinesh! This was his 10th best play. 9B UNAI for 18 ditches the U and is best by over 5 equity points. I agree with Quackle. -9.8
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: DEEEGPT 10B PEG +25 92
#note 2nd best play for Tim! He needs to play this two spaces to the right for 27 instead of 25. Still a very good play! -2.
>Dinesh: INOTTUU H4 UNIT. +9 24
#note Another horrible rack for Dinesh! This was not a winnable game for him. B10 PUTOUT for 16 is best by a long shot (8 equity points). I saw 5th place PUTTO for 14 at -10.8 back and probably would have played that as I did not see PUTOUT. Dinesh's play is -16.5 and does not sim on Quackle's top 15 moves or so. It also opens up a TRIUNITY extension which he may or may not know. Dinesh's play was a moderate mistake that would become much worse.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: DEEISTT 5F DI.ETTES +68 160
#note Best play for Tim along with INSETTED! PUTOUT or PUTTO don't give Tim the T to make DINETTES or INSETTED. This play brings back memories of New Orleans as I missed this pair in game 2 against Jesse Day. INSETTED is probably a smidge better due to lower comeback chances, but both plays have the same equity.
>Dinesh: EJOOTUV C9 V.TO +21 45
#note 4th best play for Dinesh! Given that Dinesh is behind, I would probably do B10 POOVE for 20 keeping JTU and hope to score big with the J. This was the main play I saw (I didn't see the top 2 plays but I didn't look that hard.) Quackle likes JOUST for 24 which does kill an obvious cheap points hotspot, but also blocks an S that could be used in bingos. J3 OUTVOTE is the 2nd best play and maybe the best out of all the options as it sets up the J at I3 and opens the board up the most out of all the plays which Dinesh needs since he is behind. Anyways, Dinesh's play is only -4.7 to Quackle and quite reasonable.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: BEEIIMO 4L MOI +20 180
#note 7th best play for Tim! The best equity play is BIOME at B4 for 21, but Tim's play has a lot of merit on strategic grounds. It closes an S, closes a hot spot, and makes the board less volatile. Plus Dinesh may not know the one back hook onto MOI. However, there's blockbuster overlap potential if Dinesh has an E on the 3rd column. BIOME is the play I think. -4.6 to Quackle but this seems fine enough.
>Dinesh: EFJNOSU O1 JOES +43 88
>Dinesh: EFJNOSU --  -43 45
#note This was a bad miss by Dinesh. He had JONES I3 for 51. Instead he tried MOIS*. He had a faint chance of getting back into the game if he played JONES with a bingo shortly thereafter. Not anymore.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ABEEEIW 3K EEW +29 209
#note 2nd best play for Tim! This is why the JONES miss was so bad. Tim hits the sweet spot he originally opened up. EEEW is better equity wise but opens a cheap hot spot at J2. EEW is -2.6 behind EEEW but more defensive. Tim's play seems great to me. Also B10 PEWEE but Tim's play is better.
>Dinesh: EFJNOSU 4D JOE +23 68
#note JONES is blocked. 12A JEON for 38 is best and well worth the risk given the deficit. Dinesh's play doesn't show and is -10.9 back. JOE can be played at B12 for 29 and would be 7th best.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ABEEIOS J2 BEA. +19 228
#note 3rd best play for Tim! G7 ADOBE for 23 is the best by a long shot but hard to see. Tim's play is fine but leaves one too many vowels. -9.
>Dinesh: AFNPSSU 9C ...S +19 87
#note LOL! FUNPASS* for a rack! It's not a word. D12 plays are the only options worth considering. FUN, FAUN, an FUNS are 3rd-1st place. I would have debated a while between FUN and FUNS. AFNPSU just doesn't have a lot of synergy for a leave. -18.3
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: AEIORSY B10 .AYER +27 255
#note 8th best play for Tim! D12 YO for 20 is apparently best. I would have played B10 PAYOR for 27 which is 2nd best. However, since I was annotating, I only thought about the moves briefly. Tim's play is fine again, but leave could be optimized a bit. -7.5.
>Dinesh: AFHNPSU A13 FAH +34 121
#note Best play for Dinesh! I agree with his play! PUNS is better leave the FUNS.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: AAEIORS C9 ....ES +33 288
#note 12th best play according to Quackle, but I think Tim makes the right call here. Quackle's top play OBA at I2 for 7 is utterly stupid. Tim wisely takes the points. I would do this too.
>Dinesh: ?ANPRSU 7H .AP +6 127
#note Now Dinesh has a great rack, but can't play a bingo anywhere. D12 US for 23 is the best equity play but burns the S. Dinesh's play has merit here but he needs to do TUP instead as the U is a bad letter.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: AAINORR 8J AIR +8 296
#note Since Dinesh is fishing, many of Quackle's top suggestions are utterly stupid so Tim should be contra-Quackle once again. D3 AJAR or D2 RAJA for 11 apiece seem reasonable. Dinesh's opening isn't that volatile and I don't think I would try and block it because it's hard to block well. Tim's play is only -3.8 back of AJAR and RAJA, however, so it seems fine to me.
>Dinesh: ?IINRSU L8 .UIN +4 131
#note This play ahows why TAP was a mistake. If Dinesh played TUP he has SENARII/AIRS for the bingo. Dinesh's play seems reasonable if going for a bingo which he needs at this point. I probably deviate from Quackle and do the same move.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: AMNORRT K10 MORN +20 316
#note 2nd best play for Tim! I actually like Tim's play better than Quackle's number 1 MOR. Fewer hooks onto MORN. Tim's is only -.5 back and scores 2 more points. I'll take Tim's play.
>Dinesh: ?DEEIRS 13F DESIg.ER +70 201
#note There were a bunch of bingos at 78 at 12E which included DERIDERS, RESIDERS, and DECRIERS. Dinesh's play seems fine as he needs a second bingo at least to win anyway. -8 to Quackle.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ACGHIRT H11 CA.H +10 326
#note This was Tim's first significant mistake of the game. 12B YOGH for 22 is best and what I would have done. H1 TRIUNITY for 33 is 2nd best and valid option in it's own right. I don't think I would see TRIUNITY so I would do YOGH for sure. The S is not that big of a spot. -23.5.
>Dinesh: ADELNTV M12 A. +2 203
#note Good to know that Quackle and I think alike! I immediately saw LAVED at O4 for 37 and would have insta-played this. LEVANT in the same spot also works too! Dinesh said he was trying to block Tim, but he blocked nothing and made it easier for Tim to potentially bingo. LAVED for sure.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: BGILRTX O1 GIRL +25 351
#note 3rd bets play for Tim. 3 very close plays here. BIRL and GIRL at O1 and TRIUNITY again at H1 for 33. All are within -.6 of each other. A G is clunky on this board, so I may have done Tim's play even though it's -.6 and #3. Another sound choice by Tim. Any of these 3 plays are just fine.
>Dinesh: DELNOTV N8 LOVED +20 223
#note 2nd best play for Dinesh! D13 DEV is best and is much better for strategic reasons with the X out. I hope I would have seen DEV because while LOVED isn't bad, it results in this... (-.2)
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: BFGILTX O7 FIX +54 405
#note Best play for Tim! Only play worth considering.
>Dinesh: CKNNOOT O11 TOOK +16 239
#note O12 ONTO for 20 is best equity play. Best contra equity play is O11 TOCO is you want to gamble and hope Tim doesn't have an S or know TOCO. This is -10.9.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: BGLLRTU 12B ..B +16 421
#note 3rd best play! Quackle's best 2F BLURB is a little riskly due to the blank out. GLT can't go out next turn anyway. -6.9 to Quackle but once again I probably would do Tim's play!
>Dinesh: ?CNNOUW F13 .OW +9 248
#note If I were Dinesh, I would probably do 5A UNCO for 15 followed by L1 WING for the out in two. Quackle isn't often of much help in constructing perfect endgames, so I have to use my own judgement. Tim can't score that much with the U in the A5 position. B2 GRUNT for 16 would be his top play if Dinesh played UNCO and Dinesh can go out with aWNED/oWNED at F1 for 16 or WiNG for 11. Dinesh's choice doesn't appear on the top moves.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: GLLRTU 14E G.T. +10 431
#note 8th best play! Missing 6L UT for 15. This is still only -2.4 back so very reasonable especially since Tim is under 2 minutes.
>Dinesh: ?CNNU 12G N. +5 253
#note 14L NECK for 22! -24.9
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: LLRU L13 .LL +4 435
#note Putting RULED or LURED at F1 risks a good out by Dinesh so this seems reasonable to me.
>Dinesh: ?CNU E3 N. +2 255
#note UNCO at 5A for the out and 13 points. -33.4
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: RU F2 RU.. +9 444
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.:  (CU?) +8 452
#note It is fascinating to annotate a game played by two people other than yourself. I like this annotating thing. No missed bingos in the game between Tim and Dinesh and a lot of fascinating positions. It was not Dinesh's game to win due to his opening draws but there will be more games for him to win in the future!
