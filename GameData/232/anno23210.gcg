>Matthew_Larocque: ABEHINU 9G AHI +30 30
#note I liked how this really reduced her counter plays.
>Huguette_Settle: ACT 10I ACT +16 44
>Matthew_Larocque: AABEENU L9 EAU +9 39
#note I thought this was a reasonable risk to take this early in the game. Sim even likes it.
>Huguette_Settle: BEIN 8L BINE +36 80
#note Sigh.
>Matthew_Larocque: AABDDEN 7M BAD +21 60
#note M3 BANDA(I)D. I did look there briefly but couldn't find the word.
>Huguette_Settle: OTW 12J WOT +26 106
#note At least she had to sacrifice 7 points here.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADDELNR 9L .D +13 73
#note I entertained DANDLER, but I couldn't even be sure DANDLE was a word. 
>Huguette_Settle: F N6 F.. +14 120

>Huguette_Settle: GY 9L ..GY +24 144
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMNOTU 12C TONEME +27 176
#note OUT(LANDERS)! I also didn't know ME(N)TO.
>Huguette_Settle: IQS J6 QIS +47 191
#note That hurts a bit.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGORSUY 11D YUGA +34 210
#note Oh man. I didn't even look for a bingo, YUGA just looked so good with this rack. I really needed to find GRAYOU(T)S.
>Huguette_Settle: IMV 13B VIM +28 219
>Matthew_Larocque: ?NNORST E9 NO.. +4 214
#note Slightly behind on a horrendous board. I didn't like playing this, but I have to try something. Too bad I didn't see S(EN)OR, for 24. That would have been good.
>Huguette_Settle: DIV K5 VID +28 247
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AKNRST 4J TANK +24 238
#note Well crap. I hadn't learned KANTARS yet. I'm still in it, but not for long if I don't find a bingo.
>Huguette_Settle: GR K2 GR.... +11 258
>Matthew_Larocque: ?LRRSTW 2K .RRL +10 248
#note Not a word, but wins a sim by a longshot, so a good time to get one past her.
>Huguette_Settle: AFO 1M OAF +22 280
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ILSTWX D8 XI +19 267
#note Not sure on last letter, might have been an L. Anyways, if I had bingoed earlier, then I wouldn't be in this situation.
>Huguette_Settle: ?EERRSU C3 SEcURER +79 359
#note :/
>Matthew_Larocque: ?LOPSTW 4A PL.W +24 291
#note PL(EX)
>Huguette_Settle: EILOT A4 .OLITE +24 383
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEHOST G11 ...H +9 300
#note TOESHOE/EYESHOT but I didn't really know those.
>Huguette_Settle: JO D2 JO. +15 398
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEIOST 15D cOESTIE +78 378
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEIOST --  -78 300
#note I see 3 words: cOESITE, *EgOTISE, pOETISE. In the mad scramble I don't see ETOIlES. I realise that cOESITE scores the least, but I'm having doubts about *EgOTISE, and cOESITE is the one word I'm absolutely 100% sure on. But none of that matters if I can't even put the letters in the right order... what a flop! I win by one point if I play either of the 81 point bingos (and don't go overtime)!

>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEIOST 15D cOESITE +78 378
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ANO) +6 384
#note Despite my sloppiness, I still had a chance to eke out a win, I just wasn't fast enough.
