#note I have drawn EEEEIIRS since leaving INS after MAUN. too much of a good thing apparently. I felt compelled to open a new spot so he wouldn't block the FORELAYS hook that I desperately need, and SI/JAPANS really telegraphs my leave.

>JD: EHIRSST 3C H. +14 273
#note againm I didn't want to telegraph that I had both of the last two esses, so I created a fake setup.

>JD: CDHOPQW 9E Q. +11 364
#note clearly getting to play QOPH at 1A for 79 would've been preferable. failing that, this was an overreaction - should take the points for POW at L3 before he does so himself with the other W
>Nick_Ball: AVV 1D VAV +19 376

#note POW over HOW to preserve the CH synergy
>Nick_Ball: ABELNOT 15J OBLATE +29 405
#note wow, got off very lucky here - he chickened out of stonable
>JD: CDELOPR 14M PED +23 422
#note this is not an easy position for me to win from. I was down to basically no time on my clock already. best play that Q finds is COLY at 15E the key tile seems like the W, which allows him to score on row 14. my play looks pretty bad if he has both the O and W, and maybe gives me a chance of winning if he doesn't.
>Nick_Ball: AEGNOTU 15D GOAT. +22 427
#note the key to his best endgame here is spotting GUQIN through QI, which saves TOEA. still short of a win by 7.
