#note i think against a human player FUZIL might be a better play, but i don't know. ZAG sims 6 pts ahead. quackle says i bingo more than 52% of the time. however a human might try to block more often.

#note i might have miscounted HARPS, i think i counted it as 45. i didn't realize it scored 9 more points. but not only that, it gives up fewer points. HARPS is definitely best. whoops >:/ -4

#note keep X for another turn! bad mistake here. DEN 3K is fine. i was so concerned about getting rid of the X for some weird reason. -10.5

#note i didn't actually think LEANED was a word for some reason, lol. or i forgot about it. people don't say LEANT in the real world. i lose my concentration for several plays at a time randomly, like with the X move before this turn. it's weird and i wish i knew how to fix it. -5.5

#note QI is simming above AEQuORIN (which i completely did not think about) for some reason (well i know the reason, but it's silly, i would have played AEQUORIN if i had thought of it)
