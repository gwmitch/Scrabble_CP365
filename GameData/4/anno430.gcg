#note An interesting dilemma. I knew TEREDOES was bad (the real word is STEREOED), but there was no way to block all of Lester's possible bingoes. Since playing GAUNTRY would set him up for a bigger score with STOREYED, I let it stand.

#note Surprising endgame miss by Les to let me squeak out the tie. He may have mistracked, and also he had underscored something by 1 point. But I was sure he would find CHIT (K4) to win handily, or even having missed that, hILI (H3) would have done the job.
