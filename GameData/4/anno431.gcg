#note I guess I have to count this as a mistake: since I was trailing, ORIBATID (H8) was clearly indicated. But had I done that, opponent couldn't fail to find at least a 77-point bingo...

#note Lucky to find the N in the bag, so opponent didn't have a winning play to the G. Luckier still that he didn't think of WOK (2L) on the previous turn.  Some wins are just more satisfying than others. I'll leave it at that.
