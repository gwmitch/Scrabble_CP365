#note Wow.
>Winter: AILMUWY 8G LAW +12 12
#note I burn a lot of time looking for options other than MY, because I wanted to ditch either the U or the W. In the end, I botch my play, missing the underlap, but she still misses the bingo. I did not see (W)ATERDOG, but I probably play this anyway, figuring she won't find it.

#note Really wanted to phony, but it's a good thing I didn't.
>Mary_Logullo: AEILRTU 14C URALITE +62 130
>Winter: AEENORR B13 ORE +22 194
#note Quackle wants me to score more, but with the board open, I wanted to bingo ASAP.
>Mary_Logullo: AHOX 12L HOAX +56 186
#note Wow, despite losing two turns, she has managed to come within 7 points. Gimme a fucking break.

#note Good thing I didn't try the phony earlier.
>Winter: BLMNNOY 13A Y.M +26 352
#note CONKY--damn. I'm pretty damn good on 5s. Not sure why that word seems completely unfamiliar. Anyway, my play was aimed to take out that easy line.
>Mary_Logullo: DEJ K2 J.ED +24 264
>Winter: BEILNNO L1 BO.N +31 383
#note I see BONNIL(Y) and BONIL(Y)* as possibilities, but I'm not sure of either. Then I see BO(R)N and the line at N4 and decide I can afford to try for another bingo.
>Mary_Logullo: AW 2A AW +20 284
>Winter: EEEILNO E4 .OE +12 395
#note I can see from the bag that she's not going to bingo, so I decide to try one more time. Missed (BIZ)E though.
>Mary_Logullo: ?CIIPSS 2K ..InS +24 308
#note She almost plays P(A)SS, which would have blocked my play, but then she pulls it back.
