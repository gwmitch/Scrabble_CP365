#note I suppose I lucked out on a mistake here.  I can see how DODGY and DOZED score too many points to consider exchanging but I decided to keep DOZ and gamble on drawing an AI for AZIDO (and if that failed, I would still have lots of options because the Z goes nicely with the D and the O).  It's a likely enough draw however that according to Quackle, that gamble still isn't much worse than DODGY or DOZED and is the third best play.

#note And I hit it, putting this game almost out of reach.

>Sean_Wrona: CFGIINS D2 FISC +33 282
#note I'm glad I talked myself out of considering FISCING.  It seems like there were a ton of options here that were all basically equal, so here's a play where personal style may play a role.  I don't like IF at all because I don't like keeping 4 consonants including the asynergistic C and G and it scores less.
>Karl_Higby: AAIRSTU 14C AURISTA +67 169
#note Sigh...  This sounded outrageously phony to me and I did hold it but I decided to let him have it regardless.  I know how shaky and inconsistent my word knowledge all over the place.  I figured if I challenged it and it was phony he'd just fish the A and U off, draw an E, and have bingos galore all over the place that would probably score more points and open the board more than this did.   If I challenged and it was good and he bingoed on the next play as well, I stood a good chance of losing.  Given that I had QUITE for 45 on the next play, I just decided to play it safe and that it wasn't worth it to challenge this, but the aftereffects of not challenging this may have cost me the tournament (in my next game with him, as I presume he knew AURISTA was phony...)
>Sean_Wrona: EGILNQU H11 QUI.E +45 327
#note I know KORAI is a word but I just didn't think of the spot to play QUIN there.
>Karl_Higby: DEIT 15A EDIT +30 199
#note He did though.
>Sean_Wrona: AGGLNNU 11H .UAG +28 355
#note I was definitely not creative enough here.  NUKING is a much cooler play.  This is better for defense, but clearly I needed to play more than one consonant here.
>Karl_Higby: EILOU 12J LOUIE +15 214
>Sean_Wrona: GLNNPRX -GLNP +0 355
#note Probably my dumbest decision in this game, but I was probably just fishing for any vowel to play an X play at C1 or C2.  I don't think I entirely realized all the Is are gone and if I had I might have rethought this...
>Karl_Higby: EEV G1 VEE +14 228
>Sean_Wrona: LNRRSTX M11 N.X +20 375
#note Another play where I clearly wasn't creative enough.  If I'm going to keep the X after an exchange, this is clearly a massive waste (and NEXT is obviously better anyway).

#note I apparently stopped tracking my entire racks here, but this is the only rack I don't know since I only made two more plays afterward.
>Karl_Higby: ADHLNTW M1 THAW +33 338
>Sean_Wrona: BENO N2 ONE +27 506
#note BETON is the best play.  I didn't really know it, but I decided to play ONE rather than going out just to rack the score up to see if I could win the prize for high game, which I did.  Number of wins, not spread, was what was going to decide whether I would win this tournament or not.
