>Michal_Josko: AELRX 8H RELAX +40 40
>Sean_Wrona: DDEEFGR 9G DEF +24 24
#note Wow, DEFER 7I is slick.  I'm disappointed I missed that.
>Michal_Josko: DMU 9K MUD +21 61
>Sean_Wrona: DEEGNRS N3 GENDERS +70 94
#note But it worked out for me anyway...
>Michal_Josko: AWW M2 WAW +29 90
>Sean_Wrona: AGOORST L3 GOO +25 119
#note Quackle prefers TOGA, I prefer AGO, but I just really overestimated the difference between the ARST leave and either the other two leaves because I am simply not a fan of O's.
>Michal_Josko: JO K5 JO +36 126
>Sean_Wrona: AHORSST O1 HOS +24 143
#note Yeah, row 10 plays were probably better and I just wasn't looking there.  Most of them probably shut the board down too much, but HOTS, which scores more and provides the hook for SHOTS, is certainly better.  I'm not necessarily sold on HOST and HOSTA also being better...
>Michal_Josko: Y 6J Y. +13 139
>Sean_Wrona: AEIIRST 10C AIRIEST +71 214
#note If I had played HOTS last time, this could have been a double-double.  Of course, I might not have drawn another T...
>Michal_Josko: ENY M9 .ENY +8 147
>Sean_Wrona: BIKRTUV C9 B.TIK +28 242
#note BIRK definitely.  Just didn't see it, but this is still fine.
>Michal_Josko: AEU L11 EAU +18 165
>Sean_Wrona: ADIPRUV 7E PAVID +31 273
#note I guess this vs. VAPID is a wash.  Most people would probably prefer VAPID for the defense but I'm not sure how defensive it is in that position, since it allows IVE bingos and the triple line at 8A is shut down so the only real way PAVID could backfire is if Michal had COZ or something...

>Michal_Josko: GHINZ 3A H.ZING +38 235
>Sean_Wrona: EF A8 EF +29 365
#note Forgot to record my rack on this turn.

>Sean_Wrona: EINNPRT 1G NIP +17 382
>Michal_Josko: OO A1 OO. +18 272
>Sean_Wrona: ?EENRTV 12A RE.NViTE +74 456
#note I totally would not have thought of this if not for Word Freak, but INVERTED is probably the best defensively.  I scored it as 72, and cost myself 2 points for the second time in this tournament.  It's a good thing it didn't end up mattering...
>Michal_Josko: CL 12J CL.. +9 281
>Sean_Wrona: ACIILRT 13G ARC +14 470
#note I figured he had the blank with some other good tiles so I wanted to make it hard for him to bingo.
>Michal_Josko: ?IMNOST M6 OM +17 298
#note He put down MOSTING 14A instead of MESTINO, but I said hold before he hit his clock so he removed it and played elsewhere.
