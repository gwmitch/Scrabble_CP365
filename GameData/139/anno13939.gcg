>Joey_Krafchick: ADDEIOY 8G YOD +14 14
#note I spent a lot of time on this rack, I knew I should get rid of the Y but I didn't have anything that balanced my rack with enough consonants. This is the best play according to Quackle, so I guess I made a good decision.
>Jim_Burlant: CHLRU J7 CHURL +23 23
>Joey_Krafchick: ADEEHIT K9 HEAD +27 41
#note After 800 iterations, HEAT sims slightly better than HEAD. My choice was 2 more, plus I don't think DEI is much better than TEI if it is better at all. 
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEKRSU 13E qUAKERS +71 94
>Joey_Krafchick: EIIQTWY 12K .EITY +26 67
#note I hate all of my options, my choice is fine I think. Quackle says KEY is b3st but there is no way I am leaving IIQTW. (D)EITY scorer 26 and I'll get 4 new tiles, QIW sucks too but it's my best of options I feel.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIIRST -  +0 94
#note He exchanged 6 here. 
>Joey_Krafchick: EINPQSW 14D WIPE +28 95
#note I initially laid down Qi at 11M but that is just to generous for a ZA for 63 type of play. My play sims roughly 10th, but some of the ones ahead of it I don't agree with. WISPY is the best play, I whiffed it. THis turn was bad.  
>Jim_Burlant: ENOV O8 ENVO. +33 127
>Joey_Krafchick: IINOQSW 15A WINO +30 125
#note I'm getting sick of the Q but I think this is a good play, and the rack is slowly getting more balanced. Quackle agrees, this sims best by about 2%.
>Jim_Burlant: AB 14A AB +21 148
>Joey_Krafchick: AEIINQS -AIQ +0 125
>Jim_Burlant: TT M11 T.T +6 154
>Joey_Krafchick: BEEINSU 7H BI.E +17 142
#note Sims best, close to (C)UBE. Ironically, I had the Q for so many turns and NOW I keep a U on my rack.
>Jim_Burlant: GN A12 GN.. +10 164
>Joey_Krafchick: EGNOOSU 9F GOO +16 158
#note Sims best by about 3%. That leave again!
>Jim_Burlant: ADLNU N6 LUNA +10 174
#note He originally laid down DU(E), which would have given me a bingo, then he played this.
>Joey_Krafchick: AEENRSU 12A .ENU +10 168
#note I was down to this and URA(RE), which are the two best-simming plays. EENS isn't that good, and URARE isn't enough more than GENU to be worth playing in my opinion.
>Jim_Burlant: DIJV K4 JIV. +28 202
>Joey_Krafchick: AENRSXZ M5 RAX +37 205
#note ZAX sims best by 3%. Rax is 2nd best, the next best think AFTER rax is over 3% lower. I figured now that the board is pretty much completely shut off in regards to bingo opportunities, I should keep the Z instead of burning it for only 9 more. ERNS is good, but unless I draw a blank, a bingo is unlikely.
>Jim_Burlant: DFILT C9 FLI.T +24 226
>Joey_Krafchick: AEINRSZ O1 ZAIRES +51 256
#note After lots of iterations, this play came out on top. I was very unsure about it but after good thought I made the right decision according to Quackle.
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEMOR D3 COMRADE +83 309
#note Crap!
>Joey_Krafchick: AEEMNOS L1 MENO +36 292
#note This is the most critical play of the game, and to my relief it sims best by over 5% at 28%ish. 
>Jim_Burlant: ?FOR 1H FORu. +27 336
>Joey_Krafchick: AEEIQSS 14L QIS +28 320
>Jim_Burlant: ADGILPT 15I GADI +19 355
#note (M)AGILP for Jim is best!
>Joey_Krafchick: AEEST 2F TEASE +20 340
#note I played damn well this game, with the exception of not playing WISP(Y) early on. Good game. Championship player agreed with each of my last 2 plays also. Had he only had one vowel I perhaps could have won the endgame, but to no avail
