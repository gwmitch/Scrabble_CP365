>Rafi: ABDILNU 8D BUILD +22 22
>Cesar: ADELQTW F6 QA.D +34 34
>Rafi: ANNOPST 10A NONPAST +80 102
>Cesar: AAELOTW 11D AW +24 58
#note AW is a little too agressive - perhaps AW(N) or WA(N) to keep open bingo lines instead of scoring spots.
>Rafi: ADEILNR A6 INLA.DER +80 182
>Cesar: AEILMOT 13A .OLAMITE +72 130
>Rafi: AAFIJRU G3 FUJI +29 211
#note Quackle likes FUJI/EF, but it seems needlessly aggressive. It's possible that I overestimated the strength of the EF spot. 
>Cesar: ?BIISTW I2 TWIBIlS +74 204
#note TWIBILS/ET sims a little better.
>Rafi: AADILRT H12 D.AR +21 232
#note IDEAL looks a tad better. DEAR is better than DEAL because of the pool.
>Cesar: EEGIMRR 12A .GER +27 231
>Rafi: AILNRST 14A SAL +27 259
#note Chickened out on URINALIST. SAL looks better than AL - no good S hooks on this board.
>Cesar: CEEIMRU H1 CUE +26 257
>Rafi: EINRSTU 5G .I.ER +28 287
#note I don't think fishing is going to work often enough here - Cesar isn't going to open a spot as often as Quackle thinks. If I fish I would probably have to bingo through the R. I prefer setting up the case S and leaving decent bingo potential.
>Cesar: AEIMORX 6A .XIA +27 284
#note AXIOM is best - especially if you infer the S.
>Rafi: GKNSTUV L1 GUNKS +39 326
>Cesar: AEIMNOR M2 MOA +24 308
>Rafi: EHOOTTV N3 TETH +25 351
#note Some other options are OTTO, VOTER, OVERHOT and THO. I was very unsure about playing TETH, but I thought it was important to block the best bingo lane as well as the huge P overlap. I also liked scoring points, but the leave is very scary - and probably too awful to merit making this play.
>Cesar: CEINORY O6 IRONY +29 337
#note OYER and ONERY look best - ditching the E is important with all the E's unseen.
>Rafi: EGOOORV 10J GROOV. +25 376
#note G(R)OOVE looks pretty strong here - blocking the best bingo lane and setting up GROOVER with no D's, R's, or S's unseen. OR is also a very strong leave with 5 E's and a bunch of awkward consonants unseen. GROOVY gives back too much - Z plays and bingoes.
>Cesar: ?CEEPVY O1 PYE +28 365
#note EVE/VEE look to bingo more than this next turn.
>Rafi: EEFHOTZ 15F ZE.OTH +18 394
>Cesar: ?CEEENV K5 .EEVE.t +18 383
#note Not acceptable. NOViCE is best (blocking FORE).
>Rafi: EFO 5D FE +15 409
#note If I challenge and lose, I lose the game. Low on time, should have blocked Cesar's only out.
