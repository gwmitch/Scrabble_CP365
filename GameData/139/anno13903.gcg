>Kolton_K: EOOORVW 15G VOWER +40 111
#note Trying to keep it close despite poor drawing

#note Quackle agrees- only keep E
>Daniel_Goodwin: BOX K4 BOX +36 230
>Kolton_K: ?CDEENT M2 CrEDENT +72 183
#note Getting the D counted twice (scented enacted enticed centred) would be worth more, but I played this in hopes of a challenge.
>Daniel_Goodwin: DGJU 9C JUDG. +22 252
>Kolton_K: AIKLORW 2J WIL.O +36 219
#note Wasn't sure enough about WRICK or WRACK.  I like ARK as a leave too.

>Kolton_K: ?ACKLNR 2A CRANKLe +82 301
#note I thought about trying CLANKER here for 100 (knowinig that it is no good), but opted for the sure thing
>Daniel_Goodwin: AII D1 I.IA +10 288
>Kolton_K: EFIIORU A1 I.IER +24 325
#note L1 F(L)OE is pretty nifty, but URII is an awful leave
>Daniel_Goodwin: ARTTY N6 RATTY +27 315
>Kolton_K: EFGHOSU 14B SOUGH +47 372
#note This play gives me a pretty decent lead, although the remaining tile pool can make this tricky (ZQ)
>Daniel_Goodwin: AEHIILT C7 HA. +17 332
#note If he takes the 3LS at 10J he can Q-stick me. Which, given the letters that I drew, would only minimize spread (if he blocks that I have 3G ZONE for 54 and can outrun him even with the -20)
