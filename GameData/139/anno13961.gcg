>Tasha: BDEIIRU 8D BURDIE +24 24
#note Tasha's Endgame Misadventures - Episode 8.  Al:  Why didn't you just play BURIED? Me: I'm trying to draw a challenge and I'm setting up my S for next turn.
>Al: DEMPRTU 9H TRUMPED +69 69
#note ...I should have played BURIED.  Note:  Al was still drawing his tiles during our little back-and-forth so I know he wasn't being facetious when he suggested BURIED.

>Al: AEIL 3C ALI.E +18 158
>Tasha: FGILOOS 8M FOG +29 151
#note Another alternative is 4A FILO.  I noticed the spot, but didn't see a play, but I would have played FOG anyway.  
>Al: CIKY 4K ICKY +28 186
>Tasha: EIIILOS -IIIO +0 151
#note Quackle likes L9 PILI, but I don't.  I like the board the way it is.  Patience is a virtue.
>Al: AT 4C TA +18 204
>Tasha: DEHLNOS 10J HO +30 181
#note I did consider10J HOED, but passed it up to give myself more leeway when I use the spot later.  Al won't use it himself unless he has something huge like WAXY or something.  
>Al: AOV 3I OVA +10 214
>Tasha: DEELNOS 6B DEN +15 196
#note Bad play and it knew it was bad when I made it.  M10 ED is obviously better.

>Al: INO O1 ION +20 303
>Tasha: ?EIQRSW C2 Q.. +12 260
#note I spent about two minutes on this rack because I suddenly notice the cool Q spot at E7 and was looking for a play at that spot for about 30 seconds.  I spent the next 30 being annoyed at the possbility that I missed something the turn before (I did.  QUALE).  The next minute I went back and forth between this and 5A QI.  5A QI is out of the question because of TRANQ.  I didn't even see 11H QI and I like that play better.   How can I see QI in one spot and not the other?
>Al: IIIII -IIIII +0 303
>Tasha: ?AEIRSW 13B AIRWiSE +75 335
#note I spent about a minute trying to decide between the bingo and SWARE keeping I?.  Al says the bingo is the correct play because I'm too far behind to pass up the bingo and it's not a guarantee that I'll be able to bingo next turn.  But I'm not that far behind and the game is tied after SWARE.  And I was worried about big comebacks after the bingo...like ZAX. There's too many "what ifs" involved, though, which I why I rightfully played the bingo.  Just for the record, AIRWISE does sims best with SWARE about seven points behind.
>Al: AINZ 14H ZIN +29 332
#note Al played NAZI at first then changed his mind to play ZIN.  He was worried about a T-H combo.  This also assures me that he does not have the X.  I hope he isn't drawing it right now.
>Tasha: AINOTTU 12A UNTO +18 353
>Al: AIO J12 .O.I +6 338
>Tasha: AHINTTX 7H THIN +24 377
#note I drew the X.  I win!  The unseen pool on my side looked like AAEEIMRRTU. I spent about four minutes on this rack.  I wasted a minute looking for bingos in the pool (ARMATURE, ERRATUM, MATURER) and then I realized that the board is CLOSED and I'm wasting my time.  After I came to, I became strangely obsessed with O10 UREMIA, but I didn't see a proper block.  Since I didn't see anything (N11 EXIT dummy), I just looked for a decent sequence since I win even if Al plays UREMIA. I went back and forth between cashing in the X with TAX at A7 or 7H THIN.  I played THIN because I liked keeping ATX for next turn.  And the psychological factor.  False hope and all that. 
>Al: AEMRT 15J .MARET +27 365
#note Well, I'll be damned.  I didn't even see IMARET but I guess it doesn't matter since I did not see another possibility and I wasn't able to find a block anyway.   
>Tasha: AERTUX 7A REX +38 415
#note I suddenly realize that I could NOT have played TAX at 7A last turn.  Oh geezus and I was so fixated on that spot too.  I was so close to playing TAX last turn that it's not even funny.   I'm so glad I decided to play THIN instead.  Because I made my last play on the assumption that I could play TAX next turn, I spent about a minute back-pedaling to see what would have happened if I didn't draw the E (Al was getting impatient wondering why the hell I'm not playing REX already) but then I realized I would have won regardless because Al played long and simply drawing the X was essential.
>Al: AI A7 .AI +9 374
>Al:  (ATU) +6 380
#note My absolute biggest weakness in this damn game is NOT my endgame.  I seriously need to start paying more attention to what I'm doing when I'm playing.   What if I would have played TAX? Omg, what if  I would have did that at a TOURNAMENT?
