>Sean_Wrona: CEILOTU 8D CLOUT +20 20
#note This sims better than I thought it would once I saw things like OCULI (which I missed) or TOLUIC (which I didn't know) were options...
>Karl_Higby: IINV D4 VINI. +20 20
>Sean_Wrona: DEEHIKU 9G HIKED +33 53
#note Beats me why I burned the D here instead of saving it for a crossword...
>Karl_Higby: FI 10I IF +32 52
>Sean_Wrona: AAEMRTU K4 MARAU. +18 71
#note Oh, damn.  I missed AMATEUR.  There's another play that could have won me the tournament maybe (especially because neither of us bingoed in this game).  There were MANY better things I could have done besides this anyway.
>Karl_Higby: DOOS 4H DOO.S +20 72
>Sean_Wrona: EEOQTTY 7C Q. +21 92
#note Yeah, I should have waited to dump the Q I guess.  That is indeed a terrible leave.
>Karl_Higby: AENRZ H1 ZAN.ER +48 120
#note Didn't know this word even though it's more common than I realize.
>Sean_Wrona: EEOTTUY 3F TO.Y +21 113
#note Too unbalanced of a leave, but not a horrible option I guess...
>Karl_Higby: DFIRST 11F DRIFTS +36 156
>Sean_Wrona: EEGHMTU 12C HUGE +19 132
>Karl_Higby: ILN 13B LIN +18 174
>Sean_Wrona: AEEMPTY 13F YEP +16 148
#note I wasn't looking in row 2 at all (and PAYEE is the only word I MIGHT have found), but I still like this better than the plays there because I think I already need a bingo and three 28-point plays don't score enough and turn over too many tiles.
>Karl_Higby: CRW 5F CR.W +18 192
>Sean_Wrona: AEJMRST 14A JAM +36 184
#note Oh shit.  I totally know RAMJETS is a word but once again just missed it.  It still seems like I'm in pretty good shape after this, but RAMJETS might have won it (just as AMATEUR earlier might have won it).
>Karl_Higby: OX 15A OX +64 256
#note And these were the worst two tiles he could have had after JAM.  I kind of deserved this after missing RAMJETS however.  If he had an A, I, or a U in addition to his O, he could have played 15G AX, 15H XI, or 15H XU on the next play anyway, but my deficit would still be smaller.
>Sean_Wrona: BERSTTW 7J W.B +8 192
#note And then I don't even draw a bingo after JAM, but at least this is the best fish.
>Karl_Higby: BEINOV 2A BOVINE +30 286
>Sean_Wrona: EEORSTT A1 O.E +15 207
#note Oh wow, I missed ROSETTE too (even though I instantly saw it before simming it, unlike with AMATEUR or RAMJETS).  No excuse for that either.  Really it's amazing I missed three bingos and still lost by as little as I did.
>Karl_Higby: EE 6G E.E +15 301
>Sean_Wrona: ADERSTT M7 STARTED +80 287
#note Well finally, but too little too late...
>Karl_Higby: AEGR 1F GA.ER +19 320
>Sean_Wrona: AAEENPS 8M .EA +9 296
#note Doesn't score nearly enough, and if I'm going to do this, why did I not play PEA instead?  Perhaps I was trying to keep the line at 14F open, but that's giving me too much credit I think.  PEAN or NAPE score more give me a better shot at one of the blanks (both of which he had).  And I can see why N12 NEAP sims the best overwhelmingly, but missing that, PEA instead of TEA is obvious, and PEA did sim the second-best.
>Karl_Higby: GIL O5 GLI. +5 325
>Sean_Wrona: AENNOPS L12 PE +19 315
#note At this point I knew he had both blanks and the goal was simply to keep him from bingoing, but it was already too late and there were few realistic chances to win at this point.  Apparently Quackle says PSOAE N2 has a slim chance but I didn't see it anyway as I was preoccupied with keeping him from bingoing on row 14, but clearly it didn't matter since I couldn't outscore him even if I did that.  The game was lost with TEA (or missing AMATEUR or RAMJETS or ROSETTE).
>Karl_Higby: ??AILTU 5C A.r.... +22 347
#note I've got to admit this is a nice find.
>Sean_Wrona: ANNOS 14H ANONS +16 331
>Sean_Wrona: ANNOS --  -16 315
#note I think I knew in my heart of hearts that it didn't take an S but I thought it was my only chance of winning.  Obviously, at that point, I had NO chance of winning...
>Karl_Higby: ?ILTU I3 ....s +19 366
>Sean_Wrona: ANNOS K1 SO +18 333
#note Reviewing this tournament, it looks like most experts probably would have won with what I had, but it shows promise that I can still finish in second place missing as much as I missed (especially in this game).  On balance though, I think I was more lucky than good, but I'll take what I can get.
