>Chris_Schneider: AFHIT 8D FAITH +30 30
>Kevin_Leeds: EEIINOT D8 .INITE +18 18
#note I didn't really like this play.  OI is better at 9G.  Chris plays pretty quickly.
>Chris_Schneider: EGIJLUY 10B JU.GLE +32 62
#note Afterwards he mentioned that he could have played JUNGLY or else played JINGLY and kept EU but he wasn't sure of JUNGLY.  


>Kevin_Leeds: AEEMNOW 7F MEOW +26 44
#note A long 3 ply Quackle sim supports this as the best choice

>Chris_Schneider: EERSY B10 .ERSEY +32 94
>Kevin_Leeds: AEMNNTX 6I AXMEN +35 79
#note That Y is confusing me.  Must review more words with Y there.  Been focusing on getting the 5s down better.  There are many superior plays to AXMEN including AM, MY, MYNA, TYNE, XU.  

>Chris_Schneider: DEILOP K5 I.PLODE +48 142
>Kevin_Leeds: NNORTVW L9 WONT +24 103
#note WYN or WYNN is way better but I am chicken of WYNN because I used to live pert near to a Winn-Dixie supermarket and Winn and Dixie are both not good.  WYN is even on the 3 letter sheet that is available but I hesitate to look at that unless I am clearly having a temporary insanity moment.  WYNN is the rune for W.  Now you know.
>Chris_Schneider: AELRSY H10 SLAYER +45 187
>Kevin_Leeds: AENRRVZ 5E RAZER +34 137
#note Quackle likes several moves better it seems, like RAVEN 5E keeping RZ, or VAIR or VAIN or VAINER at 5I.  I didn't spot those unfortunately.  I had to convince myself RAZER was OK.   Double Rs are not really bad but I still hate duplicates so I wanted to use an R.  

>Chris_Schneider: OOOO -OOOO +0 187
>Kevin_Leeds: CGILNTV 15A L.TIC +33 170
#note Silly to miss VYING but at least I thought of a good 5 - Chris said 'Hold' and looked up at the ceiling but he did not challenge.

>Chris_Schneider: ADETV M2 ADVE.T +22 209
>Kevin_Leeds: AGNPRRV H1 GRAV. +39 209
#note PARVE was probably a little better since NG synergy in rack is a good thing.  This was played quickly.

>Chris_Schneider: EGQSU D1 SQUEG +48 257
>Kevin_Leeds: NNNOOPR 8A NON..... +42 251
>Kevin_Leeds: NNNOOPR --  -42 209
#note After SQUEG and seeing this rack I was starting to get pretty demoralized.
#I thought I had memorized the NON-  words so I could recite them, but then at the table they wouldn't come to me.  This phony was one I had tried before.  Just try to remember it's UNFAITH.
#Chris seemed to be confident challenging it.  I started to think he is a wizard.

>Chris_Schneider: BFU 1A FUB. +27 284
>Kevin_Leeds: NNNOOPR -NNNOOPR +0 209
#note With PR(E)NOON 14F Quackle says I have about 20% chance of winning!  but instead I exchanged.  I didn't know PRENOON (adj.)  Obviously to become world champion I will have to learn to see more plays.

>Chris_Schneider: ?ADEOSU A1 .ADEOUtS +86 370
>Kevin_Leeds: ?AHKOOR N2 HO +23 232
#note Didn't know REAPHOOK either!  By this time I have given up.

>Chris_Schneider: ABIN O1 BANI +31 401
>Kevin_Leeds: ?AKOPRT J9 PA +20 252
#note Didn't know TRAPROCK either!

>Chris_Schneider: CIIINOO N7 IONIC +11 412
>Kevin_Leeds: ?DKNORT 14F TR.K +10 262
#note When I came up with TREK I only had 10 seconds left before the penalty.  There are several nice plays available through disconnected tiles.
#note My rack here was actually KNORT?, and the D was nowhere to be seen. Maybe someone can show me how to represent this in the .gcg file.

>Chris_Schneider: IO M12 OI +6 418
>Chris_Schneider:  (?NO) +4 422
#note Looks like I lost by 160.  Totally ruined my average, been trying to keep an average near 400 since Laurie Cohen mentioned experts' average of over 400.
