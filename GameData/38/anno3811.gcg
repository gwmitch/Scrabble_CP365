>jeff: ?CCNNOO 8G CON +10 10
#note COONCaN!
>moh: ADILLTZ F7 DITZ +40 40
#note DITZ is best, and it doesn't make much difference whether it hooks I-CON or CON-I.
>jeff: ?CENOOR 10D CO. +14 24
#note OK, old age is setting in (I had to get a birthday jab in). NOnCORE, CORONaE, CONvE(N)OR, CONdO(N)ER, and COR(N)pONE were available.
>moh: AADELLR D10 .ALL +12 52
#note Everything reasonable is pretty tightly bunched here. I didn't go for the points of (C)ALLED or (C)REDAL mostly because you CO(Z) play implies bingo-prone tiles.
>jeff: ?ENORTU 13A OUT.EaRN +66 90
#note 14D aLEURON or 9H ROUNdEL open up a bit less.
>moh: ADDERTY A12 D.RY +30 82
#note I wish I'd seen the cool 11A DAT(A)RY 42, which shuts down the column A hotspot and snags the DITZ-Y hook I wanted. I wsa torn between YARDED/DITZY and my DORY, but decided that I wanted to take block the 3x3 lane and keep pretty nice letters instead of gamble with a drawing more tiles.
>jeff: AAEEFST E4 FATE +17 107
#note Quackle preers H10 FAE(N)AS 30. I think I'd rather keep the bingo-prone draw together. C11 FA(T)E, maybe? 
>moh: AADEIST 14D AD +13 95
#note Somehow I convinced myself that this was akin to drawing to TISANE since there was an N wide open (ICON). Quackle prefers keeping the D and fishing with D3 AI, 14C AA, 12G AA, or D10 (CALL)A.
>jeff: AEEEGIS 15E SIEGE +22 129
#note At least my fish forced your hand here. The same tiles you played make H10 SIG(N)EE for more points, and that's Quackle's choice.
>moh: AEEIOST D2 TOEA +20 115
#note I needed a consonant draw, and I got a vowel draw. I'd seen enough of fishing expeditions, so I eschewed D3 OE 14.
>jeff: AEGLNOR 7H GO +10 139
#note All of Quackle's top plays keep ANGLER: I8 (N)O, G12 O(R), I7 O(N), 15A (Y)O.
>moh: EIILMSX 11C M.X +42 157
#note Quackle says to keep my M, even though it costs my 6 points. I see why, as it avoids the vowel-heavy leave, but that's a lot of points for an M.
>jeff: AAELNRU -AU +0 139
#note 2D (T)AU plays the same tiles you exchanges, albeit at the cost of opening the triple. That play, along with C11 (M)A(T) and your exchange, lead the pack.
>moh: EIILMNS C1 MIL +16 173
#note Or maybe D7 MI, but I prefer MIL in light of your exchange.
>jeff: EEILNNR 1A NI. +15 154
#note Quackle gives a slight edge to (COZ)EN.
>moh: BEINRSU J9 BURNIES +70 243
#note The options are obvious here.
>jeff: EELNRTU 2A UN.. +14 168
#note What a pitiful series of draws. No power, yet no bingos.
>moh: AAIIRSV K5 VARIA +20 263
#note Now that I've pulled ahead, I'm hoping to start shutting the board down, and this is the first step.
>jeff: EEHLRTW 6I WH.LE +25 193
#note L9 THEW sims well, as does J6 HE (altho it keeps the W). WH(A)LE is reasonable, but if I can hook it, the game's pretty much over.
>moh: DEEHIIS N2 SHIED +43 306
#note Best.
>jeff: ?EJKORT 2J JOKE. +32 225
#note You've got to score, unload the clunkiness, and cross your fingers.
>moh: AEEINRT L8 TRAINEE +74 380
#note No one can win against this much luck.
>jeff: ?BRSTUY C5 BUY +17 242
#note Nothing stands out here.
>moh: AGIIOOW 3G AGIO +16 396
#note While AGIO sims best, emptying the bag with an unseen Q was probably a spread killer.
>jeff: ?FPRSTV M1 V.ST +26 268
#note Your play was fine (blocking my Q play and scoring well), but 4L FR(I)T 16 blocked my Q play and threatened 15L SPiV as an out play.
>moh: AEIOPQW H1 WO. +21 417
>jeff: ?FPR M13 FRo +22 290
>moh: AEIPQ 15M .PE +12 429
