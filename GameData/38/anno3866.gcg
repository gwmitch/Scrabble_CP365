>Jason: CIINORY 8D YONIC +28 28
>George_Viebranz: DFN G7 F.ND +13 13
>Jason: INOORWX F6 WI.O +22 50
#note A little bummed George blocked the big X spot, but hopeful I can cash it in soon.
>George_Viebranz: III -III +0 13
>Jason: AIINORX E2 IXORA +29 79
#note Missed (D)IOXIN. (-5)
>George_Viebranz: ?ACEIST 11F ASCITEs +75 88
#note No double-doubles available, but George does have a cool bingo through the X that scores 90. Didn't know the word, myself.
>Jason: ?EIMNUV 12D VUM +20 99
#note Duck likes VI(X)EN, which I considered. Should've played it. The decision to keep two vowels and one consonant will prove significant soon. (-11)
>George_Viebranz: AKRT 2B TRA.K +38 126
>Jason: ?EEEINO 3D E.INE +21 120
#note Happy to see this, the star play.
>George_Viebranz: EHIM H11 .HIME +48 174
>Jason: ?AEEEFO 1A FEE +22 142
#note FEA(s)E, L8. Same score, ditches another vowel. Still, with a 20-35 V-C ratio, I'll get there soon, right? (-4)
>George_Viebranz: DDE H1 DE.D +24 198
>Jason: ?AEELOO C10 ALOE +17 159
#note This is starting to get a little ridiculous. A few minutes ago I was ahead by 11 drawing into ?EIN ... now I'm getting the tar kicked out of me. Toss-up between this, OLEO or OE.
>George_Viebranz: AAGINST B4 AGAINST +66 264
#note Bad break for George, as I have the bingo counterfeiter and can keep the blank. (I)GNATIAS the only other playable.
>Jason: ?EGIOPQ A7 QI +50 209
>George_Viebranz: AJ 14F JA. +28 292
>Jason: ?ABEGOP G13 B.P +21 230
#note Missing PAGEBOy(s). Argh. (-21)
>George_Viebranz: ATV L9 VA.T +12 304
>Jason: ?ABEGOU 8L AGUE +26 256
#note Took a long time debating between OBA/OBE at I13 or this. Q says it's close ... basically, do I want to outrun or play for the bingo? I wanted to bingo. Although I can totally see other players choosing OBE or OBA. A real stylistic choice. (-1)
>George_Viebranz: HLLOR O4 HOLL.R +13 317
>Jason: ?BNOORS J8 BiO.RONS +63 319
#note Duck likes passing on the only playable bingo. If you don't see why now, you will in a minute. (-4)
>George_Viebranz: RW D6 WR. +18 335
>Jason: EINRSUY I1 ERS +23 342
#note OK, so George now has about 2:30, I've got between 10-15 minutes and it whittled down to about 3:00 thinking about this play. I do this, then see a better play SECONDS AFTER HITTING MY CLOCK! R(EXINE)! Argh! If I'd seen it after playing ENS, I'd have been better off. Knowing (S)ENRYU (valuation leader) would've been cool, too. (-14)
>George_Viebranz: DEELTTU 15J .ETTED +24 359
>George_Viebranz: DEELTTU --  -24 335
#note I hold, seeing if I can win without challenging. Shortly after George takes his courtesy draw, Stu Goldman, unsatisfied with Jason Brooks' recent "shh" into the microphone, growls "If the director can't get quiet, maybe I can!!!" loud enough for the room to hear. Stu was on one side of me, Marty Gabriel shouting back "You're part of the problem!" on the other. I wanted to smack both of them, since I was down to less than 1:30. (CP says (N)UTTED wins 6/8 and ties 1/8, BTW.)
>Jason: INOPUYZ A10 UNZIP +29 371
#note I really thought SETTED was good, and upon walking to the challenge computer and thinking of R(EXINE), said "I think I blew this game." YUPON/(DEED)Y wins by 25, this by 12. (-13)
>George_Viebranz: DEELTTU N2 DUET +17 352
#note Now it was George's turn to say "I think I blew this game," and I felt guilty for what had happened. (ETUDE scores and sets up the guaranteed out, but remember, George had like 30 seconds left and I played UNZIP fast.)
>Jason: GOY A3 OY +18 389
#note Y(A)G instead. Didn't see George's best play. (-9)
>George_Viebranz: ELT D1 T..L +22 374
#note Nice. (George did go over on time.)
>Jason: G 10L .G +3 392
#note Missing both better spots. Glad to escape with a win and go 3-0. (-5)
>Jason:  (E) +2 394
