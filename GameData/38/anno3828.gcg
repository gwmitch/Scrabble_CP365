>Cesar: ABEEOTT 8G BOTA +12 12
#note blah.. betta. (-4) the other positioning of BOTA sims better. !
>ChrisW: IV J6 VI. +14 14
>Cesar: EEEIPST 6J .EE +6 18
#note 9G PEE is SO obvious, what am i doing. maybe it was the frustration at no playable bingo. (-5)
>ChrisW: FKOR 5K FORK +34 48
>Cesar: ?EIOPST O2 TOPSIdE +95 113
>ChrisW: MO 9G OM +14 62
>Cesar: ABEGILR M3 BA.REL +25 138
#note it's always amusing when your move doesn't even show up on the list. i couldn't see things like BEGIRT or GIBLET this late in the tourney :) KBAR is nice too. (-7)
>ChrisW: U 2N U. +4 66
#note this would haunt me every move
>Cesar: AAAGIIL L8 AALII +15 153
#note who knows what he kept, but i better start trying to outrun...
>ChrisW: ADLNOWZ -AD +0 66
>Cesar: AEEFGOU N8 AGUE +11 164
#note i kinda liked my move but 11I FUGIO sims better. i didn't want to deal with consonants or an easy X play for him. is that not a concern? it probably wouldn't happen now since he's fishing but the X might pop up later. M12 FEU or FOU i completely disagree with though. (-6)
>ChrisW: ACDEN O11 DANCE +30 96
>Cesar: EEEFIOO -EEFIOO +0 164
#note christ... quackle likes M12 FOE! (-1.5) i guess in keeping with trying to outrun him? i am relieved that his rack seemed to be broken up now.
>ChrisW: AX K10 AX +38 134
>Cesar: EEHIJNZ 14L ZIN. +30 194
#note i think i should have done 1L JIN. quackle likes just dropping 9K ZA! cool. (-1)

#note i'm worr
>ChrisW: GITW C12 TWI. +27 250
>Cesar: ADEENRT 7H RA.D +21 291
#note 11J EXITED is cool.. J6 VIAND sims best. functionally though i don't see how my move is that much worse than VIAND. (-8.5)
>ChrisW: ?CEIRTT 1H CITTERn +78 328
#note noooo
>Cesar: EEMNNTW 12A WE.TEN +26 317
#note luckily for me chris was very low on time and saw that he was likely to win anyway so he let this go, he did hold me for a while. i don't know what the hell i was thinking, though. 10D NEWT is the best legit play.
>ChrisW: DOU 11D UDO +18 346
>Cesar: GHMNPSY 10F HYP +49 366
#note this came straight from heaven. again chris was super low on time. i also played HYP ridiculously quickly to try to force an error, adding the S is better (-12)
>ChrisW: DEINRS A8 SINE. +24 370
#note for chris VIAND wins or anything that ensures an out in two, DRY too. he played SINEW with about 6 seconds on his clock.
