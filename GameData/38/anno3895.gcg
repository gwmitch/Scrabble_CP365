>Biznatch: DIINR H5 INDRI +12 12
#note An odd start.
>Carl: EEINQTU G5 QUIETEN +90 90
#note It's almost like he was setting me up. Hmm...
>Biznatch: EOSW 11C OWSE. +16 28
#note That does not make sense.
>Carl: BGLMOOO D11 .OMB +22 112
#note I dunno what I was thinking here. I was probably thinking, "This will somehow result in an implausibly spectacular display of contrivance involving a Z and two blanks."
>Biznatch: ANT 9G ..TAN +6 34
#note Ugh... who farted?
>Carl: GLOOORT 13A GLO. +14 126
#note Here I'm fishing for the Z for TROOZING.
>Biznatch: COPRTY 15B CRYPTO +36 70
#note Telegraphing the S, or he would have played COPY.
>Carl: BDOORTY F10 B.D +22 148
#note I was really tired when I played this. My mind was trying to tell me to go catch some Zs. 
>Biznatch: CHIKNOP J8 P.CHINKO +85 155
#note Huh, I guess he didn't have an S after all.
>Carl: GLOORTY 15I O.LOGY +11 159
#note Well, I have to block the S hook anyway. Besides which, my opponent may not know the huge play I've set up... But I'll need a particular letter. "Hm, but what letter is it, pray tell?" you might well be asking. I guess you'll have to wait and see. 
>Biznatch: DEEEV 8J .EEVED +41 196
>Carl: AAEEIRT N6 AR.AE +9 168
#note I'm mostly playing this so that he doesn't play REARGUED instead. I strive for an element of symmetry in my artistic endeavors.
>Biznatch: AEEGRRU O6 RE.ARGUE +69 265
#note Good thing I played AREAE first.
>Carl: EIIMOTU 13I O.ETIM. +20 188
>Biznatch: AIJNNTU A6 JAUNTIN. +101 366
#note Now now.
>Carl: FFIRSUW 11I W.IFF +34 222
>Biznatch: AD 14N AD +34 400
#note What a luckbox!
>Carl: IIRSUVX K5 VIX.. +30 252
>Biznatch: H 12I H. +14 414
#note Considering I have both blanks, there really is no combination of tiles for which this would be the best play.
>Carl: ??IRSTU 13A ....US +16 268
>Biznatch: AS L11 .A.S. +16 430
>Carl: ??IRSTZ 14D .RIT +26 294
#note Dooby dooby doo... beware of the penguins.
>Biznatch: AAEELL K11 .L.A. +19 449
>Carl: ??SZ 14I S... +19 313
#note Now hopefully my opponent, who knows REDARGUED, doesn't know ALEE.
>Biznatch: AEEL M5 ALE.E +21 470
>Biznatch: AEEL --  -21 449
#note Whew. That was close. And now, the moment of truth.
>Carl: ??Z 6A .iZz +18 331
>Carl: ??Z --  -18 313
#note Drat!
>Biznatch: AEEL M3 ALEE +11 460
#note Now, we all know that my endgame needs work, so don't act surprised.
>Biznatch:  (Z??) +20 480
