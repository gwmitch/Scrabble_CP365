>Kenji: EOOORRS -OOR +0 0
#note Interestingly to me, Quackle thinks EORRS is only a point worse than EORS.  Interesting.  I saved the O because of all the Os out and because of the lack of scoring options available.  Kind of nonstandard.

#note This is a very brutal position, and I'll consider it for my book, maybe at the end just for how brutal decisions can be.  There's a ton of options here, and I made what I think is the second best play.  As much as I hate on win%, in this position for some reason win% works with my intuition very nicely.

#note A very, very poor play.  DIE is much better.  I think I just airballed on XI o9 which is absolutely vital to understanding this position.
