#note k8- i wanted to get rid of more tiles and still score well here, but couldn't find the play - COMIX was it.
>Jason: AILRRRT H7 R.TRIAL +21 34
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: CEIIINO 5E I.NIC +14 69
#note k8 - should've probably traded
>Jason: ADIIRVW 4B DIVA +18 52
#note Saw no good options. Glad this sims up there with V(A)WARD. Given that there are only three I's left, I think I'd play VAWARD if given a mulligan. (-1)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEHILOO E9 .AHOE +22 91
#note k8 - no great reasoning here... OILHOLE, Q's suggestion, is nice.
>Jason: ?EINRSW B2 RE.WINgS +76 128
#note Going for karma points and it was the most defensive bingo I saw. Must've missed uNWISER at 14A. (-8)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: BEILOPR A1 BOP +27 118
>Jason: ACEOTTU D10 CUT +24 152
#note WTH didn't I play OUT instead? D'oh. OUTACT in the same spot is the star play. (-11)

#note Kate told me at lunch that she considered playing ROLFING here but she was pretty sure it was a past-tense verb. Turns out she should've ... it's good. // k8 - yeah. i suck.  i knew it was a verb, but couldn't remember ROLFED from my six study, so i passed this up, trying to open the board and maybe draw an ess. i was impatient, and i didn't know an easy bingo.
>Jason: AADEMRT 10H .AM +23 199
#note Oddly enough, no sevens OR eights in this rack.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: GOORSSS C7 GOOS +25 200
#note (Kate's exact rack.) / k8 - yeah. got that ess i was hoping for...
>Jason: ADEINRT L4 TREADIN. +74 273
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: HOQRSSY H4 Q. +21 221
#note k8 - i couldn't remember whether horsy was good. it is. i hoped to draw an SY word on the next turn.
>Jason: DGNORTU M7 GOD +22 295
#note Giving Kate an S, Duck likes DRUG or DUNG at 8L. I considered both ... still like this play. (-4)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AHORSSY K7 HAY +27 248
#note gave me more S hooks, i guess. meh.
>Jason: ELNRTUZ 13C ZE. +30 325
#note Ooh, spent so much time on this move and missed (ADO)ZE! I don't know how much I trust sim here ... I was pretty sure Kate had hit her fish since I looked for a while and never saw her shuffle. Still, scoring 15 more with the same tiles and taking out the best -S hook would've been nice. But this worked out. (-21)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: DEORSSU N1 DOUSERS +78 326
#note She wanted to play it at 14B for 89.
>Jason: EELNRTU 1H TENURE. +27 352
#note Yes! I made the right pre-endgame play when it mattered! It sacrifices hella equity, but CP puts it on top! (-27)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEIJNVW 2F JEAN +31 357
#note Best.
>Jason: ?ALY N9 sLAY +15 367
#note Missed the -Y hook to CUTE and, by extension, LAYs for 43. (-28)
>Jason:  (IVW) +18 385
