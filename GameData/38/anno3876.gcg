#note couthie thru the T sims just a tiny bit less well. the U is really that bad eh

>Cesar: AEIKLSU 4D ALSIKE +37 231
#note this move though, was wrong - look at H1 KALIUM and how much, much better it is. didn't see it. O13 SUK is worth a look at, but i thought cheloid might not take the S. 5G AUK sims a little better than my move, and i saw it but just decided to keep up the pressure and score. (-20.5)

#note not quite the right idea, O11 EOSIN keeps scoring. i started going for turnover but that doesn't ever seem right, but all the best plays lose the S. i'm kind of in trouble now, if only i'd found kalium. (-7)

#note i somehow missed fuddy, but i'm not sure how hard i was looking. i was trying to score and score again next turn, etc. but fuddy seems like a much better way to try to win this, especially with the pool! bad miss. (-27)
