#note it's hard to look at 2 blanks and 3 Ss unseen, and my position is not so good, and argue for playing K10 NAH. i think VAHINE is the play. (-0.5) i think if i let it run long enough vahine will catch up ;)

>Cesar: DELNNOR N10 RONNEL +31 265
#note i'm not sure if i should give him a Y inference here or not. i may have been more scared of it than it merited; N9 RONDEL is the move. i also thought rondel made it easier for him to score to the triple. i guess i'm wrong, i don't know - help? (-7)

#note i spent a long time on this. i'm glad adding the extra S seems to be worth it to quackle, it sims 5 points better! what a shame.. my first good power tile and i have to let it go so quickly. the extra bingo defense of GIFTS i think is also worth something.

#note another interesting move. H1 DOGMA is a good alternative but not with this pool.
