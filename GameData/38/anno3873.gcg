#note Close call between this and WINTRY. Keeping balanced leaves is my style.
>Rod: CIIMNOS K5 ICO.ISM +44 44
#note This is phony -- its valid anagram is MISCOIN. Missed bingos = MONISTIC, NOMISTIC.
>Evans: ABDRTTV 5H DAV.T +9 39
#note TAVS 10H, despite keeping four consonants instead of three, looks better.

#note Quackle likes WIT J7! This seems inexplicably bad. Isn't this the wrong kind of board to be making a 13-point fishing play rather than taking a 36-point sure thing? And the weird thing is... Quackle is simming this without even realizing that Rod would probably accept ICONISMS, which skews the numbers even more. I'm baffled. Only a 3-point error in the sim, but I'm still quite surprised.
>Rod: UX A6 .UX +30 145
>Evans: AGHMNOT C1 HOMAG. +24 117
#note Not a very good play. I should have seen OGHAM L11, which not only scores more but also opens the board better.
>Rod: ?GILNOY 1H .OLlYING +116 261
#note Cool play. I held for a while... not really because the word seemed wrong, just because 116 is a big number.
>Evans: ABKNQTU 10F QUANT. +37 154
>Rod: AINV 11E VINA +29 290
>Evans: ABCEEHK B2 BAH +33 187
#note Missing BEAK 4A. This scores a lot more, though, so it's almost as good.
>Rod: EOORT D4 TO.ERO +29 319
>Evans: ?ACEEEK L11 ACKEE +28 215
#note Gotta open lanes.
>Rod: ADGLL 15H GALL.D +24 343
#note Gotta close them.
>Evans: ?EILNNO C9 LEONINe +67 282
#note The only other bingo is NONLIFE in the same spot.
>Rod: ADEEORS 13G RESOA.ED +80 423
>Evans: ADEEIOT 2L ODE +20 302
#note I'm low on time and make a terrible play. I'm supposed to play DIODE N10, which keeps either EAT A1 or ETA 2L to go out next turn.
>Rod: EEIPRSU B11 SUPER +27 450
#note Missing UNRIPE 14B, which is much much better. SEE 7C is then an unblockable 22-point out next turn.
>Evans: AEIT A1 EAT +19 321
#note It's actually two points better just to go out right away with TENIAE 14A or VITAE E11.
