#note Fluked and thought the I hit the DWS with BIPEDAL. Also missed PARBOIL. I think I was a tad too eager to play PIEBALD.

#note Quackle significantly prefers BEAU or EAU, which I thought of. I guess I should keep with the AERO philosophy.

#note Quackle hates this, and puts TUN(E)S at the top. This is a tough play, and I thought about it pretty thoroughly. First of all, the big dangers in the pool here are the J and the Z. And if Brian comes through with Z(E)D and then a bingo or big J play, the game really changes. The other concern is Brian bingoing. However, if he bingos, unless it's with the Z or J (which seems pretty unlikely), I get one of them and play a good score or he gets one or both and I can probably get one on the out play, as there doesn't seem to be a way to play off both Z and J. This scenario is very tough though, and there is probably something I'm overlooking. I think this is a very interesting position, and would love some analysis from all of those great minds out there.
