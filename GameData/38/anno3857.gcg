#note -11.9 G7 MELANIC. 
>Lou_Cornelis: BDEEGLP M3 BLEED +36 84
#note I didn't challenge, Lou looked way to confident.  This play was best.  L4 BLE(E)PED is three back and 8L DEEP is four back.

#note 0. If I miss this it's a big drop to the next best play.

>Jeremy: BEIKRSV 12A BIKER. +30 152
#note -4.6 12D BI(S)K.  Sacrificing 10 points doesn't seem right, but the VERS leave is nice looking next to VS.

>Jeremy: CEGNSUV A12 .UNG +21 173
#note -6.4 3I VUG.  Didn't see the spot.  Got the C for the COTQUEAN extension.
>Lou_Cornelis: ATY E11 A.TY +20 233
>Jeremy: CENRSTV 9B V.N +6 179
#note 0.  Quackle loves V(A)N, but against a human, it looks like a fishing play.  The board is already closed, and keeping a tidy bingo prone leave is not as helpful.  I lean towards V(A)N over V(A)C because an O draw leads to 57 points worth of COTQUEAN, but the tile turnover is only 2 chances to draw an O.

>Jeremy: CEERSTV L7 ..CRETE +32 211
#note -8.8 3C VE(G).  Really?  The CREST leave is nice, but again, where will I bingo?  The COTQUEAN potential is there still too, but it's just a 2 tile turnover.  I disagree.  I give up on fishing for COTQUEAN, I'm getting too far behind.
>Lou_Cornelis: ADEEIRS 14I READIES +88 337
#note This 3 O draw off a 5 tile play pisses me off.  I would have drawn COTQUEAN and not given up a bingo.
>Jeremy: NOOOSSV F1 ONO +8 219
#note -34.5 N1 OVO(ID)S for a 2.5% chance of winning. My play is a Hail-Mary long bomb going for 1 of 2 open triple triple lanes, but I miss the best plays.
>Lou_Cornelis: EERTU O10 RETU.E +21 358
#note I put this on hold, but I know Lou won't risk losing this game at this point.
>Jeremy: HOPSSTV 1D PH.TOS +42 261
#note -1.1 1D HO(O)PS.  The wpct play is N2 VO(ID)S for about a 2% shot to win.  My play effectively gives up and goes for spread control.

>Jeremy: AAIMSVZ 11H AMAZ. +32 293
#note -35.9 B7 VI(V)A Many Ply.  I'm not so sure on how good an idea that is.  Lou will block my Z if he can.

#note 0.
>Lou_Cornelis: ADORU 12H DOR +17 428
#note Lou is low on time.  B8 O(V)A is way better, setting up an out of URD.
