#note VOE is more conducive to the closed-ish board I want vs. this opponent.  Also, the VIT leave is an absolute disaster, whereas AITZ has hope.  Not sure between VOE and VIE, as ZO has some synergy, but ZITI will likely play, and there's not many places for the ZO synergy to play (AZO and ZOA won't likely score, whereas ZITI might)

#note Pretty much have to give credit for a big rack.  Maybe AMU is better, but I really hate LITZ, and I don't like the board shape much.

#note Maybe NIZAM, but I don't mind my play.  NIZAM opens the board a little bit more, but against a very open player, I don't think that's an issue.

#note PIANIST just allows too many free points that anyone can easily find.

#note I don't really want to leave the D, but I think I think I have to.  I'm still behind and this board isn't really that conducive to outplaying opponents.

#note I prefer this.  The J has gotta go eventually and has no shot of scoring on this board.  The FLUXES hook is nice but not that important.

#note This is the kind of play that you want to get from open opponents who aren't very good at tactics.  When you don't leave scoring or bingo spots, they might make a play like this.

#note TNow it's time to play some defense.  Opponent could also have the blank, but as noted before, they seem to struggle with plays on the board after GELATI.

#note COBRA is an option, but it allows more bingos, and I think that my opponent may have trouble outscoring me and is probably going to need a bingo.

#note Ugh.  Held wanting to challenge, but alas, couldn't.

#note Looking at my tournament position, spread isn't important.  This is my 5th loss and I can't afford a 5th loss, and my spread is crap anyway, so I'm not risking much.  Considering that I essentially need this game, I decided this was a better route than a desperation OTToMAN challenge.  Shockingly, it didn't work.  Maybe I should've just hoped for her to accidently transpose tiles or something.  I figure that the odds of this working was about one in 25000 or so, but that's better than zero, and was the only way to get back in the tournament given my position and spread.
