>Sam: EEIIMTV G6 VI.E +9 9
#note Missed the LEKE hook--VIE J6. Terrible. Would have avoided the ensuing disaster.
>Win_Inthara: ?EENOOS J5 ONESOmE +66 80
#note Only held for about three seconds.

#note Wasn't 100% sure but played it.
>Win_Inthara: ACELR 13G C.RA.EL +30 142
>Sam: ABEEOST 3I BO.EA +26 152
#note Was very close to chickening out on this. Huh?

#note Not fatal, but a poor play. I should trade and keep CER or something here.
>Win_Inthara: AA D14 AA +17 287
>Sam: CDEGNPR 8L .GER +15 300
#note I looked back a couple turns later and wondered how I could possibly miss EDGE. CEP C12 is alright too.

>Win_Inthara: IIII -IIII +0 364
>Sam: CDEFINT C9 INFECT +26 344
#note It's either this or DEFI N7. I just thought it was too easy for him to block after DEFI.
>Win_Inthara: DHNNOSU 11C .UD +14 378
>Sam: DGHILUZ D11 .H +20 364
#note Apparently LEZ N7 wins more. I didn't have time to think it through too much, and this seemed fine, and I kept LEZ.
>Win_Inthara: INNOORS O1 .ORNO +8 386
>Sam: DGIILUZ D6 GILD +10 374
#note We were both super-low on time, so I hoped he'd play SIGN and give me ZIN, but he wins after that anyway. Ah well.
