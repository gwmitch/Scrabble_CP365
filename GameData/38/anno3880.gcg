>Pete: EKNRTUV 8H TRUNK +28 28
#note I considered both this and VERTU... I decided to take the points.  VERTU is a slightly better equity play, but the two sim right about even, with TRUNK just slightly ahead.
>George_Viebranz: ?AEFORT K5 FRO.TAgE +90 90
#note GV: It took me at least 3 minutes to find this.  Saw sEAFRO(N)T early on, thought there might be a dub-dub.
#note PZ: Best.
>Pete: DEEPRSV 10G PERV.DES +74 102
#note GV: I would imagine Pete knows all the PERV- words.
#note PZ: Best.  I considered VESPERED* before remembering that that would be a silly silly phony.
>George_Viebranz: AADMNXY 12H MAX.D +36 126
#note GV: I considered MANY L12, but this was 2 more points, unloaded the X and kept the Y (a tile I have come to like).
>Pete: ABLMNNR 13G NAB +20 122
#note PZ: I am surprised that LAMB and BLAM are so much better that my NAB. they win by 4 and 3 % respectively.  I wanted to undouble the N, and I was willing to risk the 4 consonant leave, as I significantly overvalued the synergy of my leave.
>George_Viebranz: AEGINOY 11D YOGI +20 146
#note GV: Big whiff.  My play isn't even on the list.  MA(YO) is best.  I was just brainless here.  I think I got so fixated on trying to find a 6-tile play from 14I that when I saw one wasn't available, I settled for something way worse.  
>Pete: LLMNPRW -LLMPW +0 122
#note PZ: I considered MAWN, duck's choice, but didn't want to get caught in a no vowel pattern for two or three more plays.  I exchange LLMPW... duck prefers exchange LLMNW of the exchanges.
>George_Viebranz: AEHINRS M2 HERNIAS +82 228
#note GV: This word is within the range of words that I have studied.
>Pete: DEELNOR H1 REDOLEN. +80 202
#note PZ: I am a idiot.  I played REDOLENT because I forgot to do the math and see that its anagram scored three more.  They are the only 2 playables.
#note GV: It's rare that Pete makes a glaring mistake, other than choosing to spend time with me.
>George_Viebranz: ACHLORT 2A CHLORAT. +80 308
#note GV: Missed the anagram, which is safer (maybe) and scores 12 more.
>Pete: DEILOPQ 2J QOP. +38 240
#note PZ: Slightly panicked, I decide to make the crazy play to add some variance to the board.  My problem was that either 30+ Q play left huge potential playbacks.  QI N1 sets p 33 points for an I alone.  And with 6 Is useen, that seemed crazier.  Fortunately, duck agrees with my logic.  QOPH slightly edges Q in win % and is much better equitywise.  they both destroy all other options.
>George_Viebranz: AGJOUUW 12A JUGA +50 358
>Pete: DEFIILL B10 FL.ID +34 274
#note  I miss FJELD, basically because I was obsessed with undoubling the Is in a I heavy bag.  FLUID and FJELD are close in sim (less than .1% difference in win %), and I may have played FLUID anyways, as it opens a new line, scores, and leaves better.
>George_Viebranz: GNOSUWW N1 US +42 400
#note GV: Didn't like leaving the double W, but once I pulled the S I felt like my chances of winning this game were awesome.
>Pete: EEIILVZ H12 ..ZE +45 319
#note PZ: MAZE scores and opens, and while the leave, while not great, does have some possibilities on this board.  
>George_Viebranz: GNOSUWW N10 .WUNG +18 418
#note GV: I have to make another play with this shit rack?
>Pete: AEIILTV C1 I.LATIVE +80 399
#note PZ: Only bingo.  George held for a long time before releasing.  I knew the word (it's a grammatical case found in a bunch of languages), but I wasn't sure if it was in the book, as a number of the rarer cases aren't in the OWL.
#note GV: I will confirm that I held for a long time before releasing.  This puts him back in a game I thought I was sure to win.  Chances are decent that he's pulling the case blank.  However, I have never known Pete to phony intentionally, especially in a low-stakes situation like club.  I decided I didn't want to be stranded with the rack I had.
>George_Viebranz: AIIOOSW 14H .OA +19 437
#note GV: Aaaaaaaaaaand let's follow Pete's bingo with an awful play.  WA(Z)OO is an awesome play, the kind I don't see.  Quackle thinks my play is a turd.
>Pete: ?ABEITT E1 B.ATTIEr +68 467
#note PZ: Idiot.  I forget to look for sevens.  BATISTE/BISTATE score 20 more.
#note GV: I guess I'm lucky that this isn't one I have to think about challenging.  Just deal with it and find a way to make some magic happen.
>George_Viebranz: IIMNOSW A12 .OIN +38 475
#note GV: No-brainer.  His J(OEY) would a perfect way to turn an awful endgame rack into gold.  I'm passing up S(C)OW, but I have no choice.  
>Pete: CEEEIOY 15J ICE +8 475
#note PZ: My play wins sim, keeping multiple places to score 20+ with the Y while blocking his out.  Basically, if George screws up here, I can steal the win.
#note GV: A no-brainer for Pete.  From my side of the board, it still looks good.  He's not scoring much here and I think I have a trick up my sleeve.
>George_Viebranz: IMSW 7M .M +4 479
#note GV: I actually don't see EYE or PYE.  I don't really see anything decent he can do here.  He can block my O6 WIS for paltry points and leave me with W(A)I(T)S or WIS I4.
>Pete: EEOY A8 EYE +23 498
#note PZ: best, tied with PYE.  
>George_Viebranz: ISW O6 WIS +23 502
#note GV: one of my favorite kind of games: a slugfest with a fun endgame that I win.  Nicely done, Pete.
>George_Viebranz:  (O) +2 504
