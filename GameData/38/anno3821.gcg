#note This rack reminded me of a baseball player, Rod Carew - stole many bases and batted .400 nearly into August one season as I recall.  I wondered if 'waner' is good but it's not. CANER is valid but not a good choice. WEANER, meaning 'one who weans', would have been better.

>Kevin_Leeds: ACEINRY 6G YINCE +28 38
#note missed CINERARY and NECTARY (didn't know these).  Probably it was better to play off YA somewhere.  This game I noticed John D. taking a lot of time it seemed, so that gave me some confidence I might not have had otherwise.

>John_Dalton: EGI 8A GIE +16 83
>Kevin_Leeds: ADJNOQR E6 Q.NDAR +32 70
#note According to Quackle (at least superficially) JORD(A)N keeping QA is preferable.

>John_Dalton: III -III +0 83
>Kevin_Leeds: GJNOOTW F9 OW +29 99
#note After this I was surprised that 2x2 with the E was sitting there for so long.  John has managed to draw his bingo.

>John_Dalton: AEELRST 12C RESLATE +83 166
>Kevin_Leeds: EGJKNOT K3 JOK. +30 129
#note This was pretty easy to decide.

>John_Dalton: ACDEL 13I DECAL +25 191
>Kevin_Leeds: ?EFGGNT 12L TEGG +22 151
#note I don't really know why I decided to keep the F - Quackle says F(A)NG is best but I had decided that if I was going to keep a G then I had to keep the N too.  So F(A)G or F(O)G would be better than TEGG then.

>Kevin_Leeds: ?BDFIMN J12 D.F +24 175
#note I was excited about D(E)F when I saw it left the two bingo lines open - I could get an ING bingo to the G or else use DEF+I hook to score at the other spot.  Then I drew HLMBIN? and nearly ruptured myself trying to stay calm while John pondered which spot to use ...

>John_Dalton: ?EENRST --  -74 249
#note 'gentures' had to be a time pressure mistake.  Looks to me like GENITURE was misspelled.  I broke a tournament rule by talking about the word GENITURE while going to adjudicate.

>Kevin_Leeds: AEINSUU A8 .UINEA +8 278
#note GUINEA was kind of an error, I could see it would be difficult to spot a bingo along the N row.  But John noticed I'd made an S hook...

>Kevin_Leeds: AEIOPSZ 4C EPIZOAS +91 425
>Kevin_Leeds: AEIOPSZ --  -91 334
#note 'epizoas' is a too much more greedier than necessary. EPIZOA and AIN would have been a fine play. EPIZOOTY is the funniest word ever

>John_Dalton: DEIORSV 4C VOIDERS +77 402
>Kevin_Leeds: AEIOPSZ H1 IZA. +39 373
#note John has a 68 point lead now, and about 1:30 over on the clock.  I have a nice rack and a nice Z play.  How hopeful should I be?  Quackle says IZA(R) is the best shot but I haven't told Quackle about the extra 20 points.

>John_Dalton: ALOV B2 OVAL +26 428
>Kevin_Leeds: AEMOOPS 1H .POMOEAS +89 462
#note Woo hoo! i am the king! This could be the first time I have ever used a 5 vowel 8 as an out bingo.  Maybe not even on ISC.  Sooo lucky ...  If you count up the bingos here, I got 2 big ones, and John got 4 medium sized ones.
