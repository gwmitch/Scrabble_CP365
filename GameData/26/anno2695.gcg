>Steve_Grob: DEEEFGK 8D KEDGE +32 32
>Jason: IILNOOT 9C LINO +16 16
#note Q likes OIL, same spot. (-6.9)
>Steve_Grob: ?BEFIOT 10A OBIT +21 53
#note I don't mind opening up 3x3 lines when holding a blank.
>Jason: EHIIIOT -HIIIO +0 16
#note Well, isn't Q ballsy? It likes THIO at 11C and ranks keeping EHT and EHIT slightly ahead of this. (-5.6)
>Steve_Grob: ??EEFLU A7 bEF.ULEd +80 133
#note I came thisclose to trying to get FLOURENE* by for a 3x3.
>Jason: CDENRSW 10F WEND +31 47
>Steve_Grob: BIMOPTU 11I OPIUM +21 154
>Jason: AACIRTX 13A .XACTA +30 77
#note OK, this may not be the best play with both blanks gone, but a double-digit error? Q likes (M)AX at M11. (-10.2)
>Steve_Grob: BEEIJNT 11C BEEN +33 187
#note Jason: Nice fit from Steve; worthy of a "nice play" from me.
>Jason: DEINRSW 14F WINDERS +84 161
>Steve_Grob: CGIJOTT H12 CO.I +27 214
#note This was a tough choice, to take out the big hot spot and leave myself hamstrung for vowels.
>Jason: AAEEIIL 15L ILEA +18 179
#note Close between this and Q's pick of A(M)IE at M10. (-0.6)
>Steve_Grob: GHIJOTT B6 JOT +29 243
>Jason: AEIMNRZ 12L MAZE +44 223
#note I know the MARINE stem, so it was quite disappointing to have the last tile be a Z ... until I saw this.
>Steve_Grob: EGHIPTU 14A .UG +27 270
>Jason: AINRSVV O8 VARV. +33 256
#note Close between this and VAV at 10L. I debated the two for a while and couldn't pull the trigger on the latter with two S's out. Best in valuation, a fraction of a percentage point behind in wins. If I'd known what his last leave was/this rack is, I'd have played VAV. :)
>Steve_Grob: EHIPRST 7H HIPSTER +69 339
#note I can start to breathe a little bit again.
>Jason: AGINRSY 13M YA +37 293
#note Steve: He's not going to go away, is he? 
#note Jason: Nope. You want me to go away, you have to make me.
>Steve_Grob: AAFIORR 8K OAR +11 350
#note I'm all about shutting down bingo lines after my game one fiasco. It was either this or OAF (in the same spot) for me. I opt to ditch the extra R.
>Jason: AGINQRS 6F QIS +38 331
#note Steve: The collar tightens yet again.
#note Jason: I was debating between ditching the Q for 11 and playing for a bingo or this, and I figured Steve would make the decision easy with his play, which he did. Q doesn't seem to like it as much, but what about QIN(TA)R? Keeps the S (although who cares on this board?), scores and opens a lane.
>Steve_Grob: AEFIORT C3 FARO +23 373
>Jason: AGHNRTY D1 GRAY +35 366
#note Q's looking for the bingo out and says HY(P) at J5. (-19.2???)
>Steve_Grob: EILNSTU 1A LUN.ES +21 394
#note I have to give myself some credit here for not trying GLUTEINS*, which I wasn't sure about, and just wrapping up the W. Wish I would have held back the S, however.
>Jason: DHNOT 2F HOT +27 393
#note Felt like I did all I could. Had a six-turn stretch where I lost 0.6 equity. Just couldn't quite make it all the way back.
>Steve_Grob: IT 1H IT +12 406
>Steve_Grob:  (DN) +6 412
