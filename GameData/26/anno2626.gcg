#note For 18 more points, I should've tacked on the S.

>Phil: AENSTWY 12A W.YS +39 81
#note Don't known TAWNEYS, which woulda been nice. Q prefers YAWS over WAYS? YAWS allows for row 13 little plays like A(C)E that could score a lot; OY has no back hooks so this was more defensive.

#note Shoulda played TANGIEST instead- better tile placement. Both are better than AGITATES 14H.

#note FIX N1 is better for spread. I played SIX cuz I thought his only out bingos could occur on column O; if I had known he had two out bingos that couldn't be blocked, I would've played FIX.
