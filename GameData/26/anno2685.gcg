>Ryan_Fischer: EEGLNTT 8D GENTLE +18 18
#note GELT is probably better even though GENTLE sims best.  I was trying to be aggressive outta the gate.  Who knows what's the better approach.  Anyone?
>Dave_Leifer: EEPWY 7I WEEPY +30 30
#note Well, yeah, that's one reason GENTLE isn't great, but I'm not one to worry about vowels next to DLSes TOO much.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADLPRTY 6G PLAY +36 54
#note Missed ADEPTLY or PTERYLA, 2x2s.
>Dave_Leifer: BCKU 5J BUCK +32 62
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DDIRTT 9I DIT +16 70
#note Another slight miss.  Shoulda been DIRT, IMO, though DIT does just fine too.
>Dave_Leifer: MOO 7E MOO +18 80
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DGHRTW -DGWR +0 70
#note And this is why DIRT is better.  The exchange isn't great, either.  I had a long, involved process re: what to keep.  THRoW for 48 is the only scoring option, but it opens two TWSes and gets me nowhere.  Keeping RHT? is Quackle's first changing suggestion.  There is already a T on the board, so mine is less useful, even though that's not even a lane T.  TH goes well together.  R, not so much, but RTH is okay, which is why, I can see, they might be good.  But then, I might be overloaded with consonants again if I get unlucky, and with nowhere to hook, that's a bad prospect.  Help?
>Dave_Leifer: GIORU N1 GUIRO +25 105
#note Very generous of him.
>Ryan_Fischer: ??HIOTU 1G sHOUTIn. +83 153
#note ...and I should've seen OUTweI(G)H for 140, but didn't quite take enough time for it.  He said it was a hard find, yeah, but when OUT is on your rack, it makes it a little less forgivable.
>Dave_Leifer: HIRRW 2F WHIR +29 134
#note He flashed an extra R he couldn't use.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEJOOR 9C JO +20 173
#note Didn't like GADJO; DOJO gives up a bit too much as well, although, sure, I'm giving up a big potential underlap (though I do have a case O).
>Dave_Leifer: AFIR 10J FIAR +30 164
>Ryan_Fischer: AADEOQR 3L QA.D +28 201
#note AQ(U)AE is an option, but not a great one.
>Dave_Leifer: AGLU C9 .UGAL +26 190
#note He took a while on this.  It's hardly a fish, which is what makes what happens next so painful.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEINOR 11A OR.ANDIE +70 271
#note Thanks.
>Dave_Leifer: AEINRST A8 SEN.RITA +131 321
#note Ow!
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEIMNS M9 B.IME +24 295
#note Hah, got a phony by him.  I kept wanting to play BIMENSE (BIMENSAL's good -- why not?).  Was just a bit shellshocked after the 3x3, trying to figure out how to bingo again, salvage a game that shoulda been mine.
>Dave_Leifer: FO L12 OF +23 344
>Ryan_Fischer: EENNSSV H11 .VENS +36 331
#note Good way to do it.  I've got my eye on the BUCKOS hook too, which I'm betting he questions.
>Dave_Leifer: ACELN 3D CLEAN +25 369
#note one lane down.
>Ryan_Fischer: ENSSTTZ 13G Z.ST +24 355
#note Best, happily.
>Dave_Leifer: EX 12C .XE +40 409
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAENSTV O5 SAVANT +41 396
#note And that's all she wrote, couldn't quite cash it in.
>Dave_Leifer: DEIOR D1 DI.ER +20 429
#note Missed his out of DORIE(S)
>Ryan_Fischer: E M5 .E. +10 406
>Ryan_Fischer:  (O) +2 408
