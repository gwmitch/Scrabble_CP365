#note it likes it better at 8F! (-0.8)
>David: EIR 9F REI +12 12
>Cesar: CDEMORY J6 MERCY +33 45
#note i somehow miscounted this as 26. 7I MY sims best, i guess the leave is strong plus i keep the C for MYC. (-4)

>David: ?AEFINT 1K .ETIA +18 50
>Cesar: EEGHKPU E10 PUGH +28 145
#note PUKE in the same spot, but i'm iffy on that. i like PUGH better. (-3)
>David: AEN D11 NAE +19 69
>Cesar: BEEIKLU 3K .UK +14 159
#note *GAG* i honestly spent too long debating whether i should play TUBELIKE then decided i just did not want to play a word i wasn't 100% sure of. (-65) i'm very sure i'd play it if i cared about anything at this point.
>David: AN K10 AN +9 78
>Cesar: BCEEILO 12H BELIE +23 182
#note yes, OLEIC or OBELI is good here, with what he's telegraphing, but i DONT CARE at this point. they're basically tied in the sim.

#note N12 STOT (-1.5) or 14G TAV or VAT
>David: QT 14G Q.T +12 193
>Cesar: CISSTVV 14K VI.S +16 258
#note 5K EVICT is sensible. (-1)
>David: BEL N6 BL.E +14 207
>Cesar: ACIRSTV O4 VIA +14 272
#note this was a bit frustrating. i really hated that GNU spot but had no idea what i could do. 12C VAGI seems great, though. the sim winner is N1 ITS. (-1) O3 VITA has to be better than VIA, should see that.
>David: ADEITWZ -ADE +0 207

#note wow, this sims highest?!
>David: ?FGGINR C5 FoRGING +67 274
>Cesar: ?AIORTZ 8A ZI. +39 337
#note H1 ZOIC is the move here, talk about being lazy. (-9)
>David: ADEWX D2 WAXED +39 313
#note david immediately said DEWAX after he hit the clock.. doh!
>Cesar: ?AOORTT 2A TRO. +14 351
#note this was very difficult for me. i wanted to block the three bingos i saw SODOMIZE, DOWNIEST, and DOWNTIME, but he could have had OZONISED/OZONIDES, which i didn't see, so this is not a winning play. add that to the fact that i'm leaving a huge opening on the E column. yuck. TAO E5 wins 93% of the time vs my move at 77%... seems the computer isn't concerned with Z bingos. 93% seems a little too high. (-16)

#note what a lucky draw
