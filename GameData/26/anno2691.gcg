>Jeremy: ACEEEIT -EE +0 0
#note 8G CEE pulled ahead at the last minute of the sim.  -0.6 points.
>Ross: ADIJMZ H4 MAZJID +56 56
>Ross: ADIJMZ --  -56 0
>Jeremy: AACEEIT 8H AE +4 4
#note Simmed with knowledge of 6 of Ross' tiles, this move is simply bad.  -26.3 points to 8F AECIA.
>Ross: ADIJMUZ 7G JAM +32 32
>Jeremy: ACEGIOT 9I GOA +14 18
#note 91 GO (with knowledge of ZID in Ross' rack).  -12.3  Yeah, dumb.
>Ross: IORSZ 8K ZORIS +56 88
>Jeremy: CDEIORT O1 CORDITE. +89 107
#note Best
>Ross: BDI J5 DIB +23 111
>Jeremy: ?AHPPTU 10K PHUT +25 132
#note I chickened out on MEGA, turning down the best play 10I APP.  Ouch.  -11.1
>Ross: EELW N2 WEEL +31 142
>Jeremy: ?ALPTTU 11G PUTTs +40 172
#note 3J PUTT(ER).  I didn't want to see a 2x2x connected to (ZAP)S.  -7.8 equity and out a blank tile :-(  Time to start playing better.
>Ross: CEIINOV 5C INVOICE. +78 220
>Jeremy: AAFILNO H1 FOLI. +33 205
#note D1 FANO(N), close.  -0.5
>Ross: AX 4L AX.. +24 244
>Jeremy: AAFHINQ 4C QI +37 242
#note Best
>Ross: EY G2 YE +14 258
#note Ross starts rossing up the board.
>Jeremy: AAFHLNU 10F FUN +20 262
#note Remind me not to play at Tim Hortons with blaring music again.  Clearly my concentration is messing up.  H11 (U)HLAN -11.8
>Ross: AENNRST 12A TANNERS +71 329
#note Not looking good
>Jeremy: AAHIOOR 11C OOH +26 288
#note 13A OHO.  Slightly less valuation, but better odds on bingo next.  The best valuation is 3L HO(ER) for 37, but that keeps an unsightly leave.  -2.6
>Ross: AEW A12 .WAE +21 350
>Jeremy: AADIRRU 9D ARID +21 309
#note 2 ply sim says 9D RAID -5.1 equity,  Many ply sim agrees with me 9D ARID is the winningest play with 10.87% win percentage. I absolutely love my play of ARID.  It gets attention that I threaten a 50 point K play at 8D.  If Ross takes the spot he opens another bingo lane for me.  Ross wasn't sure about jumping on it (giving me a new bingo line if he does), but did take the bait.
>Ross: EEMN 8A NEEM +34 384
#note I offer to concede the game to have enough time to play another.  (I drew rotten tiles after ARID and thought I'd be 2% at best to win at that stage, but Ross wanted to play it out)
>Jeremy: AKLORUV I1 AUK +35 344
#note Best.  8.35% to win the game.
>Ross: ?ABGINR 14A .B +8 392
#note Ross let me know this rack, and Quackle says it is indeed the best play.  Better than 14A (A)BRAdING for 74 points, and it wins 99.51% of the time.  Interesting.
>Jeremy: ALORSVY A3 SOVRA.LY +65 409
#note A spot O10 SAVORY, but then I spot possibly the coolest play I've ever spotted before.  It will win 45.70% of the time, but probably less with the blank unseen.  Best.
>Ross: ?EGINRT C10 G..E +10 402
#note M6 RE(R)O(U)TING and N7 b(I)T(T)ERING are the difficult out bingos.  13A (W)REsT, O10 sERING, 3K sTE(ER), 3K sNE(ER), O10 sTRING, K1 GRIT, and K1 GIRT all win the game for Ross.
>Jeremy: DEGLS 3L LE.. +28 437
#note Best.  One of many game winning plays for me now.
>Ross: ?INRT N10 .INTeR +10 412
>Ross:  (DGS) +10 422
