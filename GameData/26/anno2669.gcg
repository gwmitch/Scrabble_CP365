>Pete: AEGHPSS 8D PEAGS +22 22
#note Chickened on PHAGE/PHAGES. the top 8 plays are different iterations of those two words.  Then miss HEAPS.

>Pete: ?DEHOST E2 HOSTEl.D +75 97
#note missed SMOOTHED or ETHMOIDS for one more point.  
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EEIILNT 11D .ELINITE +90 116
>Pete: CDEOORU J7 EDUC.OR +16 113
#note My first missed bingo of the tourney here. DECOROUS, which I've never seen before.  My play is awful here... but I was hoping the use the front hook later and draw a challenge later.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: JO D3 JO +31 147
>Pete: AEOOOTV H11 .OVAE +27 140
#note best.

>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEINNRS L9 INSANER +77 240
#note It's almost like Jeff doesn't want me to win.
>Pete: ?ABORUU F10 U.U +5 231

>Jeff_Fiszbein: AZ 10B ZA. +33 273
>Pete: ?ABHOQR 9I Q.A. +23 254

#note As Jeff challenged.  
>Pete: ACFIMOT 2J C.MFIT +38 369
#note was very pleased with this play, and was surprised to see how far down the list it was.  FORMIC on the bottom wins... COMBAT TOMBAC through the B and a couple others also are better equitywise.  COMFIT movesup to 3rd in sim. TOMBAC wins sim.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: GRU 14F GU.R +18 317
>Pete: AADENOR 3M ADO +23 392
#note ADO (along with ATONED O1) is best, but VERANDA 13H woulda been sweet, if a bit suicidal.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ALX C12 AXL. +27 344
>Pete: AEENNRS N7 ENSNARE +81 473
#note best of 5 playable.  Find the disconnected 9 on Row 5.
