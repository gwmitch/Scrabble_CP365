#note saw the bingo, didn't want it, just felt wrong to use the S to gin up a 65-point turn.  also saw YUPON but knew the duck would like the S leave best
>Barb: ADDEILL 11A DALLIED +76 120
#note Coincidentally, we had discussed this earlier in the day.  I facetiously regretted teaching her the word.
>Jeffrey: ?AHILOS 15H SHOALI.g +149 259
#note Monster Draw!  Best!  Didn't know HALI(D)OmS nor SIpHO(N)AL, coolest play was SHItLOA(D)!  Wasn't 100% on this, because I was remembering SHOALERS*.  SHOAL is a verb meaning to turn shallow- awee bit o' the Scottish, I'll warrant!

>Barb: EOV -  +0 193
#note Considering she has played OUISTITI and other 5v8s before, I wasn't sure if she would challenge.  The blank may have thrown her off- I know it does with me sometimes, anyhow.
