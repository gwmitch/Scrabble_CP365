#note honestly, i just wanted to score some, and bruce often finds small plays for a lot, so i wanted to put something on the TLS. i know this had leaves that were probably worth fishing for.  Q prefers GLOAT or OCTAL as a five in that spot.

#note i was getting low on time (for me) and having trouble figuring out what to do.  my drawing this game also had me pretty flustered, so the blank was nice, but i was stressed out that i ws going to lose despite the lucky draw.

#note agonized b/t YETI 4F and BUY 4D. Took the couple extra points, and left the bingo lane available, since i felt more likely to bingo.
