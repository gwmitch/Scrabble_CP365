>Phil: ADDEERT 8H TREADED +72 72
#note Normally this placement would be perfectly good, but considering that Phil had to beat me by slightly more than 200 to win the tournament, it makes sense not to take out a red square, just to maximize the chance of a triple-triple happening.  In his situation, I probably would have played REDATED 8B.
>Dave: ACENRSY H3 ANCES.RY +64 64
>Phil: AEGLORT 7A LEGATOR. +62 134
#note Phil has exactly the kind of board he needs to have a chance.  Unfortunately for him, I also have good tiles.
>Dave: ?ILNOVW B2 INWOV. +40 104
>Phil: DESUU 3A U.USED +14 148
>Dave: ?AAEJLN 6E AJE. +56 160
>Phil: ?FIILST K4 FILI.TeS +90 238
>Dave: ?AABCLN N1 BALANCe. +86 246
#note I suppose I could have gotten really conservative and played this at M2, but I figured the chance of a nine timer was ridiculously small.  Even then, he wouldn't necessarily catch me on spread.  Fortune favors the brave.
>Phil: EHOOY J10 HOOEY +41 279
>Dave: EILMNQZ M2 LEZ +41 287
#note MIssing ZINE or MIZEN L1.
>Phil: BFGO 13I B.FOG +28 307
#note Good timing.  He blocked EQUINE.

>Dave: EIINOQU 10A .QUINE +37 358
#note I was a tad disappointed there were no L's left for the insertion play.
>Phil: AHIK 12L HAIK +45 379
>Dave: IINORST 15E IRONIST +83 441
>Phil: GOPR -  +0 379
#note Challenged HOOEYS, a completely logical thing to do given his tournament and game situation.
>Dave: EIMNPUX O1 EX +49 490
#note I played this quickly, then realized that I could have done XU O4.  Not a big difference.
>Phil: GOPR 14L GORP +25 404

#note Phil gave a helluva fight.  The JQXZ were the difference makers in this one.
