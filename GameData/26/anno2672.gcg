#note Jeff won a bag of Smooth Tiles for this play.
>Steve_: DEJPRTX J6 JE.P +29 29
#note Way down the list, and almost eight points in back of PR(O)JET.
>Jeff: GISV 10G VIGS +26 102
>Steve_: DIRRTTX E7 T.RRID +14 43
#note Clearly I need to study my JXQZ nonbingos. T(O)RTRIX is clear and away the best play here. About an 11-point error.
>Jeff: DIOTV K3 DIVOT +29 131
>Steve_: AEINTUX D11 XI +33 76
#note Another misplay with a biggie. Best is EAUX at D12; this one cost just under six points in equity.
>Jeff: APZ J2 ZAP +41 172
>Steve_: AENRTUW L6 WAN +23 99
#note WA(S) F6.

#note Jeff is burning tiles and running away with this game.

#note Jeff gives me one chance, while burning six more tiles.

#note E(PI)C(U)RE is the sexy play. I didn't see that, of course. Q likes to keep fishing, however, and plays VEE G10.
>Jeff: ADK E3 DAK +33 351
>Steve_: ADEEILQ 4J ..Q.E +32 239
#note Should have added the D on the end for eight more points. My thought was to keep the extra consonant, and a hook for scoring.
