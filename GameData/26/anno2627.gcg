>Sam: ?DFGGTY -FGGTY +0 0
#note According to Superleaves: D=0.43 and T=0.19, but ?D=27.47 and ?T=27.65. Interesting...but the plays sim basically equal. 
>Karl_Higby: ABJ 8G JAB +24 24
>Sam: ?DEMNTY H5 DYN.MiTE +64 64
#note I overdrew here, idiotically. The overdraw has to be the stupidest mistake in Scrabble. I resolve to be more careful in my drawing. Anyway, this is the only bingo.
>Karl_Higby: AFLW 6D FLAW. +16 40
>Sam: AAIOOST 5D OAT +17 81
#note This is a bad play. I looked and looked for plays underlapping JAB on row 9, but not for column G and I plays parallel to DYNAMiTE! OBA I7 is best. 4.5-point mistake.
>Karl_Higby: AFX 7D FAX +35 75
>Sam: AEIIOOS -AIIOO +0 81
>Karl_Higby: ?EENORU 11E dEU.ERON +78 153
#note This showed that Karl probably didn't know DYNAMITER. 
>Sam: EEGHOSZ 10K GEEZ +39 120
>Karl_Higby: AAIM N10 .AMIA +32 185
>Sam: EGHOPQS 15J QOPHS +39 159
#note Part of the problem with QI 13M is that I didn't know any of the sevens and eights in EGHOPS?? other than GOPHERS. PISHOGE, PISHOGES, PISHOGUE, SHEEPDOG (ok, knew that), PHOSGEEN, ESOPHAGI (would never have found that), DOGESHIP. POSH and GOSH 15L also sim slightly better here. 3-point mistake.
>Karl_Higby: DIKN 4A KIND +50 235
>Sam: DEGLOOS A1 GOO. +27 186
>Karl_Higby: CINV 13K VIN.C +20 255
>Sam: DELNPST 8A PEDS +37 223
#note Did not see sim favorite PELTED 12D, but did see PLED 13E. Perhaps it was greedy, but I wanted to keep the DYNAMITER/DYNAMITED hook open for more points, and a possible challenge. 6-point error.
>Karl_Higby: IITT 10B TITI +7 262
>Sam: ABELNTU M7 BLU. +10 233
#note Shit. Kept thinking NEBULATE* M3, never TUNEABLE. Of course I saw TUNABLE/ABLUENT. I am 7/7 on ABEELNTU in cardbox, haven't seen it in 45 days and won't for 38. One thing to study is -ABLE/-EABLE bingos, like RIDABLE/RIDEABLE. BLUE looks like the best non-bingo at least. 50.5-point mistake.
>Karl_Higby: COY 8L C.OY +36 298
>Sam: ADELNTU 13B LUNATED +83 316
>Karl_Higby: EEIINUV -  +0 298
#note Challenged--I think DYNAMITED was the one he was unsure about.
>Sam: HINRRSW B2 WH.N +35 351
#note Uh, wow. I believe I had plenty of time as well. I was so excited when I saw this that I missed WHIR and WHIRR B2, both of which I had seen as possibilities on my rack. Horrible. 18-point mistake. He held this, btw.
>Karl_Higby: ILO O11 LO.I +16 314
>Sam: AEEIRRS 5H .REARIES +68 419
#note Held briefly
>Karl_Higby: GIRT O1 TRIG. +24 338
>Sam: AEEORUV F1 OVER... +25 444
#note VOMER 9F is two points better. Didn't see it. 
>Karl_Higby: EIRS 14A RISE +16 354
