>Jason: EGINRTU 8F TRUEING +70 70
#note A nice idiot-proof opening rack.
>Brian_Bowman: VX I7 V.X +25 25
>Jason: AIMRSST 10F MAST +26 96
#note One of those where I knew I was missing a bingo. Damn Brian for blocking the eights through the E! TSARISM is 77; MISS(T)ART 64. (-30.0)
>Brian_Bowman: IIIII -IIIII +0 25
>Jason: IIORRST K5 IRO. +8 104
#note Missed RI(G)ORIST. And I saw TORI and TIRO at 11E but couldn't resist drawing to STIR with 11 E's out. (-43.8)
>Brian_Bowman: CDHIL L1 CHILD +31 56
>Jason: ACIRSST 2K C.AT +18 122
#note Let's complete the trifecta by missing TRIASS(I)C. At least I correctly passed on SATIR(I)CS! (-41.0)
>Brian_Bowman: AAAAAAA -AAAAAAA +0 56
>Jason: DILNRSS L8 .ILDS +14 136
#note I didn't miss a bingo! (bows) No autographs, please. One of those with many options. (-3.0)
>Brian_Bowman: OW F6 WO. +14 70
>Jason: ABDNRSU 11E DUB +20 156
#note Bingo miss No. 4. Chickened out on SANDBUR, which really scores at O2. (-58.2)
>Brian_Bowman: AIMO 6B MIAO. +16 86
>Jason: ANOPPRS 10K P.OP +14 170
#note A few plays have higher win percentages, but this is better in valuation; only PAN at 5C is better in both. (-1.1)
>Brian_Bowman: AHJ C3 HAJ. +28 114
>Jason: ANNORSW 5C .AW +38 208
#note OMG! Five bingo misses! I wasn't 100% on NONWAR and figured it was an adjective even if it was good. And where are those damn E's? (-50.5)
>Brian_Bowman: AQT B2 QAT +31 145
>Jason: ?ENNORS O4 NEuRONS +80 288
#note 2-for-7 in bingoing with bingo racks. A .286 batting average isn't bad, right? (shakes head) Figures, keep missing drawing into RINS, STIR, etc., but a crap leave like NNORS gets there after a dream draw. Q likes the anagram, which I always forget. (-0.5)
>Brian_Bowman: IIII -IIII +0 145
>Jason: ?AGILTZ 1L .LAG +25 313
#note Finally the equity hemorrhaging starts to subside. Q likes GI(D) at 11J. (-2.3)
>Brian_Bowman: EKNOR 12A KRONE +31 176
>Jason: ?FIRTVZ B11 F.IZ +32 345

>Jason: ?EFRTVY H12 V.RY +42 387
#note I made the best play! (fanfare)
>Brian_Bowman: IU K10 .IU +18 259
>Jason: ?EEFGOT 14F FE.E +32 419
#note Q likes FORE better; why I can't tell you. Does it think I'll duck all six E's on my pick? (-1.2)
>Brian_Bowman: AO A11 O.A +14 273
>Jason: ?BEEGOT D4 B.. +20 439
#note Missed G(R)EE and B(R)EE at 6J, which would require me knowing CHILD's other back hook. Will the mistakes never end? (-17.1)
>Brian_Bowman: EE 14B .EE +15 288
>Jason: ?DEEGOT N10 .ODGE +18 457
#note G(R)EE is better than this phony, even though it stayed on. Should've just played DOGE at J3. (-3.0)
>Brian_Bowman: EEINTUY J4 TYE +19 307
>Jason: ?ET 15G T.Ee +12 469
#note Put the blank on the left and make it an S; it's five more. OMG, what a horribly played game. There is no justice.
