>Eric_Harshbarger: AKNPR 8H PRANK +32 32
#note We talked about whether it's worth it to play back and save a few points to prevent the snapbacks of PRANKING and PRANKISH.  He likes volatility.  I do too, but that leaves things a bit too much to chance.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABFNSTT J6 AB.FT +14 14
#note Best, happily.
>Eric_Harshbarger: ELOT L8 .ETOL +18 50
>Ryan_Fischer: FNNOOST M11 FON +19 33
#note Best, oddly, though I didn't like sticking those hooks out there even though I had one.
>Eric_Harshbarger: ?DEHTUW 6F UnTH.WED +66 116
#note Nice find by him.  He was feeling good at this point, but watch the way things swing!
>Ryan_Fischer: ANOQSTZ L1 ZONAT. +50 83
#note Interesting choice here between this and QATS for 40.  Hard to pass up 10 points, drawing 5 to QS isn't horrible, there IS an open U, and he might counter with 39 up top.  I like the volatility of my play here, especially 'cause there's a chance he can't counter and I have the S, meaning all I need is a Z three to use the TWS if he doesn't.
>Eric_Harshbarger: AIIIJPV 4H AJIV. +16 132
#note Which, much to his chagrin, is what happens.  Yowch*.  He told me his rack here -- think I got it right.  Painful.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEENQST 1L .EDS +42 125
#note Hehe.
>Eric_Harshbarger: IIIPUU -IIIPUU +0 132
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ENQRTU O1 .QUiNTER +98 223
#note QU(O)TE is actually much better.  I didn't look long enough.
>Eric_Harshbarger: EHIMN 5B HEMIN +22 154
>Ryan_Fischer: CDMOSSU 4A MODUS +40 263
#note Happy little overlap.
>Eric_Harshbarger: AEGILNR 9B NARGILE +64 218
#note Missed (P)EARLING.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEGOSV D8 D.OVE +22 285
#note Much better is G(R)OVED, which I shoulda seen.  Couldn't quite pull it out.
>Eric_Harshbarger: OOR A1 ROO. +18 236
>Ryan_Fischer: CGIPRRS 13C CRISP +34 319
#note Chose this spot 'cause it's a bit more defensive.  Sure two Ys are unseen, but would rather not put the S hook on the right TWS.
>Eric_Harshbarger: AGII 11D .IGIA +18 254
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGORTY 14I GYRATE +43 362
#note Little bit o'luck.
>Eric_Harshbarger: UX 15N XU +36 290
>Ryan_Fischer: EILOSWY 12H YE +18 380
#note Saving the final O, leaving one in the bag.
