>Vera_Bigall: EEKSX 8D KEXES +42 42
>Pete: ?DEGHIU 9F UH +27 27
#note Either DUH or UH work here.  I liked leaving the D for an ED bingo hooking UH.
>Vera_Bigall: AEINOSV H1 EVASION. +86 128
>Pete: ?DEEGIM 3H .DEEMInG +76 103
#note best.  REIMAGED only other, but it scores 10 less. I needed to stay in range.
>Vera_Bigall: EGIR 2F GI.ER +22 150
>Pete: ?DEINNP 5E PIN.oNED +90 193
#note One of two 2X2s, PINNIPED the other.  Love drawing the second blank bingo immediatetely after playing the first blank bingo.
>Vera_Bigall: BEIO O1 BO.IE +27 177
>Pete: ADFILLV 4K VID +35 228
#note this or VALID 68 are about equal.  I like the style points for VID, tho.
>Vera_Bigall: OTU 4D OUT +12 189
>Pete: AAFLLQU 1D QUAL. +29 257
#note best.  You couldn't have payed me to take the points with AQUA.
>Vera_Bigall: ILST D8 .ILTS +18 207
#note Seeing the S burned here did not sadden me too much.  I liked the board, and I felt good about where we were.
>Pete: AABFLRT C2 BARF +22 279
#note ABAFT woulda been nice.
>Vera_Bigall: CCHOPTU 6B PYC +29 236
>Vera_Bigall: CCHOPTU --  -29 207
#note This was not a difficult challenge.
>Pete: AAILNTT B2 ALT +21 300
#note Missed LATTIN b1, which would been sweet.  ALT kills a line, and has a decent score and leave.  Playing with the lead is easier than the converse.
>Vera_Bigall: OPTY 11B PO.TY +20 227
>Pete: AILNRTW A1 TWA +29 329
#note best.  Looked for a while for some weird bingo with this rack... there's none on this board.
>Vera_Bigall: AGU F11 .UGA +10 237
>Pete: AILNORY B11 .OLY +18 347
#note Saw, but chickened out on, ROPILY.  POLY is alright here.
>Vera_Bigall: CDO 6D DOC +28 265
>Pete: ACIMNRW 12A M.W. +17 364
#note Wanted to pretty much kill the A column.  Who's gonna find an ISM bingo, anyways.  About equivalent with AWN equitywise.  COWS in the same place will sim slightly, but both are 98+%.
>Vera_Bigall: AH A14 AH +20 285
>Pete: ACIINRR 6J ARIN +24 388
#note A calculated risk.  After the earlier challenge, I felt I had a decent chance at getting away with ARIN, and it would nicely clean my rack and render the N column less dangerous.  RIA in the same place scores less, and was the right play.  I got greedy... and I got away with it.

>Vera_Bigall: EJN 14D JE.N +11 296
>Pete: ACIORST A5 ACROTIS. +97 485
#note Glad I've been studying.  That's a new one in my repertoire.  I remembered the possibility of the ISM bingoes, and it finally hit me to look, after trying to find something elsewhere.
>Vera_Bigall: EEFORRZ N5 REFROZE +100 396
>Vera_Bigall: EEFORRZ --  -100 296
#note The desperation phony... which comes when I have a tie and don't need spread.
>Pete: EN 15G EN +8 493
#note best.  I liked this game.  I felt in control, and ACROTISM was kinda cool.
>Pete:  (REFROZE) +38 531
