>Judy: AEIILNN 9I ANILINE +64 64
#note Wishing now I had put the J on the star!
>Steve_: ACHKOTY 8L AHOY +58 80
#note Spent a long time deliberating over this play, especially on whether I should burn the A for another eight points. While this is the highest scoring play (of many high scoring plays), Q likes O5 CHOKEY best.
>Judy: AOT G8 .ATO +12 76
>Steve_: CEKLNRT 11F R.CKET +24 104
#note I'm chastising myself for not keeping that A as part of my leave instead of looking for the best play. T(HI)CKEN uses the same tiles and scores 10 more points, but it's CL(ON)K in either of two spots that wins the day with Quackle.
>Judy: ADEL H11 .LADE +27 103
>Steve_: ELMNQRU 13F QU.LM +18 122
#note I'm hoping to draw an i after this play in order to play the extension (it it's still availabe.)
>Judy: CINOOST 15B COONTI.S +61 164
>Steve_: DEFNRTV -FDVN +0 122
#note FR(ON)D deemed best. My thinking was to not block up the board any further now that I'm behind, and to go for one of the four remaining i's in the bag.
>Judy: BFU 7J FUB +19 183
#note Good thing she didn't know B(ROCKET); I didn't either, btw.

#note First missed bingo of the tournament, sure not to be the last.
>Judy: AADIMPT -I +0 264
#note Judy exchanges a single tile!
>Steve_: ?ENOSUW 7N .W +14 270
>Judy: EG 4L .EG +9 273
>Steve_: ?EGNOSU M3 G.. +8 278
#note Feel I need to take out this hot spot in case her last play was a set up. Something like WAX or even WAD would be a killer.
>Judy: DIT D11 DIT.. +12 285
>Steve_: ?EINOSU C12 OI +10 288
#note Second missed bingo. This one I should have found.
>Judy: NNN -NNN +0 285
#note Judy exchanges three tiles.
>Steve_: ?AEMNSU F9 MA. +15 303
>Judy: W -W +0 285
#note Judy exchanges a single tile. The ARUUGA! ARUUGA! alarm is going off in my head about now.
>Steve_: ?EHNRSU M8 ..N +6 309
#note ES 10M applies the pressure and is best. 
>Judy: ?AINX E5 XeNIA +27 312
#note A bold play at this stage.
>Steve_: ?EHRRSU F5 UH +34 343
#note The easy choice, but not the best choice. Still, not bad, as it wins 93 percent of the time. Coming in at 97 percent are RUSHER at D1 for 30, and RHUS at F3.
>Judy: AOPRSWY B10 WOPS +25 337
>Steve_: ?DENRRS A8 REaD +19 362
#note RESoD scores a few more.
