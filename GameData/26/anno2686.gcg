#note Nice exchange.  Hehe.

#note Was happy about this.  Very happy.
>Tim_Michaels: CINZ O4 ZINC. +29 120
>Ryan_Fischer: ACFLNOR 14B FALCON.R +80 162
#note He blocked FALCONR(Y) for 107!  :(  ZIG was 33, too.  Why'd he wanna lose the CN so badly?  Disappointed he didn't even hold on this one either.
>Tim_Michaels: HOO 13A OOH +27 147
>Ryan_Fischer: EEMNTUY 4L YUT. +32 194
#note So far, my play's been pretty solid, I think.

>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEEMN 3K NAME +28 222
#note ENEMA, lose an extra vowel.
>Tim_Michaels: ?ADGLNW 12C WAdDL.NG +83 253
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEPSS 2M APE +25 247
#note Need some consonants I can work with.
>Tim_Michaels: ENORU 6F ROUEN +16 269
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFGISS 11K FA.E +26 273
#note But not THOSE!  Crap.  He blocked FAS for 40, too.  Frustrating.  I immediately wanted to pass on BIG/IF, but that looks right now that I look at it.  I hate Gs.  I hate double esses.  So I tried to take a risk, set up my S.
>Tim_Michaels: AEHMS O11 SHAME +50 319
#note ...and it cost me the game.
>Ryan_Fischer: DGISSVW 9E WIV. +14 287
#note Set up my S, maybe.
>Tim_Michaels: AQU 13L AQU. +26 345
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGLSST 10C GLED +22 309
#note No dice.  Take points, set up an O-hook and hope.
>Tim_Michaels: EPRX 7D PREX +40 385
#note Ow again.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?OSSSTV M2 ...S +16 325
#note Ew.
>Tim_Michaels: LOOT 5D TOOL +21 406
>Ryan_Fischer: ?OSSTTV 4A VOTeS +26 351
#note Nothing much I could do there.  It was this or OTTO.  OTTO V-sticks me, though.
>Tim_Michaels: IOU M13 .I +11 417
>Ryan_Fischer: ST 14B ........S +16 367
#note SOFT/SWADDLING is a cool little play I missed.  Didn't play SOT as I would net more letting him play out with OU(T).
