>Phil: ?EINORU 8H URINOsE +64 64
#note With so many to choose from, I picked this b/c of: no hooks, U in the triple lane is unlikely, and good vowel/DLS placement. 
>Jeremy_Frank: IMUX K7 U.MIX +28 28
>Phil: ACCEINV M1 VACCINE. +80 144
#note If only I knew VACCINEE, this find would have been that much cooler. Not sure why, but he laughed out loud on this one.
>Jeremy_Frank: ENOY 1K EN.OY +36 64
>Phil: ?EEFIOS I6 FO.ESIdE +63 207
#note Only bingo, took me a while.
>Jeremy_Frank: AQT 10F QAT. +33 97
#note He pointed out that I blocked QAT for a ton with FORESIDE.
>Phil: DGJNOSV G9 G.DJO +17 224
#note Only sims decently. JOGS 14F is worth the S, VANG in the same spot is interesting, and I didn't see DEVONS 13H, but honestly I like this play better.
>Jeremy_Frank: INZ 4J ZIN. +30 127
>Phil: EHHMNSV 13F H.V. +10 234
#note Talk about failing miserably. I passed on HM because I wanted to dump the V and set up the M, figuring I might draw a 5 ending with M. However, EHMNS has no ____M 5s, and odds are I wasn't gonna draw one. Still Q's second choice though.
>Jeremy_Frank: AIP 11D PAI. +25 152
>Phil: AEHMNOS 12D AH +23 257
#note AHA 2M is looking much better, using the same tiles. This play was weak, I guess I got obsessed with that M spot- the only word that plays there is HANSOM (sweet). Stupid mistake- guess I lost focus after those bingos.
>Jeremy_Frank: LOW 6F WOL. +18 170
>Phil: EIMNOSS 14E OMS +39 296
>Phil: EIMNOSS --  -39 257
#note Ouch, the insta-challenge. Was embarassed for not knowing GADJO doesn't take the S.
>Jeremy_Frank: FGI L10 FIG +28 198
>Phil: EIMNOSS M11 SOM +23 280
#note Don't know the sweet EONISMS 2E. This is best otherwise- I think it's worth sacrificing a point for some defense here (14D).
>Jeremy_Frank: ABK 5E KAB +27 225
>Phil: EINRSSU 7A INSURES +71 351
#note Actually can't believe Q prefers it for 8 fewer at 2E. With not an S, blank, or C (-IC) left, I figured this wasn't particularly dangerous; I guess Q disagrees.
>Jeremy_Frank: AGLR A4 GLA.R +24 249
>Phil: ABEERTW 2M .WE +27 378

#note No comment.
>Jeremy_Frank: ADEOPRT -ADE +0 275
>Phil: AAEENOT C10 AE +15 419
>Jeremy_Frank: ADEELPR 2E PEARLED +67 342
#note Changed from PLEADER to REPLEAD to PEARLED; guess he was trying to get me to challenge?
>Phil: AELNOTT 14J TALENT +22 441
#note ETALON 1A for 27, TOLANE/NOTATE 3B for 23. 
>Jeremy_Frank: EORTT 3B OTTER +16 358
#note TORTE 1D woulda been sick. Well I played pretty poorly after we great beginning; maybe I got cocky. Regardless, I have to stay focused for all 25 (50) minutes if I want to really improve.
