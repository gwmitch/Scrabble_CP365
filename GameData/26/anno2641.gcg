#note OI does astonishingly better than any other play due to the ridiculous defence. but I figured that the way my opponent was playing, the board would never open again. oi is still better tho

#note these are all mistakes. I was fishing for vertigos, but the much superior play is to just throw them all back. seriously. the blank is the only tile worth having at this point.

#note not worth fishing after that s gets played, but this is wrong. there are so few v bingos that I can hit, and they all offer tons of counterplays. throw them all back until the blank comes out.

#note the only one. maybe I shouldn't play this given her last move, but it wasn't clear that I was ever going to get another chance to bingo without it. worth a shot at taking the advantage, I thought. also low on time.

#note not at all right. if I'm going to try that, I might as well play something else and then see if she traps herself by playing off the wrong tiles. quackle says HE 13C for whatever reason.
