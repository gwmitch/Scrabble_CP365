>Jason: HINORUY H4 HOUR.Y +16 16
#note This or HOUR at 7J. It's a dead heat.
>Lisa_Slankard: CHNW K7 W.NCH +26 40
>Jason: EEIILNT I3 LEI +11 27
#note Wow, Q rates two plays I was unsure of best. I'm not sure how to handle this news.
>Lisa_Slankard: ILRV J2 VIRL +26 66
#note Naturally, I give her a good spot to dump junk.
>Jason: EEINOTZ L4 ZONE +31 58
#note Passed on (HER)OIZE ... Q says I'm a wimp. It also sees ET(HER)IZE, which I didn't. (-6.6)
>Lisa_Slankard: EKNRSTU 6E KUR. +10 76
#note Lisa told me she drew EE? after this play.
>Jason: DEINSTT M7 DISTENT +81 139
>Lisa_Slankard: ?EEENST N2 kEENEST +76 152
#note She only got 74. Thank heavens this wasn't in recount range.
>Jason: ABMNOOP O1 BAM +26 165
#note BOO(K)MAN? Whoa. (-9.0)

>Jason: AFGNOOO 1A GOO. +21 224
#note GOOP-y, POOF-y stat: I had all eight O's this game. Perhaps an advantage, although it didn't seem like one at the time.
>Lisa_Slankard: DEX F2 DEX +33 205
>Jason: AFILNOR 13H INFLA.OR +62 286
#note Very relieved this stayed open. Good timing for me.
>Lisa_Slankard: ?AAIRTT 12B RATTAIl +63 268
#note Three bingos ending in -TA score 69 at 12C.

#note Lisa surprisingly played this very quickly, while I was still drawing. She was surprised she emptied the bag and berated herself for doing so. (R)UBY would have given her ADEINRS and guaranteed out bingos, sinking my battleship. "I deserve to lose," she said after my next play. (And yes, this is phony, but up 24 with the J and the bag empty, why even hold?)
>Jason: ACIJSTV 15L JIV. +22 364
#note OMG! (O)VISAC leaves guaranteed outs with JT! (-27.0)
>Lisa_Slankard: ADEIRS M3 RE +26 346
#note She should be blocking the out ...
>Jason: ACST 3C C...S +20 384
#note ... that she didn't made me wonder if PAIKS was good, and I wasn't about to play anything I wasn't 100% on. A grudging -35.0.
>Lisa_Slankard: ADIS B3 SAID +19 365
#note Nice to have a game where I felt like I won instead of the tiles winning for me. Also nice to start 2-0 and move to Table 1.
>Lisa_Slankard:  (AT) +4 369
