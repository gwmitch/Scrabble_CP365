>Vera: AAW 7G AWA +21 21
>Steve_: CHIJTTY D8 .ITCHY +32 58
#note CHITTY 6i is best.
>Vera: DEGORSS 6F GROSSED +79 100
>Steve_: AIJLTTY K5 J.TTY +30 88
>Vera: MPU C12 UMP +33 133
>Steve_: ABEILSV 15A VISA +32 120
#note Q prefers the rack management play of IVY, 9i. Saw that, but elected to take the points now. About a six point error in valuation.
>Vera: EX F8 .EX +26 159
>Steve_: ABEELLZ 5E LAB +20 140
#note TABLE 8k.
>Vera: EMW 4D MEW +25 184
>Steve_: AEELLUZ 5K .EU +13 153
#note The rack management play is TULLE, 8k. The scoring play is LAZE 3a. Q prefers the former, and says the difference in winning percentage is two points (29.54-27.01).
>Vera: AEGIIIO -IIIA +0 184
#note Vera exchanges four tiles. Maybe I should have opened that triple line;-)
>Steve_: ADELNNZ 3C ZED +34 187
#note Should have played this at B10 for eight more points. Board blindness.
>Vera: EEGINOR -IEEO +0 184
#note Vera exchanges tiles for the second turn in a row.
>Steve_: ACILNNR 9C C.N. +11 198
#note Duck likes CRAN(ED), but after two straight exchanges I'm understandably leery about opening bingo lines, not to mention a triple. I opt to close down the B line and go for rack balance. 
>Vera: DENR 8K .REND +21 205
>Steve_: AEILNRU 7M NU +8 206
#note I elect to keep playing defense, when the right play, of course, is to go on offense and play XU.
>Vera: GO 6N GO +15 220
>Steve_: AEILNOR J9 ALIENOR +66 272
>Vera: EOPRT 15J .EPORT +33 253
>Steve_: ?AEFKOO 13J .OOK +16 288
#note The idea is to take out bingo lines and the big Q possibilities from N10.  Duck does it with AFOO(T), I chose this.
>Vera: FLT 11I L.FT +14 267
>Steve_: ?AEFHOR 11B AR.H +27 315
#note Was very happy to find this, which doesn't show up in Q's list of choices, but finishes just a couple of points back in winning percentage to FOR(C)E. I'm now 90 percent to win, (supposedly).
>Vera: EN L3 NE.. +10 277
#note An obvious desperation set up.
>Steve_: ?AEFIIO 10A IF +26 341
#note C player surprises with its suggestion to pass six tiles to the blank, followed by (N)AOI.  I considered the latter, but thought I could lose to a Q play from the triple, so opt to go for points - the duck's third choice.
>Vera: ?EIQRST 3H SQuI.TER +102 379
#note Ouch and ruh roh. Wasn't expecting this. Vera told me after the game she drew S, blank after her play of NE(ED).
>Steve_: ?AEIOOV H1 VI.E +24 365
#note In time trouble, but no time to give up just yet. Q doesn't see a win for me, but then it doesn't factor in human error. It suggested cAVIE H11. I think OVErREPORT might have stood a better chance, had I known and seen it.
>Vera: AAIINU G10 INIA +14 393
>Steve_: ?AOO 3A OO... +15 380
#note A(E)rO at 12i loses by five. I have four seconds left and go with the best I can find in terms of points.
>Vera: AU 1H .AU +6 399
#note And thus another squandered game comes to a close.
>Vera:  (A?) +2 401
