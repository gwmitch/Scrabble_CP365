#note I probably should've chosen the other position, but I figured it'd be more painful to hook an S with a DWS play than to simply play down from the Z.

>Ryan_Fischer: AGHOORS 13J RO.GH +18 230
#note this is bad, though.  Took a gambit, setting up my S.  He remarked later that I blocked VO(T)ING, so I at least had that going for me.  Better, not knowing that, is simply HO M13 22, though I don't like playing like that.

#note Best.  This, or FA at bottom left.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEILOST 6H I.SOLATE +62 342
#note Blah, totally blanked on TOTALISE, creating a bit of a sticky endgame situation.
>Martin_Weisskopf: AMX 7K MAX +43 301
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AABNNU 8L BeAN +41 383
#note In hindsight this was very reckless.  Empty the bag, leave the TWS open.  It worked for me, though.  Better is AB F1 22.  I can't block both places.  I played BeAN to prevent plays like YEAR in that same spot.  Seeing TOTALISE woulda made my job much easier.
