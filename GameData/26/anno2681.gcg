>Jason: AEEINNT 8H ANE +6 6
#note Tough call. Q likes NE. (-1.3)
>Steve_Glass: BEJLMNT 9H BELT +16 16
#note When Steve told me his leave after the game, I said "I didn't realize you played off your good tiles!" :)
>Jason: ?EILNTT 7B LETTINg +62 68
#note I looked for -ABLE nines, but it wouldn't have been worth my while. T(AB)LETINg is, though. (-20.6)
>Steve_Glass: IJN 8A JIN +34 50
>Jason: BFHOQRT F6 Q. +31 99
#note Missed FORTH at 10J and hope to draw an I. (-5.5)
>Steve_Glass: AGMOPRS L4 GRAMPS +35 85
#note Steve correctly passed on POS(T)GRAM.
>Jason: BFHORTU 7J BU.F +20 119
#note Ah yes, I should've been able to call either I or U on the pick. Considered (P)OUF, but passed on it. (-4.0)

>Steve_Glass: IIT O6 TI.I +4 163
>Jason: IMNOPRY 10J YO +32 174
>Jason: IMNOPRY --  -32 142
#note The play that probably cost me the game. What can I say? I debated between (W)ORMY and this. I saw a bunch of vowels out and played this, setting up PRIM. I thought for sure it was good. *sigh* If I'd seen (W)IMPY leaving NOR, I would've played it. *double sigh*
>Steve_Glass: EEISZ N2 SEIZE +36 199
#note However, Steve made me feel better. Round 5, vs. Clark, he lost 565-232. He 1) challenged GAOLeRS, 2) tried TENAGER*, booted and 3) challenged HECTORS. Even the 1800s...
>Jason: IMNOPRY B10 .ORMY +26 168
#note I know YOM at O1 is the play, but given Steve's affinity for closed boards and the configuration of the board after YOM, I felt my life could quickly become miserable. Felt like I needed to open. (-11.6)
>Steve_Glass: CGLO 2J CLOG. +14 213
#note A fitting play. :) I believe it was after the Clark game than Steve asked "I know this will sound stupid, but RETAIN+B. Anything in that?" After the tournament, I shook his hand and said "Congratulations. Well-deserved." He responded, "I don't know about that. I didn't know RETAIN+B. Oh! RETAIN+A; I couldn't see anything..." "There's nothing there," I interrupted. "Oh good!" he said and departed, leaving me to laugh and shake my head.
>Jason: INOOPUX A14 OX +32 200
#note Slightly best. (M)IXUP is close.
>Steve_Glass: ERU D10 .UER +8 221
#note In fairness to Steve (since I've made him look like a schlub), his goal is to know the whole book. He doesn't study by probability or even anagrams. As he put it in the hallway between rounds: "ARENITES, ZYMERGY; it's all the same to me."
>Jason: HINOPUW M1 U.H +24 224
>Steve_Glass: EO N8 .OE +7 228
>Jason: AINNOPW E7 .WI.P +26 250
#note I hated taking a long time with this play, as Steve was in time trouble and I wasn't in the greatest shape. But, it took me all that time before seeing this. Only PAWNO(R) at 5G, which I didn't know, is better. (-0.7)
>Steve_Glass: FI 5K F.I. +32 260
#note Insta-played, naturally.
>Jason: AENNOOV 13B .A.OON +18 268
#note I thought he was closer to bingoing than he was. Regardless, gotta bite the bullet, open, maybe catch the case power tile. (M)O(R)ON's win percentage is almost equal and slightly better. (-0.5)
>Steve_Glass: OT F12 O.T +5 265
#note Gee, wonder if he's got the S?
>Jason: ADEINRV G4 VAI. +18 286
#note Gah! I would've given my right arm to have the sevens stay open. Q likes VERDAN(T) at D1. (-3.1)
>Steve_Glass: AEGN 4C GANE. +18 283
#note Beautiful play. That S is gonna sink me.
>Jason: CDEHNRV K9 .RENCH +22 308
#note Considered (BEL)CH, (BEL)CHED and (BEL)CHER, all of which are superior. This has a decent valuation, but wins just 28.80%. (BEL)CH's is negative, but wins more than half the time. VE(N)D wins 54.20% and is 6.0 points better.
>Steve_Glass: AAADKSU H1 AUKS +38 321
#note He said the E was in the bag, although in severe time trouble he wasn't sure. Hmph. I could've used that. Scored as 37.
>Jason: DDDELVY M10 DYED +21 329
#note Best. Steve had me tracked for DEV, not DLV and thought I had guaranteed outs and he'd lost (esp. since he was already overtime). I saw A(H)EAD to block and missed ADA(G)E. Fortunately, so did Steve, although his sequence is only inferior by a point.
>Steve_Glass: AADE L12 AA +16 337
>Jason: DLV D3 L.V +6 335
>Steve_Glass: DE N13 ED +13 350
#note Some bad luck at the end, but it's not like Steve outdrew me (he got seven power tiles but obviously lousy luck in the middle). These wounds were self-inflicted. So much for being 2-0 vs. Glass.
