>Steve_Glass: ABENNR 8D BANNER +22 22
>Steve_: ALNQSTV E5 QAN.T +28 28
#note Q prefers the E5 placement just a tad. I thought this would give up less to a play off the 3ls.
>Steve_Glass: AEGLMST H2 MELTAG.S +62 84
>Steve_: EILOPSV 1E PLOSIVE +122 150
>Steve_: EILOPSV --  -122 28
#note Oh, man oh man oh man. Quick impulsive play and greed got the better of me here. Take the sure 81 and be happy.
>Steve_Glass: EHY 5H .HEY +20 104
#note Yup. More medicine.
>Steve_: EILOPSV 3B PLOSIV. +32 60
>Steve_Glass: BGIO 4K BIOG +21 125
#note This foreshadows Steve holding back an S, at the very least.
>Steve_: EELOTUX 2E EX +52 112
>Steve_Glass: AAH 3K AAH +32 157
>Steve_: EIILOTU 6J LEI +18 130
#note I really liked this play at the time, but it comes up third best behind ETUI 6K and TUI 2M.
>Steve_Glass: ASUV O1 VAUS +33 190
>Steve_: DINOPTU 1A PUNTO +27 157
#note Anyone go with Q's choice of UD(O)N at D1?
>Steve_Glass: DI F5 ID +25 215
>Steve_: DEFIINR 4C IF +22 179
>Steve_Glass: FU D6 FU. +17 232
>Steve_: CDEIINR B1 .N.RICED +44 223
#note Thought this was one of my better finds in the tournament. Nothing else comes close.
>Steve_Glass: OTW A7 WOT +32 264
>Steve_: DEIMOOW F8 .OW +16 239
#note I hated this play when I made it, and still do, even if it does end up second on Q's list (to NOMOI, same spot).
>Steve_Glass: ?DELRTY 11F TiREDLY +77 341
#note Ballgame.
>Steve_: DEEIMOR 12L EMIR +24 263
#note This is where I should be playing to conserve spread, instead of hoping for miracles. RE(TIREDLY) would have been a cool play. Still, second to OMER in the same spot; yet it seems like the second best poker hand. Both have win percentages of just over two percent.
>Steve_Glass: AAIKZ N10 ZA.KAI +78 419
#note Ouch.
>Steve_: CDEJOOT L9 JO..D +16 279
#note Duck likes DOJO 7L.
>Steve_Glass: ?EEINRR 13E INtERRE. +59 478
#note Q passes the bingo and goes with the RETIREDLY play. I'm guessing it likes it's chances for a triple-triple or better bingo on the next turn.
