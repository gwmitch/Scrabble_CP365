#note I was unhappy with this play when I made it, and Quackle concurs. SMUG in the same spot is best, and PIG is another good option.

#note To my surprise, Quackle likes keeping ISS best, with keeping IS second and keeping S third.

#note THRAVE, a word I didn't know, is best.
>Adam_Logan: BIL F9 LIB +24 221
>Sam: ?AELRTV N4 VAuLTER +70 257
#note Huh, Quackle likes 15A VET here best, 1.5 points ahead of VAT and 2.0 points ahead of VAuLTER. I don't really see a reason to forgo the bingo here, especially considering that he can easily block the N column and render a bingo rack useless. 
>Adam_Logan: DI O8 ID +22 243
#note Another small play for Adam
>Sam: EEEEJLM H12 JE.. +18 275
#note Quackle's top play of JEEZ is too risky considering Adam's previous play, but EME 14J is an improvement over my play.
>Adam_Logan: ENOUW 4J UNWO.E +26 269
>Sam: EEEILMO 5I EME +18 293
#note MELEE to the triple looks better, but I simply didn't see it.
>Adam_Logan: AIN 15B ANI +17 286
>Sam: EGILNOR D11 GO +16 309
#note LO in the same spot or JO are huge improvements. I didn't even think about how much better EGINR is than EILNR, and didn't like setting up SLAB--but it's not like this board is devoid of places to play sevens ending in S. GO was very poor, but I would have had playable bingos with the two tiles I drew had I played LO, JO, or GO.

>Adam_Logan: CEEKOUV O1 CUV.E +32 386
#note Adam's best shot, but the tiles didn't work out for him in this endgame. 
>Sam: CDEHSTW H1 WH.D +39 409
#note When analyzing the game, Adam found the impressive possibilities of DANISH 15A and SWITHE H1. My play works out better than either of them, but board vision like that is astounding. To be one of the elite players (as Adam is), I need to acquire near-infallible board vision like that. WHID is second-best to WHIT in the same spot, which is counterintuitive: Adam's best play is KINO 4A, but if I play WHIT for six less than WHID, I keep CDES for DECKS A1 (36 points). This forces Adam to play elsewhere (EEK 5E would be best), and after DECOS M1, I win by 16, 2 more points than WHID wins by.

#note Hey look, I luckboxed a former National and World champion!
