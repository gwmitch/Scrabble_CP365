#note JUG sims far better than anything else. I'm mildly surprised. I don't think I'd do JUG. [-5]

#note i laid down FIRM, took it back and played FIG. they sim so close. i think FIG is right. FIRM is winninger by about 0.25% (of course since i have the M). but i don't like the leave or giving back a possible Y play or really any vowel. [-0.3]

#note MART in the same spot is very nice. i saw it but decided against it because i have the blank, and because CART? seems so strong.. but it's about killing my opponent's scoring chances! i think. [-6.5]

#note i missed THREE high prob bingos here! but CAROM sims higher than one of them. i thought it was ok (i only looked for a bingo for a little bit). i actually thought i might be able to get away with intract. [-4] 12D INTeRACT (?)

#note [-27]  i thought of waysides as soon as he played ways, and i forgot about it.. it would have won the game. HOW FRUSTRATING!!!!! i put my head in my hands about 20 secs after i made my play, when i suddenly re-saw waysides.
