#note Why not GLITZ? Good question. I have no answer.
>Bing: ?CFJSTV -CFJV +0 22
>Steve: ?ILSTUX E9 .UILT +12 47
#note The simple XIS/HAZARDS is easily best. I'm thinking I must be punch drunk from the way my morning has gone.

>Bing: BEHLNNN L10 BENN. +14 114
#note Steve: I wasn't sure if this took an -S on the end or not.
>Steve: ?IMOPRS M4 PROMISe +67 153
#note About the worst of the possible bingos, both in terms of score and what it offers up to the opponent. Best is PORIsMS at i3. Didn't know that, but I did see PRoMISO(R) down column F and that's much better. For the fanciest bingo, look for the nine along row 12.
>Bing: CEHIKLN 8K CH.NK +54 168
>Steve: EEIITUV K2 UVEITI. +24 177
#note Played this right away, I was so sure it had to be best. And yet, you can use the same tiles and score the same elsewhere on this board with a different word. Which I would have played for style points, had I seen it.
>Bing: DEEFILY N2 FLIED +39 207
#note Steve: This game shows, more than anything, how the choices you make during a game trickle down and influence the end result. If I see and play U(N)ITIVE he doesn't bag an easy 39 here. OTOH, maybe UVEITIC blocked an 8 to or through the R at M5.
>Steve: AEEESUV 13I VEE.A +49 226
>Bing: ABCEGOY 14B GOBY +30 237
>Steve: AEGSSTU 3I GU. +9 235
#note Weak; although it's OK in terms of leave, it just doesn't score enuf points.
>Bing: ACEFOTW 15A COW +32 269
>Steve: AEEOSST O1 TEASE +34 269
>Bing: AEFORTW 13A FEW +40 309
>Steve: EEJOOOS 4H JO +20 289
#note Did you notice PROMISE takes an E hook? Q says JEE for 31 is good enuf to keep three O's as part of your leave.
>Bing: AINNORT K10 ON +12 321
#note NOEL K11 is 2 more points.
>Steve: EEEOOQS -EEOOQ +0 289
>Bing: AIINRTU O8 .AURI +10 331
>Steve: ADDEELS A11 DE. +8 297
#note An effort to set up another bingo line; if I'm sure BENNI takes an S, then I play SEED and take the points.
>Bing: AIINNQT J5 QI +28 359
>Steve: ADEELOS H4 .OE +10 307
>Bing: AAINNPT 2C PINTANA +65 424
#note I had some idea that this might be good, and it seemed like it wouldn't hurt much to try. NU 2J might be the safest way to wrap up the game, as it blocks DROSERA (the only possible playable bingo for opponent).  
>Steve: ADEELOS 1G LODE +29 336
#note There's a 45 point play along row 1 if you care to look for it. I believe I was in time trouble and slapped this down fairly quickly.
