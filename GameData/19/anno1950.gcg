#note Wow, I gotta say what teh eff!  I saw RALLYING immediately.  I don't know what kinda rare tropical disease infected my brain to make me miss the fact that there's a WIDE OPEN I in the MIDDLE of the board.  Wow.  Also of note is LARYNGAL, JANGLY, and GALLY or RALLY parallel to JANE.
>Curtis_Lee: FO K4 OF +26 84
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGLNTU L1 GLUT +20 115
#note Philosophy change test here.  When I'm faced with keeping something like EE or EU, I never know which is better.  A while back I was told to undouble the vowel no matter what.  So that would imply keeping EU is better than EE.  But is that so?  Quackle has GELT way down on the list, implying keeping the U is bad, and two Es is better.  GLUT sims a little better than GELT, but it's JUNGLE or FULGENT for the win.

#note Blargle, he's just draw 7, my rack sucks and shows no prospects.  I guess I should take the points now...  ZEIN is just dumb.  ZINE sets up a free 30 point B drop.  Throwing in three Is really slows me down, but those are the only three appealing options.
>Curtis_Lee: EM 12K EM. +23 201
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEHIII N5 AHI +31 211
#note Risky, but equally volatile on both ends, so I'll hopefully cash in on one.  +3.9 initial evaluation over the next best choice, no sim.

#note Whoda thunk a B dump would be so awesome.  Cashed in on a bit of my own luck.  Safer is playing ENQUIRY now, saving the B for next turn.  But EINQUR is such an awesome leave to draw to, I think.  15 8s, and a lot of high scoring possibilities otherwise.  BURQ(A) leaving EIN is another option.
>Curtis_Lee: ?AGINOR 15A ORiGINA. +80 316
#note Now, I sort of sensed this was coming after a dinking play like TAV.  The score was even, though, so I don't know if I should've tensed up.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEINQRU B8 ENQUIRE. +124 403
#note Well, looks like I made up for that equity loss with RALLY(I)NG.  This is totally bogus.  The National ENQUIRER* of plays; the only one out of that group that isn't good.  So weird.

>Curtis_Lee: OX N1 OX +39 391
>Ryan_Fischer: CIOSUUV D8 .ICUS +20 448
#note (F)UCOUS is the champ's choice.  I was close with my play, at least.  Should've been (F)UCUS though, at least.

#note MEM, MIM, MOM, MUM, but no MAM*!
>Ryan_Fischer: OUV 2B .UV +7 455
#note (A)VO in the bottom right corner blocks his best play of MONK.

>Ryan_Fischer:  (MNTT) +12 473
#note Always nice to win when the opponent gets both blanks.  Could've been better, had I not missed that bingo.  The endgame was a kind of freight train screaming towards conclusion.  Nothing much in the way of really tough decisions.
