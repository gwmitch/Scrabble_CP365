#note took a long time to come up with this move...just trying to add volatility to the position given that I'm already down 71. Quackle suggests LANAI/LIANA or AIN - AIN blocks the biggest spot on the board but leaves a really lackluster board and leave so seems out of the question, but I guess keeping the N with LIANA is better. I wonder if it matters that LANAI gives a different tile for 8s versus LIANA. Probably not given that she's fairly likely to play there...

#note I like getting excuses to play this way.
>Laurie_Cohen: AY O1 AY. +18 133
>Jesse_Day: ACOPRUZ H1 ZAP +49 121
#note I suppose it didn't occur to me to look for the better play, but COZ is it.
>Laurie_Cohen: DY 6H Y.D +23 156
>Jesse_Day: CORRSUW 10H ROW +21 142
#note back in fighting range after the last few plays, and this counters her series of semi-fishes somewhat.
>Laurie_Cohen: B 2N B. +22 178
>Jesse_Day: CDQRSUU 11D CURDS +24 166
#note to use marlon's words, this is a terrible move. When I made it, my thought process was that she's been fishing for four turns, and CURDS takes out the biggest spot on the board, leaving a tricky lane on the K column and one on the N column that gives me counterplays. Furthermore, the Q is guaranteed to score next turn at two different spots. But I think this is a mistake anyway because I have so little potential with the Q. might as well play QUAD, which sets up the S as an additional opportunity, and see if more points come out of the next rack.
>Laurie_Cohen: ELLMOSV -ELL +0 178
>Jesse_Day: CLNOQRU F6 QU.. +34 200
#note it might just be psychological, but if you look at the last two plays, the end result is that I score 58 points and drew a random rack. Hence why CURDS was so bad, even if I "forced" her to exchange.
>Laurie_Cohen: ?EEENST N5 STEEpEN +67 245
#note STELENE looks like the play
>Jesse_Day: CLNNORT 8K TON.R +18 218
#note I know I already said this, but imagine that I play QUAD, get to take the best of my rack the turn after that and THEN have to react to this play. the whole game would've been different. Meanwhile, I miss ONCET on this play just to make matters worse.
>Laurie_Cohen: GHNU M10 HUNG +23 268

>Laurie_Cohen: EE O8 .EE +11 279
>Jesse_Day: ACEINOR D11 .ONIC +24 255
#note CONIC gives too much back to be the best play. Better is a play like RACE, which effectively sets up two lanes because she'll have a hard time blocking the G and the lane from RACE at the same time. However, the outright best is just dropping the O at 7M for decent points and forcing her to react. At least, so quackle says, and I'm tempted to agree.
>Laurie_Cohen: EIOV 15A VOI.E +30 309
>Jesse_Day: AAEEEIR 13C A.E +6 261
#note best by a mile is ARENE, which sets up a legitimate second lane. My play was an attempt to set up the S if I draw it, but creating a legit second lane is clearly better.
>Laurie_Cohen: HLRT 14B TH.RL +33 342
#note nice play!
>Jesse_Day: AEEEGIR 14B .....AGE +12 273
#note GEEZ is also an option, banking on drawing OX and some sort of scenario where she has trouble playing the J. But THIRLAGE seems to make the most sense for applying the most pressure.
>Laurie_Cohen: MMO 15G MOM +38 380
#note unlucky that she had the O...but it gets kind of interesting after this.
>Jesse_Day: EEFIIRU 13H EF +25 298
#note this endgame is so complicated that neither I nor quackle have any idea what the right sequence should be, but I just don't see why this wouldn't be the start of the right sequence, even though I end up botching it pretty badly.
>Laurie_Cohen: GJPSTX 2G P.. +6 386
#note quackle thinks TREE is a point better in the long run, but I can't tell if quackle's playing it right or not. 
>Jesse_Day: EIIRU 13G R.. +13 311
#note I should take VEE at 7L because that's a spot still in contention (can be blocked with TREE). I was under tons of time pressure, but gotta remember that the way you play endgames with a stick is to cash the spots in contention first.
>Laurie_Cohen: GJSTX K3 ...S +12 398

>Jesse_Day: EIIU 7L .I. +10 321
>Laurie_Cohen: GJTX 13G ...T +7 405
>Jesse_Day: EIU 15G ...E +8 329
#note quackle goes haywire due to the endgame player bug which doesn't evaluate passed out endgames correctly.
>Laurie_Cohen: GJX -  +0 405
>Jesse_Day: IU J12 I. +2 331
#note now it gets hilarious. I'm so low on time that I don't even see both the I and the U spot until I have about five seconds left, but I have to do it in the right order so that she doesn't get to play her J...but then I forget about it and pass over and over again! What a silly ending.
>Laurie_Cohen: GJX -  +0 405
>Jesse_Day: U -  +0 331
#note I had about five seconds left to make these last two moves, hence why these moves suck. Should play PADI and then UN.
>Laurie_Cohen: GJX -  +0 405
>Jesse_Day: U -  +0 331
>Laurie_Cohen: GJX -  +0 405
>Jesse_Day: U -  +0 331

#note If my score is listed as 661, then quackle appears to be failing to handle the passed out endgame correctly. I guess it just doesn't happen that often. Sofar as the game goes, it was a bit disappointing not to capitalize on my run from the day before to make it back to even. But Laurie is so nice and fun to play that I couldn't really get all that cranky about it, which was good, because the next few games would all be very tight and leftover frustration might've been costly. I made enough mistakes in this game that I didn't really deserve to win, but I think I stepped up my game for the rest of the morning.
