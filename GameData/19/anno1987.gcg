#note GAUSS 12F is best. Another new word to me. 
>Mike_Milan: ACDIL H11 ALCID +29 54
>Sam: DEIINSS 8M IDS +14 42
#note Annoyed by my bingo (INSIDES) getting blocked, I didn't focus hard enough in order to find the double-double. DENARII is the best play. Bad miss.

>Mike_Milan: EMOU J10 MEOU +25 103
>Sam: AEINORS O1 ERASION. +77 134
#note I wonder why I picked ERASIONS over SENSORIA. I'm positive I weighed the benefits of the two. ERASIONS leaves juicier parallel play on the N column, and doesn't block anything. SENSORIA stops bingos starting from either D (15H or N8). And there's a better (minute, bet still better) chance of SENSORIA getting challenged.
>Mike_Milan: ADEN K9 DEAN +25 128
>Sam: BDGMTVY N5 MY +32 166
#note Ok, that's 7 straight consonants I've picked out of the bag. BY is slightly better, as the M is less clunky, there's still one B out, and the M can potentially be played at M3.
>Mike_Milan: BGILN M7 ..BLING +26 154
>Sam: BDGJNTV -BGJNTV +0 166
#note Ok, that's 9 straight consonants I've picked out of the bag. Keeping just N is better, especially given that the D at H15 is one of the only bingo lanes.
>Mike_Milan: AAEIPRS -AAEI +0 154
>Sam: DLSTTVW 3J W..T +20 186
#note Ok, that's 15 straight consonants I've picked out of the bag.
>Mike_Milan: EY N1 YE +19 173
>Sam: DJLSTTV -DJLTTV +0 186
#note Ok, that's 17 straight consonants picked out of the bag. And didn't I just throw this J back?

>Mike_Milan: ?AIILPU 7A nAUPLII +66 259
>Sam: ABDESTV A5 VE.D +21 224
#note ADVEnT A3 is obvious, and best by far. 
>Mike_Milan: GNRT C5 GR.NT +7 266
>Sam: ABESTTW E4 BAW. +18 242
#note Almost tried BAWTIEST* despite knowing it was phony. Quackle likes the interest WAST 14K slightly more than BAWL. With only one E unseen, I can score 30-ish points next turn on the triple if he doesn't have the E, and it's possible to bingo out of BET. I accidentally overscored BAWL by 2.

>Mike_Milan: FIX F3 FIX +26 319
>Sam: CEHIRST J1 H.. +9 259
#note I considered the knowing phony ITCHERS* for a long time before foregoing it. Quackle likes ridiculous things such as ITCH D9. Not that I think my play is necessarily best; any other suggestions here? I needed to bingo to win this game, but HAW didn't score enough as it turned out.
>Mike_Milan: IOV 15E VOI. +19 338
#note Luckily for me, he doesn't pick a blocking play here 
>Sam: ACEIRST B9 ATRESIC +74 333
#note He held this for a few minutes, giving me a glimmer of hope, before he accepted.
>Mike_Milan: ?OPRRTT D1 PRaO +26 364
>Sam: E 8C .E +8 341
#note I know that Mark was an underrated player, but it was demoralizing losing to the bottom seed in Division 1, especially to cap off a 1-3 morning. Now 4-7, I resolved over the lunch break to sweep the afternoon games and crawl back to even at the midway point of the tournament.
