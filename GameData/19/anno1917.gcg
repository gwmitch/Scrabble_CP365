#note missing the sexy EYEwAT(E)R...doh...I wanted to play YAw(M)ETER, but it was less points (groan).
>Matt_Silver: AEIMOQU H1 QU. +36 171
#note Matt says he completely spaced on QUAI...not that it had any effect on my next play...

#note luckbox...?
>Matt_Silver: AEIMOTU 10A .M +23 194
#note Matt just wanted to score and not use many tiles, but we agree that ODIUM is not a bad idea...
>dacrON: GIILNOZ L1 ZO.IL +48 295
#note Quackle likes ZO(R)I "a lot" more...
>Matt_Silver: AEEIOTU 1K A.OTE +42 236
#note He didn't really consider (Z)OEA, but in hindsight it was probably a better play.
>dacrON: AAEGINO 7I O.A +10 305
#note It's these kinds of plays that always screw me up. Why am I dinking while up 60?
>Matt_Silver: DEINNRU M5 INURNED +62 298
#note Can you find the common word, but tough best play?
>dacrON: AEEGINV C3 VINEGA. +26 331
#note I didn't really give this play much thought. Quackle doesn't hate it. Matt liked VEG, which is okay too, but I figured with SSS? STILL unseen, it seemed like a decent idea.
>Matt_Silver: ABDILST 8L B.AD +30 328
#note Matt overdrew. I picked SSD off his rack...
>dacrON: EEOOPUV 12A POOV. +26 357
#note He has at least that S...
>Matt_Silver: AFILSTX 10H FLAXI.ST +72 400
#note so much for blocking the E
>dacrON: EEJNRUW 11J NU +24 381
#note I just can't see myself playing J(O)W here, because I don't want to maybe give him two shots at blocking it. With enough tiles in the bag that I will get it the next turn, it seems reasonable to block the X spot, and play J(O)W the next turn...or hit something big for a nonbingo...

>Matt_Silver: BDGILOU 4F GOD +28 428
#note BOG was probably better...
>dacrON: AEEIJRW C11 J.W +26 407
#note Quackles says JAWE(D) or JEWE(D) is better, any ideas? J(O)W went down instantly.

#note shit.
>dacrON: ?AEEIRT 13G ARIETtE +70 477
#note And that will be my high loss ever. Couldn't quite reach 500 though. Really awesome game, glad to be a part of it.
