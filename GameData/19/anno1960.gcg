>Lester: IPP 8G PIP +14 14
>Mike: AEKOQTZ 9F QAT +20 20
#note When the choices were generated, my first thought was "why didn't I take the points with ZOEA J6?" Turns out QAT wins the sim by 2 points, I guess because often the next move will be QI for 11 or an exchange.
>Lester: AENOSTU J2 SOUTANE +69 83
>Mike: DEIKOOZ 3I Z.OID +50 70
>Lester: DIY 10E YID +28 111
#note (Misscored as 29.)
>Mike: ?AEHKOU L1 HA.KU +32 102
#note I saw sHAKEOUT 5C, but couldn't convince myself it was good. This is best of the nonbingos, but still a 15-point error.
>Lester: ACLO 11B COLA +22 133
>Mike: ?EGGORX 1L .OGG +27 129
>Lester: GILNTU K6 LUTING +27 160
>Mike: ?AEERRX 12C RARE +20 149
#note I don't know what I was thinking here. I didn't feel like opening the triple line, but LAXER D11 is second in the sim, just behind cashing the blank with EXCREtA B9 62. RARE sims 12 points back; even EAR in the same spot is an improvement.
>Lester: OO 10J O.O +5 165
>Mike: ?ELNRWX 13B REX +36 185
#note In a standard sim, REX wins over LEX in the same spot by a mile. However, if we infer ERS on Lester's rack (not unreasonable, given the fish), it's a virtual dead heat. (I just didn't want to give up the I hook; I guess specifiying the tiles means it's less likely he has it.)
>Lester: AJSW M7 JAWS +30 195
>Mike: ?EILNTW 13F TWINkLE +66 251
>Lester: CEF H12 F.CE +39 234
>Mike: ?EOSUVY M13 SOY +32 283
#note Spot blindness here; CURVY B11 wins by about 12 points over this.
>Lester: BEEIN 5E BEINE. +16 250
#note Hey, at least I held on it! (Don't know why I let it go, though; I guess I didn't want to give the momentum back to him.)
>Mike: ?AEERUV 8M .VE +18 301
#note Again, CURVE or RECURVE on the B column is best. (Don't worry, this is the last time I miss this spot.)
>Lester: DHI 6D HID +22 272
>Mike: ?AEFLRU 15C FUnER.AL +61 362
#note Other than playing through the other E, there's no other bingo.
>Lester: B F4 B.. +6 278
>Mike: AEMRSTV 3C VERA +21 383
#note This is one of four plays, according to a many-ply sim, that are 100% to win. The others are all at 7C, which doesn't make sense to me; don't you have to take out the new line to lock it up?
>Lester: ADEINRT O7 R.TAINED +60 338
#note Not that it would've affected the outcome, but: Find the playable nine!
>Mike: EIMMNST 7B MIMS +21 404
#note Same effect as MEMS in this spot...except that MEM happens to take the S, while MIM does not. Actually, STEM N3 is three points better.
>Lester: O B6 O. +6 344
>Lester:  (ENT) +6 350
#note (Score recorded as 404-351.)
