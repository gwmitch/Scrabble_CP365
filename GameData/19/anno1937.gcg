#note Gonna hook an S onto it too!  Doesn't English suck?

>Ryan_Fischer: AEENORU D12 EURO +20 151
#note This game's been pretty uneventful up until this point.  All my plays have been best (and pretty easy, save ZI(N)CY), and I don't know what he's been up to.  I really hesitated to slot an O in the 3x3, but didn't see anything else appealing.  Turns out EAU D11 18 woulda been fine, just 2 fewer points.  The oddest thing about this play is, I didn't HAVE to slot the 3x3 to score 20 points.  Making the play one higher scores 20 as well, without the risk.  Despite that risk, pulling it up one square sims only a half a percent better, give or take.
>Jeff_Parsons: ??EINRR 3H .ERRyINg +70 113
#note Considering his rack, I REALLY shouldn't have played EURO.  Quackle with inference would've hated it.  He misses several 3x3s here, but they're baby 3x3s, all for 104: REs(O)RcIN, REb(O)RINg, IgN(O)RERs, INf(O)RmER, and INd(O)RsER.  There are a couple 72 point plays missed too, but this one is okay.
>Ryan_Fischer: AABDENO O1 BO.AN +21 172
#note BO(g)AN isn't great.  I just learned DAGOBA (best) the other day.  Some one-off-er of BODEGA I came across while watching a game on ISC.  DOGBANE is the other option, but with 3 Ses out, it's risky, and there's really no incentive to turn over tiles other than going FOR those Ses or the JKQX, of which only the X is really appealing (though better I get it than him).
>Jeff_Parsons: HMO 15A HOM. +27 140
>Ryan_Fischer: AADDEGK 14B DA.K +28 200
#note Well, DARKED for 10 more is best, but I had the right idea.  DARED and GARDA are also options.
>Jeff_Parsons: IQ 5G Q. +22 162
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEGSUW -WUG +0 200
#note I think this is a serious mistake even looking at it before asking Quackle.  Two 26-point plays missed, each with decent leaves.  I just wasn't thinking straight on this turn, and it cost me a bit of spread, definitely.  The initial valuation is 13.6, versus 30.3 for AW(N) or 28.6 for GAW(P)ED.
>Jeff_Parsons: AL 11J LA +14 176
#note Such an ugly play.  Kills three lines while indicating that HE's close to a bingo.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEOSX N5 EX +27 227
#note DESEX is best by far.  I don't recall whether I saw it.  I think I'd have some reservations about slotting the X, but for 48 points, I shouldn't care too much.  Besides, this is the more advantageous way to slot an X if you must (harder to reach either way).  I didn't consider AXED, and I should've, but I really don't think I should've been scared of DESEX, which would've put me up 72.
>Jeff_Parsons: AE 7C AE +6 182
#note Setting up his S, no doubt, but it's a lot of dinking around for nothing, when I should've been scoring more than I have been.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEOSUW 12K WUD +22 249
#note I kinda laugh here 'cause I JUST THREW UW BACK IN THE BAG!!!  And I realize, that yeah, this REALLY kills that quadrant of the board, but it's kind of what I want.  The bingo threat is imminent yes, and I'm not close, but I figured I'd grind it out from here.
>Jeff_Parsons: AEINSST B2 SESTINA +71 253
#note SEITANS is much safer, as is TISANES, TANSIES, or NASTIES.  Oh well, thanks!
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEIJOS A1 JIAO +43 292
>Jeff_Parsons: MY A8 MY +33 286
#note I wish I could've taken the bottom spot first, because the JIAO play is in a spot that's so much harder to hit.  Basically, his bad play got him lucky.  Sucks when that happens.  Interestingly, MY/DARKY is 3 more, but obviously not as defensive.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILLPS C10 LIP +13 305
#note I saw PAL, not about to play it and leave the E hook.  SPEIL is the winner, though with consonant blend letters still out, I don't know how fond I am of slotting the L.  Then again, I don't know what I was doing trying to draw a bingo on this board.
>Jeff_Parsons: DET M5 TED +18 304
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGGLSV L6 VEG +25 330
#note Got one right for once, though VALSE 13I 41 is pretty.
>Jeff_Parsons: IO 5J OI +9 313
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGLNSU 13H DUGS +16 346
#note I'm really proud of this play, because of the calculated way I arrived at it to achieve a desired result.  "Leave one in the bag, score points, keep things shut."  Done and done.  The worst he can do if I slot the D, based on that pool, is O(D)IC, and I'm confident I can survive that if he has it.  The Champ chose my play 3rd, and initially it sims pretty badly.  Bummed about that, but what can I say, it worked for me.  GUL 13I is its top choice.  PAWL totally slipped my mind, but what good is an S gonna do on this board, except MAYBE hooking DARK for a few extra points.
>Jeff_Parsons: GO H13 .OG +15 328
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEFLLN 15H .LANCE +12 358
#note Score and go out.  But Quackle has such an awesome knack for shenanigans, I love it.  L(E)E I2 5 sets up CALF!  Now what it's gonna take for me to develop that kind of endgame skill, I know not.  It IS a very instructive how-to, though.
>Jeff_Parsons: EEIORU 2I ROE +13 341
>Ryan_Fischer: FL M2 L.F... +10 368
#note Was happy to find that fancy little out.
>Ryan_Fischer:  (EIU) +6 374
#note Won despite him getting both blanks (at the same time doesn't help him, especially missing the 3x3s), but I should've won by more.  A recurring theme.  Still, it's the start of a streak.
