>Cesar: BDENPTT H4 BETT.D +12 12
#note J7 DEBT, what is wrong with that? even J7 BEND if i can't see it. this move amuses me, because at this point i'd drawn ONE blank in the last 7 games, and it had come at the very end of the game! you can see that my judging center of my brain is completely out of whack -- i wanted that extra shot at the blank! DEBT is clearly better than BETTED. [-12.5]
>Fogel: COX I3 COX +28 48
>Cesar: DEENPRS J6 SPENDER +77 89
#note hey... now that's a nice draw.
>Fogel: DEEIRW 11E WEEDI.R +44 92
>Cesar: AEEGLNO 6F GE.A. +23 112
#note cute, but 10B GENOA turns over more, and the leave might even be better. LNO is not good. (and it opens up the board a little). [-1]
>Fogel: COY 10D COY +34 126
>Cesar: EILNORT 12D INTRO +30 142
#note at least i can still find some nice moves on the final day. D8 LECTION is interesting too.
>Fogel: AEGV G3 GAV. +28 154
#note omg stop scoring so much
>Cesar: AEFILOP F2 FA +16 158
#note what's wrong with me? FA/AGAVE is better. i was scared of giving him a snapback to the triple though. what do you guys think? 13B OAF is creative too or 3I CALIF. [-9.5]
>Fogel: AABEIQR -AABE +0 154
>Cesar: AEILOPU E1 PILAU +23 181
>Fogel: ?AEGNST 13H EASTiNG +81 235
>Cesar: AEHIMOR 12L HOAR +29 210
#note N10 HOAGIE gives me a triple back -- this move doesn't. oh and it scores more. this is my typical freakout post-opp-bingo move. [-6]
>Fogel: DFI 13B DIF +19 254
>Cesar: ?AEIKMN O8 MAKE. +33 243
#note i was very happy about what i drew and salivating over my anticipated 90-point KINEMAs, and thinking "see, i CAN draw blanks!", and also thinking why would he ever block there when clearly the R is wide open. damn it!!
>Fogel: AILV N6 VIAL +21 275
>Cesar: ?BILNOO 3I .IBOL +18 261
#note this is the move from HELL. i actually chickened out on BLOOP! keeping IN? on an open board! [-16] oh hell... [-3000000000]
>Fogel: HMTU 1A THUM. +45 320
#note go me!
>Cesar: ?ILNOWZ L1 ZO.N +46 307
#note i give him a nice Z comeback spot instead of doing 4L WIZ. [-8] *golf clap*
>Fogel: EENORSU 1L .ONE +39 359
>Cesar: ?IILORW 14N OI +12 319
#note desperation sets in. this still wins the quackle sim, presumably because i've already screwed up so bad that i need something like this. what am i gonna hit anyway?
>Fogel: EINQRSU 15I REQUINS +112 471
#note *runs around in circles screaming*
