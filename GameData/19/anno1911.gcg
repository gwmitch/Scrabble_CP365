#note The simple IFF sims best, followed closely by FOP. Both are slightly better than FIN (according to Quackle). I think I like FOP best, as IFF only leaves me eights through LOWN and sevens starting with T or a vowel or playing parallel to OWN. FOP leaves the S hook for me to take advantage of. I guess there's a good chance Nick will give me some more hooks after IFF, though. Either IFF or FOP would have been better.
>Nick_Meyer: AEILMNN 6D MELANIN +75 101
#note Turns out I gave his bingo a home.
>Sam_Rosin: AEPRSST K2 REPASTS +78 127
#note Didn't really know PASTERS 100%, but that's no excuse at all. PASTERS 10B is easily best, scoring 10 more than my play. 
>Nick_Meyer: AJOU F2 JOUA. +28 129
>Sam_Rosin: AENOOUV 8K .UAVE +27 154
>Nick_Meyer: ?EHOOPV 2H OVE.sHOP +84 213
#note Sounded plausible, and I had no idea at all, so I didn't even hold the phony. OVErHOPE is the best play, scoring 95.
>Sam_Rosin: ?DDGNOO H1 G.OD +24 178
#note NOODGeD! I know this word, since I've had discussions with my dad on the differences of the words 'nudge' and 'noodge.' Having never studied it is not an excuse, just like PASTERS.
>Nick_Meyer: MY 3M MY +33 246
>Sam_Rosin: ?CDGINO O8 .NCODInG +89 267
#note I saw the neat NONCoDING, which is of course inferior, but scores many more style points. No one of the small surrounding crowd after the game (including Joel Wapnick) believed it was good until we looked it up--I guess 9th grade biology was good for something.
>Nick_Meyer: EIRRTW M7 W.RTIER +30 276
>Sam_Rosin: AILNTUY 12J YUL. +14 281
#note sLAY is awesome, and easily best.
>Nick_Meyer: CO J10 CO. +14 290
>Sam_Rosin: AABEINT L4 AB +20 301
#note BAA is very slightly better according to Quackle, but I haven't an idea why--AB covers the more dangerous spot, considering the X is out. Whatever: I'd still play AB in a game.
>Nick_Meyer: DDEEETU O1 U. +12 302
>Sam_Rosin: AEEINTT 7I TE. +9 310
#note I guess I had a reason not to play WET. The S hook? But that makes no sense since he already has COYS. Oh well--this play sucked.
>Nick_Meyer: ADEIORS 13D ROADIES +70 372
>Sam_Rosin: AAEINTX H11 AX.TE +60 370
#note Yay for timely draws!
>Nick_Meyer: EGK 12C KEG +23 395
#note Setting up the S-hook that I didn't pay attention to.
>Sam_Rosin: ADIILNR 15G D.RAILIN. +62 432
>Nick_Meyer: ABEHIRS B10 BASER +35 430
#note So this is where it got interesting. Very, very interesting. I was of course ecstatic after DERAILING, but then I noticed BRASH 14B and thought 'Oh SHIT!' Then I noticed the possibility of ZEE 15A if he did that. When Nick laid down BASER, we both thought it was his win, and a terrific play. Until my play, that is. So, here's the endgame puzzle: Is there a win here? And if not, can you cadge out a draw? Please, please take your time on this--I think it's a terrific endgame exercise, and not the easiest find either. It might take you a long time to figure out, and no one noticed this over the board even during the postmortem except for Quackle (just now). In fact, I'm setting up a challenge right now: I really don't think anyone can come up with this play without Quackle's help. It's a really intricate and complex situation, more than it may seem. Can you find the sole winning or tying play?
>Sam_Rosin: EETTZ G11 ZE. +33 465
#note After BASER, I immediately noticed HIT, and thought that my play of ZED wouldn't be enough. Sure enough, I did the math, and after taking a 35-point lead after ZED, I would lose by 3 to HIT 14F. But then I laid ZED down on the board--it blocked HIT! Nick hadn't even seen the possibility of ZED, and was understandably distraught when it hit the board
>Nick_Meyer: HI 10J .HI. +9 439
#note Nick's best outplay. Now, if you didn't before, take the time to find Nick's one play that wins or draws for him. If you can't (and believe me, it's no easy find), go back to my original post for some long-winded endgame analysis and the solution.
