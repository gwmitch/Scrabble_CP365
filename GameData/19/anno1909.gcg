>Sam: FGHNTUU 8G FUG +14 14
#note I liked keeping the U instead of holding a vowelless* leave, and also for hooking opportunities. What I didn't consider is FUGU 8E, which reduces the potency of an E hook. FUGU 8E is best.
>Sam_Moch: AEU J6 EAU +13 13
>Sam: EHNNTTU K7 TENTH +27 41
#note Any thoughts on TENTH vs. HUNT? They seemed almost identical to me during the game.
>Sam_Moch: KNOW I3 KNOW +21 34
>Sam: AAEFNUV L3 FAUVE +25 66
>Sam_Moch: AW M3 AW +25 59
>Sam: AEINNOO H4 ONO +15 81
>Sam_Moch: AY G3 AY +12 71
>Sam: ABEIMNO N2 OBA +24 105
#note Yes, AY is an obvious fish, but there isn't much I can do to block. Even if there were a good play blocking the 2 row, he is almost certain to bingo, if not this turn then soon. Might as well build my own rack up for a bingo. Note that the awesome BOHEMIAN, the only eight in this rack, doesn't play (though I originally thought it did during the game).
>Sam_Moch: OP O1 OP +16 87
>Sam: DEGIMNT 2M M.. +15 120
#note Why is MOP so bad according to Quackle? I guess DEGINT is much weaker than I thought. Quackle's favorites include METING 2B, J2 GID (didn't notice the YOND hook), 2B TINGED, and simply 4G YOND. I would have played GID or YOND, had I seen them. 
>Sam_Moch: AEINRST 12H ANESTRI +75 162
>Sam: DEGINTY O4 YID +25 145
#note Quack likes DINGEY 2B (scores 35), YID J2 (missed the spot again), or DYEING N9 (scores 38).

>Sam: EEIILMS 1H ELEMI +30 266
>Sam_Moch: Z F14 Z. +31 307
>Sam: ?EGIJOS C12 JOI. +22 288
#note Durrr: JInGOES! I haven't studied it, but a poor miss nonetheless. REJIG is also better than JOIN. 
>Sam_Moch: ILL 12C .ILL +22 329
>Sam: ??EGSUV A12 VUG. +13 301
#note LoVEbUGS from the L is best--other bingos are OUtGiVES and SEVrUGa. Should have found OUTGIVES, but not mad about the other two. VEG 3A is a nicer non-bingo option than VUGG.
>Sam_Moch: CIIIRST E1 I.TIC +14 343
>Sam_Moch: CIIIRST --  -14 329
#note Held this one for a while before challenging it off. NERITIC looks best for him, leaving just one in the bag. 
>Sam: ??EHORS D1 S.OsHiER +77 378
#note Didn't see or know the double-double REScHoOL. HO 2J is also a viable option, and is good because it blocks the X-spot in addition to holding the incredible ERS??. SLOsHiER was one of the night's many 'the blank is an S as in Sam' moments--there was a decent amount of Sam-confusion among me and Moch.
>Sam_Moch: CIIIRST 2J TI +12 341
#note Quackle likes just playing CIRRI, surrendering the big XI 2J but keeping the sure out-in-two.
>Sam: BDEIPX 3C B.X +43 421
>Sam_Moch: CIIRS 8A CIR.I +21 362
>Sam: DEIP 5D .IP +16 437
#note Saw RIPED, but didn't know it, and didn't even see REDIP. Looked for something to block FAUVES, but didn't see NIP, which is best of the non-outplays.
