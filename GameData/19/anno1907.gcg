>Sam: BDFHRTU 8F BHUT +18 18
#note The other option here is FUB, which Quackle likes a little better. Sort of makes sense, since unless he drew a bingo or an S, FUB really shuts down the board even more than BHUT. DHRT is probably as good as DFR, also.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: IRTT F8 .RITT +9 9
>Sam: AADEFRS 10A FARAD.SE +64 82
#note Jack held this play for a minute. The F tile was a little fuzzy, so at first he thought it was a P. Then he realized it was an F, and thought maybe I had thought it was a P. Finally he started thinking about farads and electricity, and accepted the play despite not knowing it. Better than SAFARIED in the same spot.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: EHT A8 HE.T +30 39
>Sam: ??EORSX J2 REdOXeS +90 172
#note I've been attending the Patrick Hodges School of Scrabble. I wanted to play XEROxeS for a point less, but didn't, to the disappointment of Conrad (sitting next to me). vORTEXeS or cORTEXeS are each two points more, and clearly better, but I didn't see them.

>Sam: AEILRVW 3F REVI.WAL +82 254
#note I played this word without hesitation, as I had studied it in my cardbox. Later that night, I looked up my performance on it--turns out I had added the word the night before, and had missed it. I was pretty amazed that I was so certain of this word just a day after learning it (along with 399 other words). 
>Jack_Eichenbaum: AEEEMPU -  +0 111
#note Jack challenged REVIEWAL. I love the NY Club's method of challenges--Joel Sherman walked over to our board and said, "That's good!" 
>Sam: AEEINTU 4L EAU +12 266
#note This play is safer that it seems, since I already played all of the hook letters (X??). Quackle's favorite is RETINUE, which does score well and keep a decent leave, but is a little overly risky, I think. Other options are RETINAE (a little more defensive, but worse leave) and EAVE. Perhaps I was a little too enamored of the EINT leave of EAU.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: MMU K5 MUM +34 145
>Sam: AEINOOT 9F .OTO +19 285
#note ENVOI is the standout play, and I completely missed it. ROTO is much better when played at 11D.  
>Jack_Eichenbaum: ABDIIOP H1 BO.ID +36 181
>Sam: AEIKLNN C2 ALKINE +29 314
>Jack_Eichenbaum: AEG 2L GAE +15 196
>Sam: DINOTUY 12A YO +27 341
#note Quackle likes UNTIDY/EMU better in terms of win %. I didn't see it, but it's an awesome play--it blocks the EME or EMS hooks, the UTES hook, and the BRITTS hook all in one, in addition to stopping bingoes starting with T. Terrific play.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: JLR 2B J.RL +22 218
>Sam: ADINNTU 1M TAN +15 356
#note Quackle likes DUAD best, which is a nice play considering the E and I-heavy bag.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: CEW 5B W..CE +20 238
>Sam: DGIINOU B5 .OG +18 374
#note WOG isn't terrible, but TUI is better despite a 14-point sacrifice. Much-improved leave and starts to block the board.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: DIS 6F DIS +27 265
>Sam: DEIINUZ -IIZ +0 374
#note I wanted to keep a U in case of drawing the Q. For some reason Quackle still likes TUI a lot, which doesn't make too much sense to me. I should have just gone with FARADISED, which I saw.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: ACINPSY -ACIN +0 265
>Sam: DEEENOU 11D .E. +12 386
#note Why didn't I just play RETE this turn?
>Jack_Eichenbaum: FY E10 ..FY +17 282
>Sam: DEEINOU 11D ...E +11 397
#note Not a bingo-friendly bag, but he could have had SPAZ/UTES for big points
>Jack_Eichenbaum: APSZ L7 SPAZ +22 304
#note And now for 11 fewer points in this spot.
>Sam: DEIINOU 8L .ION +18 415
#note Quackle seems to like PEON in the same spot better. I'm not exactly sure why.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: AIINPQV O5 PIA. +6 310
#note Terrific play. It effectively sticks me with the C, while giving him the opportunity of getting rid of the Q if I make a mistake. INN is a slightly better play with the same idea, however
>Sam: CDEIU 6M DU. +6 421
#note The only block
>Jack_Eichenbaum: INQV 9K V.N +10 320
>Sam: CEI N8 .E +9 430
#note I should have played BI first, and then VANE. However, I was already low on time or over on time at this point--I was not used to playing with a chess clock nor the 23 minutes that the Manhattan club uses
>Jack_Eichenbaum: IQ 1H .I +4 324
>Sam: CI B12 .I +2 432
>Jack_Eichenbaum: Q -  +0 324
>Sam: C B12 ..C +10 442
#note No, I didn't really play OIC*, but apparently cross-tables doesn't support GCG files that end with both players passing out, as it said "Unknown Line: Sam: C (C) +-3 429." The real final score was 409-314: I lost 3 points for my C, he lost 10 points for his Q, and I lost 20 additional points on time. Like I said, I wasn't used to the 23-minute games or the chess clock we used.
>Sam:  (Q) +20 462
