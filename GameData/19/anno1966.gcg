#note 2B UNPAINTED is simming a little better. 1C GUN sims a little better too cuz it keeps the E [-2.5]

>Cesar: EINPSTZ E4 SPITZ +43 298
#note C6 ZIP is simming better by win %. don't know what is right here. I suppose ZIP keeps a better leave. but SPITZ blocks the E and the I kind of..  but here is where the tracking sheet is important. there are three Is and two Es unseen, but only one T, so if he's going to bingo, it may be more likely thru the T. the V is going to be unlikely just because it's a V, but who knows.

#note i had to challenge. i knew EGGINESS was no good, and i was also pretty sure about vitiator, but i was in shock. i looked for a bingo for a while but just gave up and hoped for the tiny chance it was no good [-49] 15A SERGING
