#note Impressive find here by Steve.

>Sam: AAALRSV K3 VARA +27 96
#note With an open board, no reason to panic early and play ARVAL in the same spot.
>Steve_Polatnick: DIRY L6 YIRD +18 210
>Sam: AIKLOSW D4 AWOK.. +26 122
#note WOT 7H is nice, setting up the S hook with SWAT.

>Steve_Polatnick: DORU B10 DOUR +23 285
#note Nice blocking play.
>Sam: ADELNPS 4J ..ND +14 191
#note Setting myself up with another S-hook. Quackle likes the simpler BAN or BAD in the same spot, but if Steve can play on rows 10 or 11 (EWER/... or JOES/...), I've got a tough task to place my bingo.
>Steve_Polatnick: AINT C12 TAIN +17 302
>Sam: ADELOPS 3M APO +16 207
#note BANDA is good! Never seen this word, which is a reminder to learn my fives already. Quackle likes OD M3, but that assumes I know BANDA, and in real life Steve is going to be continuing to play defensive. APO at least kept it open. PEDALOS N1 is of course best.
>Steve_Polatnick: ACFIIRT B1 ARTIFIC. +80 382
>Sam: DEEILOS M9 OILSEED +72 279
#note The board's still open enough for a potential comeback if I can triple-triple.
>Steve_Polatnick: BGINO O1 BO.ING +30 412
>Sam: AMOPRST 9L ..OM +7 286
#note Quackle likes A1 MOAT, but I have to assume Steve's blocking. DOOM opened another triple-triple lane, but I don't have any prospects. DOOR is a good alternative I considered, fishing for TRAMPLES O8 185 with EEELL still unseen. As it turns out, DOOR may have won the game.
>Steve_Polatnick: VY 3F .VY +13 425
#note Steve said he would have played this even if I had played DOOR instead of DOOM.
>Sam: AELPRST 14G PRELAT.S +74 360
#note The right draw for TRAMPLES! Except I made the wrong play last turn. TIVY 3E is very interesting, especially if I know EMPALERS (I didn't). I'd think Steve would have to block at that point, though. Even a simple play to 15O blocks both triple-triple allies.
