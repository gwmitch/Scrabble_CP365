#note Not much different from WAX 5K, I think.
>Robert_Linn: AGO 7E GOA. +14 166
>Sam: EHKORWZ L9 WH.Z +38 177
#note ZOWIE! I'm surprised I missed this easy best play.

>Sam: EGHIMSW 13C W.IGH +32 309
#note I saw the awesome WIG 2F, but chickened out. I had not idea at all about GLANDLESS.
>Robert_Linn: AEEIIOP -AEEIIOP +0 284
>Sam: BEEEMOS 14H EME +16 325
#note It was pretty obvious that I had to block here. Quackle prefers OBE 14I, but what about resulting plays to the triple like FOVEA or FAGIN? 
>Robert_Linn: OPT 12G OPT +13 297
>Sam: BEFIIOS 2A EF +25 350
#note Blocking the only remaining bingo line...or so I thought. For non-idiots, FILO 11B is best, blocking the most potent lane. 
>Robert_Linn: AENV B10 VENA +28 325
#note Why not keep fishing? I don't know what Bob had, but he can't win after VENA, it seems.
>Sam: BIIIOSV 2F BI +20 370
#note Setting up my brilliant next play. Quackle likes SI G1, setting up BI if necessary.
>Robert_Linn: AGIOPTU E10 PI +16 341
#note ZIG 12L or PRUTA N2 work better here.
>Sam: IIOSV H1 IS........ +38 408
>Sam: IIOSV --  -38 370
#note Hey, I try. As a sneak peek to the later rounds, this would NOT be the longest phony I attempted during this tournament. 
>Robert_Linn: AGOTU I2 GO.. +9 350
#note A setup that made me think...
>Sam: IIOSV 1A ......S +19 389
#note ...but was ultimately blockable
>Robert_Linn: ATU 7M TA. +4 354
#note I think Bob might have been low on time here. He kept saying "You tricky!" after ISLANDLESS*.
>Sam: IIOV A11 OI +8 397
>Robert_Linn: U M6 U. +2 356
#note EMEU 14H or A1 FEU for 6.
