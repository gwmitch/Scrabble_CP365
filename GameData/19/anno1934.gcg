>Mike: ?AAFSTV 8G FAVA +20 20
#note Better by about 2 points than taking the ten extra with FAVAS.
>Dielle: CIOZ 7J ZOIC +29 29
>Mike: ?HLNSST 9J SH +17 37
#note The only bingo is N(A)THLeSS, which I didn't know. It's tied with SL(O)SH in the sim; SH is about 7 points back.
>Dielle: ACDEEFT 9B FACETED +74 103
>Mike: ?ELNOST E5 ENTr.SOL +78 115
#note The seven possible double-doubles all sim within 0.7 points of each other.
>Dielle: ADEW D9 .AWED +33 136
>Mike: AABEKPR 8A KEP +36 151
#note Though it's fourth on the initial choice list, this quickly jumps to the top of the sim, by about 5 over C12 BAKE.
>Dielle: AEYY K9 .AYEY +28 164
>Mike: AAABERX L10 RAX +45 196
#note This is a 7-point misstep: AXE in the same line is best, with AX in between the two. I guess I was afraid of spending the E (it would be the seventh, and we're not even close to halfway), but the 3v1c leave is just too much to overcome.
>Dielle: INNU 5E .NNUI +5 169
>Mike: AABBEHL C12 BAH +27 223
#note This, BABE in the same spot, and THE F9 are all very close in the sim. I felt the need to undouble the B, and didn't feel like opening the triple line.
>Dielle: GMU B13 MUG +28 197
>Mike: ABEGLQR H1 BARQ.E +81 304
#note Well, that was unexpected!
>Dielle: EIORSTW A1 SITEWOR. +98 295
#note Hold, please. I couldn't remember whether it's WORKSITE or SITEWORK that's good. (Turns out it's neither.) There's something similar where both versions are good; what is it, folks? Besides, given my rack, I didn't feel the turn was worth the risk. This is something I'm working on (namely, challenging more); the best way to improve that is to learn more words.
>Mike: GGILORT K2 GIGOL. +16 320
#note This beats J12 LOG by about a point; even though opponent's just drawn seven new tiles (you're welcome, Dielle), there's no need to throw open the line. (Plus, I'm trying to get to the ?JS in the pool.)
>Dielle: NPTU 2A .NPUT +14 309
>Mike: DEIIRTV H8 ..DITIVE +42 362
#note Best, clearly. I was proud of this one.
>Dielle: ?ELMNOR 15E sOL.MNER +60 369
#note Somewhat surprisingly, this is the only bingo for Dielle.
>Mike: DEJOORR D1 J.DO +40 402
#note According to Championship Player, J(O) F14 is just barely ahead of my choice. This surprises me, frankly; I would think taking the points and leaving one in the bag would be a clear favorite.
>Dielle: AIOT C2 .ATIO +22 391
>Mike: EILNORR 3J L.NIER +12 414
#note Six points worse than ORRICE M3 (which I now recognize; I've seen the seven), NOR L3 (which I considered), and a couple of other plays.
>Dielle: EISU F1 USE +15 406
#note 2J E(G)IS is best eight points better.
>Mike: OR L3 .OR +14 428
>Mike:  (I) +2 430
