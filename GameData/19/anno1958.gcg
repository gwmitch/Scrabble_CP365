#note insane.. J5 AZOLE sims three full points better than my move. how does this make sense? [-3] the only thing i can think of is that AZOLE sets up AWL/WE and because the board already has a big S hook it doesn't matter to put another one.
>Rod: DEFY N8 DEFY +32 56
#note very surprised that BELIVED* wasn't a word. what does BELIVE mean? it's an adverb meaning "in due time". i'll take away 22 equity from myself. ? [-22]

#note i liked blocking lanes and the turnover.
>Rod: ? -  +0 288
#note i was surprised to draw a challenge then on the way to the computer i started thinking that maybe i just came up with it out of thin air.. what a ridiculous phony that would be!
>Cesar: ADIORRS 15C AORIS. +7 349
#note this play is considerably lamer. i did have the right idea kind of. D10 SORDID has a 100% win percentage - this is the right way to block! keep in mind that the SABE lane is also open, although i'd think it would be ridiculously hard to hit. also ADROIT is better than AORIST but i didn't see it.
