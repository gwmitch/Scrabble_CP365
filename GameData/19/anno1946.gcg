>Cesar: EIRRUUW 8L W.RE +33 141
#note yuck! but i gotta take the points and kill the spot. E4 WIZ though sims higher.. that E makes the leave a lot better. [-1]

#note cesar -- this is an exchange rack. i'm nuts!!! at least it's a little close. [-6]

#note H12 TUFA is almost even with this. i'm still nuts. [-1]% 
>Manop: CFIO 13F COIF +25 232
>Cesar: AABEFQU C5 F.QUE +28 224
#note and i've played thru a 3 U rack. however 14I FAB keeps a good leave (i still shudder a little) with an opportunity for an awesome score. i think these kinds of sims throw quackle off a little, though, because that next score might be so huge. for example, B2 QUA sims high too, but isn't that just nuts?
