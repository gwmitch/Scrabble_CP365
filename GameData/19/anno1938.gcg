>Jesse_Day: IILMOOW -IILMOOW +0 0
#note I must've still been cranky from last game, because I tipped my rack over without a word and hit my clock. But quackle actually advocates playing through with WOO at 8G. I suppose the potential of the hook and the semi-decent balance makes it worthwhile.
>Stefan_Rau: AADENX H8 ADNEXA +44 44
#note does stefan always open vertically and I've just never noticed before?
>Jesse_Day: EEIIKOS G12 OKE +32 32
#note I liked my move a lot, but I maybe wasn't thinking about the H, which dampens my enthusiasm for it. But it's almost even with ENOKI and EIKON, and I think I do like it.
>Stefan_Rau: RTTUY G4 RUTTY +14 58
#note as far as I can tell stefan had absolutely nothing for much of the beggning of the game.
>Jesse_Day: EFGIIOS I12 OF +33 65
#note scores and makes my spot harder to block, but quackle says that GONIF will lead to me scoring 17 more on average next turn than OF!! This makes a lot of sense - on such an open board, EGIIS is a serious liability. I even think I saw GONIF, but I didn't think hard enough about it to realize how good it was.
>Stefan_Rau: ADGOTU 4C OUTD.AG +20 78
>Jesse_Day: EEGIINS E4 .IE +6 71
#note brace yourselves, it gets ugly from here on out. quackle likes SEEING, which is fine, but more than SIGNEE, just to give back a huge Q spot? I don't get it at all. hell, the game could just end after he hits a QUA___ play. Maybe it's worth taking the 3 points, but now is the time that he's most likely to have the Q. This fish does ok, but it might be the wrong one - DIE gives me a 5% higher chance of bingoing though also giving back big plays.
>Stefan_Rau: BEIMO 11D BIOM. +28 106
#note I played much of this game at a very slow place, maybe tired from the game before, but Stefan pllayed pretty fast. Incidentally, I can't help but report that the woman next to me on the bus has Stephen King's Insomnia in her hand and has been dead asleep since getting on while occasionally snoring.
>Jesse_Day: EGINNPS H3 P.N +7 78
#note  airball...I hate fishing repeatedly, but quackle prevents some what of an alternative - just PEN at 12C. The E doesn't improve ING bingos that much. The hilarious thing about my play is that I can totally just play NAP, and there's no reason not to. (After this comment, I took about a two hour nap. Maybe I confused myself)
>Stefan_Rau: EEV 12B VEE +20 126
>Jesse_Day: EGIILNS B10 LI.ING +24 102
#note this whole sequence was fairly demoralizing at the time, so it's comforting to realize that there actually wasn't anything that much better to do. Quackle says that fishing one more time by playing LEI at 13C is better because it hits a lot of bingos and because LIVING gives back the triple, but I guess I just wanted to move on. Shouldn't let frustration get in the way of making the best play, but fishing really isn't my style most of the time and I was happy to get away form it.
>Stefan_Rau: EEPV A8 VEEP +33 159
#note stefan put down VENUE at the same spot before playing VEEP.
>Jesse_Day: ?AEHSST 15E gASHEST +88 190
#note I knew it was time to stop fishing! He actually held me on this play, but given the cajillion alternatives didn't challenge. I laid down HASLETS, but wisely didn't give him back the S. But the play that I couldn't find was SHEATHS, which lands the H on the double, but as it turns out would also have given him a bingo. I wish I'd found this, but the time pressure and frustration combo were very relevant. Actually spotted GASHEST natural from the G, but that's a terrible play.
>Stefan_Rau: CEJNORU C3 J.UNCE +36 195
#note Stefan later told me that I had enraged him by giving him CONJURES and then changing my mind.
>Jesse_Day: AAGIILU -AAGIILU +0 190
#note For the second time this game, I tipped over my rack and hit my clock, but Stefan totally called me on that being whiny behavior. I guess I was a little bit frustrated. It's also not even close to being right because AALII at 14J scores enough to make it worth persevering. I liked the look of the bag, though, and feared big comebacks to AALII if he had an S. Should just play it tough. quackle also suggests NILGAU, but AALII's points should be taken.
>Stefan_Rau: AADER 3H .ARADE +24 219
>Jesse_Day: HIORSTY N1 HISTORY +90 280
#note after this one, I crack up hysterically because (at least by the looks of it) I had played like a complete donkey and just pulled this out of the bag. This also sent Stefan on a mini-tirade about Scrabble being bullshit, which I wasn't quite expecting, but was pretty justified during the circumstances...but keep watching.
>Stefan_Rau: CEGIOQR O7 ORGIC +29 248
#note a fantastic play that goes a lot further than the obvious QI towards winning him this game. He told me his rack because I wanted to know how he got to his next play...
>Jesse_Day: AAILMNW 10E AW +28 308
#note I missed what's pretty easily the best play, WADMAL. WHA to take out the H is about even with my play, but WADMAL makes good sense in providing defense and scoring some points to increase my lead. AW doesn't lead to that many bingos on this board. Also, WADMAL would've been great given his actual play...
>Stefan_Rau: EFIQRSU K3 .QUIFERS +90 338
#note ouch!
>Jesse_Day: AEILMNO J6 MINAE +38 346
#note MODI jumps out at me first thing in retrospect, but it's possibe I just didn't see it given my flagging board vision throughout a lot of the game. MINAE has tempo advantages though, and gives me a shot at drawing a big tile that'll get me the points I need to survive. But quackle chooses a different play over either of those - LOMEIN, emptying the bag! in fact, it does miles better than any other play, which I would love to understand but don't. to me it seems like it leaves me up 1 where all stefan has to do is out-in-two to win, but maybe LOMEIN gives me the extra shot I need at a tile that will seal the deal. LO is also mediocre given the bag, showing lots of promise for duplication.
>Stefan_Rau: BLNORTW 1M W.O +27 365
#note imagining that my rack had started with an A, I would have ADLLR?, a much better place to be
>Jesse_Day: ?DLLLOR 9C DOR +28 374
#note I should just out-in-two with RILL, but I triled to get cute. if only LILLY were good I think I would have a win. I thought about a lot of different stuff, but I guess I tried DOR in case he did something stupid hereafter.

#note Looks like I forgot a note the first time I annotated the game. I guess what jumps out the most about this game in retrospect is the disconnect between how I felt I was playing and how the game actually went. Reeling from my loss against Marlon, I was pretty down on myself throughout this game even as I played just fine, if not great, but I have to wonder if that kind of attitude didn't just make me more tired and take longer when a fresher me might've been able to do a little better to win such a close game. Also happy to see that the preendgame is actually quite interesting, which prevents the game from just being a parade of mild errors on my part.
