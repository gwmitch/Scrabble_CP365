>Sam: AAEGUUW -AAGUUW +0 16
#note Perhaps I was a bit too hasty in exchanging here. Nothing really wrong with GAUZE 6G I think.

>Marjorie_Schoneboom: ERX 6C .REX +56 125
>Sam: EEGIKOS 4A GE.K +22 105
#note Not a great one here. KOIS D1 knots the game up and is best by far.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: ASTY A1 STA.Y +27 152
>Sam: AAEIOQS -AAIOQ +0 105
#note Didn't I even see QIS 10B??? The exchange is mediocre.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: AAG K4 AGA +19 171
>Sam: AAEIOSY L4 YO +23 128
#note Deserved this draw after some poor intermediate plays. EOSIN L4 managed to sim best here. I guess have the GEEKY hook to dump at least AY next turn, but still...
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: AIU L7 U.AI +4 175
>Sam: AAEIOSV K10 AVO +14 142
#note The beautiful OAK D2 sims best. At least AVO sets up the S-hook...
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: ?CDEISU 13G CrUISED +83 258
#note ...which she skilfully uses.
>Sam: AAEIQST 10B QAT +38 180
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: BI 12K .BI +21 279
>Sam: ?AEINST M2 AcETINS +85 265
>Sam: ?AEINST --  -85 180
#note I couldn't find a real bingo, so I tried this phony. You see anything in AEINST? Seriously though, trying ABOONS* was greedy.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: EITU B10 .UITE +28 307
#note Taking out the highest-scoring line for my bingo
>Sam: ?AEINST M1 cINEAST +77 257
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: CDER 12A C.DER +22 329
>Sam: EILNORS 3E NEROLIS +64 321
#note Uh, I'll take that.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: ADM 2F MAD +27 356
>Sam: EFGJNOW H12 F.OW +39 360
#note My winning % has gone from 5% after cINEAST to 18% after NEROLIS to 59% after this play.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: ILORRRT C12 .IRT +16 372
#note Marjorie did have a few winning sequences here: TERROR followed by IDOL or DIRL, DORR followed by TWIRL, DIRL followed by TERROR, and a few more. If I'm not confusing her with someone else, I believe Marjorie doesn't usually track.
>Sam: EGJNN 2L J.N +20 380
#note Best, setting up ENG O1 or NEG 4F.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: LORR 1M .OR +8 380
#note ODOR saves some spread points.
>Sam: EGN 4F NEG +21 401
#note Wow, what an exciting game. After ten turns apiece, I was down 127 points, but came roaring back in the last five turns, scoring 77, 64, 39, 20, and 21. I don't need to tell you how serendipitous (aka dumbass lucky) my draw of NEROLIS was, or my NT? pick to the AEIS leave. I have to say, Marjorie is one of my favorite opponents, and I always somehow beat her in games I shouldn't win, like this one. She handled the turnaround of events very well, with disappointment but grace.
