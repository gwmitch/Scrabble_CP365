#note Phony or not, it's a bad play.  Throw in EOQ and move on.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEEINOQ -AEOQ +0 37
#note I really hate making a play like ONE or ANE, but it's best, taking the hotspot.  It creates another better hotspot on this closed board.  So very annoying.  Wouldn't've been in this situation had I just changed when should've.

#note DINKIEST doesn't play and I was desperate.  I guess he thought this was plausible.  SHINNIED is the only thing close.

#note Played GAVE instead of GIVE.  Had my reasons, but don't remember them now.

#note So much for fishing, or bingoing, or anything else.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGILRST 14F TIRL +12 264
#note He has two outs (I mistracked), so the best play is just dropping the S, 9D (COZEN)S 32.  Oh well.
