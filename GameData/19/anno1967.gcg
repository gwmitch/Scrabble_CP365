>Jesse_Day: AEINNRV 8D VAINER +26 26
#note as I've said previously, not really how I like to open, but nothing makes it worth playing short.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: AEEOZ 7E ZOEAE +37 37
#note he's got some game! This went down almost instantly.
>Jesse_Day: DNQRSUW F5 QU..N +16 42
#note hoping to at least get to draw a vowel and pluralize it. Quackle thinks that QUERN is much better for me next turn than QUOIN. why? oh wait...it's because if I draw an I I hit WIZARDS! wow! what a cool play.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: DELMS 10B MELDS +33 70
>Jesse_Day: DDNRRSW C9 W.NDS +26 68
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: CITY 12C .ICTY +22 92
>Jesse_Day: DEHJRRU -JHRU +0 68
#note a classic case of me exchanging when I shouldn't. JUN is worth playing, even though he could easily hit a big play there - it's just that DEHRR isn't that bad.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: AANTU 5F .UANTA +30 122
>Jesse_Day: BDEEIRT K2 REB.ITED +61 129
#note OH MY GOD I miss what would've been the prettiest play of my entire life!! and you'll even all know the word in question!
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: AAFL L4 ALFA +45 167
#note doing a great job thus far of using the board. Oh, and the word was INTERBREED. Sick, eh?
>Jesse_Day: ?AEIIRT 13G AIRIEsT +72 201
#note what the - no! not possible! I'm not allowed to miss two tens in one game! This one would be a terrible play, but if you find this play I will give you a cookie the next time I see you. No, seriously, I will.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: DFOO M6 FOOD +24 191
>Jesse_Day: EGMRSSV J12 V.M +14 215
#note I did not see REGMA at all, and my play is probably a little bit hasty, but I have the last two esses and there's no reason not to maximize their use. VIG is actually a little bit better than VIM supposedly, reflecting how crappy the G is as a bingo tile without the ING. But setting up VIGA makes no sense.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: KL H13 .LK +21 212
>Jesse_Day: EGOORSS B6 GROO. +17 232
#note another lost rack, but given my play and what I left this must've been it. Quackle likes SORGOS, which I a) didn't see and b) would hate for not maximizing the use of the esses. GROOM isn't great though...what should I do?
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: BEGIN 2J B.ING +28 240
>Jesse_Day: EOPSSUX 8M .XO +30 262
#note this play is absolute garbage, because XU at 1L is beautiful. he's just set me up with the last S, and unless he draws the Y for IFFY it'll be tricky to block. I think that I was running low on time, as per usual.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: AELT 1L TEAL +23 263
>Jesse_Day: ?EOPSSU H4 P. +7 269
#note ok, I was under mega time pressure because I have no idea what my rack was. Something like EOPSSU?...ok, that's right. Quackle likes SPOUSE at the bottom right, which beats the tar out of my play. Why not go up thirty-five with the blank in hand instead of making desperate fishing plays? I should look for that kind of play more often.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: GI 3I GI. +10 273
>Jesse_Day: ?EOSSTU A7 OS +14 283
#note I saw OUTSOLES but wasn't sure about it, but I don't think OESTROUS ever crossed my mind. My only missed bingo of the day, and pretty crappy timing for it. Yet again the next best play is SETOUS to the triple, and my play isn't very good at all.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: EIIR E10 .I.IER +18 291
#note lucky for me amnuay blocks the wrong lane...
>Jesse_Day: ?EESTUW O8 .UTWEEpS +83 366
#note I totally know OUTSWEEP, but I was so desperate to get anything at all down and so low on time that I don't care. Amnuay had to challenge though he knew it was good.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: ACEJPRY -  +0 291
>Jesse_Day: HNPUY L11 PU.HY +32 398
#note Amnuay also challenged this one, which I thought was pretty interesting. I suppose it's fairly low probability, and among a flotilla of -Y suffixes who knows which are good and which aren't? Which reminds me - ask me about the time I accepted BENCHY, which may have been the only time I have ever been intimidated into accepting a word.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: ACEHJOR -  +0 291
>Jesse_Day: N 4K ..N +5 403
>Jesse_Day:  (ACEHJOR) +38 441
#note The final score is no reflection of how well Amnuay played in the early and middle stages of the game and how lucky I had to get to win it. But I ain't gonna complain. I was so so happy I finally got to play a Thai player, and I told Amnuay that hopefully I'll get the chance to go over there and play King's Cup sooner or later. As far as the tournament goes for me, I had somehow without realizing it just salavaged a winning record for the day, with the prospect of returning to .500, even, and on the whole played my best day of scrabble in the tournament so far. With luck I would settle in further for day 4 and make my way back up the charts...
