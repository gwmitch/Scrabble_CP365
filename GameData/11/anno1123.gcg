#note The most misguided move of this whole unsavory sequence. Even moreso than the earlier LIE play, MINAE breaks up a great rack for no good reason. Pretty clearly, I should have just dropped the E for MEN D8.

#note PUG H13 was my first instinct, but the 4 consonant leave didn't look that great. But the bag was vowel-heavy; also PUG would block big Q plays, and I might be able to win without a bingo.
