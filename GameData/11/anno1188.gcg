>Dave_Koenig: AEFIIOW -AFIIOW +0 0
#note Yet again, I made a probably inferior choice to exchange my opening rack, and was rewarded by picking up a blank.  Sim says WAIF 8F is 7.4 ahead of the exchange.
>Jason_Katz-Brown: ABERZ 8D ZEBRA +52 52
>Dave_Koenig: ?DEENNW G8 .ENoWNED +63 63
#note I was about 80% sure UNWEANED was good, so it seemed better to stick with the word I was certain of, even though it was less safe.
>Jason_Katz-Brown: AILNQSU E4 QUIN.LAS +118 170
>Dave_Koenig: EIJRSTT I2 JITTERS +83 146
#note Quack says TRIJETS is 2 points better.  What is the duck smoking?  JITTERS looks better to me in every way.

>Dave_Koenig: ADGGHIV F2 GHI +22 205
#note Again, I find it hard to take the duck's top choice of VAGI F1 seriously.  Both VIGIA 6B and GHI are very close to it in the sim.
>Jason_Katz-Brown: ISX J8 SIX +44 292
>Dave_Koenig: ADGILOV 2I .OVIAL +36 241
#note This was a nice play, but I would have loved to be able to play the seven on my rack.

>Dave_Koenig: ADGNRRT L12 G.RD +16 288
#note All of the duck's plays are through this I, and sim favors all the long plays, with TRADING scoring tops, about 6.7 more than my play.  Given that I need to build toward a bingo and prolong the game, it makes a lot more sense to me to play short.

>Dave_Koenig: AAACILN 9B ANA. +16 337
#note A killer play that gives me the C hook, a good leave, and a fighting chance.
>Jason_Katz-Brown: ILOPTV B4 PIVOT.L +22 391
>Dave_Koenig: ?ACEILR A7 LACE +35 372
#note If there's any chance to do better in this game, it's right here.  I burned most of the time on my clock cycling through all the bingos on my rack to see if any of them fit on the A column, which didn't leave me much of a chance to contemplate the non-bingo options.  I decided to make a high scoring play that left one in the bag and hope for some miracle comeback on the other side of the board.  The problem is that it's too easy for him to lock things down on the right.  I think Quack has the right idea here: VIAL K2, leaves open the A column and creates a new bingo lane on the L column.  Quack thinks I win 29.8% of the time after that.  Other contenders are VAIL 29.56%, LAC 29.27%, TICAL 25.63%, LACE 23.2%.  It seemed to me that taking the extra five points with LACE was better than LAC, with all the remaining A's and E's to draw, but apparently I was wrong.

>Dave_Koenig: ?AFIRST A1 FARoS +26 398
#note Unfortunately for me he had a bunch of spots to go out in one.  Otherwise, I could have made some noise with IF J5 and RoAST G1.  FoIST G1 was two points better than my play.
