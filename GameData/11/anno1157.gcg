#note This play jumped out to me right away.  Then I said to myself, "no, that's not a word."  But then I thought it was again.  I was totally vacillating, but in the end convinced myself that it wouldn't have jumped out so quickly if it wasn't a word.  I knew two things for sure: that CUBAGE was a word, and that CUBITAGE didn't make any logical sense.  So why did I play it?  Because I'm a bonehead.
>Dave_Koenig: ?ACGITU --  -83 70
#note The real bingo that I should have played on this turn or the next one was AUGITIC.  Even if I had seen it, I probably would have been unsure if it was good.  But the really odd thing about doubting it is that I think I've played it before.  Funny how memory works. (or doesn't)

#note What the hell was I doing here?  Funny thing is that if Joel hadn't blocked the G, I would have played TITTLING*, which I was sure was good.
>Dave_Koenig: ?IINTTT --  -65 86
#note Joel mentioned out loud that he did not know whether it was good, but he correctly challenged.

#note The best bingo, and it got a long hold from Joel.  I was thinking that my earlier idiocy might pay off with a free turn here, but he correctly decided not to challenge.  This one I knew 100% not only that it was good, but also that it was a verb.

#note Yes, I did say "nice play."  Yes, I did not hold.  Yes, I'm still amazed that this is phony.

>Dave_Koenig: ?ABDILX D8 BI.XiAL +36 433
#note I figured it was only fitting to add to the idiocy of this game by playing the blank for zero points.  BIAXAL is the play of course, and I was pretty sure it was good.  But I knew that a lot of the -AXIAL words don't lose the I, and the thought of losing a third turn to a phony was a bit too embarrassing.
