>Mike_B: AABDLLS 8D BALLADS +76 76
>Cesar: ACNNOTY E7 C.NYON +22 22
#note my inner sense of judging plays suffers most in these types of situations. i can understand why BONNY is the best play if i think about it for a while, but i discarded it while playing. i don't understand why CANYON sims so bad. [-4.5] 
>Mike_B: IQ J6 QI. +32 108
>Cesar: AAAMOPT 12C PA.AMA +22 44
#note see above reason. i go for turnover way too much when i'm down and there's good tiles unseen. D10 AMA is best. but maybe my play works for me? [-6]
>Mike_B: EIR 13F REI +13 121
>Cesar: EILOTUV K2 VOLTI +27 71
#note i'm playing this worse than i thought. but can 14A OUTVIE really be the right play? [-8]
>Mike_B: IU C12 .IU +10 131

#note [-2] 3J OOZED. i thought of it, but eh.
>Mike_B: ?EINSST L6 SESTINa +76 212
>Cesar: AEHOORW K11 WORE +42 180
#note conrad told me i missed wahoo in the same position, but it's not playable! dammit conrad! 
>Mike_B: GNO 8L .ONG +15 227
#note this is a pretty clear telegraph that he drew the other blank. now, what the hell do i do? 
>Cesar: AEHHOVW 4H WHO.E +30 210
#note I13 VOW is better. i didn't notice this spot this turn. [-7]
>Mike_B: ?AELNPS O1 ELAPSiN. +89 316
>Cesar: AADFHRV H11 H..FA +33 243
#note ok, time to start getting desperate. HAIFA FTW
>Mike_B: AKY N1 YAK +35 351
>Cesar: ADEFRTV I13 VAT +33 276
#note it also likes just reiver. very interesting! i can draw for DRAFTEE. although it would have been likely blocked.
>Mike_B: EERT 5F TREE +14 365
>Cesar: DEFJORT 3G JOT +32 308
#note i hate blocking a bingo lane, but it doesn't seem likei have a choice. damn J! it sims highest.
>Mike_B: ETU N6 TU.E +11 376
>Cesar: BDEFIRR H1 BR...D +36 344
#note it likes 14E IF or EF better. i was thinking maybe i can draw some sort of weird B bingo and save the F spot for next turn in case he tries to block up there. i don't see any weird B bingos i could draw. [-5]
>Mike_B: GM 10D G.M +15 391

#note [-5] FOIN (???)
