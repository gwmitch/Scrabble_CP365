#note I really agonized over this one. VETCH looked good for the leave, but setting up a 70-point K play seemed too swingy. I missed CRWTH, which is probably best.

#note Another tough decision. I guess I should have just played MOC E10, which sims best by a fair margin. Obviously, I was worried about getting bogged down in consonants, but the NRTH combination is synergistic enough to avoid major trouble.

#note ATONE might have been a little safer, but I thought I had a read on Chris as being close to a bingo. In that case, I might be able to profitably hit 15A; this was wrong today.

#note EXING 13F is a nifty play that was never on my radar.
