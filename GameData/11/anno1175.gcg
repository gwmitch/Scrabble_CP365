#note I spent a while on this rack, saying to myself, "this can't be the best I have here.  Where's the better play?"  Turns out there isn't any.

#note Again, the best that I could do.

#note MIDGET 3H is clearly the best play here.  It scores the most and keeps the synergistic MP combo.  This is a bad miss, and cost me about 10 equity.  Looking back at the position now, the play seems obvious.  But it was getting late in the evening, and I was definitely feeling fatigued.  The fact that I was wading through consonant drek for three turns in a row while he smacked me around every single play certainly didn't help.

#note I made best plays here and every turn up until the phony.  But it didn't matter.  This game was just out of hand.

#note I seem to make it a point to play one phony five against John almost every time we play.  He always challenges them off too.  I know perfectly well this one is no good, too, but my eyes were getting bleary.

#note Playing the Q at 9A is better to take away his big scoring spot and to preserve two places for JAWAN.

#note He should have made his two final plays in the opposite order.
