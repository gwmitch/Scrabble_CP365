#note Surprisingly to me, KYE sims about 5 points ahead of this exchange.  Yes, it scores a nice 16 points and leaves the board very dead if he doesn't have an S, but it seems to me that playing off the E seriously reduces my bingo chances.  Note that UGH takes the S in both front and back.

#note The key moment of the game.  I was almost certain that PUGHS* was phony, but I decided that the board was so dead that losing a turn wouldn't hurt me that much here.  So I could afford to gamble and put Kenji's word knowledge to the test.  He didn't even say hold.

#note ODEON is virtually even with this in the sim.  Normally the extra points would probably make ODEON worthwhile, but this play has the advantage of keeping the REINDEX extension, or even REINDEXED if I pull another E.

#note Clearly the right play is to dump vowelage in this spot, but there's more than one way to do it.  I was torn between this play and AGEE, which are not far from each other in equity.  However, I didn't see EAGER which is a superior play.  The extra points are worth breaking up the rack a bit more.  AGEE is about 4 back, GEE about 5 back.

#note This is the second best bingo, but there is a clearcut winner.

>Dave_Koenig: ADDFSSZ 5J ZA.FS +34 356
#note Interestingly, sim thinks FADS 10J is 6.5 points better than this.  The board is not great for the Z, but I think the main reason is that FADS makes it nearly impossible for him to get bingos down.
