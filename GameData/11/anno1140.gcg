>Joe_Bihlmeyer: ??ANPRU -??A +0 0
#note I sure hope that wasn't actually his rack
>Magrathean: EEGLOSU -EGOU +0 0
#note quackle actually likes the exchange even without the inference that he has good tiles.
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: AA 8G AA +4 4
>Magrathean: ?EJLOSV -J +0 0
#note I think that with inferences, exchange J is a better move than LAV. Right now he's much more likely to leave me a double-double by bingoing than after LAv
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: ?ABEGRS 7G BAGgERS +74 78
#note I actually held this play for a few seconds before realizing that I was a nimrod.
>Magrathean: ?ELOSTV K5 OV.rLETS +90 90
#note VOTELESS and LOVEFEST are both more defensive, but I like setting up the C...not that I saw either of those other two
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: DENPTU 9B PUNTED +20 98
>Magrathean: FIINOWX 8A FOX +52 142
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: EHU J10 HUE +31 129
>Magrathean: AIILNRW M2 RAWIN. +18 160
#note I agonized for about 6 minutes over this move, when it turns out that there really was nothing that much better. Quackle likes WAIL at J2, perplexingly...why set up the S hook?
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: EGO 2K OG.E +10 139
>Magrathean: BIILPTZ F8 B.ZIL +41 201
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: ADIMMRY 12D MI.EU +16 155
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: ADIMMRY --  -16 139
#note unfortunately for joe, I speak french.
>Magrathean: ADILPTY 1H PITY +32 233
#note unclear why I didn't just take the points with PLATY, but whatever
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: EMU 12D MU.E +12 151
>Magrathean: AACDLQT E11 Q.A +46 279
#note I guess QUA is pretty dangerous too, and ACDLT is far worse than ACLT, but I still don't like making it that easy for him by playing QUAD
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: DENOT 14A TONED +26 177
>Magrathean: ACDLRTY A11 CAT.Y +33 312
#note just outright missed the hook to MULEY for all sorts of high scoring plays...sigh
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: CNORS 15E SCORN +36 213
>Magrathean: DILNRRU 2E LURID +15 327
#note god, I hate this kind of rack. Right word, wrong spot. No need to open the triple
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: HIM 13G HIM +24 237
>Magrathean: AEKNNRR E2 .ANKER +20 347
#note quackle actually likes LANKER a lot...I'm not totally sure myself
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: AEILSTV O1 ESTIVAL +89 326
>Magrathean: AEEINRW 13A .WA +21 368
#note ??? Quackle appears to go haywire with this move, saying that AW at 14I is way better. I really have no idea what to think...suggestions?
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: EFGIIOO F5 IF +32 358
#note you have thirty seconds...what's the right move?
>Magrathean: DEEIJNR 4B JIN. +22 390
#note I actually find the right endgame under time pressure, unlike the next game...
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: EGIOOO 9K .OGOI +8 366
>Magrathean: DEER A1 REED +36 426
>Magrathean:  (EO) +4 430
