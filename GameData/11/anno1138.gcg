>Magrathean: ACIKOST 8H ICK +18 18
#note I don't know what to think about this one. ICK clearly gives back too much counterplay, but quackle likes KOI, which leaves the I next to a double letter! I think KA is likely best.
>George_Viebranz: MOPPRT G3 PROMPT +28 28
#note sweet play.
>Magrathean: AAMORST F6 MOS +38 56
#note Missed bingo. saw MARCATOS, didn't like it because I thought it was a musical direction. Turns out it's a musical passage played in the marcato style. bleh. Quackle hates playing through the S, I underestimated just how bad it would be, but in retrospect I don't like setting up the Y at all, and the S helps the AART leave out a great deal.

#note sometimes I is luckbox.
>George_Viebranz: GOW I3 WOG +23 89
>Magrathean: ADIORTU E5 OUT +18 165
#note an important move. OUT is second best, but DUI does a really nice job of blocking dangerous overlaps along the Q and ZA, and would've paid off. Thought about playing QI to fish for READOUT, but correctly avoided it. Sometimes 2 point equity mistake can cost a lot more than that.
>George_Viebranz: INX L4 NIX +50 139
>Magrathean: ADHIIIR 1G R.DII +6 171
#note not as horrible as I thought at the time, but I missed IRID, which uses the same tiles and is blatantly better, although given his next play it probably would've hurt in real life. AHI is also a decent play.

>George_Viebranz: ?EGHNOO C3 N.E +15 178
>Magrathean: AAGHNNO A5 AGHA +30 235
#note just about even with AGON. I would rather take the points.
>George_Viebranz: AENORSU D7 ARENOUS +72 250
>Magrathean: DENNORU C9 DONNE +31 266
#note y'know, I saw DUNNER and passed it up because DUN is a verb too. Sigh.
>George_Viebranz: EIIILST M2 EAU +8 258
>Magrathean: ACDEIRU 14A CUD +20 286
#note DUE is about even, although I didn't see the DONNEE hook
>George_Viebranz: ?AEILRT H8 .nERTIAL +74 332
>Magrathean: ADEIORY B9 OY +31 317
#note missed the play to the triple, DIOECY, which I guess has to be better just because of the points. Also worth noting is YO, which sims evenly with OY in spite of giving up a point because of its defensiveness
>George_Viebranz: EEEFLNW A12 LI.E +21 353
>Magrathean: ABDEINR N4 BRAINED +71 388
#note has to be right, tempo and all.
>George_Viebranz: F 2M .F +10 363
#note uhoh
>Magrathean: EFGHILT M9 FIGHT +44 432
#note I think this play has to be right. It wins 5/8 endgames, or 4/7 I guess given that he almost certainly has the blank. The next best play only hits 3/8.
>George_Viebranz: ?ELOSTW 15H .OWLiEST +80 443
#note Nice find, George. As it turns out, the two tiles in the bag when he made his play were the E and the S, and if he draws the E then he can play TOWELLED, but not for enough. So it goes. Quackle tells me that he can also win by playing TEAbOWLS here and hooking to FIGHTS.
