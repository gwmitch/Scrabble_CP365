>Jane_Whitmore: ?ACHNRX -? +0 0
#note for whatever reason, using the exchange 1 command prompts quackle to put in a fake rack.
>Magrathean: AAIOVWY 8E WAVY +26 26
#note sacrificing points because of the X1 - trying to cut down on bingos
>Jane_Whitmore: MOO 7C MOO +13 13
>Magrathean: ACGIOOS 8A GOO +16 42
#note only 8 is GRACIOSO - a little worried about putting the G there. Quackle sims it equal with COO and AGO, but maybe should give COO more respect
>Jane_Whitmore: AE 9C AE +9 22
>Magrathean: AACEISS 10A AAS +11 53
#note misevaluated the synergy...IC better than AC, but not with the ES thrown in. However, best play is clearly CASA - sets up the S nicely for next turn, might as well take the points
>Jane_Whitmore: ERZ D4 ZER. +26 48
>Magrathean: BCEEINS F7 N.BE +14 67
#note toyed with playing ABCISE, should just play BE...I think I would see this normally
>Jane_Whitmore: RWY E10 WRY +23 71
>Magrathean: ACEINPS A1 ESCAPIN. +92 159
#note wrong bingo - missed SAPIENCY, which is worse positionally but scores much more
>Jane_Whitmore: ?AFLOST 5C r.FLOATS +70 141
>Magrathean: DENRTUV A10 .DVERT +42 201
#note mistakenly deciding that UN was better than UR, which is untrue
>Jane_Whitmore: IK 4H KI +24 165
>Magrathean: EILNNTU J3 UN.ILENT +69 270
>Jane_Whitmore: ADEOTTU I9 OUTDATE +65 230
>Magrathean: DDEFGIJ 15G JE.D +36 306
#note quackle likes taking the points with JEFE, but I like that by drawing an E or an L next turn I set up a big play (FUDGE or FULGID)
>Jane_Whitmore: BEHNQUX 13G QU. +22 252
>Magrathean: DFGIILP 3I F.LGID +40 346
>Jane_Whitmore: ?EIORST L3 .EnITORS +68 320
>Magrathean: CEGHIPU 2M PIC +24 370
#note missed VICHY, the biggest scoring play. I guess I just liked the idea of drawing for QUAHAUG.
>Jane_Whitmore: BIO D12 BIO +24 344
>Magrathean: EGHMNNU C13 HM +28 398
#note hard not to get scared by the last play into some kind of block of the huge X play. Of course, I draw AX out of the bag, but that seems better than quackle's suggestion of ENOUGH, which empties the bag
>Jane_Whitmore: HI B1 HI +19 363
>Magrathean: AEGNNUX K10 ANNEX +28 426
#note so, she might not see it, but I have to block QUARREL. My way is 7 points worse than playing DUNNAGE, which I didn't know and would be afraid to play in case I'd mistracked.
