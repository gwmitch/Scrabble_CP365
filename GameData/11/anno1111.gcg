#note Just to illustrate how not all my marbles were there yet, I almost laid CHID down in this spot, then looked down at my rack and saw the ERS.

#note I preferred this way of scoring with the J to close out the triple-triple lane.

#note Best, but I burned a lot of time looking for bingos.

#note From this point onward, my bladder felt like it was going to explode.  To top it off I had already been frustrated about not being able to find bingos earlier and was running very low on time.  I was pretty sure there were some bingos through the E, but I failed to find any of them.  (I did see ELEMENTS, the one bingo that doesn't fit.  I'm pretty sure I saw MEETNESS, but doubted its validity.)  However, I felt fairly confident there was no E ending bingo to the triple, and I thought that scoring plays off the X on row 4 were likely better than 60 point bingos along the bottom.  The move I played was a good one, and better than bingoing, but it definitely rattled me that I couldn't *see* the bingos, even though I would have passed them up.

#note I'm holding the blank for the fourth turn in a row, haven't found any bingos, feel like an idiot, running dangerously low on time in a close game, and about to wet my pants.  Failing to find anything on a quick scan through the E or R, I figure I better grab the good scoring Y play and hope to bingo the next turn.  Later, as I'm about to type the rack into Quackle, I said out loud, "Oh you putz, you missed ANDESYTE."  I woulda been in good shape to win the game.  Instead I was immediately punished for what was (over the board) my only mistake in the game to this point.

#note Gah!  First the Y, then the K.  I gotta score and keep the bingo line open up top and hope to get very lucky.

#note Explanation: I had around 5 seconds left on my clock and *seriously* thought that I was going to pee my pants.  I had seen of SLOGAN C2, which I really wanted to play against LOGAN, but he blocked it.  I wanted to throw the letters down as quickly as I could and RUN to the pissoir.  I threw down BLINS* super fast without even thinking about it, and as Adam is saying he is going to challenge it, I say, "I've got to go the bathroom," and bolt out of there in a flash.
>Dave_Koenig: ?LNS --  -4 406
#note Adam politely waited by the challenge computer for me to return.  But his best play was to carry out the challenge, take my play off the board, pass his turn, and restart my clock.  He probably would have taken 20 or 30 points off my score then.
>Adam_Logan: U G3 U.. +4 460
#note Fittingly, I still had the damn blank on my rack till the end, due to my own incompetence and bladder.
>Adam_Logan:  (LNS?) +6 466
