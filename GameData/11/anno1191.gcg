#note second game in the early bird, this was right after my game with carl. i was happy that this was just the early bird.
>Cesar: AENOORR G8 .ROON +16 40
#note horrible miss. i didn't even think to look. (i also didn't find adorner. and i don't remember looking thru there either, i just slapped down the first thing i saw. this is a good game to think about -- good example of allowing myself to give up so early). [-48]

#note quackle says just dropping the Q at B1 gives me a 50% chance of winning!! but i actually went through the tiles here. if i draw the S, i have FINALISE -- which he can easily block with GOR or something of the sort. i'm not sure what quackle is talking about here.... the other move it likes is K10 INIA, also for 50%. cute but how do i win ?
