#note Interestingly, QUOD H6 sims best, despite scoring 11 points less. The defensive advantages are clear, especially if opponent lacks an S; still, it seems like a lot to give up so early in the game.

#note Missed NIDGET 11H.

#note Without an S, it was pretty tough to convert a bingo rack on this board.
>Adam: ?AEGIMR O3 GERMInA +82 202
#note EpIGRAM is 7 more, but maybe he didn't want to set up the X.
