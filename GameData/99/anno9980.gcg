#note i considered BELIVE mainly because there is a small chance that he doesn't know that it doesn't take hooks, but that is not a good reason to play it, plus i have no idea how to quantify that. i know that david has strong word knowledge.

#note the difference is tiny, but BLEARIER is better. i beat myself up over this too much. (-0.3)

#note i think this was a tough choice between MONEY and M7 YO. the moves achieve different objectives. there is a third choice that is also close that i didn't even see, STYMIE for 42, which achieves yet another objective. at this point in the game, with this type of board, i prefer to either score a lot and play open, or devolatilize the board. i'm going to catch up with my move so the score is basically even. it's just a tough choice, but i would have played STYMIE had i seen it. YO sims a little higher than my play, but i felt like i wanted a semblance of board control. (-4)

#note quackle actually likes TOONIE almost as much. it seems weird to me, but my average score after it is nearly comparable to after OKE.

#note lame. missed GINZO, C2 ZIG, and D12 GIRO. GIRO seems right to me. i actually spent some time looking there too, but it must have been half-heartedly. (-6)

#note crap...
>cesar: CEGIORZ H1 CORG. +30 303
#note i really did not like 3A ZOIC and am very surprised it sims at the top. ZIG C2 is very close behind and looks a little more reasonable. i guess now is not a time to play scared, and i liked scoring 30 and giving myself another chance to also score with the Z. (-2.5)
>pearl: AEILTUW C1 WAUL +16 335
#note he also considered OUTWILE, which seems kind of risky with three Ds unseen, but WAUL gives back slightly more on average. WAUL also allows him to score a bit more. i think OUTWILE sims better because of the lower volatility.

#note championship player says this only wins 41.67% of the time, and is also the winningest move. that's a bit surprising to me actually. i thought my chance of winning after this was in the 70s -- although i did see ARCHIVED as a possibility. there's actually a bunch more possible - HYOIDEAN, CHICANED, VOIDANCE, VERDANCY; maybe these are contributing to the low win %.
