#note this was actually kind of a tough choice. which overstep is best? purely a defensive consideration; being that i like playing offense maybe i should go for the play i'm more comfortable with. my play sims better by a little bit; half a point.

#note i strongly considered I4 GOX. if it didn't keep two Is it would kick ass.

>cesar: AGHIIOY 12K AHOY +22 195
#note ugh this is really bad. HOAGIE is the clear winner here, but even various plays at I3 are ok like HOYA, AGIO, whatever. 3G VIGIA is interesting too. AHOY gives too much back, keeps a terrible leave, and doesn't score enough. (-10)

#note question. which fish is best? i beat myself up for not playing 3G VIG, but that's more closed than this fish. best go all out. although after DAW, i have no idea if this is correct.

#note my move is about three million times worse than the best move of F8 IKON here. i even thought of DAWK but was too lazy to go down another two letters. ugh. (-20.5)
