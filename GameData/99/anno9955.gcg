>Vicky: ADERZ 8H RAZED +34 34
>Noah: EIILOVW 9F VIEW +26 26
#note There's a good variety of considerations here. Perhaps WI(Z) to keep an opener board instead.
>Vicky: ?AALPRT 10H PARTiAL +73 107
>Noah: BEGILOW L3 GLOWE. +22 48
#note Quackle likes OB(I) here, which is a reasonable option. Tough play, and I do kind of like opening the top of the board more here, but something OBI is probably a better way to do that, with a still good-enough leave.
>Vicky: BGINRV M9 B.RING +24 131
#note She first set down R(A)VI...
>Noah: BEIIIRU -BIIIU +0 48
>Vicky: FT 7K F.T +12 143
>Noah: DEEERSU F8 E.E +8 56
#note Tough play. REUSED seemed to give up so much potential in my leave, so I chose this to open dynamically and keep strong tiles. Quackle actually suggests (L)EU and (R)UE, which both are good plays.
>Vicky: BHTY 5K B.THY +26 169
>Noah: DEIKRSU O8 DUSKIER +98 154
>Vicky: AHIR O1 HAIR. +36 205
>Noah: FIILNPY E5 PINY +23 177
#note Also available is PINY/PYIN on row 11, which I didn't see. That might be a little better, though it's nice that I am setting up a scoring spot for my F here.

>Vicky: AMOX D4 MOXA +45 275

#note Or perhaps STANcES 12E.
>Vicky: JTU C3 JUT +29 304
>Noah: AAEEQRS 10A QA. +19 304
>Vicky: DEIO D11 .IDEO +27 331
>Noah: AEENORS F2 O.E +5 309
#note I just saw few good ways to give me a shot. I guess (W)OE could me reasonable, coming within 9 and maybe winning my points alone, or drawing something through the O. This forfeits to most racks.
>Vicky: CDNOO 1D CONDO +37 368
>Noah: AENOORS 6L .OO +18 327
#note Neither of us saw the key play here: UMIA(Q) A5. To play the best endgame, that must be seen.
