>cesar: ABEIMST C5 BI. +11 72
#note this didn't show up in the original list but sims pretty decently. 6B KAB though sims best because BIN is giving too much back. it also makes it easier for this to turn into a goddamn staircase. (-3)
>cynthia: ELY D3 LEY +19 92
>cesar: AAELMST I2 MALATES +69 141
#note i think i didn't play MALTASE because i didn't want to give up an easy comeback, but she's still likely to score enough. silly sacrifice. (-2)

#note i missed a number of better bingos, 5H mARRIAGE, 2A RANGIER O3 SuGARER. believe it or not, i was already pretty low on time. cynthia was playing fast and i was futilely trying to control the board. (-7.5)

#note ugh. N5 WAUR did not seem appetizing to me, and K10 WAUR was also way too open. i didn't know wat to do here so i just scored, really gritting my teeth at the worst leave of all time. K10 WAUR does give the most back. however, the irrigate hooks are already pretty damn open, and WOVENS is a word, so it's not like the board is not juicy. the best thing to do in a situation like this is to race for the better leave. TAJ puts it too much on chance. (-12.5)
>cynthia: T B2 T. +8 246
#note that's not good. crap crap crap
>cesar: INORUUW 10B WO +36 299
#note it just scores way too much. there's no alternative. UU again it is.

>cynthia: AQST 12B QATS +38 329
>cesar: EHINRUY B12 .UEY +32 346
#note QUEY is giving a lot more back than QUIN but i'm scoring and i need to score.  QUIN is slightly winninger. (-1%)
>cynthia: DEEFNR 11I FENDER +30 359
#note HOLY CRAP. i had already flung my pen across the room and stormed off and threw all my scoresheets and beard in the trash and then had to go pick it up when she didn't put down the blank. just kidding. 
>cesar: AHIIINR A14 HA +35 381
#note great cesar, three i's. saw AYIN, wanted to not only score more, but make it a lot harder for her to plan an out in two. AYIN is better, though. (-4)

>cesar: DEIIINR E1 DI.NE +30 411
#note that E was a godsend; although IRIDIC would also have done the trick (i likely wouldn't have found it)
