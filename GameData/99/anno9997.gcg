#note This is the critical play. I wasn't sure what to do given Isaac's entire rack. I was hoping to find some sort of setup, or something that gave him weake bingos or blocked the board. Basically, I really didn't like Isaac's next move, and I'm wondering if I should've done something about preventing it....

#note APNOEA G9 would have been sick, but now I had a tougher desicion. I think this is my major mistake. The top of the board isn't hard to block, but the bottom is brutal. A(L)OE takes out the bottom nicely, and I can overlap next turn. APNOEA(L) is also available, but I didn't like being so open.

>Noah: AENOORR 13K AERO +21 171
>Isaac: DRY 12J DRY +29 154
>Noah: EGNOORT O1 RONTGE. +27 198
#note Unfortunately, it seemed like it was time to open at this point, as I didn't see anything nearly as strong as this.
>Isaac: BILNRTU 5H BLURTIN. +72 226
>Noah: ABCMOTT H1 CABO. +36 234
#note Again, didn't know TOMBA(L) (pertaining to a tomb). This time though, CABOB might just be the play.
>Isaac: AET 4K EAT +14 240
>Noah: EEIMTTT G9 TIT +19 253
>Isaac: AHI N1 AHI +26 266
>Noah: EEIMQTV -EIMQV +0 253
#note Time to go for esses and blanks here. EIMT is also a reasonable option, though.
>Isaac: EGIMORS 15A OGREISM +87 353
>Noah: ?CEJOST 6B ObJECTS +85 338
>Isaac: AUV E4 UV.A +14 367
>Noah: AAFHIMP 14A HAAF +38 376
#note Seems like I'm in a pickle here in most situations. Just gotta hope for an S or something.
>Isaac: ADEFQSU 2F QU.D +34 401
#note Isaac wasn't sure enough of UVEAS, though this is only 2 points worse than 8A QUADS because of (C)AFES F7.
>Noah: IIKMPZ C12 IZ.. +26 402
#note Similarly, ZI(T) 9E is actually 2 better!
>Isaac: AEFS 1H .AFES +14 415
#note But he missed F6.
