>Ryan_Fischer: ?CEISTT 8D CuTTIES +72 72
#note This sims best of the multiple options, but I might have wanted to consider something a little more volatile and open considering I don't know my opponent except that he's rated below me hasn't played a tournament for a few years.
>Mohamed_Alim: BCNOY E6 BO.NCY +24 24
>Ryan_Fischer: AAILLPU 7I PILAU +20 92
#note Of note: D1 PALLIA 26.

>Mohamed_Alim: OOOOOUU -OOOOOUU +0 63
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEILNR 8L ANIL +20 148
#note Static Q says fish off the A.  Sim knows better, liking ANIL.
>Mohamed_Alim: BIJ 5I JIB +44 107
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEIORS G2 AI +15 163
#note This is where I get sloppy.  I reason, hey, I have the R, this has gotta be a decent fish with the L and C open.  (C)IAO is probably better, and this is vulnerable in a way I overlooked.  O(C)A cuts off the T and C.  Maybe I shoulda just exchanged.
>Mohamed_Alim: ESTZ H1 ZEST +56 163
#note Ugh.  So careless of me.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADELORS M7 ..LOADERS +72 235
#note But at least I hit my fish.
>Mohamed_Alim: ?AAEIMT 15F AnIMATE. +80 243
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEMNOP 14F MOPE +33 268
#note PED(R)O: a card game.  9 more points.
>Mohamed_Alim: IX N10 XI +52 295
#note Well, if I'm getting hit by stuff like that, I really can't blame myself too much.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEGGNR L1 GENRE +29 297
#note Wins the sim, but it's looking pretty grim.  I NEED one of those As.  That's the game right there.
>Mohamed_Alim: EHO M2 HOE +23 318
#note (I hate plays like that.)
>Ryan_Fischer: DGINORW L10 GROW +41 338
#note Well, that sorta helps.  Getting low on time though.
>Mohamed_Alim: HO 13I HO +21 339
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEINRR O11 DINER +26 364
#note Suddenly the win% is swinging in my favor, but perhaps I shouldn't have broken up this rack just yet.  I just didn't want him to hit me at O11 before I could.  With respect to that, M2 HOER wins the sim.
>Mohamed_Alim: ATV 12H VAT +21 360
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGIRSU M2 ...D +23 387
#note Best, but fat lotta good it does me.  The sim likes RUG(BY), opening another lane with my neat DEIS leave.  I considered ZIG, too, but that's much weaker at the same score.
>Mohamed_Alim: AEFKN 13C KENAF +46 406
#note %#^()@@!  There's that @$(&@)@-ing A I was looking for!
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIORSU C13 .I +6 393
#note 11C GU(Y) 7 is 12.5% to win.  Wonder how.  Here my brain just pretty much melted down and I lost 30 points off my clock before fishing off one letter in the worst place possible.  I really don't see what else I coulda done here.  AI mighta been my worst mistake.  PEDRO hurt in that it allowed KENAF later.
