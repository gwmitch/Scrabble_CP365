>Tobey: HLORW 8D WHORL +30 30
>Chris: DEGIOOR H4 GOOD.IER +62 62
#note Pretty fortunate that he gave me one of LN here to play through. 
>Tobey: AAGLPST -AAGPLST +0 30
#note Exch. 4
>Chris: ADEELPT 11H .EPLATED +72 134
#note Forgot that PALTERED is a word. Bye bye 2% win equity!
>Tobey: AEMZ O7 MAZE. +51 81
#note Although this scored 51 I was very happy to see him play it :P
>Chris: CCDGHVY N10 H.DGY +55 189
#note Because this. Dat leave. I actually missed a higher scoring play, but since it takes an S and HEDGY doesn't, my play is still best.
>Tobey: ?AEENPT N1 PEnNATE +74 155
#note Nice bingo. I won't mention the elephant in the room hehe.
>Chris: CCLOTUV E3 CLUTC. +26 215
#note This is not a very clutch play. I thought of CLOV(E) J2 to block the triple but wrote it off as stupidly paranoid, then thought of VOCAL K5. Didn't consider VOCAL L8 or VOUCH E4l (the sim winners) at all. Uncharacteristically poor board vision by me here. I didn't know the anagram of CLUTCH, CULTCH, at all. From my last turn, Y(E)CCH was 59. 
>Tobey: AIN 1L NI.A +21 176
#note Not sure what he had with AIN but I was happy to see him likely sacrificing to block this not-so-dangerous spot.
>Chris: EGNORUV M7 GUV +21 236
#note Wanted to keep NG for CLUTCHING with so many I's out but this is just too much better than something like 4B OVULE and CLUTCHING is only 34.
>Tobey: BY L11 .BY +16 192
>Chris: AEINOQR E3 ......IER +32 268
#note I thought this might be good. It's not, but CLUTCHY is, which is weird. Part of the reason I played it is that if Tobey has a bingo after his fish last turn, he's less likely to challenge. He didn't even hold this, but to be fair I think this would be a tough challenge for most players to make. 
>Tobey: ?ABEERS 14F BEAtERS +75 267
#note I think he should play BEAvERS instead to limit parallel playback. Nevertheless, he's caught up to me after my fast start!
>Chris: ADNOQRW 15E WORD +39 307
#note Debated WAND and WORD and missed ONWARD for 48. Ugh :( I did like that WORD set up a short S hook lane and was hoping to draw QATS or something there. 
>Tobey: FF F8 .FF +35 302
>Chris: AINQSTV 5K QAN.T +28 335
#note I hit QATS but then started debating between it and QANAT K5, which I ended up playing. This board is deceptively bad for both bingoing and scoring, so I should have taken the extra 10 points for QATS here. 
>Tobey: IJN 6J JIN +39 341
#note He's ahead now? Wtf am I gonna start 1-3? Also lol got punished.
>Chris: INOSUVX O14 OX +32 367
#note Simming best by over 2%. Not much reason to save the X by playing DUOS H7 because the SWORD scoring spot is becoming pretty important.
>Tobey: AIM D4 AMI +20 361
>Chris: AINRSUV D10 RAVINS +38 405
#note 4L VINA is simming 10% higher than D10 RAVINS and I don't understand. a 6 hooking KEF and SWORD by him would put the game in danger and KAN* isn't a word... He held this for a while, probably because he knew if it was good his winning chances weren't good. 
>Tobey: AE M11 .EA +26 387
#note I had been eyeing that spot for a while.
>Chris: IILNOSU M1 .NIO. +16 421
#note Q likes DUOS H7 again but I wanted to play it safe and block the bingo lane. The only bingo in the pool is TOOTSIE, but he could still have it I guess!
