>Josh_Sokol: BEOORUZ H4 BOOZE +38 38
#note I start off doubting BOOZER and missing REBOZO! Go me!

Dual commentary in this game by Morris and I.
>Morris_Greenberg: EEGJMOO I3 JOE +24 24
>Josh_Sokol: DFILLRU 9D FLUID +28 66
#note Again doubting BOOZER I should have played FURL, but I didn't think Morris was too likely to burn me on the spot I opened. 
>Morris_Greenberg: AEGIIMO 8A AGIO +24 48
>Josh_Sokol: AR I7 AR +17 83
#note Here I saw RAILCAR and ARRIVAL, the only 7s. I looked for 8s. I didn't see LARRI(G)An (probably would have doubted it too much to play anyhow) and I didn't know wARRI(G)AL. But I looked pretty lengthily at the BO, seeing things like ARBORIALS*, which I was pretty sure it would be spelled ARBOREALS* if ARBOREAL took an S, and it looked as though I could have something there. But I just couldn't manage to see a sick AR(BO)vIRAL for some reason. I had the right idea but couldn't complete it.
>Morris_Greenberg: DEEEILM 4F EM..ILED +26 74
#note Morris: I was pretty sure this was phony, it is much better than other options though.

Josh: I held this for a while, knew I had studied BEILMOS and that it was MOBILES and something else. I concluded that it might be EMBOILS* so I let it go, even though EMBOLI/EMBOLUS made me doubt EMBOIL* a lot. These factors, Morris' frequent phonying and him having challenged UPBOIL last game should have given me the courage to challenge this.

#note Only thing
>Morris_Greenberg: EEFIOSS 15A F.OE +24 98
>Josh_Sokol: DEHNOQR C7 Q. +21 174
>Morris_Greenberg: EGIKSSU E8 S.UG +16 114
#note I was choosing between K(L)UGE K3 and this. I liked this leave a lot more. Quackle likes KU(E) F2 and SUK J8 more than both though.
>Josh_Sokol: DDEHNOR F9 .H +26 200
#note At least here I looked to see what I would draw into if I played off the H over playing 5K OHED or 3E EDH. I saw ADORNED, ROUNDED and DENDROID and that was enough for me. I also saw HORNED and DEHORN.

What's that? DEHORNED played? Oh really.

D(I)HEDRON too.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EIKSTT K2 KI.TiEST +72 186
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EIKSTT --  -72 114
#note I seriously thought this was good. Yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck.
>Josh_Sokol: DDENOOR 5K OD +13 213
#note I thought this blocked some stuff and allowed me to score and/or bingo after Morris plays SKITTlE somewhere next turn. That's what seemed the most plausible thing for Morris to play next turn. But SKITTlED* is no good, and Morris would probably have challenged and screwed with my confidence. This is still probably right as it blocks Ta(L)KIEST, T(E)KtITES and (D)ISKeTTE.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EIKSTT 12E SKITTEd +67 181
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EIKSTT --  -67 114
#note And I seriously thought this was good. YuUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuuuuuuuuuuuuUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuUUUuUuUuUuUccccccccccccccck.
>Josh_Sokol: DENORWY J8 ROWDY +23 236
#note Morris: Smart block.

Josh: My confidence level was rising so high after two successful challenges. That never happens to me!
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EIKSTT M2 KI. +16 130
#note Quackle prefers a safer play like K(Y)TE 12I.
>Josh_Sokol: AEENNTV N1 VAN +26 262
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EINSTT O2 ENTwIST +81 211
#note Well, as a consolation for completely shooting myself in the foot twice, this is the only bingo that fits here.
>Josh_Sokol: EENNPRT N6 PEEN +26 288
#note Scared of the X now.
>Morris_Greenberg: CEEMNST I12 ME +12 223
#note As good as anything here.
>Josh_Sokol: AHNRTTU 14I TRUANT +21 309
#note Didn't look like Morris would be able to score after this because of his last play. After I played this I noticed THRU in the same spot and wondered if that was a superior play. I think it might be given a strong rack inference but maybe TRUANT's benefits are just so large. (MET)H, 14L H___ underlaps, etc.
>Morris_Greenberg: CEENSTY 15H TEENY +55 278
>Josh_Sokol: ABCHIRV 3B BIRCH +29 338
#note 5B BIRCH allows for GESTAPO at 3A. I thought there could be a few bingos that fit at A3. I mean I guess Morris could also not have an S which makes INSCAPE and CATALPA available too. Anyways it seemed obvious which BIRCH was superior here but the simulation disagrees for whatever reason. BACH is good here too. M7 BRAVI isn't something I thought of. It's probably just as good as BIRCH because of 9s that may fit that BRAVI would block and just the sheer rareness of a bingo at A3.
>Morris_Greenberg: ACGSTUW O12 WAST +40 318
#note CUTAW(AY) L9 is flashy. I am winning less than 2% of the time here.
>Josh_Sokol: AEIOPSV 4A VISE +32 370
#note Aww, nowhere for my phony PAVOISE* that I keep thinking is a word! D1 plays like VE(R)A and PA(R)VE/PA(R)VO are better than this if I know for sure that Morris can't have anything, but if I want to play it safe I should play A(R)VO setting up my P! This seems like the 5th best play, but I knew it won so I played it. I didn't play VASE because of A(BA)/LAX at 2A.
>Morris_Greenberg: AACGLUX A11 LAX +25 343
#note I considered C(R)U, I saw it still lost. I completely forgot to consider C(R)UX though...both are better than this.
>Josh_Sokol: ANOP 2B OP +23 393
#note I knew his letters and I didn't see anywhere he could play GUACO or some weird other thing. If I saw the spot at 6D I would have made the right endgame play. But I suck.
>Morris_Greenberg: ACGU 6D GUAC. +10 353
#note I averaged 26 points per turn on racks where I didn't hold the blank. I averaged 24.25 points per turn on racks where I had the blank. Therefore, blanks stink.
>Morris_Greenberg:  (AN) +4 357
