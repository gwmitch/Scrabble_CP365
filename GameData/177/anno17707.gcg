#note I saw sOM(E)DEAL like 2 seconds after I hit my clock, despite spending almost 3 minutes looking for the best choice. I chose this over MELODIAS to create two scoring places- 15 and M.

#note Oof. WARM M10 is the play here for sure. I overlook MM so often =\

#note This was another really hard turn. YUCA gives up the S, yeah, but everything else sucks. It's still pretty hard to bingo with that S, just get some points. This keeps the M which will be important for O12. (J)AY just gets hit with a big counter play.

Should I play AY O14 for 20 instead?

>Matt_Canik: BDDNOQY -BDNOQY +0 258
#note I think I need to exchange here. The Q is going to be horrible on this board without a U and a play at 6E is justgiving up big overlaps for her while holding terribly. I decided to hold the D becaus I had a lower chance of doubling it up compared to the N, it scores more (big on this board), and I didn't hold both because I wanted another tile turned over. 

Sim agrees with both ideas- exchanging and holding the D. 
>Robin_Lewis: FG K10 F.G +15 299
>Matt_Canik: ADDFIOR N6 IF +20 278
#note Maybe I should be trying to turn over more tiles to get the blank to bingo. Is it too soon to assume I need to bingo or Q-stick to win?
>Robin_Lewis: EHNORT 12C THRONE +23 322
#note Eep.
>Matt_Canik: ABDOORR 6C BROOD +21 299
#note I need to stop her from scoring points and ADOBO/DOBRO don't do that at all, so I chose to play BROOD instead. 
>Robin_Lewis: EENY 10F EYEN +14 336
>Matt_Canik: ADDIINU E11 D.UID +14 313
#note I have no idea how to handle this. I've got exactly three paths to winning now: Bingoing, Q-sticking Robin, or drawing and playing the Q for 50+. I think if I do pull a Q play it will likely not score enough anyway and it will get blocked often, so I don't want to play that way. I guess I'll just play this and hope to pull the blank and bingo. 
>Robin_Lewis: EEEGQTT D5 G.EET +7 343
#note Blocking my bingos and allowing for many Q plays. Nice play by Robin. 
>Matt_Canik: ?AILNRS F5 N.. +6 319
#note I spent a ton of time and didn't have an "A" option, so finallyI threw this down with 9 seconds left on my block.
