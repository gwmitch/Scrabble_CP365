>Josh: EEILOST H3 ETOILES +66 66
#note well that's twice in a row I draw a seven first turn.
>Bernard: ATX I1 TAX +35 35
>Josh: ILNOPRW J1 OW +28 94
#note Not sure about this play but it would be hard for Bernard to find a 3x3 most of the time. I don't think I should have given him the possibility though. 
>Bernard: ?ADEELR 5E REL.ADEd +82 117
#note Exactly what I was saying. Bernard might have seen RE(TO)tALED for 140. Gosh. 
>Josh: IILNPRT 8A TRIPLIN. +89 183
#note 3C TRIPL(EX) or 1E PINI(TO)L are better plays than this against someone who would challenge this common phony. 
>Bernard: ILN G1 NIL +15 132
>Josh: ACDEHNO B3 ANCHO.ED +76 259
#note ridiculous
>Bernard: NW C7 W.N +23 155
>Josh: AEEEFIV 6E EF +28 287

>Josh: AEEEIPV F2 PI +31 318
#note D2 VEEP is nice
>Bernard: EINOSST K5 .SSONITE +66 261
>Josh: AABEEMV J8 BEMA +32 350
#note AMEBA is a word. I missed it. 
>Bernard: EKU C1 KUE +24 285

>Bernard: ?ADEFST 13H FEASTeD +81 366
>Josh: EGQRRYZ H11 RE.RY +36 431
#note Probably (F)EZ which I considered. Both are good plays. 
>Bernard: ACOR 4L ORCA +16 382
>Josh: GQRUVYZ O2 GR.VY +12 443
#note Awful move here. I missed QU(I)Z of all things. I also chickened out of GU(R)RY. Maybe I'll see QU(I)Z next turn. Even Z(I)G is better than this I would say. 
>Bernard: DO 9M DO +12 394
#note very good move by Bernard.
>Josh: BGOQUUZ M6 QU.. +15 458
#note Juggled between this and (A)ZO. Thought he could Q stick me more often than Z stick me with something liks (S)AG at 6K.
>Bernard: AGIOTU A10 AGOUTI +27 421
>Josh: BGHIOUZ J13 .ZO +32 490
#note -4 to 12M BIZ. missed that too. blehblehbleh
>Bernard: A 1C .A +7 428
>Bernard:  (BUIGH) +22 450
#note At least this meant giving Bernard highest loss.
