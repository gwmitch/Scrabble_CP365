>Morris_Greenberg: AACDFMO 8G FADO +16 16
>Kristiina_Overton: EHO 9H HOE +18 18
>Morris_Greenberg: ACEMOUY 10E YUCA +17 33
#note EAU 7G is really nice defensively, I missed that and 10E CYMAE.
>Kristiina_Overton: AFN 11D FAN +24 42
>Morris_Greenberg: BEIMORU D11 .UB +16 49
#note Forgot UMBER and OMBER were things. Those are a bit better.
>Kristiina_Overton: ILOPU 13B UP.OIL +22 64
>Morris_Greenberg: EIMORTZ -  +0 49
#note UPBOIL looked funny to me, and she could play an A or O so I could get AMORTIZE/ATOMIZER or MOTORIZE.
>Kristiina_Overton: IIIII -IIIII +0 64
>Morris_Greenberg: EIMORTZ 14B MI +20 69
#note I completely forgot about the HOER hook this turn. RITZ K9 is definitely better than this.
>Kristiina_Overton: ACENOS 15C CANOES +34 98
>Morris_Greenberg: EGMORTZ 9C GORM +20 89
#note Interestingly, GERM is simming higher than GORM. I considered both heavily, but the only differences in the bag for plays that go to the triple are a G could be the fourth tile here, while a P could be the fourth tile with GERM. I completely forgot to consider HAJ/RAJ/TAJ here though, so that analysis is flawed.
>Kristiina_Overton: DEKR K9 DREK +26 124
>Morris_Greenberg: DDEEITZ L10 EDITED +37 126
#note DITZ L11 is too risky here with a Y still out.
>Kristiina_Overton: HLP 14K H.LP +18 142
>Morris_Greenberg: AIJNRTZ 8B RAJ +38 164
#note Benefitting from my earlier mistake.
>Kristiina_Overton: EIL 15L .IEL +21 163
>Morris_Greenberg: EINNTUZ I7 U..N +16 180
#note I was pretty sure this was phony when I played it, but everything else either barely scored, or gave a lot back, and I was playing abnormally few phonies for me so I had to inject some phony-age into the board since I ran out of phony-insulin the previous day.
>Kristiina_Overton: AQT 7A QAT +20 183
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EEINTZ B5 IZ.. +33 213
>Kristiina_Overton: AILRV A1 VIRAL +29 212
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EENOOT M4 bOTONEE +61 274
#note I thought (R)OTENOnE (or (R)OTEnONE for that matter) gave up so much more than bOTONEE that the extra 5 or 3 points respectively were not worth it. The 66 pointer and this are neck and neck in the Quackle sim, both a bit above 79% to win.
>Kristiina_Overton: BGIS C2 BIGS +17 229
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ANNSTV L3 VAN +16 290
#note I am at 94.5% here to win, the board is now pretty shut.
>Kristiina_Overton: ASW J12 SAW +42 271
#note oof, missed that.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ENSTTT 12J ...TE +9 299
#note No play wins 100% here, this is awfully close. Quackle slightly prefers 5J TE(NO)N and 7L T(O)T to this.
>Kristiina_Overton: IX 8M .IX +30 301
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ENSTTW N2 WEST +19 318
#note This always wins. Another fun win is WiST in the same spot which threatens the T front hook.
>Kristiina_Overton: EGIORRY O10 YORE +19 320
#note With about 2 and a half minutes left on my clock I recounted the entire game as fast as I could, after incorrectly changing YUCA to 16 points, I found no other "mistakes", so I let this stay since I still had the win (and would lose if I challenged and it were good).
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ENT 4C .ENTs +10 328
#note NoTE D3. I had under a minute from holding the previous play and recounting the scores, so I slapped this down quickly. Finished with 38 seconds, so I'm happy that I was able to recount so quickly if I need to ever do that again.
>Morris_Greenberg:  (GIR) +8 336
