>Josh: ABENRST H4 BANTERS +74 74
#note 14 game tourney, I should have a bingo first turn twice. This is the first against a player I kind of don't need to get lucky to beat up on :(
>Judy: AA -AA +0 0
>Josh: AEOPRST I2 PROTEAS +74 148
#note This is a rack I guess I still have difficulty with. PROTEAS is all I saw and I thought it was the only one cause of SPORATE*, which I kept guessing in the quiz I studied this on. I need to remember ESPARTO and SEAPORT. I saw PROTEAS(E) but I thought I was making it up. I need to study 8s and go through high probs again :(. This is a probably a better play than PROTEASE against Judy though. Still I can't miss these things.

I'm not used to getting this lucky. 
>Judy: IR -  +0 0
#note Judy challenged
>Josh: AEEOUVY 9C VOYEU. +17 165
#note I missed 2I (P)EAVEY and obviously OEUV(R)E at 9D. I also considered G8 YOU but I missed G5 VAU. All of those seem like better plays than VOYEU(R) except YOU. 
>Judy: IR 10H .IR +5 5
>Josh: ?ACEHQS 5G Q.. +12 177
#note Well then, I missed some ridiculous 9 here. CHAQUETA is not a word in my vocabulary. If I knew it and saw it I would be ahead 242-5 on a really really tight board.
>Judy: AGNT E5 TANG. +18 23
>Josh: ?ACEGHS K5 CHAnGES +102 279
#note I'm at 99.97% to win after this play. This is ridiculous
>Judy: DEEY 8K .EEDY +27 50
>Josh: AHIIIIO -IIIIO +0 279
#note I should play through this with N6 OI(D)IA I guess.
>Judy: CEKOT 2I .OCKET +32 82
>Josh: ADEHMNO F6 HO +28 307
>Judy: AIIX 3L IXIA +48 130
>Josh: ADDEMNU D4 MUD +21 328
#note How dare I miss ADDENDUM? I looked for like 4 minutes. Aarrghh!
>Judy: BEILNR M7 B.RLINE +26 156
>Josh: AADEINR L12 AD +13 341
#note No idea here. I should probably just go for points with RA(V)INED.
>Judy: EZ N6 ZE. +37 193
>Josh: AEFILNR L2 ..F +20 361
#note N11 FILA looks good cause I have one of the case R's and she might try to pluralize.
>Judy: III -III +0 193
>Josh: AEILNRS C7 RA.ELINS +74 435
#note Yes, that's an S I just drew
>Judy: ?AEILNO B2 aEOLIAN +70 263
#note ELAtION looks a tad better
>Josh: FIJOPTT 4A J. +17 452
#note I took forever cause there was only one A left. I wanted to try and block ANA but couldn't really seem to to it well. Another turn where I was clueless. D12 TOIT is champ's choice but I don't know why besides it blocking all of the good 8 lanes. 
>Judy: DELMOUV 14F VOLUMED +82 345
#note I held this
>Josh: FIOPRTT 10B F. +13 465
#note Just 15G FIT I guess even though one-in-the bag scenarios induce more errors than endgames and this might block scoring plays
>Judy: AWW A7 WAW +42 387
#note but WAW was obvious from the start
>Josh: IIOPRTT 15G RIP +27 492
#note I was running out of time. This is 13 off of 15G ROTI. Bleh
>Judy: GINOU B13 ION +12 399
#note right play
>Josh: IOTT D11 IT +10 502
#note -2
>Judy: GU F12 GU. +7 406
>Judy:  (OT) +4 410
#note Really unhappy about this game. I got way too lucky yet still only won by 92
