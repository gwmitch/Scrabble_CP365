#note LUREX then WOO would have been much smarter than playing them the opposite way as I did.  LUREX is pretty defensive in its own right except for crosswords with the H, M, or P...

#note Really missed the boat on this one.  I just don't like playing less than 20 points and leaving rather ugly leaves, but looking at this now, I see that GNOR is in its own right a rather ugly leave...  I'd possibly be better off if I just kept the R...  Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration.  Big whiff here.  I think one of the major reasons is that I didn't want to open anything, but with the tiles she had, she would have anyway...

#note Wow, ORC is BEAUTIFUL...  Need to hope for some vowels now...  Well, I would have no matter what I played here.

>Sean_Wrona: CHIMNRS M7 HIM +24 179
#note Did I actually think this was defensive?  Playing HM in the same spot might have been a LITTLE defensive, since it doesn't allow so many letters on either side for column L or column N bingos - just column N bingos, where I could get a high-scoring snap back in response.  But I just guess I didn't see the infinitely superior HM which opens nothing new, scores more, and keeps a vowel.

#note I'm happy I thought of this anyway!  It also takes out a bingo line!

#note I didn't like it, but I was trying to learn to make challenges in costly positions (something I have been doing WAY too often online against Siddharth Murali in recent months), especially after stupidly and ridiculously challenging CONY against her boyfriend earlier in the tournament.
