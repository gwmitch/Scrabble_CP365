#note I didn't know either bingo (and had I she probably wouldn't have controlled the game), but this is a pretty good bet especially considering EPACT, but she could easily play that herself...

#note PETIOLATE, wow.  It never occurred to me how dangerous that placement of ETIOLATE might be...

>Sean_Wrona: AEIILPU -IIU +0 209
#note This doesn't sim well, but I still like it more than most of the recommended plays.  Sure I agree PIU/PETIOLATE is the best, but how many 1500s know that?  I really don't like what DUI and TUI do to the board leaving a worse leave for only a few points.  TUI with no S is dreadful.  DUI blocking the S and potential triple bingos also seems dreadful to me, and neither of those plays score anything and I'd guess AEILP is worse than AELP but I don't know that for a fact.  By exchanging I'm not giving up any powerful lines or blocking the lines I myself would need to bingo, so I'd still stand a rather good shot of bingoing through the E, T, I, or S keeping AELP.  Keeping AEILP seems much less versatile.  I still like this.

#note Oh yeah, I know DHURRIES is good but I wouldn't even think of it...  I still think I need to bingo more than anything and then get lucky with high-scoring tiles after that, and with all the esses and blanks out, I almost need to do this, not thinking of DHURRIES.

>Sean_Wrona: BCGMN C11 B.NG +21 469
#note For quite some time, I was looking to see if there I could keep her from going out.  I saw FEU and MU and I was wondering if she might miss one of them if I blocked the other.  I ultimately decided she wouldn't miss either play (especially because I spent minutes weighing this) and just played to minimize spread...
