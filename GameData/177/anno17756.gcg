>Josh: AEIIRWX H4 WAXIER +40 40
#note Matthew is ahead 2 games and almost 800 spread points. If I don't beat him by more than 150 this game he will be Gibsonized. 
>Matthew: CEKO G3 COKE +33 33
>Josh: ABDHIII F6 HI +34 74
#note this or HID? I didn't think it was that likely he would have a 6-letter word at 8A. I think I needed to take the risk to ensure that my rack doesn't end up costing me a turn because of the need to exchange.
>Matthew: DELNOOU 8A NOODLE +33 66
#note He saw LOUDEN after he played. Still not great that he had a 6.
>Josh: ABDDIIQ 9G B.AID +12 86
#note This move really baffled me. I played this to set up QI in two spots and also hopefully draw a U. I felt like dropping the Q this turn for 14 with a bad leave wasn't worth it. I didn't however spot 9E ID, which sets up one spot for QAID. I also considered I that D5 QAI(D) gave me around 30 points next turn most of the time with BI/QI or something. Didn't seem worth it either. C8 (O)BI will usually not work although it may be worth it? In the situation I was in I probably should have exchanged. I would like to know what others think about this position, even though callouts in annotated games never seem to garner discussion.
>Matthew: BEY 7B BYE +28 94
>Josh: ?DGINQT 10F QI +35 121
#note A lucrative draw.
>Matthew: EEMNRTU J6 MUT.NEER +68 162
#note but crap
>Josh: ?ADGGNT 12D uNTAGG.D +74 195
>Matthew: ?HIMSSS 14J SHIMS +37 199
#note Moderate blunder number 1 by Matthew where he saw SCHISM as a possible 6 with his rack but missed his SCHISMS.
>Josh: AADERRT A8 .ARRATED +80 275
#note I can do this!
>Matthew: ?EGPRST L3 PaRGETS +79 278
#note no...... don't do this to me.......
>Josh: AEJLNUZ 3J JU.E +26 301
#note H12 (G)AZE? I missed that? M10 UNJA(M) is probably the best play though. I played JU(P)E cause I felt like I needed the case S to win by enough and so setting it up was step 1. 
>Matthew: AFF H12 .AFF +33 311
#note 

>Josh: AEILNUZ M10 NIZA. +32 333
#note N10 ZEIN(S) looks decent here but I won't really bingo next turn with that enough to win by enough. LAZI(ED) D3 gives me good chances only if Matthew doesn't block N14, which I felt he probably would if he could. I think that this is my best play, but it's up for debate and is also in relation to me needing to win by a lot.
>Matthew: IPSTWY N1 WISTY +36 347
>Matthew: IPSTWY --  -36 311
#note I drew into VACUOLE. If Matthew has the case S I'm in trouble. 

In Matthew's head, he was ready to play N1 WISPY, then saw that he could score a lot by pluralizing NIZAM too, so was debating the two, and then he finally decided to play WISPY. The catch? He played this mistakenly.

I'm holding his play, and I'm thinking "What is this? This can't be good. But if it is, I lose! OK, let me just wait til' he draws his courtesy tiles and make sure WISTIER* is in fact phony. OK, he's drawn them. *Gulp* Challenge." Matthew: "shit, it's no good".
>Josh: ACELOUV N4 VACUOLE +74 407
#note OK, I got a really lucky break. But he's scoring at least 40, I'm still not in a good position to win by enough...
>Matthew: IPSTWY O8 PITY +44 355
>Josh: AEILLOO N12 AL.O +17 424
#note Yeah, I can't win by enough. 

There are 5 in the bag, but I can't for the life of me find a play that uses 5 of them. So I'm paranoid that there's some sort of fish that Matthew can do that will win some of the time. But he still has his S, so I figure I should interfere with his best scoring plays. That's why I play this. And anyhow, 2 in the bag is usually a good idea. Champ likes A(N)OLE at E11 for 10. I considered B6 OBOLE but saw Matthew could have something that scores a lot at A1, so I didn't want that. 
>Matthew: U 6J .U. +6 361
#note Crud, what is he fishing for? He blocked my best play too, he's just too darn good...
>Josh: EIILOOT 3C OLEI. +14 438
#note He was going for IRONWE(ED)S it seemed. I got paranoid and figured I had to block the ED even though I saw nothing. But in that case I should play OOLITI(C).
>Matthew: ENORSVW 15M S.W +35 396
#note 2A VOWERS beats this play by 13 points. Not that it mattered.
>Josh: INOT B12 TIN +14 452
#note I didn't have any time left and wasn't sure of my tracking anymore so I didn't see his next play. so -7
>Matthew: ENORV D1 VO.E +22 418
>Josh: O J3 .O +9 461
>Josh:  (NR) +4 465
#note Well, this game I ended his undefeated streak against me live and stopped him from hitting 2000 at the same time. Oh, and I put myself over 1800! This was an important milestone for me. Too bad it's because Matthew made an unenforced error (unless you count being nervous as my fault). Maybe I can still win if Matthew gets beaten by 350 at the same time as I beat my next opponent by that much! Heh...
