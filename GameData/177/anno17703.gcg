#note That's right, with two pair of playable bingos (which could all be blocked in one fell swoop) I challenged CONY.  I thought he was Collins confused or something.  I remembered CONEY, but CONY just didn't stick, especially because I obviously knew CONIEST* was no good.  Words like this are the hardest to retain because they're so easy to anagram on Zyzzyva...

#note And my ridiculous challenge gave him a free chance to fix his rack, whereas if I had bingoed I might have easily built momentum...

#note Without knowing what he had, I wanted to open up the most possible lines for myself...

#note Second disconnected 9 played against me in the same day!  And I still have yet to play one in thousands of ISC games...

#note This is not preferred, but I couldn't bring myself to play any of the preferred plays over a board, since almost all of them score 10 points at most more, keep the Q, and dump the A on a closed board...  Maybe the logic is that whether I keep the Q or keep the V, I'm probably going to have to exchange regardless, so I should simply go for points?

#note This was Collins confusion, but it would sound just as weird to me in a Collins game and I'd challenge it regardless.

#note I had vaguely seen EVENSONG before (enough to know it was valid, but not enough to think of it as a possibility over the board, so I didn't think to block it.)

#note I don't remember *why* I chose this over TRITONES.  I hope it wasn't just random.  It appears to be right, but I'm not sure I understand why.  Maybe just because of fives ending in h?

#note The second time I've had an unplayable DIGERATI in this tournament!  This is an instance where I should follow the Carl Johnson rule: 'Never fish for a bingo when you need more than a bingo to win'.  Unfortunately, the problem with that for me is that I so rarely actually *see* my highest-scoring plays...  Especially when they're like 20 point fives...  If I draw an E, it's possible this *could* work as a gambit to force him to play in the other place so I could bingo on column D, but since he held the other one, and since he'd still win if I bingoed again, he had little to worry about anyway.

#note I probably lost by less than I actually should have, so I'll take it.  I just need to *stop challenging plays that aren't worth it*...
