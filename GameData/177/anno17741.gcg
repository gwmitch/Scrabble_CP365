>Morris_Greenberg: EHIOSTV 8G HOVE +20 20
#note Installment 1 of Morris' mediocre return to Scrabble (a.k.a Montreal tournament 2014).

It is probably a bit smarter to play HOVE at 8E, since the only hook I have for it is the front S hook, and neither of the L or R for the double double.

>Seth_Lipkin: GRUU 7B GURU +12 110
>Morris_Greenberg: AISSTUZ L4 ZAS +38 155
#note This and ZA 4F are neck and neck. I prefer this, especially since it is hard to bingo in lane L with ISSTU as a leave.

>Seth_Lipkin: EO 1H OE +23 164
#note Lucky break.
>Morris_Greenberg: EEGIPRT 11E PETER..G +22 260
#note I was choosing between this and (T)EG N2, they both score the same, it is a question of whether I want to groom my rack for a bingo, or burn more tiles to get to the blank quicklier and shut down the board more. The duck prefers TEG by a bit less than 3.5% (91.1 vs. 87.9), but I am fine with this. Two other plays to consider is GIE 9F or GIE 9E, which block and groom the rack, but don't score as much.
>Seth_Lipkin: OX N5 OX +30 194
>Morris_Greenberg: ACIKOPY O6 ICKY +48 308
#note I considered just playing ICK to not give a bingo lane, but 12 points is a lot to give up. Sim likes ICKY 2nd most and ICK 3rd, but COPAY 10D takes the cake.

>Morris_Greenberg: EEMORUV N9 OVUM +22 460
#note The star play is ME(N)U M12, which blocks all of his J plays very nicely. This is the 3rd best endgame according to Quackle, after MENU and N9 OVER. In my sloppiness, I missed that OVUM gave up TAJ over it.
