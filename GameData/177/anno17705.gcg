#note I simply forgot whether PILI took an S or not, but I should have figured it had to if he was willing to make that kind of setup...  I have no idea how I missed ORDAINS/OW though...

#note Urp!  Why didn't I exchange here?  Probably because I assumed that his racks were better than they were from his setups and felt I needed to block...  That horrific leave plus my being unsure of PILIS allowed him to close the spread considerably despite not bingoing...

#note I must have been trying to block SKA bingos, not that there was any chance that he was going to bingo with what was left...  I'd have been better off blocking the PILI scoring spot...
