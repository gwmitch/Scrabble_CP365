>Chris: ?HLNSUV -HLUV +0 0
#note No idea why I didn't play LUV here. I only thought of SHULN and exchanging. I should keep HS? instead of NS? too...
>Emanuel: AEIRZ H4 ZAIRE +48 48

>Emanuel: CFHI M3 FI.CH +34 82
>Chris: ADEEGRV J4 E.GRAVED +69 135
#note (o)VERAGED K5 is 74
>Emanuel: AO F4 A.O +6 88
>Chris: EGRV 10F VERG. +17 152
#note Can't remember my last 3 tiles but i'm pretty sure they were all consonants. I wanted to block as much as possible after his fish as well as get rid of GV.
>Emanuel: ESX K10 SEX +36 124
>Chris: AEMNOPW L2 MOP. +29 181
#note I was pretty tilted that I couldn't use the SEX spot at all. Didn't like WOPS in case he kept another S with SEX since he played it pretty fast, but there's only 1 S left and SEX scored enough that he might burn his S to play it. I missed POEMS L1 though, which looks like the best play. 
>Emanuel: ACEINNR 8A NARCEIN. +89 213
#note So he didn't keep an S after all. Was wishing i'd have played WOPS after this play.
>Chris: AAEENSW I2 AWE. +23 204
>Emanuel: EILU L11 LIEU +30 243
#note He gets 30 for EILU but now my case S just got a lot more valuable
>Chris: AEKNNST 13K T.AK +27 231
#note Thought of TEAK and TANKS H15. Didn't think of the super-aggressive (PI)NK for 15 at L4, which is winning the sim by 3 %. I liked that TEAK pretty much locked in that the LIEUS hook would stay open longish term, and I was hoping to eventually win the game with that spot. 
>Emanuel: BDLOO 3B BLOOD +22 265
>Chris: DENNRST O8 TRENDS +36 267
#note This and all the fishing plays sim really close. I hated giving up my S for a non-bingo but I also didn't think he had the blank with BLOOD and I wanted to play 6 rather than 2 to go for it.
>Emanuel: DEJY D2 J.YED +32 297
#note Overscored by 2
>Chris: AELNOOU N10 NOO. +19 286
#note Thought of ABOON B2, NOOK N10, and OAKEN N11. OAKEN scores 4 more than this and i don't have the S anymore and if he does block LIEUS it'll only be like 12 points, so i think I shouldve played it. Didnt like ABOON because it blocks bingo lanes to the left and I might need to bingo to come back here. 
>Emanuel: IQU B6 QU.I +33 330
>Chris: AEILOUY J1 OY +26 312
#note Thought of YOU J14 and OY. Missed the sick (A)LIYO(T) hooking FITCHY for 27, which is the only reasonable play that digs for the blank. I didn't like YOU because it gives easy playback on the triple and facilitates lower volatility, which isgood for him. The sim has YOU and ALIYOT at the top and this 2% down (at 9% lol), but I still like OY better than YO(U) at least
>Emanuel: PU H1 UP +20 350
>Chris: ?AEILTU 7L U. +5 317
#note Looked for a while for bingoes down from the C or N, then decided to pure fish for 5 points. I knew this was dangerous since this could lead to me being outscored even if I do bingo, but the scoring spots aren't that good on this board, and if i bingo with LIEUS i won't give much back and should be able to still win? I didn't want to make a play like LEU/QUAIL since then he could make a cheap block of LEUS and I have no recourse other than to try to outscore myself. I can bingo with 13/16 draws but only like 8/16 with the LIEUS hook. The sim likes UTA N2 for 17.
>Emanuel: EI N10 ....IE +20 370
#note This is a cool play, since it scores decently and prepares to block the LIEUS hook on the next turn. 
>Chris: ?AAEILT D8 .ALAmITE +70 387
#note Now with the threat of LIEUS being blocked next turn and me not hitting my coinflip to get a bingo there, I'm forced to bingo here and give a bunch of playback. This and CALIfATE are the only bingos. I remembered this super fast since Sid missed it in Albany famously lolz.
>Emanuel: AFIIMOW 15A WIF. +30 400
#note Emanuel found a cool out-in-2 sequence and i couldn't do anything about it since i drew BHNRTT after CALAMITE. 
>Chris: BHNRTT 13C B.RTH +28 415
#note At least he didn't block this hehe
>Emanuel: AIMO 14H MIAO. +21 421
#note I was low on time and tracked only somewhat near the end so I thought I might win when I saw he had WFMII but he found the win. I made a bunch of mistakes but this was one of the funnest games of the tourney for me anyway. I felt like I was playing Phil Laak in poker because of Emanuel's attire: sunglasses, hoodie, and basketball jersey, which was pretty awesome lol.
>Emanuel:  (NT) +4 425
