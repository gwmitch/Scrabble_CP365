#note That FERIA hook is still there and I'm going through E's like a madman.

#note Phony. It looked funny as I put it down but that happens a lot with real words so I didn't worry about it. Not even better than 12A HOVER.

#note #1 rule of scrabble: score points. This scores 1 more point than E2 ONO and is thus better. Right?

#note Bad draw. If he plays perfectly I can't win. Over the board I though this did it.
>Mason_Shambach: AAIMTZ H4 MATZ. +19 342
#note He spent a while here, going almost all the way down on his clock. He first put down N11 ATMA which forces me to find 11L PLAY. N11 MATZA looks good and scores a ton but loses to the reploy of 15M BAP. This play doesn't really win in any case. The winning play is I11 NIZAM, which allows for a 20 point out, more if I try to block.
