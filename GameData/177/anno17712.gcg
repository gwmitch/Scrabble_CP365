#note Spent ~3 minutes here, finally decided on this, and noticed sOM(E)DEAL for 90 like a second after hitting the clock. Balls.

#note WARM M10 is obviously best. Ugh, I never see MM.

#note This turn drove me nuts. I didn't want to play YUCA incase she had an S, but I figured the odds of me getting burned *too* badly were not high at all, and I held the M for the O12 spot so I could score quite well. Maybe I should just play MA or MU at O14 and hold the Y for JOY if she overlaps the J.

#note I've got to exchange here. My plays at 6E give up big easy counters and hold so poorly. I hold just the D for more chances at the blank than ND and kept D over N because it scores more and there's only one unseen D vs 2 usneen Ns. Sim agrees with the decision. 
>Robin_Lewis: FG K10 F.G +15 299
>Matt_Canik: ADDFIOR N6 IF +20 278
#note Do I need to be opening here? Playing more tiles to try for the blank or an E?
>Robin_Lewis: EHNORT 12C THRONE +23 322
>Matt_Canik: ABDOORR 6C BROOD +21 299
#note I need to minimize her counterplays while turning over tiles and opening the board. She didn't have the blank last turn, so it's likely still in the bag for me to pull.

>Matt_Canik: ADDIINU E11 D.UID +14 313
#note 3 ways for me to win the game here:
1. Bingo
2. Stick her with the Q
3. Bomb the Q for 50 or more. 

3 seems unlikely, 2 is gonna be hard with QATI? unseen, so 1 looks like my best bet. Let's go.
>Robin_Lewis: EEEGQTT D5 G.EET +7 343
#note A nice play by Robin to block my bingos and allow draws to get out of this Q-mess she's in. This was her actual rack. 
>Matt_Canik: ?AILNRS F5 N.. +6 319
#note No wins here. Spent forever looking for an elaborate setup or crazy block but just couldn't see one. Ran down to 9 seconds and just plopped this down.
