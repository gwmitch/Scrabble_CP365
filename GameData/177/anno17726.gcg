>Josh: AELLOOS H8 OLEO +8 8
#note Prepare yourself for my best-played game of the tournament. May I remind you that this is the first game of the day, and my reputation for this particular game is easily determined by my annotateds. I considered the equity of -AELS but was overcome by the far superior control of OLEO. If I play LOO, where do I play it? H7? H6? H8? Each of the 4 options simulate within one point of each other. Very interesting position where it wasn't right to spend too much time on. 

I saw the only 8 with this rack.

>Josh: EGNSSTY M3 GEYS +28 72
>Josh: EGNSSTY --  -28 44
#note This is a great play in terms of defense.

What? What's wrong with it?
>Seth_Lipkin: ?AEIILR L6 .LAIRIEr +68 108
>Josh: EGNSSTY 14G GEY +25 69
#note This gives too much back, I should play STY here.
>Seth_Lipkin: ABORR 15D ARBOR +33 141
>Josh: NRSSSTW 8L .WNS +21 90
>Seth_Lipkin: AOTX N4 TAXO. +28 169
>Josh: IOQRSST 11K Q. +22 112
#note Considered Q(I)S too, but that would probably influence Seth's play to give me less options next turn so I didn't want to give him too much rack info. 
>Seth_Lipkin: DEFGO O1 DEFOG +39 208
>Josh: DIORSST O8 .ORDISTS +80 192
>Josh: DIORSST --  -80 112
#note I get so frustrated in situations like this that I just give up
>Seth_Lipkin: IPW 2L WIP. +18 226
>Josh: DIORSST 3K DOS +17 129
#note this over SOD because it's easier to bingo on lane 4 after but that's fallacious since it makes it much easier for Seth to score on lane 4 too
>Seth_Lipkin: ACDTU 1H DUCAT +34 260
>Josh: EIILRST D8 LISTERI. +68 197
#note Hey, I played a valid word!
>Seth_Lipkin: FHI 10B FI.H +18 278
#note I still have a chance of winning this game after a move like FI(S)H, which makes no sense. I should have just had to forfeit after playing a phony 4.
>Josh: AEEPRTU 13B UP.ATE +23 220
#note I almost played EPURATE* because I knew I was going to be doubting myself way too much the rest of this game. 11A PAT(T)EE is a word I didn't know but it scores pretty well, maybe I should play it. 9C P(I)U is a good play. I didn't consider closing a lane. 
>Seth_Lipkin: BNNU G5 BUNN +9 287
#note I was drawing much better than Seth
>Josh: AEEIORV 8A VOI.E +24 244
>Seth_Lipkin: EOV 10L .OVE +15 302
>Josh: AAEKMRY F9 KYE +40 284
#note This opened up the opportunity of outscoring so I played it.
>Seth_Lipkin: MN 6F M.N +11 313
>Josh: AAAEMRR 5D RAM.A +26 310
>Josh: AAAEMRR --  -26 284
#note Well forget about that. I played this knowing it was probably phony, but that if Seth challenged unsuccessfully, I would win. So I don't think he can risk losing a turn. So why not take it?
>Seth_Lipkin: ?CEHNNT O10 .TCHEd +39 352
>Josh: AAAEMRR F1 MARRA. +16 300
#note I just wanted to play one of my favorite words and hope he would challenge again since he was quite trigger-happy this game.
