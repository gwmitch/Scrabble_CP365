>Morris_Greenberg: ADEHIOO 8D HOODIE +28 28
>Jason_Li: AIIIIIZ -IIIII +0 0
#note He told me afterwards he kept ZA.
>Morris_Greenberg: AILMNST I7 M.LANIST +65 93
#note MANLI(E)ST is a bit better here defensively, since it doesn't take the S hook. To better understand why this is worse...
>Jason_Li: AEINSTZ 15D ZANIEST +139 139
#note ...see this.
>Morris_Greenberg: ABEFGJU 10F JUG. +28 121
#note The duck slightly prefers putting the A in front, this is second best.
>Jason_Li: DDEIV 12H D.VIDE +26 165
>Morris_Greenberg: ABEFGWX E5 BEF.G +22 143
#note Much better than playing the X here.
>Jason_Li: IQ 11K QI +47 212

>Jason_Li: AEILSTT 7H S.ALTITE +63 275

#note I did not recognize it. Back to studying.

>Morris_Greenberg: ?AANNOR N12 ROAN +20 221
>Jason_Li: EHRRY O13 RYE +31 336
#note Jason said afterwards that I blocked HERRY for 50.
>Morris_Greenberg: ??AINSV L1 VArmIN.S +78 299
#note If it's any consolation for my first bingo misplacement, Quackle likes this most, even more than 4F (W)AVINesS for 82.
>Jason_Li: FHO D4 FOH +36 372
>Morris_Greenberg: CEKMRTU 6J KE.T +38 337
#note I thought KR(A)UT killed the board too much. At this point, I have to hope for a lot to go right. Since there are so many E's left, I like this more than KRAUT, they're the same points so it's a question of leave vs. openness.
>Jason_Li: ABDEORT 2G TEABO.RD +84 456
#note Well, that makes me feel good about my decision last turn.
>Morris_Greenberg: CEMRRUU 1D CURER +38 375
#note All plays are under 1% to win, but maybe just UM, RUM, or CUM at this triple spot, so I can maybe take an extra turn to shoot for the stars.
>Jason_Li: GOOP 11D GOOP +27 483
>Morris_Greenberg: EEMNNUY M12 .M +18 393
#note I knew ENNUYE and ENNUYEE, but didn't know they did not take an S. So, this fish is completely irrelevant.
>Jason_Li: CEOR 12C CORE +30 513
>Morris_Greenberg: EENNUWY 10L YEW +24 417
#note We both missed Jason's outplay of ULA(m)A here. WE 3I is the best play, blocking that.
>Jason_Li: AALU J9 AL +21 534
>Morris_Greenberg: ENNU 14I .UN +9 426
#note Again, not seeing A(m)U
>Jason_Li: AU 4K A.U +2 536
#note Overall, a small mistake could cause big repercussions. MELANIST instead of MANLIEST really changed the game from the get-go. Regardless, challenging SMALTITE also affected the outcome.
