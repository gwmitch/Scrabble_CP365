>Emanuel: DEHIMOR H4 HEIRDOM +84 84
#note Both of us need to win this to have a chance of stopping Matthew Tunnicliffe and making first place. 
>Josh: EEJLNOS G9 JOE +39 39
>Emanuel: AAARV G3 VARA +20 104
#note Emanuel at least had AAA here as he mentioned. He was frustrated that he had started strong with HEIRDOM and drew crap
>Josh: AELNSST 11B LATEN.SS +80 119
>Emanuel: AAGL 12A GALA +22 126
>Josh: AEEKPRU 13C PUKE +33 152
#note PERUKE! Didn't know it. I did however know the next cool option, EUREKA for 39, but not APEEK for 43. All of these plays are at 13C. This is probably the 5th best play. It makes the X extremely good.
>Emanuel: ORT 4D TOR.. +16 142
>Josh: AEEEGRX 14E AX +56 208
#note I drew the X, which is extremely lucky. I do have to be wary of the Z though, whose value increases incredibly after this play. But do I play AXE here? I think so, but I didn't want to open the board at all, I was comfortable with how it was. 
>Emanuel: BEGLRSZ 9G ..B +15 157
#note Very thoughtful play, as if he draws an A he's in business (only 3 left though) and if he draws an O too, since I'm probably going to be distracted by his setup. But possible he should just play Z(AI)RE 6F of BERGS 15A. I think the gamble may not be worth it although it will usually cost me equity. 
>Josh: DEEEGIR I5 ERE +13 221
#note The obvious play here is GRIDE/DIRGE/RIDGE at 15A, but I fell for his trap. I almost decided that he was probably doing something like what he was doing but I didn't feel like risking it.
>Emanuel: EGILRSZ 15A GIRLS +28 185
#note Z(AIR)E is still looking sharp, but he can play it next turn too. Not sure about this play, still.
>Josh: DEEGINO 5D OE +10 231
#note I still see G13 DEE/DE and deem them too risky. I don't however see 10E DO(OM)ING, which looks decent. Here I was just sealing every good lane available hoping he would open something up for my DINGE leave
>Emanuel: Q B14 Q. +22 207
>Josh: CDEGIIN 13C ....D +14 245
#note 6B CIG looks better. If I keep scoring poorly, leaving good scoring spots open, I'm in trouble.
>Emanuel: EPZ 6B ZEP +39 246
#note just like that he's back in the game now
>Josh: ?CEGIIN 14E ..ENIC +24 269
#note what a lucky draw.
>Emanuel: ANN 15G NAN +21 267
#note good play
>Josh: ?BGIOVW F6 VOW +32 301
>Emanuel: INTT 7H ..TINT +7 274
#note smart play
>Josh: ?ABGIOU M3 AGOU.I +14 315
#note Naturally I spent a lot of time on this turn looking for bingos. Here I wanted there to be many openings for bingos rather than one which would seal the game most likely. With my lead and my blank more lanes seems to be a good thing. I also saw this blocked the S hook RETINT created. I also considered GUA(N)O and BOI(N)G but blocking the S looked like a good idea. 
>Emanuel: DIIR 12I IRID +12 286
>Josh: ?BDHIMT 11K HIM +29 344
#note I considered this and HM at N5. I didn't consider MIB in the same spot, which seems like a good alternative. I felt like HM gave back too much to be worth it such as Emanuel having a much higher chance at FLOWS O1 or something. But yeah MIB's leave is much better 
>Emanuel: AFO 7A OAF +30 316
>Josh: ?BDITUY 4J BUD.Y +24 368
>Josh: ?BDITUY --  -24 344
#note I saw I had DUBEITY* here, but I would have spelled it wrong had it been playable. Instead I play a word I'm quite sure of and it's challenged off. Really bad.
>Emanuel: ?FS 8M .F +5 321
#note seemed right to assume I didn't have the blank. At least I did.
>Josh: ?BDITUY O8 sTUDY +51 395
>Emanuel: ?LNSTUY K2 SNoUT.LY +70 391
#note HOLD!
>Josh: BCEEEIO N12 BICE +23 418
#note At this point I was dumbfounded that I had screwed my tracking up as I had ample time to make sure everything was good. I didn't like SNOUTILY. I saw BICE and it looked like I couldn't lose no matter what he had drawn. I couldn't figure out what it was because of the enormous pressure I was feeling. The time trouble and people being loud in the background oblivious that others were bothered by their loudness (it was lunchtime after this game and this was one of the last games left in the room) really overwhelmed me here. I spent at least 5 minutes with my fingers inside my earholes here. Spread also mattered here so challenging successfully would have given me a better chance at dethroning Matthew in the next two rounds. I felt like the win was most important though, and I wasn't sure of SNOUTILY* being phony. Ugh.
