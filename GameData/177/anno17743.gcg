>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEGKLU 8D KLUDGE +34 34
>Morris_Greenberg: AEFORSY D4 FREA.Y +32 32
#note Ah, I didn't know KLUDGEY, this is the best play not using that hook, but it's a bit less than 7% behind FOY J6.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AEEGOR C9 AEROGEl +72 106
>Morris_Greenberg: EFIOPQS J6 QIS +45 77
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEETU 15A TE.EDU +21 127
#note TELEDU plays for 3 more E6! I still may have played this one if I were Matthew for defense, but it's very close.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEFOPPX 14E OX +53 130
#note Sim slightly prefers EXPO in the same spot, but it seemed a bit too risky in my opinion for the extra 4 points and not having the double P's.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DDINU K3 UNDID +28 155
>Morris_Greenberg: AEFOPRT B10 FAT +31 161
#note Didn't know FO(R)EPART. It is probably a bit better to keep the T here too and just play FA. F(ID) 7I also is probably a bit better.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ILV I7 V.IL +23 178
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EMOOPP C3 POOP +27 188
#note Ooh, POPE(D)OMs, cool word I completely missed. However, this, POPEDOMS and a bunch of L1 plays (like POME, MOPE, POPE, PEPO) are pretty much all even. POMO L1 beats all of those plays by around 5%!
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BE E5 BE +23 201
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AEEMTW L1 WAME +34 222
#note This seems best, though EW(E) 14A is not too far behind. 
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IO M1 OI +9 210
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AEEHNT L7 EArTHEN +78 300
#note I was about to pull the trigger on ETHANEs N1, but then I second guessed myself. Rustiness at it's finest. NEATH N2 is also worth considering, and sims 3rd after my play and ETHANEs.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABERRSS F2 BRASSE.R +82 292
#note Note to self: don't let Tunnicliffe keep phonying you! You are up 90 points and that word looks ridiculous for ignorant American scrabble. He probably played it quickly because he thought that it would fool me, not because he was so confident that he could save about 5 seconds to make sure no other real play was an option. This increases his winning percentage to 23ish, with other plays all below 10.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEITTUV 13I VAU.TIE +28 328
#note I mistracked here and thought there were 3 A's left, so I was nervous about VAU(N)T (to make AVAUNT). Regardless, this is riskier, and is worse. Sim also prefers (WO)VE 1L, which scores and is safer defensively, though has a worse leave.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: INZ O12 Z.IN +69 361
#note Ouch.
>Morris_Greenberg: GIJSTTY 1L ..TT +21 349
>Morris_Greenberg: GIJSTTY --  -21 328
#note JIT(NE)Y 4H is a beautiful play I did not see. I was choosing between this and T(A)J J12, but decided that I had to block this area of the board. 

Sadly, I don't know words, or at least sometimes think I know words that are just strings of letters with no significance to a Scrabble player. Another play I considered which sims higher than JITNEY (but not TAJ or this WOTT if it stays) is just WOT to set up the S and close the high scores for Matthew.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: MR 1L ..RM +27 388
>Morris_Greenberg: GIJSTTY 11A T..TY +16 344
#note With all of the O's out, I see that I can likely play JO B2 next turn to set up another bingo lane. I will likely draw an N either after this or after JO to have INGS and 3 other tiles. Sim still likes T(A)J best, and also likes SIG(H)T a lot (They win about 11.5% of the time). This wins 9% of the time.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: LOW 8L .LOW +21 409
>Morris_Greenberg: GIJOORS B2 JO +22 366
#note Matthew will almost definitely block, but can't I at least hope? (sim wrongfully says it wins 24% of the time, but is not considering that humans like Matthew are not complete idiots).
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACIN A3 CAIN +14 423
>Morris_Greenberg: GHINORS -  +0 366
#note HORNWORM and RINGWORM both play! But, since I am only 99.9999% sure CAIN is good, I have to challenge. My threshold for accepting defeat is about 187% sure of being acceptable.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACILN N3 ALNIC. +10 433
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe:  (GHINORS) +22 455
