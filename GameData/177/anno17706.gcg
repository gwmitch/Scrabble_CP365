#note Disclaimer for this entire tounament: This entire tounament will serve as a clinic for how to draw like Jesus. If you want to know the secrets to getting to 1945, just draw as well as I do! I'll end up with 19 of 24 blanks this tounament. 

Q says trade or ply AUTO at 8G. Why there?

>Matt_Canik: ENNORRU 11H RUNNER +21 105
#note Not thrilled with creating a situation where we'll be racing to an S with MOURNER. 

NEURONE and this were the frontrunners (no pun intended), with RUNE seeming like another option I could make if I really want to try and bingo next turn. But against a weaker player, I want to play more tiles and hold fewer 1-pointers. 

Between NEURON(E) and RUNNER, I chose RUNNER because with NEURONE he can score easy points at 15A or 13A and I'm stuck with no good scoring spots. 

Quackle predictably chooses MOURNER. Against other opponents I would too. 
>Bruce_D_Ambrosio: AEGINOS N5 AGONIES +71 105
#note Well I'm glad I didn't play MOURNER now!
>Matt_Canik: AIIOSST 8L IO.S +15 120
#note This was one of the toughest positions of the tournament in my opinion. I saw IO(N)S, SATO(R)I, SATO(R)IS, AO(R)IST, IOTAS O1, and SI(M)A. TO(R)II is also an option. 

Eventually I chose this because I was scared of a big play at 8L. And yet again, my paranoia will pay off...
>Bruce_D_Ambrosio: AEIRZ O1 ZAIRE +47 152
#note ...because this would have been AZI(N)E for 72!
>Matt_Canik: ACEISTW 13A CAW +26 146
#note Played this turn too quickly. WO 7M is way better- stronger leave and no easy countes for Bruce. Bad. 
>Bruce_D_Ambrosio: INO A12 I.ON +21 173
#note But I luck out. He has no good plays back. 
>Matt_Canik: BEEIPST 14A .BE +24 170
#note And he gives me this awesome play!

>Matt_Canik: EHNRVYY 2J HRYVN. +46 290
#note I saw this rack and thought I was sunk. Was looking at exchanging or ENVY 15C when suddenly.... 

This is why you never give up on a rack!
>Bruce_D_Ambrosio: EFT O12 FE.T +33 261
>Matt_Canik: EIOUWXY 1F YOWIE +38 328
#note Not thrilled about how this gives up potentil 2A bingos, but I've just got to play this. I can block the spot next turn and coast. 
>Bruce_D_Ambrosio: AFK 2E KAF +24 285
#note Well I guess he doesn't have the blank or he'd be keeping that open.

>Bruce_D_Ambrosio: DHT F11 D.TH +19 304
>Matt_Canik: DDJLRRU C11 J...D +16 387
#note With all those unseen vowels, how did I get more consonants? Strangely, it's actually a great thing for me to have pulled LR into 4 consonants here because his chances of bingoing are now really small.
