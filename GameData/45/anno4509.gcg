#note Only one bingo scores more than this, and it's horizontal.

>Joey: ?AJNTYZ 3B JANTY +30 60
#note I think I chose this over JAY to shed another consonant, and also not allow easy counter-plays.
>Keith: AR B1 RAJ +20 84
#note Your guess is as good as mine why this was scored as 22.  DOPS.
>Joey: ?DEEFTZ 1A FRiZED +84 144
>Keith: CEILPRS H1 PRESLICE +89 173
#note Annoyingly blocking not only the only seven, but also the only eight.  I held for awhile, then remembered RESLICED* was the plausible phoney I was thinking of.

#note I could've played QUIT, but the leave was too horrendous.

>Joey: AGINQUV 10B QUASHING +41 316
#note Let the race begin for the case S.
>Keith: CEHRW 13C WRETCH +34 291
>Joey: ILOOPSV A6 VIOLS +46 362
#note I considered biding my time, making him wonder where the last S was, but this was too much to pass up.
>Keith: BTU H12 BHUT +36 327
>Joey: ADIIOPT 12H BIPOD +20 382
#note Lots of close choices here.  I'm not really thrilled with any of them, since I'm less than a bingo ahead on a pretty open board.
>Keith: AEELMOR 15F METEORAL +61 388
>Keith: AEELMOR --  -61 327
>Joey: AIIITWY 11K WAY +31 413
#note I probably should have emptied the bag with WAIT, so that he couldn't set up two bingos at once.
>Keith: AEELMOR 7M DO +3 330
>Joey: IIIIORT O7 TORII +19 432
#note Good thing I hogged all of the I's he needed.

>Joey: I D8 VIA +8 451
#note Not the cleanest game, but a good sized victory nonetheless.  Winning two in a row took way too long.
