>Jason: ABCEORY 8G CARBOY +34 34
>Scott_Appel: ?AEMOPT I3 TEMPO.Al +64 64
#note The star play here is h1 hEPATOM(A)--a tough find.
>Jason: ?EHIILY 3C HELIcI.Y +76 110
#note The only bingo.  I found it through the C and then the T appeared for more points.
>Scott_Appel: GORRSVX 4B VOX +49 113
>Jason: EEFGLMN H1 GL.ME +44 154
#note I saw the only 8 and prayed for the letter, but it didn't happen :)
>Scott_Appel: AEGPRRS 11F GRASPER +82 195
#note SPARGER/CARBOYS is 8 more points... I'd play it if I was 100% sure of SPARGER on the day.
>Jason: AEEFNTU 12K FEU +21 175
#note Sims best.
>Scott_Appel: AEIKNNO 2J OAKEN +29 224
#note Best.
>Jason: AEEINNT B4 .ENETIAN +65 240
#note So I spent about 4 minutes here lamenting that ANTIGENE got blocked.  I considered all sorts of dumb moves like 3L ANE... then realized I hadn't checked the V.  Whew!  All it cost me was time.
>Scott_Appel: AIINNRT 1A TRAININ. +80 304
#note Oof.  Now I wished ANTIGENE had been playable again :(
>Jason: BEQSTUW A7 WEB +39 279
#note Clearly best.  QSTU is just fine.
>Scott_Appel: ADDHLOZ H11 .HOLD +39 343
#note Scott mentions some fun setups with this rack.  FWIW, his move AHOLD sims best.  HODAD, ZA, and AHOLD are available for more points but Scott sees the killer potential in the C7-C9 line for his Z.  Nice play!
>Jason: IIQRSTU 13F QU.IT +16 295
#note Here's my big mistake of the game.  Just QIS/FEUS is much better.  Even PI or BI sims better.  I mentioned after the game that I thought there surely was something better than my move and yup, that's so :)  [-8]
>Scott_Appel: ADEEGJZ C7 DAZE +64 407
#note Ouch.
>Jason: AIIRRST L2 .IR +14 309
#note This sims best... what else are you going to do?  <shrug>
>Scott_Appel: EEGJLNT M1 J.T +24 431
#note Scott can cash GLEEMEN this turn or next.  Basically JET and GLEEMEN are close to equally good.  I'd have preferred this turn, because his play is unfortunate for my rack.
>Jason: ADFIRST A11 AFRIT +38 347
#note Ouch... blocking INDRAFTS.  Now it's going to take a miracle.
>Scott_Appel: CEEGLNU 5E GLE..EN +40 471
#note A nice find, but JUG for 35 now is a killer play, sacrificing only 5 points to keep CEELN instead of CU.
>Jason: ADDSSSU 1M .US +32 379
#note Sweeeet... I have all the hooks for FEU.  Unfortunately there are absolutely zero bingos to be had with any 1 tile fish.  At least I checked that.  JUS appears best.
>Scott_Appel: CIOOUVW 13A .OC +10 481
#note ROC seems to be 5 points worse than OCCUR, which makes sense as the game plays out.
>Jason: ADDOSS 13F .....S +21 400
#note I thought this was good, giving me the DADOS threat and maintaining 2 outs--but Quack likes ODDS better.  I was afraid of letting him play VOW in general, but of course at o9 AVOWS kills, while AN(SA)/DAZES is a threat.  I think QUOITS is alright.
>Scott_Appel: IOUVW 10L OW +8 489
>Jason: ADDOS 7K DADOS +17 417
#note An interesting game, and one that was fun to play.  
>Jason:  (IUV) +12 429
