#note Not sure what I should have done here. HO 9H blocks all bingos, but at a horrible cost. I hoped for action on the triple with my Z, but the leave was really too junky. Also, I missed that my play set up AwARDEE for a better score. Could an exchange be right?

#note Yuck. I guess DUG is better, to preserve ZING.

#note Should have preferred FADS or FEDS, for more flexibility in the endgame. The F seems like a better tile to keep than the V, but it's an illusion in this position.
