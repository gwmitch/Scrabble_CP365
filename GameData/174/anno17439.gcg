#note So Rafi was really pissed because he was in 2nd and two games behind Jesse, but didn't get matched with him (Chris was also two back, and had less spread). Rafi was really angry for quite awhile, and in my fragile state, his outburst triggered another panic attack in me, and I didn't really want to play anymore, and totally hindered my ability to play Scrabble. I'm happy to have this game recorded so that I can see what it is like. Anyway, this opening rack shows an immediate devolution in my mind. VIATIC is obviously a word, but I chickened out of it. I even knew I was bein silly.

#note I felt so awful at this point that I figured I was better off trying to get a lucky draw here. That's how bad it was.

#note It's kinda pointless at this point - can't even concentrate, and Rafi is getting angry again.
