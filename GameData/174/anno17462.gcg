#note As soon as one hits simulate, FLAN moves up. I would never consider a QNN leave, Guess I have to think about that.

#note Rafi said he had PAUCITY here. Lovely play.
>Chris: EINPQRS A13 QIS +49 217
#note Would love to play Q for 21. Had it been a 31 point Q-drop, I would have done it, but ER is so string I am liable to hit next turn anyway.

#note Had I played PARENTED correctly, Rafi would have had LAUGHERs and I would NOT have had seedings* !:-), but would have had REEDINGS and maybe another choice or 2.

Of course, there is a God, so no doubt, I will draw my much-deserved after this.

#note Brought average score per play down to 58.75
>Chris: CILORTT 2M L.T +5 400
#note I see the possible EROTICA(L) and fished for it ot whatever 7 might fit ot an 8 off the T or through I that may still be available
>opp: BEFJOOU L6 JOB +31 501
#note I cut a calf praying for Rafi to play J(I)B to try to block EROTICA(L). This is the play that wins. From Rafi's viewpoint, I could have had TRAGICA(L) as the A is in the bag and my LT play could have easily meant that I held ACILT. He said, "There is 100% chance you would see ARGOTIC and a 99% chance you would see TRAGICAL, so I covered ARGOTIC." Excellent thinking. I am actually pretty proud that after no blanks, no X, no Z, no J, having a U-less Q and opp averaging damn near 60 points a turn, I made him *have* to make the right play to win. Needed three S's and three -ER combos to countermand that.
