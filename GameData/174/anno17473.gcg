#note i'm in trouble. 3B GED might be worth a try too, more pts, etc. F1 IGGED is quackle's lame suggestion. (-1%)

#note C2 YUM gives me a tiny big better chance, end the game slower and a decent bingo chance, although he will probbly play somewhere in the bottom left to muck it up. who knows.

#note A1 LEFT ends the game slightly slower. with OCTET i'm at 1 in 10000 to win, which is pretty cool. LEFT makes it 1 in 2000!
