#note I almost played LOVINGS# here but then realized to my horror that it would give up GLOVINGS# (but I thought was TWL obviously). -ings words are obnoxious.

>JD: ?EIILXY 9G XI +36 110
#note I was hoping he'd put a letter at 7G like BOX, FOX or POX so I could get BOXY/my bingo.

>JD: AAEJLTW J4 TAJ +56 266
#note I played TAJ instead of JAW, which is right, but for the wrong reason - putting the J at A13 gives him lots of cheap vowel dumps for too many points.

#note with a big lead I wanted to reduce the volatility of this scary hook. unfortunately, REARINGS* is a phony even in CSW, making this one of the 134 phonies I played this tournament (slight exaggeration).
>XP: CEHRSYZ 14I SCHERZ. +54 267
#note sick.
>JD: AAENNRU 15K AREA. +27 353
#note Mayive I should've taken VAU here. the U sucks and the V- spot is really useful for him, whereas it might be harder for him to take my other spot on his next turn. But on the other hand, points are points, so this is likely fine.
>XP: FOY M2 FOY +27 294
>JD: BENNQTU F4 BUNN. +9 362
#note the most interesting move of the game for me by far. the pool looks increasingly good, and with the Q in hand I might have a hard time responding if he bingos on column F. I also didn't want to put the more useful E into space. ditching my U seems wrong at first glance, but I can draw an I for QI at the bottom or an A for QAT, so I think I like my play.

>XP: DEIIRTU 2M .IT +12 342
#note this is a really awesome play by XP - trying to fish for a Q bingo more than anything with a few different tile draws that win unless I play my cards right. maybe he could also play ID/FETED but then I might catch on and block the Q.
>JD: AEIMNPT B12 ..T +18 432
#note XP's last previous play was sick. from my perspective he could have something like TURMERIC or ACQUIRED, so all I can do is not bingo and hope to outrun if he does bingo.

#note ran out of time, this play is pretty good, only 3 short of TiMPANA. nowhere for ipanema.
