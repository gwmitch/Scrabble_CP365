#note this game is for all the marbles - Bay Area Matchplay went to game 7 for our series. The winner gets to play JD in the final - he just won his match a few minutes ago. Noah was watching next to me which was actually kind of distracting, although I completely need to get used to that if I ever hope to be annotated again at Natls..  This is very close between ROTOR and TURGOR. i was very cognizant of trying to play more defensively throughout this whole series as olaugh is a machine and knows every word.

#note This play seems clearly best. I considered DRUID 11B for a few seconds but RIDE is a significantly better bingo leave.
>olaugh: ACS J8 SAC +20 53
>cesar: DEEIIRY 11D YID +20 57
#note i missed DEITY here. his play telegraphed an S to me and I didn't want to make it easier for him to bingo by giving up some friendly letters, although YID also sets up a good 7 lane. I think I still would have played DEITY if I'd thought of it, because of the leave, but I still worry about the defense of it.

>cesar: DEEIIRT B10 DI.IER +26 83
#note although this is a risky play, there are no other good options. DECEIT was what I saw first, it gives up fewer points but I wanted to keep the E. DICIER bingos more often than DECEIT for me (and for him...). Also considered 13D TIE, which scores just way too little, but it doesn't sim too badly.

#note a lucky break here, nothing else is close.

#note another lucky break, coupled with his exchange. it took me a while to pull the trigger on this word, as i haven't studied 5s in a while. 
>olaugh: ?AELOOR 11H ROsEOLA +67 217
>cesar: AALNRST 12L RANT +18 220
#note this is a frustrating play and my first serious mistake of the game. It seems that I do not know very many high prob 5s at all, or at least wouldn't pull the trigger on them on John. RATAL O11, RATAN O11, or O8 ANTRA are plays I would have played if I'd seen them; O8 ANTRAL though for 28 sims best. I did definitely see the ROSEOLAR hook but kept seeing things like ALTAR and wasn't sure on RATAN. (also, I spent a paranoidly long amount of time making sure I wasn't missing a bingo...) 
>olaugh: ?AINPTV 10L TAV +34 251
#note amazingly, I've blocked his two bingos - ANVILTOP and PIVOTMAN. I'd love to say I played RANT defensively, but it's not the right play, and it's also not very defensive since line 13 looks easy to hit. Just got lucky.

#note John makes his best play and the Scrabble gods give me a gift.

#note and I get another gift. BANTERS 6E is best here. I blanked on the B hook to HUT, only thinking of PHUT/SHUT. luckbox!

#note surprise again, I didn't think of the possibility of TOROSE. the simple 14I IF sims best on many-ply and it certainly has the most equity. i would just hate for something miraculous to happen when spread doesn't matter and i have the series won.

#note OBI 3H is pretty cool, making him play there and blocking a high scoring play to the S.
>olaugh: GJU H1 JUG. +36 367
>cesar: BEIINOW 14E OBI +16 452
#note ENOW here at 15L is definitely best, but again I forgot TOROSE was a word.
