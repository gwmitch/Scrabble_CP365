>Josh: AEGIKOT H6 OKA +14 14
#note Tough choice here, I really didn't want to give him a good DWS and facilitate my overlaps, but I guess the K isn't the best consonant to put on the DWS either. Not sure if this was right.
>Joel: DEEIRST I6 DIESTER +72 72
#note Joel had just won his last 3 games with 500+. Not looking good...
>Josh: EGIMNST 11G ME.TINGS +72 86
#note Good draw for me though to counter Joel's. 
>Joel: EPRUVY 12B PURVEY +35 107
>Josh: EEEHLQR C11 Q.EER +28 114
#note given that dropping the Q seemed necessary I played this. I wasn't 100% on HEELER (J2) and missed (S)HEQEL (which would be my option if he didn't give me a U). I just had to pray his luck was turning!
>Joel: IY E11 I.Y +18 125
>Josh: AEHILLZ 15A HA.L +24 138
#note setting up Z(E)E, although it's still the best play without that setup I think. M11 (G)HAZI is way too dangerous.
>Joel: EF 14B F.E +24 149
#note aww, he must have knew somehow...
>Josh: AEIILSZ L8 AZI.E +30 168
#note But even though I stopped focusing on just the spot I set up, I failed to see SALI(N)IZE after looking a decent amount. I should have alphabetized AEIILNSZ... I've seen SALINIZE many times before. Maybe I should play (N)AZI instead of this. I also failed to consider it. ZEI(N)S gives back way too much and screws up my rack. 
>Joel: GGO 8L .GOG +18 167
>Josh: ?ILOSTU N2 SOLUTI.n +68 236
#note First I saw TOUSLIn(G) and ruled it out as invalid. I really need to remember TOUSELS* being the only invalid one. I then considered that SOLUTING was valid but decided to play SOLUTI(O)N because of uncertainty and because of defense. I didn't want to have to worry about an S at O1, him bingoing at G2 almost inevitably gives me a great comeback. Noteworthy is LUSTIhO(OD) 6A.
>Joel: FHO O1 FOH +34 201
>Josh: AEEMOTX J4 MEAT +21 257
#note Now that I don't have to worry about the S, I feel it's the correct time to start closing in on this board. I liked this cause it sets my X up, even if he overlaps the M with an A or an I. But at this point I shouldn't have needed to worry too much, and instead I decide to miss two key plays... Maybe moat instead.

#note lucky
>Joel: AO 9K A.O. +17 269
>Josh: BDILNOU H11 .ON +21 455
#note style points, this is obviously worse that 14H LOB.
>Joel: ACV G4 VAC +15 284
>Josh: ABDILNU 14I AB +25 480
>Joel: N 10L .N +8 292
>Josh: ?DILNUW L6 DI.....s +22 502
#note I didn't pay much attention in this endgame when I should have. This is 26 points worse than 4C UNLI(V)e.
>Joel: IINRSTU G4 ...S +19 311
#note best play
>Josh: LNUW K11 .N +4 506
#note I also forgot I had drawn the last W so I thought he was also stuck, so instead of playing LU(V) I played this...
>Joel: IINRTU 5B NUTRI. +12 323
#note this was wrong though. I think Joel wanted to get the game over with.
>Josh: LUW C3 UL. +6 512
>Joel: I 10I .I +8 331
>Joel:  (W) +8 339
#note This is a game where I played well and not well at the same time. I need to be consistent at club to emulate the performance at tournaments.
