#note TREK is the word I was looking for. Took me awhile to find this, and then played it.

#note Admittedly I missed 14B THI(G)H, but correctly chose this over HETH(s). Interestingly, this only takes -NESS in Collins, though I was prepared to add the LY, had there been a Y left. ;)

#note B10 ZOONA(L) wins for sure.
>dacrON: GOORSTU C13 GU. +22 393
#note Debated this and OUTGO. Leaving one in the bag and preserving an -OTS play at N10 seemed like a good idea. Manyply likes OUTGO more to the tune of 6%, and Champ player probably can't solve this. I still like this play...but not sure.
>Richard: EINORSX 15H OX +36 419
#note Amazingly, this only loses to the N being in the bag. That's exactly what I left. That said; the 87.5 win% here is perhaps misleading, as GUV might suggest some strength on my rack.
>dacrON: BIOORST N8 RIOTS +27 420
#note ROOTS in the same spot, or 14N BI also win. This seemed safest, with under 1 minute left, as its saved two good spots for BO.
>Richard: EINNRS 13C ...NERS +21 440
#note 2B RINSE is one better.
