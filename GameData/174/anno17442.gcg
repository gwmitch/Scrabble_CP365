>cesar: EEILRSS J6 RESILES +65 75
#note kept debating between this and up one (so J5 RESILES). it's basically just a defensive consideration. i wanted to make it a little less volatile. quackle likes J6 IRELESS by about 2 points more.

#note this didn't look right to me, but i thought i could get away with it. she basically instantly challenged it.

#note this is a very bizarre game for me and i have no idea why i'm not playing at the B spot to the triple. BOWER or OBEYER are clearly better; quackle also likes C11 COWY too. i'm starting to think i misannotated something, but i was not playing like myself at all this game. (-12)

#note i think for the first few moves since i'd lost my opening game to paula i was just really worried about losing again and started playing badly because of it. for example here i am taking points and turnover instead of keeping the S because i'm worried she'll get the second blank and i'll lose. it sims really close.

#note this is a tough move to have to make but i am being excessively paranoid because of the lost turn earlier.

#note just saw VERNIX on quackle very easily, but apparently not over the board. was i just really tired or what? i know i was worried this game and got some tunnel vision, but i had no idea it was this bad. (-11)

#note quackle likes C4 NOUN here. it kills her EKE spot that i dumbly created. (-1.5)

>cesar: EINRSTV 8A VE. +18 317
#note quackle is really liking 12B VID or L8 LEV here. i wanted to block ZIT. i don't think my chances of bingoing are that great here. i think VET is best, even though it burns an E for EKE. what say you all?

>cesar: IINRSTZ 2G RITZ +35 352
#note i got pretty lucky after pretty bad play early. BTW - if she plays EKE, i only have one win - it's a good exercise to try to find it. i definitely did not find it over the board although i was prepared for her to play it. i wonder if i would have with just a couple of minutes on my clock like always.
