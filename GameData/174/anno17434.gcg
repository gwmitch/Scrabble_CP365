>dacrON: AACDMNT 8G MAC +14 14
#note CAD is apparently a bit better here.
>Jesse_Day: AEEIJOV 9F JOE +18 18
#note JD: ermmm, I thought the board would be sooooo defensive after this play...uh...
>dacrON: AAADENT J4 ANTAE +15 29
#note JD: I held for some reason

>Jesse_Day: EFINNRS --  -79 55
#note I was surprised to see this when I came back from the bathroom. Unfortunately for me FERNINS(T) plays in two spots. JD: uh, my bad. I didn't even see the second spot for FERNINST until after he challenged
>dacrON: AGHIIYY M13 YAG +28 157
#note I didnt realize the upper FERNINS(T) score more, or I would've likely taken YAH here, going for a play at H 1 next turn.

>Jesse_Day: DGNOTTU 15H GUNDO. +30 270
#note Held this, but it was no time to challenge anyway (it's good).
>dacrON: ?DGIIIT 4D DIG +27 295
>Jesse_Day: ?ELOTTU E10 .LOUT +14 284
#note JD: difficult decision for me. I can take more points by playing LET or ET at 5C, but I thought I needed to start branching the board to guarantee a bingo, and the distraction of CLOUTS could make him think I am setting myself up there and lead to him not blocking all the bingo spots.
>dacrON: ?DEIIST 13B DIS.nITE +70 365
#note I have to play this right?
>Jesse_Day: ?EEFORT B6 FOsTERE. +71 355
#note JD: seems like I must bingo and hope for the best. I can probably win if he drew the Q or if he failed to draw either of the remaining vowels.
>dacrON: ELLQRRZ G12 Q. +11 376
>Jesse_Day: BMNOPRX E3 ..X +24 379
#note playing BIN now sims a bit better.
>dacrON: ELLRRZ 7A R.LLER +7 383
#note (I)LL, a play I considered, keeps it closest, but I was out of time and chose this. Should've done (Z)A instead and hoped he missed R(O)LLER because I lose a lot of spread this way. Just a bit frustrated after that horrendous draw.
