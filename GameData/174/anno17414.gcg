#note FIX? UNFIX? FIXING? FU(R)RING really stood out to me, especially since I (randomly) knew it took an S. And it sets up the X at 11E. But I decided not to play it because I thought it was too cute. 

It's simming best without that consideration, and becomes a few points stronger with it. So apparently it's not too cute.

#note I see NONaCTO(R) but pass it up intentionally- a 59 point bingo is not what I need right now. I don't see CONf(R)ONT or CONT(I)NuO, but would not play those either.

>Matt_Canik: ?GHLNOT 3J HO.G +18 290
#note HOL(I)NG appears to make sense but I feel she'll sniff out a setup of my T and block. I don't think DONATIVE takes an S but I'm prepared to try it if I need to to win the game. 
>Leslie_Millard: AL J3 .A.L +9 369
>Matt_Canik: ?AELNST N3 SALTErN +68 358
#note No need to play DONATIVES now, more important to get *something* down to try and take her in an endgame. This seems to give the least back.
>Leslie_Millard: A -  +0 369
#note And she challenges! I can win!
>Matt_Canik: AAELOPS O6 OLEA +21 379
#note With an S and some luck, I think I can win this endgame pretty often after this play. I really want to block MAILE O4- she's eying that spot aggressively. 
>Leslie_Millard: AEEILMS A12 EMES +28 397
#note Phew! I blocked MEALIES!
>Matt_Canik: ADEPRSU I5 .AR.ED +15 394
#note I have a few wins according to Quackle, but didn't see one except BARMED*. I was about 80% sure it WAS valid, though. She can do nothing about SUP/ES except make a really bad play that gives me more points, so I'll win in any scenario where this stays on the board. She's also quite low on time and maybe can't figure this endgame out in time. 
>Leslie_Millard: AIL 4N .I +3 400
#note Time pressure

#note No reason to risk DONATIVES now!
