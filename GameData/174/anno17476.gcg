>Sam_Towne: II -II +0 0
#note After over 4 months of stalling, I've finally decided to revisit Albany and see how I can improve instead of forgetting about it completely. Did I really play as badly as the numbers showed? I guess we'll find out as I annotate.
>Siddharth_Muali: HILMNRY 8F HYMN +24 24
#note Exchange 2 or not, this is the only feasible option.
>Sam_Towne: ?AAEIRT H8 .ATERIAl +80 80
>Siddharth_Muali: EIILRSV 14C VIREL.IS +65 89
#note I chose like the second worst bingo here. LIVERIES is a bad miss. This is about a 10% loss. I do know these words, but I failed to find them. No excuses.
>Sam_Towne: ?AEINNO 10D vENA.ION +61 141
>Siddharth_Muali: AFIMNRW D12 WA.F +28 117
#note At least this is good.
>Sam_Towne: AFORV 11J FAVOR +31 172
>Siddharth_Muali: EGIIMNR N10 G.IME +24 141
#note Chose the lowest variance, non fishy play, which isn't a wise thing to do probably, but the only other play that even scores is EM for 22, leaving GIIRN. Nah, not really. But seriously? MI? IMMATERIAL? VIM? At least this play flip flops with everything aforementioned as 'best'.
>Sam_Towne: IQS J6 QIS +45 217
>Siddharth_Muali: IIJKNRW K5 JIN +33 174
#note Wasn't thrilled with this play. With 4 D's out, I'm probably just feeding him free points and handing him free board control, but at least if he doesn't have it I give him a spot to worry about. Only KIWI is better, I would think.

>Sam_Towne: HLO 11E HOL. +28 269
>Siddharth_Muali: BCEORRT O8 BRO +18 192
#note ORBY looks nice with the same tiles. I figured the other BRO would get shut down too easily. At the same time, I have no idea what this accomplishes.

#note This static valuation of 54.0 means absolutely nothing.

#note Dunno
>Sam_Towne: LPU 6F PUL +25 376
>Siddharth_Muali: ACEEIRT H1 CEREA. +27 289
#note Missed AVE as 'best' these last two turns, but they don't accomplish anything at all, really.
>Sam_Towne: CRSUX 4D CRUX.S +30 406
>Siddharth_Muali: DINNTTW 7B TWIN. +12 301
>Sam_Towne: DEEKOTU 8A TOED +33 439
#note Blocks unbatted (which I saw), his best play.
>Siddharth_Muali: ABDENTU M7 BUTE. +15 316
#note Lol yeah, 1 off of the best non-bingo endgame play!
>Sam_Towne: EKU 1H .UKE +10 449
#note Two huge mistakes this game, one obviously didn't matter, so really the fatal error was not finding LIVERIES. Ouch. Playing fairly decently for most of the rest just won't cut it.
