#note 6J SHA(N)K felt too risky - a momentary lapse of judgement that I need to forget about. But even so, I missed a perfectly reasonable, if not the best contender contender in J7 LAKH.

#note Serious tunnel vision here - didn't spot the fact that plays could go at (J)_(B). I wanted turnover for the S or ?, but this sacrifices too much to do that, I feel.

#note D4 CA(R)OM is the obvious good play I missed here, and MUCO(R) wins a 2ply sim due to it's X setup potential. I'm not really sure if it scores enough to justify the sacrifice, though.
