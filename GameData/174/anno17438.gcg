>dacrON: ACEEIPR H1 EARPIEC. +95 95
#note Anxiety had definitely set in, as my record against John is terrible, and I almost missed this. Fortunately I noticed it as I was picking up tiles to play CRE(E)PIE.
>John_O'Laughlin: IIKUW 4C WIKIU. +30 72

>John_O'Laughlin: ACM 3B CAM +28 127
>dacrON: AINOOPU E3 O.A +22 217
#note Was completely at a loss on what to do here, but after he played CAM, this play jumped out as an effective block. (y)OUPON is an interesting play I didn't notice, although not a play worth making here.
>John_O'Laughlin: ALUW 11H WAUL +19 146
>dacrON: INOPTTU 12J POUT +18 235
#note 12D PUTON wins the sim barely for its win%, which is funny, because John bingoes the same amount after POUT or PUTON, and INT is pretty nice here. Maybe it's the 5 extra points PUTON scores.
>John_O'Laughlin: IQ 7C QI +26 172

>John_O'Laughlin: ELNO B10 NO.LE +18 190

#note Well, OK then.
>John_O'Laughlin: OX A14 OX +29 219
>dacrON: ?HHNORS A9 NOH +13 402
#note Darn! I missed a bingo here! The worst part is, I saw that I almost has RamSHORN, but then missed SHo(E)HORN! Perhaps a bit too complacent here.

>dacrON: ?EHIMRS 9M H. +18 432
#note Looking at this in hindsight, I may have missed a great opportunity here. I know he has DITTAS, and likely has an S after CAM, NO(B)LE. ADISTT? makes only DIkTATS and DISTAnT, which means John won't bingo if I open with ME(T)H here! Quackle confirms this analysis that I bingo 61% next turn, but is 61% enough? I think so!
>John_O'Laughlin: DIOTT K3 DITTO +21 270
>dacrON: ?DEIMRS 8D .....D +19 451
#note This play is fine if C9 MED(I)I doesn't exist.
>John_O'Laughlin: AEFLNS 4J F.NALE +20 290
>dacrON: ?EIMRSS L12 .M +4 455
#note UM, I don't know what to do here. He only has a bingo on 1/8 racks, so should I open and force him to block? / risk the 1/8 bingo shot? I have the most spread at this point, and John has the third most. And although we can no longer win, we can both still cash.
>John_O'Laughlin: BEIJRST J10 T..S +8 298
#note J10 J(UP)ES is best here, but John was out of time, and didn't want to give up a potential bingo.
>dacrON: ?AEIRSS H10 ...ER +8 463
#note This sequence is 7 or so worse. than 3J I(D)EA. Gotta force him into J(AW).
>John_O'Laughlin: BEIJR M3 J.B +24 322
>dacrON: ?AISS 15H SAIlS +42 505
#note 6 seconds was not enough time to deisgnate the blank. I've made that mistake before - I went over 1 minute.
>dacrON:  (EIR) +6 511
#note Final score 501-322.
