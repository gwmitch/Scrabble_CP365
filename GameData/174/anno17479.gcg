#note CLABBERS game vs Emanuel. 

Clabbers is a variant of Scrabble wherein any string of letters that anagrams to a valid word is acceptable. So I could play the word WOMEASE, since it anagrams into AWESOME. To challenge, the opponent must say what word(s) she/he is thinking of, and then it works how a normal challenge would work.

Here I thought about exchanging, since you quite often give back a lot of points by making the first play in Clabbers, but it didn't seem he could score 15 more post-FIG than post-exchange most of the time.
>Emanuel: KMRU 10F KURM +28 28
#note MURK/FRIG.

I started to fear KURMY (MURKY) after this play.
>Josh: EIJLNPS H7 ....EPLIN +54 68
#note At first this was PREFILING, and then I saw that it was also PILFERING!
>Emanuel: CITV 11D VCIT. +28 56
#note EVICT or CIVET here.
>Josh: ABDGJSU 9G J.U +43 111
#note here I was blind to A(VCITE) even though it's quite obvious now that it's ACTIVE. So I probably should have burned my S and played JBASU/AVCITE (JUBAS) for 55.
>Emanuel: EIOTV D8 VOI.ET +32 88
#note VOTIVE
>Josh: AADGGS J9 ASGGAD +40 151
#note Wow! playing GBSAAG (GASBAG) at C9 is the right play here, as keeping a D over a B is good and it scores more. I also missed the placement of DAGGAS (GDSAAG) for 47 at the same spot. Instead I played it for 7 less points forming JGUA (JUGA) and pluralizing KURM. I also didn't think Emanuel would be able to hook DAGGAS after thinking about what letter could be added to it to form a 7-letter word. But alas, one can add an A for AGGADAS and--I'll save you the spoiler :)
>Emanuel: LL F10 ..LL +8 96
#note Emanuel was frustrated that he didn't seem to be able to score or bingo, and missed L[JGUA] (JUGAL) for 13 more points
>Josh: ?ABORSU C9 BOSRAUl +98 249
#note I stared at this rack and the board for quite a long time. There are just so many options in Clabbers! I even got to writing down AABLLORSTU?, looking for an 11 through TLLA on 13A! I found nothing and amazingly there was nothing through those tiles! Unfortunately my brain quickly got drained and I got impatient. Had I looked longer (or had I been less tired) I might have seen the 9-letter word through the V and I on row 8! Can you find it? I also didn't even consider words through that I such as IAROBSUc (CARIBOUS), IAROBSUm (BIRAMOUS) or IAROBSUp (BIPAROUS)! Anyways, the star play remains BORVURSIA! ARBOVIRUS! Amazing! 

The coolest play was RgOSTJUTUAB, forming SUBJUGATOR! My play was LABOURS or SUBORAL and quite boring in comparison.
>Emanuel: DOY 15A DO.Y +33 129
#note ODYL or OLDY.
>Josh: ACEHIMW B13 WH. +34 283
#note I kept on seeing CAVIEST* instead of ACTIVES, so I missed ACWHO, although it is a pretty dangerous play. The best play was probably AMHICE/ASGGADA, HAEMIC and AGGADAS, but I missed AGGADAS. This wasn't a very good play
>Emanuel: EEIORST 15H .SREOTIE +87 216
#note SEROTINE/ONERIEST was the bingo, but what is ASGGADR? I didn't know but I didn't challenge, cause if he said that he was thinking of SAGGARD then I would have lost my turn! I didn't know that word. Nice play!
>Josh: ACEFIMT 14J .AMEF +40 323
#note This time I had VFIEICT (FICTIVE), forming JUTE, CUM and STAGGARD. Just like SAGGARD I didn't know STAGGARD. This was good cause it took out some 8 lanes, an easy scoring spot, and partially blocked column O bingos, which would hurt. This word is FAMED
>Emanuel: DNPY 13J .PNYD +51 267
#note PANDY.
>Josh: ABCIORT 12L OB +29 352
#note Here I had (P)I(G)TABO (PIGBOAT) for a whopping 59 points! Instead I took 30 less points to go for a bingo and missed it :P

>Emanuel: EINR 8A RNE.I +33 300
#note RIVEN and RUBEOLAS!
>Josh: AACIORT D4 CRAI......T. +52 404
#note I was so excited that he didn't block my spot here! This even drew a challenge! I had to make sure all of the letters were right before playing this, but it took Emanuel much longer to decipher what I had just played. OVERACTIVITY!
>Emanuel: NQR -  +0 300
#note And even when Emanuel finally found what this may have been he challenged! I was pretty sure it was good because UNDERACTIVITY is good.
>Josh: AAENOTU A1 AEONUTA. +77 481
#note I think I should have played the same word starting with the R at D5 here. Both are AERONAUT, a very lucky draw.
>Emanuel: NQR 6A .QR.N +34 334
#note TRANQ
>Josh: AEEEOTW B1 AWEE +30 511
#note (RNEVI)WE(I)EET! What a beautiful dump for 44 points! Did you find what it is? 

My boring play was for defensive purposes, and yes, I support adding EW to the dictionary, and have since I was a wee child!
>Emanuel: ?HNOSXZ C2 OH +28 362
#note going for oxazines at H8. Good effort, maybe should have just dropped the H then. High scoring play is HNZOSc (SCHNOZ), making HAGGARDS. 
>Josh: DEEIIOT 9B I.. +7 518
#note Emanuel kibitzed that he didn't have a bingo here, so I decided to go for my own.
>Emanuel: ?ALNSXZ 8J SAZLNo +83 445
#note AZLONS
>Josh: DEEEIOT G8 D...IET +30 548
#note Right word (JUTTIED), wrong spot. I can add the T to NSREOTIE to form TENORITES!
>Emanuel: X 7D .X +19 464
#note Thank you for tuning in, I hope you were entertained! :)
>Emanuel:  (EEO) +6 470
