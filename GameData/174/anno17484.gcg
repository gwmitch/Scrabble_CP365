#note This sims best
>Rafi_Stern: AELNORT H1 TOLERAN. +77 106
#note He put it going down from the T first, then switched it
>Kolton: AEFINRT 4H .F +5 71
#note I actually knew that the only bingo with FAINTER and IL was ANTILIFER. Weird. Hope this fish pays off.
>Rafi_Stern: BSU I6 BUS +26 132
#note A valiant effort to block
>Kolton: AEINRTT J1 TERTIAN +77 148
#note Muahahaha evil laugh. 
>Rafi_Stern: ELRU D8 .UREL +24 156
>Kolton: EEEGIRT 12C G.EETIER +60 208
#note Good thing he floated an L, because TIGEREYE didn't quite fit
>Rafi_Stern: EHI 9I HIE +23 179
>Kolton: AEEKNOQ H11 E.KON +27 235
#note Wow. 8K AKENE for 44 is a pretty bad miss
>Rafi_Stern: DEIVW 8K WIVED +44 223
>Kolton: AAABEOQ -AABOQ +0 235
#note 6 out of the top 7 choices are exchange. The other option is to fight through it with ABO(V)E
>Rafi_Stern: OPST 13B POST +33 256
>Kolton: AADEEEL 2B DEA.E +22 257
#note Q likes LEA(V)E a little better. I understand why, I think.
>Rafi_Stern: DOPR 1A DORP +42 298
#note ouch. that's why
>Kolton: ADELRUY 15G U.DERLAY +63 320
#note (T)U(T)ELARY is pretty sick
>Rafi_Stern: ?ABCMN O12 CABs +66 364
#note Rafi said he passed on a bunch of bingos here because with an S and the other blank and the Z and the Q unseen, I could easily lay down a 90 point play here. Also, he said that this was the move that lost him the game. He should have played CAMs and saved BAN for BAN(JOISTS) next turn~~~~~ whew.
>Kolton: ?FGMNOS 14M FO. +31 351
>Rafi_Stern: IQ 14A QI +30 394
#note This was a very interesting play. I guess it still is.
>Kolton: ?AGMNSZ 3A ZAG +38 389
#note Ok. I need a little luck here
>Rafi_Stern: ACHMNO 10K NACHO +24 418
#note I'm not sure what his entire rack was here. If he had ACHIMNO, he could play 15A INCH for 77 and then I would have to find L3 UNIoN(I)SM to win the game by 5. If he had ACHMNOO, Championship Player says 3J (R)ANCHO is best
>Kolton: ?IMNNSU 15A INNS +53 442
#note Best
>Rafi_Stern: IMO 14J MO +22 440
>Kolton: ?MU D4 aMU +20 462
