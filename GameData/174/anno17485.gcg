>Chris_Williams: BIJ 8G JIB +24 24
>Kolton: CEEEGHN J8 ECHE +30 30
#note Q gives a slight edge to GHEE instead.. I like keeping NG with an open I
>Chris_Williams: FIRVY 11I V.RIFY +30 54
>Kolton: EGILLNU N6 GLUIL. +16 46
#note Q says to fish with something like M11 (F)LU
>Chris_Williams: ACEEGHLLN -  +0 54
#note aceeghlln
>Kolton: ABELNOU M11 .OU +12 58
#note I whiffed on BE(F)OUL, my play is second best
>Chris_Williams: AEINO 9E AEONI. +27 81
>Kolton: ABEHLNV 8M L.V +18 76
#note This play is quite bad. 8A HAVEN is 38 and 10F HEN is 40
>Chris_Williams: ENOOTZ E5 OZON.TE +64 145
>Kolton: ABEGHNW D11 WHANG +33 109
#note 10C BA(T)HE for 41 comes out as the winner here. 8A GNAW(N) is a hard word for me to find. Also, I realized very shortly after I hit my clock that this would be worth 2 more at D1
>Chris_Williams: ENOX 8A XENO. +39 184

>Chris_Williams: CDEKNR 13B CR.NKED +30 241
>Kolton: AEMRRSY 14J MARRY +39 280
#note I was hoping he would float an O so I could play ROSEMARY, but alas.
>Chris_Williams: ?AEEEGT 15F TEEnAGE +84 325
#note Nice find. The only other bingo is ETAGErE

>Kolton: EIMOSTT G2 MITTS +32 312
#note This is the turning point in the game. Postgame, we went back through this, and even though my play is probably 'best', fishing off one of the Ts might have been better. If I had done that, I would've had something like 6/11 shot at a bingo next turn (Chris said that he would've played QUITS had I not blocked that spot)
>Chris_Williams: DILSTTU H1 TUTS +28 353
#note Possibly what his rack was
>Kolton: AEFOORW K3 WOOFER +38 350
#note Championship Player agrees with WOOFER and say I am 26.5% to win
>Chris_Williams: DIILNSS 3K .ILDS +18 371
>Kolton: AAIR 1H .IARA +6 356
#note Tough pre endgame here. I still need to work on that part of my game.
>Kolton:  (INS) +6 362
