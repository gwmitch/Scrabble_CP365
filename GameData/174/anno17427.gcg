>Chris_Cree: EHLRUUY 8D HURLY +30 30
#note JD: This game was to clinch the tournament! CC: Whoa - Never thought of HURLEY. I was too busy thinking that both games against Jesse, I have 2 U's in my opening rack and by playing through them, he will not draw them to mess up one of his.
>JD: AEEEGJQ F3 JAEGE. +18 18
#note I was about to play JAYGEE but figured it made the board more open while I was offloading the Q. Of course, JAEGER blocks my U to play through, but I figured I would never get to use that spot anyway. stupid me - he could play at I6 after JAYGEE or something. JAYGEE is the play.
>Chris_Cree: ENNTTUW 5C UNW.T +16 46
#note CC: Nice WU, 2 pair rack. Now I am out of them and have good balance.
>JD: EEIOQSV 9C QI +26 44
>Chris_Cree: BEENOST 7H BONESET +68 114
>JD: DEEOOSV 10D DOVE +23 67
#note jesse really needs to go back to the book and not miss nosedove
>Chris_Cree: DILNUWY M3 UNWI.LDY +84 198
#note CC: Another WU. This time it hits about as big as it can. I feel pretty good about my chances right about now. Thinking that I can win by enough to play him again round 14 for the title. Let's have a PBD that is worth a damn, OK?
>JD: ?EEOOSS 4H SOmEO.ES +68 135
#note JD: my only bingo CC: Lovely find with this 3 pair blank rack. For me, those are *so* hard to work through!
>Chris_Cree: DFGIMRX 5I FIX +50 248
#note CC: was really hoping for another vowel. This will haunt me come a turn later
>JD: AEILNPR H1 PAL. +18 153
#note JD: in spite of my great rack, the board is very defensive - just need to open a lane and hope.
>Chris_Cree: ADGKMRR L10 MARK +27 275
#note CC: A tournament losing play. As I set this up in Q, I thought M(A)RK, you dimwad! I knew what Jesse was up to opening a P line. I "saw" DEKAGRAM. I wanted to play DAK(S) but just couldn't pull the trigger on keeping 4 consonants, then thought "I *know* and will think of MARK(A), will he?" I need to win by 150 anyway, so open it up and draw somethng, kiddo. Though the highest valued play, the 0.59 winning % difference rears its head.
>JD: AEFINOR 1H .INAFORE +101 254
#note CC: You have got to be kidding me. PF word, F on DLS?
>Chris_Cree: BCDGIRV N10 CRIB +30 305
#note CC: No A, no big play. My thoughts are that I have just seen a chance to win the tournament die and I am playing for 2nd place. Very hard to keep my head here.
>JD: ?AEIOTZ K11 ZA +46 300
#note JD: wow, I actually have a chance! Should play AZO here because it takes away a lot of cheap points from him (as well as leaving me a better leave)  CC: Jesse said he had already drawn the 2nd blank here and no doubt, made the correct decision to take 49 keeping the blank. I am just shaking my head as he just about ties it looking down at my rack.
>Chris_Cree: DEGGNTV C4 V.GG +11 316
#note CC: TEGG looks a lot better, but I was really after shedding the dreck and giving myself a chance to draw S or blank and hit 14L, or even a cool _ _ A _ S play
>JD: ?AEEIOT O12 TOEA +22 322
#note CC: I was all set to play DENT when this came down
>Chris_Cree: DEENPST 11C PED +26 342
#note CC: I figured the dynamism of this play gave me the best chance.I really wanted to play TED. Had I had an I or A, I would have. Should have anyway.
>JD: ?EHIIIN 8K HI.I +18 340
#note JD: after PED I thought it was safe to assume he had the last E, so HIVE at 4A looks worse. if I don't bingo soon it's conceivable he could block by playing on row 14 (MARKA).  CC: This tells me he has IER? - oh joy. Game 12 and 13 of a 14 gamer - the big ones, and no blanks for me?? What is up with that? I just get eaten up thinking about stuff like this.
>Chris_Cree: AEINSTT 12D SATIN +34 376
#note JD: incredibly, this was his actual rack. I thought SATIN seemed reasonable at the time but quackle loves TA at B10 because he is so likely to bingo after - and if I bingo right away he bingoes out to win in many cases. the game would turn into a delicate dance of who could bingo last. when all's said and done, I think this was a fair try.  CC: A SATINE bingo doesn't play?? I did not think through the value of TA or AT here. I mistakenly thought that the tile pool was so good, I couldn't help but draw a 7 letter word and would be able to retort his bingo underneath on row 15 and win. I should have thought I literally can't miss with this. Given what I did play, I should have played SEITAN over SATIN
>JD: ?DEINOR 14F ORDINEs +71 411
#note JD: must bingo this turn, ORDINES seemed a little harder to play off of than DINEROS.  CC: Hd to have an S as blank bingo. Given what I drew, both win.
>Chris_Cree: ACELOTT B10 CATTLE +35 411
#note JD: chris can make this a 2-point loss if he plays CATTLE at 15A, in which case I don't get to play REAM and have to find MAR/APED to win. I only had about 15 seconds to play, so maybe I would've missed it!  CC: With the tile pool what it was on my 5 letter draw after SATIN, I counted 27 7 letter words in AACELMORTU and of those 27 7 letter words, *zero* of them played under ORDINEs.He has two places to play ARUM. CATTLE takes both out and makes him have to play a good word. CATTLE for 29 is actually 3 points better. Never thought that one through.
>JD: AMRU 15A R.AM +27 438
#note our score was wrong so I may have just taken MA for 18 and an apparent 3-point win...but the tie would've still been enough for me to clinch first!
>Chris_Cree: O 13L .O.. +20 431
>Chris_Cree:  (U) +2 433
