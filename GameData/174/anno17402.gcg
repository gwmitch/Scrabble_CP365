>paula: AOR 8F ORA +6 6
>cesar: FGIIITT E5 GIFT +20 20
#note for the first time i learned at this tournament than when playing someone significantly lower rated, it is better to exchange borderline racks. maybe for this example it doesn't matter so much because GIFT keeping ITI is not that bad.
>paula: GOT F4 GOT +13 19
>cesar: AEEIITU G7 U.AEI +7 27
#note this is where the exchange maxim comes in. this is already very likely an exchange situation against a top expert, and there is no reason for me to take 7 pts here. maybe 9G ETUI but it has similar problems. this is one of the valuable lessons i learned this tourney! (-0.5)
>paula: EIPSW H11 SWIPE +44 63
>cesar: AEEEIOT D3 TOEA +15 42
#note now i suddenly need the points, but i am still way too stubborn. keeping EEI really doesn't do much for me here and i'm just giving up easy overlap points. (-0.5%) I know all these decisions are close but I should immediately exchange against lower rated players.
>paula: AJR C2 RAJ +33 96
>cesar: EEEFINW B1 FEW +28 70
#note B1 WEE, perhaps, which scores less but is more volatile. i still prefer FEW and hope i don't get yet more vowels.
>paula: BDEENRS I2 BENDERS +67 163
#note this game is very quickly getting out of control.
>cesar: EEEINSU 5I .UE +8 78
#note i was actually starting to freak here. saw ENNUI and WEENIE but i was too scared to keep EES instead of EEINS. is ENNUI right guys? I feel like I'm far enough down that it's actually hard to tell. maybe I do need to now get lucky and play off as few tiles as possible and try to force mistakes or whatever. (-4)
>paula: AENV H1 VANE +33 196
#note this is painful

>paula: CKY N11 C.KY +26 246
>cesar: EELRSYZ J1 RYE +33 224
#note can't afford to make any mistakes here, I saw LYE after hitting the clock. I wonder why this happens to people. Suddenly I have a singular focus to try to win this game and catch up ASAP that game mechanics start going out the window. I was already beginning to imagine possible phonies. (-3)
>paula: Q 13G Q. +21 267
>cesar: ELLRSTZ 14J ZEST. +37 261
#note see what i mean - this is a terrible miss. 7K LEZ is easily the best play here, but i was too focused on scoring and catching up at all costs. (-15)
>paula: ABGINNR C6 BARNING +68 335
>cesar: IILLOPR -  +0 261
#note i was about 90%+ sure of barning, but i was nearl 100% that i would lose if it stayed on so I feel like I had to challenge. i guess I wasn't THAT far down, but still my situation is very dire.
>paula: ?ADDHLO A1 OH +36 371
>cesar: IILLOPR 8L .ILL +12 273
#note it doesn't really matter anymore. maybe something like M7 ROIL gives me something better to work with. 4K POLIO is something else. ::shrug::
>paula: TV 15G V.T +6 377
>cesar: IILOOPR B10 OI +10 283
#note hehe, 11A ION is the only sensible move here as everything else loses 100%. however there is no universe under which she leaves that lane open.
>paula: ?ADHI 1J .ADIsH +33 410
>cesar: ILMOPRU A7 LUMP +29 312
#note missed primo (-8). Opening a tourney with a loss always sucks :(
