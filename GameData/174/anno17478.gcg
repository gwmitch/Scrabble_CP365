>Siddharth_Muali: AEINOPZ D10 .OPAZ +32 245
#note Not great. I saw PULP/EPIZOA which I opted out of but failed to see it one space higher. That woulda been great. ZONAE is also a beautiful fit. I was trying to fastplay to run her over at this point (I think she had 6 left here?), but that doesn't mean I should overlook simple plays. (-10?)

>Siddharth_Muali: EIINOOW 14B WI. +30 275
#note Sims second to WIZEN, hated that because it's needlessly dangerous and I wanted to prolong the game given her time trouble.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ACN N2 CAN +16 249
>Siddharth_Muali: EILLNOO 7H .OL.E. +20 295
#note No need to give her bing lines with OL(I)O. This play felt good because I made it backwards. Missed ORIEL, which may be better than this, but I'm satisfied with my play.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ?STX 1L XyST +60 309
>Siddharth_Muali: AEILNOY C11 YON. +27 322
#note I think this is certainly better than the other YONI, which is the play that's rated higher than this.

>Siddharth_Muali:  (NS) +4 419
#note Another okay-ish game, the phony was awful, but my mistakes weren't too bad otherwise. TOPAZ was like a 10 point error, but the others were pretty minor. Still a long way to go though.
