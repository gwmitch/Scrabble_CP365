#note I like WINGY better than WYLING because of the s-hook setup.

>JD: EFJNSTY 13C FEY +39 73
#note the first of many attempted phonies on the weekend. this one is a very tough challenge for him. it may not even be better than playing JITNEY, but I figured I would dump the J next turn and then have bingo tiles, whereas my rack is pretty much rebooted after JITNEY. but jitney lets me bingo faster, so probably a mistake.
>Rafi: ELLNOSU 12C EN.OLL +23 150
#note I held WHIMPERY* for a bit as it looked unfamiliar, but I couldn't remember whether it was phoney or whether I hadn't seen it in awhile. Thought about ENROL but the L setup won't amount to anything big really. PUL is an interesting option that I didn't consider... the board is so bingo prone that ELNOS will hit around 2/3 of the time! ENROLL, ENROL, PUL, and LO/WO sim very closely.
>JD: BCJNSST 6G J.BS +15 88
#note surprisingly quackle really wants me to play JABS at the top - I guess the S being there lets him bingo with a lot of random racks, even though it seems counterintuitive to close the board while down. but the S I already have makes it harder for me to hit row 1.
>Rafi: AEISUUV 3E UVU.A +10 160
>JD: CENQSTT -QT +0 88
#note way too consonant-heavy, should keep ENST. I figured my best lane was SWINGY and that I only needed one vowel, but ENST is still more balanced.
>Rafi: ACEIOOS 7E .OA. +22 182
#note Oh I missed a really sick play in the same spot (COHEIR), although with such a strong leave after HOAR it's not necessarily better. I can't necessarily infer the S after exch. 2 since both blanks are unseen and there's only one S left, so leaving my S hook open with a good leave may be important if Jesse bingoes elsewhere. ORA seems pretty much equivalent to HOAR.
>JD: CDENSTT 4G T.NCTED +24 112
>Rafi: CEIIORS M2 IO.IC +16 198
#note Considered ODIC and OI as well. The pool is almost half vowels at this point, and both blanks are unseen, so I valued ERS + 2 points as stronger than IERS. However, I missed LOCI which is 2 points more than IODIC! CEIRS also looked a little worse than usual with a vowel heavy pool, and as I mentioned I wanted turnover for blanks.
>JD: AADENSU H12 .AUD +15 127
#note the pool is pretty consonant-heavy, should just play ELK and then profit from leaving SWINGY open.
>Rafi: EGRRSTX -GRX +0 198
#note So much for a vowel heavy pool. I guess I could have played through here, but the X didn't seem at all useful on this board and I want to bingo as quickly as possible and root out those blanks! I could also play the X for 18, but with a lead I don't want to be so volatile (especially with Jesse close to bingoing, as he might block my best spot). Quackle likes G(A)R/R(A)G. Not sure I buy it.
>JD: AEEIKNS D4 KEA +19 146
#note the pool is pretty consonant-heavy, should just play ELK and then profit from leaving SWINGY open.
>Rafi: EFOQRST 2L Q. +11 209
#note I bingo enough after QI to make it better than QIS or exchange FQ.
>JD: EINPRSX 2B PREX +35 181
#note I was starting to get rafi in some time trouble here and didn't stop to consider just fishing the X since the two blanks are in the bag...but I bingo 84% of the time next turn after fishing the X which makes it worth playing short, and the bingos are often worth 80+ points.
>Rafi: EFGORST G10 GO.F +21 230
#note Quackle prefers (M)OG... I bingo less but maybe when I bingo I score way more?
>JD: ILMNNOS N1 ISM +38 219
#note it didn't occur to me here to play IMINO at 5K, which gives him a ton of free points but also leads to me bingoing 42% of the time next turn instead of sub-20% after ISM.
>Rafi: ?EORRST O3 SORTERs +76 306
#note I think I played this because I didn't want to leave an open R after RESORTED/RESTORED. Not necessarily the best reasoning, as I am taking out a hanging D, and SORTERS also opens a new lane.
>JD: AEILNNO J6 .OLANINE +60 279
>Rafi: ?DEHINT 2G H.D +17 323
#note This play seemed to have the best balance between scoring and leave, which is why I played it. I was pretty sure that EINT? hits a lot of bingos that start with a vowel as well, giving me flexibility to hit column N. My mistake was that HIT and other similar plays overlapping SOLANINE block a big Z threat, as well as the added bonus of scoring 6 more points.
>JD: EEEIRTZ 3A ZEE +32 311
>Rafi: ?EGIINT A3 .INGIEsT +104 427
#note Lucky. I definitely got the upper hand tiles-wise in the second half.
>JD: AAEIRTU 1A RAIA +26 337
#note my best endgame
>Rafi: BDOOT K9 BOD +24 451
>JD: ETU 14B UTE +15 352
#note like every game with rafi, this was a tough strategic contest. at least I came back from my early deficit to give myself a chance. Many interesting small errors along the way (wrong spot for JABS, keeping CENST instead of ENST, not fishing the X etcetera)
>JD:  (OT) +4 356
