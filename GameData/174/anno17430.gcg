>dacrON: BEIOPTU 8D BOITE +20 20
#note Blatant mistake here - 8D BUTEO is better. Over the board I wasn't happy placing the E there, but seriously, seriously?
>Cecilia_Le: OUZ E8 .UZO +26 26
>dacrON: ?AEOPTU G6 AU.OTyPE +62 82
>Cecilia_Le: AALMORS H1 AMORAL +29 55
#note We both came up with (P)ALOMARS* here! This is a nice option - I'd compare it along with H12 ALMA.
>dacrON: EEGHPSX I1 HEX +47 129
#note I didn't like all the scoring this opened, but it felt like a better play than HEX at H13. As it turns out, the other spot was better in this specific instance, but I'm still not sure which play is right. If nothing else, I still have the S for the big hook, as well as PEG next turn at G1. This also blocks some lanes, and if I can get PEG down, really cripples half of the board. I think it is better, but not 100% sure.

#note Right decision, but HAVING would've worked out better as it turns out.
>Cecilia_Le: EKLNR 8J L.NKER +33 204
>dacrON: AAAENST 12C AA +10 264
#note L4 sims a hair better. I get really nervous in these situations, where I just needto bingo to win, and canget caught fishing if not. Very anxiety inducing.
>Cecilia_Le: EORRU 12G .OURER +22 226
>dacrON: AADENST 14E ANSATED +85 349
#note And sure enough, I drew another unplayable bingo, and was really starting to get nervous. But I caught a game-ending break when Cecilia opened me a spot.

>Cecilia_Le: IIIWW -IIIWW +0 254
>dacrON: ?CELLNW 15A CLoWN +45 420
#note Dead even with W(AL)L. I just liked taking the easy points and taking the easy scoring spot, especially as Cecilia just threw some nasty tiles back.
>Cecilia_Le: ETV B10 ET +10 264
>dacrON: CEILMRY D4 CLIM. +22 442
#note Saw YLEM, but didnt think to look as far over as J column! As it turns out, Cecilia had bingoes in either spot. Even so, it's probably best to take out column O.
>Cecilia_Le: DEIINOT O8 .ETINOID +80 344
>dacrON: EFGNRVY F4 VEG +19 461
#note Blocks both outs and saves the Y for scoring.

>dacrON: FNRY J11 F.Y.R +11 472
>Cecilia_Le: EW C9 WE +12 375
#note 9A (E)WE is one better. Otherwise, a correct endgame by both players.
