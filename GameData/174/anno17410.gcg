#note hahaha, this game is NOT going to be fun to review.  I did not play this blank until the next to last turn in the game.  This inevitably means I missed lots of bingos.  Considering that, it's AMAZING I lost by as little as I did.

Really, I couldn't find UNIONISE/UNIONIZE?

#note Well, I probably would have been unsure about TANNISH, XANTHIN, AND INHALANT (even though I probably wouldn't have challenged any of them).  I guess this isn't AS bad as OURIE was, but this is still bad.

#note Okay, there's nothing wrong with me missing NAINSOOK and MAKIMONO.  I'm sure lots of 1800 experts would miss those.  But why on earth did I play this instead of KINO, which gives me a much better leave and much better scoring defense?  Because I didn't see KINO, I guess...  I think that's also the one of the three IKNO fours that I keep missing (I want it to be some other word starting with K, and that tends to vary).  Sensing a theme here?  Having said that, considering the value of the blank and considering none of those bingos scored much, THINK plays might be ALMOST as good here.

#note Bad luck or bad fish?  JETE would have scored more and prevented him from bingoing, but the problem is that it wouldn't be very difficult for him to shut down both the JETES line and the row 14 line in one fell swoop and that would greatly decrease the probability of me bingoing...  Was JEE a risk I had to take or did I just need to be more patient with JETE?  I did consider JETE but can't bring myself to want to play defense from behind...

#note To my credit, I INSTANTLY saw BELADIED upon reviewing the game (before entering it into the Kibitzer).  Why did I miss it then, and not merely that but OBELISED, DECIBELS, etc...?  Even this fish sucks.  Was I just in awe and initimidated about playing a champion for the first time, the way some people get about Nigel?  I didn't think so but this is clearly one of my worse-played games and I can't BELIEVE I made it this close.  I probably actually should have won...

#note Intermediate garbage.  Me playing at my stereotypical worst and I have way too many games like this.  It's just all the common bingos I missed that puzzle me here...  I could have played the same tiles with BORA but I actually got lucky that I had a spot where I could bingo on the next turn, and BORA would have actually blocked it...

#note This was probably my second-worst played game in the entire tournament yet I lost to a three-time champion who drew a blank and all four esses by 39 points.  How did I not lose this by 200?!  Well, I did draw all four of JQXZ and considering Joe only bingoed twice, it's hard to build that massive a lead I guess...

I really don't know what to say about this except "Look harder"...
