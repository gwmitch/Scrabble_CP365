>Sean_Wrona: AAINNOT 8H AIN +6 6
#note I really didn't like this as I played it, and for good reason even though I figured I'd draw an E and I did.  This was too reminiscent of the starts to my games in which I lost to Heather Drumm and Ted Rosen, so I feared for the same here.  I need to be willing to blow up my rack for 14 points when it's actually warranted...

>Sean_Wrona: ACEGNOT 9I COAGENT +76 82
#note At least I didn't screw up badly with COGNATE (putting the E in the second spot)!  That's the kind of stuff I do thoughtlessly too often when I KNOW it's wrong.

>Sean_Wrona: ADNOOPR 12L POON +26 137
#note I was not thrilled about giving him an easy bingo spot but he already had one after MOB so this doesn't really change anything, and all my best plays are here.  POOD is obviously the play though.  I keep forgetting that word.

>Sean_Wrona: ADERRUU O11 U.DER +18 155
#note I missed UNDUE.  Quackle says it's 3-4% better in winning percentage.  I still don't like duplication on a closed board, and I think putting an E at O15 is more dangerous than putting an R there, although granted those bingos may be harder for STEEs to find...  I think I like this better.

>Sean_Wrona: AAILRRU 15K AUR.. +6 161
#note I acknowledge ARIL (which I missed) is better, but I'm happy this gambit worked as I guessed that he wouldn't know AURAR after he played VILUM and I was right.  He challenged.

#note This is not the easiest sort of play to find and it's a great setup and really hard to block unless he has an S (or I suppose a bingo through the C, which isn't THAT likely).  I did not remember that PICAL was good though.  I don't know whether I think that makes this better or worse...
>Michael_Ecsedy: FORSU 11E FOURS +25 167
#note But he did...
>Sean_Wrona: EEILNRS 10E EL +13 188
#note Another good setup that's really hard to block.  I suppose these are still too dangerous since I barely have a lead and if he bingos I will almost certainly lose, but I think the probability I bingo is so much higher than the probability he will (especially after he drew five tiles) that this should be fine.  Having said that, this is a pretty obvious setup and I fully expected him to block it.  I was surprised when he played somewhere else...  I'm excited though that I've FINALLY learned to fish with brains.  Anyone who's watched me on ISC can attest that this has been one of the weaker parts of my game...

#note I'm glad I took my time and actually looked here.  Unfortunately, since I wasn't recording my time in the middle of the game, I don't know how long this took.  I do know despite being a common word, this isn't the easiest possible find and I'm glad I was patient here rather than just looking for one minute and fishing...

>Sean_Wrona: DDIIKSX G3 XIS +35 402
#note SICK is lovely and totally shuts the board down.  I'm disappointed I missed that.  I really didn't like playing XIS here because I might be giving up some blank bingos.  Playing the other XIS for the same score would have been better.
