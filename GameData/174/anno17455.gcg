#note 5I ANYON is best statically because ANU isn't that much better than UU to make up the scoring difference, but the sim supports the fact that keeping UU is just too fatal at this juncture, and YOURN gives me the best win % (at about 20%).

#note Mark initially put down ZOO, but decided to pick up the second O because he'd leave himself with 3C1V otherwise. That worked out quite well for me.
