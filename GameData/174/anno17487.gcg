>Kolton: AETUVWZ J7 Z.UAVE +20 20
>Nigelicus: ?ABHITT 12C HaBITAT. +76 92
>Nigelicus: ?ABHITT --  -76 16
#note This seemed a little weird. I knew that I would have seen it somewhere somewhen. (The playable bingos are TITHABLE HITTABLE BATHETIC HABITATS HABITANT)
>Kolton: EINRTTW L2 WRITTEN +82 102
#note Lucky Luck
>Nigelicus: ?ABHITT 10E HABIT.nT +64 80
#note TITHABLE and HITTABLE are worth 80
>Kolton: ?ADERSU 13G DAnSEUR +87 189
#note So many options here.... This one score the most points though, which makes me happy.
>Nigelicus: EGLNOU 14B LOUNGE +25 105
#note He spent a long time on this turn
>Kolton: IIMOPSV 15G VIM +31 220
#note I was all set to play IMP(R)OV setting up my S until he changed the board dynamic.
>Nigelicus: DIY 15A YID +26 131
>Kolton: BINOPSU 8H .....UPS +42 262
#note I thought about this opportunity when I played WRITTEN. (Nigel challenged, because that word really should be hyphen-ated)
>Nigelicus: ACEEGHLLN -  +0 131
>Kolton: BEINOOP E9 P.ONO. +22 284
#note There are several plays that score better here, but with a big lead, a play like this shuts down the bottom left pretty admirably.
>Nigelicus: CGHNX -XCHNG +0 131
>Kolton: BEGIORR 12A BORI.G +24 308
#note Didn't even consider BE(W)IG here. I probably shoulve have.
>Nigelicus: IQ K4 QI +37 168
>Kolton: AEEINRS N6 NA.ERIES +72 380
#note I always want AERINESS* to be a word. It took me a while to come up with this (the only playable bingo)
>Nigelicus: AEF 11H FA.E +29 197
>Kolton: ADFJKMO D8 JO +21 401
#note After an exchange, a 2 tile play, and a 3 tile play, I figured his rack was probably pretty handsomely groomed at this point so I wanted to take out some more lanes. (also, there are no good leaves here regardless of what I do)
>Nigelicus: ACCEINY O1 CICANEY. +105 302
>Nigelicus: ACCEINY --  -105 197
#note Getting pretty desperate here. I had never seen it, and I figured, if this is good, you deserve another turn anyways for getting it down.
>Kolton: ADEFKMO O4 FOAM. +20 421
#note I actually have 12L ME(E)K written down here (it sims best and is in fact the only play with a positive valuation) but I might as well keep shutting down the hotspots.
>Nigelicus: ACCEINY 5J C..Y +9 206
#note During his turn here, I kept thinking 'I bet he plays C(IT)Y and fishes for an ING bingo in the H column'
>Kolton: ADEEKNT 7F KEA +11 432
#note Every duck is entitled to it's opinion. Quackle hates this play. I think it is best because now he has to find a bingo ending in B,O,W, or through K
>Nigelicus: ACEILN 2J LA. +8 214
#note I don't know his 7th letter here, but maybe something like IC(K) would work? This isn't a bad play either
>Kolton: DDENSTT 1I DEN +8 440
#note I asked Championship Player (who I always think is Dave Wiegand in my mind and I'm not sure why) and he said exchange DNTT is best. Dave, you so crazzzzy.
>Nigelicus: CEILNOR F1 CORNLI.E +68 282
>Nigelicus: CEILNOR --  -68 214
#note I really had no idea if this was a word or not. Lucky challenge.
>Kolton: DEESTTX L12 D.E +8 448
#note Holy crap the X fits perfectly at M7 and I completely whiffed on it. I was trying to set up TEXT or SEXT for next turn, completely spacing on the L hook.
>Nigelicus: CEILNOR 15K CLONE +30 244
#note CLONI(CITY) is fantasticity
>Kolton: AEISTTX 3D TAXITES +69 517
