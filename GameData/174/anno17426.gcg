#note tricky play, AD at H3 sims well too. didn't want to set up an S hook especially but no alternatives are great.

#note played too fast again, something that happened a few times this weekend. GLOB is not that far off because it gets rid of GO but BLIGHT or BLAH should be better.

>JD: AEEHIKT O1 .HAKE +17 263
#note tricky decision - quackle says I'm 97% to win, but to me the scariest lane by far was the S on column O, so I figured I'd block it now while I could. A cute option is EH at 2N to leave me with a fish for SHIITAKE (didn't think of it) but I didn't want to create the long term potential for a huge SH- bingo that he could fish for.

#note my second time whiffing on an extension this game as I miss SHAKEOUT which is a lot better than TORI.

>JD: ALNSUVZ E9 .VULA +16 379
#note whiffed on the N hook to SHAKEN, doesn't really change my win percentage but I do cut his bingo percentage a little bit.

>JD: EINRSTZ D6 Z. +11 390
#note far and away my best play

#note nice find...

#note rather than blow the game on AFFIANCES (which I was pretty sure was good, but not 100%) figured I'd take the sure win.
