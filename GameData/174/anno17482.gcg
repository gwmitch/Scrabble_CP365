>Kolton: AAGIPTW 8D WATAP +28 28
#note There were 3 of us at 5-2. Rafi and I were playing for first (we each had spreads over 500) and Chris Williams' spread was like +20. 
>Rafi_Stern: ?EORSST 9C SORiTES +74 74
#note Lots of bingos with the P score 80, but Rafi wanted to play this one a little tighter.
>Kolton: BGIRSTV 10B VIG +24 52
>Rafi_Stern: AEFM 7G FAME +31 105
>Kolton: BEEORST 6H ROBE +32 84
#note Do you keep the R here and just play OBE? They simulate identically.
>Rafi_Stern: EFR 5K FER +22 127
#note He said later that he wished he would've kept the R here
>Kolton: BEEISTU N2 TUBE +19 103
#note I4 BI(OM)E(S) is legit!
>Rafi_Stern: ADDGN L1 DANG.D +30 157
>Kolton: EIINQSW O1 QI +35 138
>Rafi_Stern: EJOSTU 1F JOUSTE. +45 202
>Kolton: ?EINOSW O5 SNOWIEr +85 223
#note 2B WIgEONS scores 2 more
>Rafi_Stern: ENO 2E EON +18 220
>Kolton: DHIILRU 5D LURID +20 243
#note Not much else here. I wanted to keep the H for the 10N hotspot.
>Rafi_Stern: AENTY N10 YENTA +46 266
#note Unless he takes it first
>Kolton: CHILPRX M7 CHIRP +26 269
#note O14 XI wins the sim, but I hate 5 consenant leaves.
>Rafi_Stern: AGIV 4A VIGA +28 294
>Kolton: IKLLOOX O13 OXO +41 310
>Rafi_Stern: AEMU A1 MAU.E +30 324
>Kolton: AEIKLLY L11 ALKYL +31 341
#note My choices were this or ALLEY in the same spot. This was risky because if he has ZORI(L), I pretty much lose the game. Championship Player likes 3F YELK best (which I didn't even see)
>Rafi_Stern: DILNNRZ C2 ZI. +26 350
#note This might have been his rack. A nice setup for ADZ.
>Kolton: ACEEHII K9 HIC +32 373
#note I have 4 options written down for this play. K10 ICE 28 leaving AEHI. E7 E(AR)ACHE 32 leaving II. K9 HIC 32 leaving AEII. 15H CHIE(L) 30 leaving AEI. 

If I play EARACHE, I lose. He needs vowels. ADZ is unblockable so I'm already filling in 26 for him next turn. I'm not going to type all of my thoughts here, there was too much to think about. But I decided to take the highest scoring play because I knew I could outrun him since neither of us could go out in 2 or even 3 turns.
>Rafi_Stern: DLNNORT 2A .D. +26 376
>Kolton: AEEI 13L .E.. +16 389
>Rafi_Stern: LNNORT 3F TON +18 394
#note Championship player says TROL(L) is 100% to win... I can't score more than 10 next turn and B4 (I)NN is unblockable. SORRY RAFI!
>Kolton: AEI 8M .A. +9 398
#note I saw his best play of DRAPER was worth 9, so as long as I score at least 5 and have an out next turn I'll win.
>Rafi_Stern: LNR H5 .....R +9 403
>Kolton: EI B10 .IE +6 404
#note Winning by 5 points in the last game was awesome. An epic battle!
