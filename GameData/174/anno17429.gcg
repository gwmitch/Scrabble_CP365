#note Quackle wants me to hold back the CH and just play in for 8. Fascinating for sure, but is it worth risking the two consonant draws?

#note Loss of confidence here. I was pretty sure I1 VEX for 7 less was the play here, but I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger (this does set up EX for next turn, or leaves VEX for a big block. Confidence, man, this isn't rocket science!

#note I looked for a 1K play, but managed to miss LEAVE. Note how I later miss DEAVE in a different game. Yikes - this is a bad miss, but I get handsomely rewarded as it turns out.

#note I didn't see anything very good here, so went with this. 4D FADEO(UT)S may still be better, though.

#note I didn't like this that much, but it was so much better than O(UT)SAW, and I thouht there was a ??TSAW word. It's PITSAW.

#note I can slot an A S or T. I noted the A gave the possibility of GR(A)DUATE, and the S gave the possibility of (S)UBGRADE. The T offers nothing, and the only playable bingo thru the I, V(I)BRATED, seems very unlikely after NU - whih suggested Paula had the G (she did).
>Paula_Catanese: ADEGRTV A3 VA.TED +33 291
#note TARD(i)VE is 3 btter. Paula didn't think this was a word, but I liked it. It is good. VAT is a verb, VATTER* VATLIKE* and VATFUL!
>dacrON: BU C3 BU. +10 535
#note Oh no! I missed (C)UB. That is awful. I need to stop having  no time left for my outplays.
