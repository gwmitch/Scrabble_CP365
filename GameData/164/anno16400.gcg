#note Odette's starting to play fast and attempting to close the board by the looks of it. I'm starting to get a bit frustrated and play what I though was a cool move at the time perhaps a bit too quickly, overlooking the much better double-double.

#note Play too quickly, almost out of frustration, hoping she doesn't notice - she thinks about it for a bit and looks it up - good game.

#note I figured my only chance at this stage was to pick up the X and make some sort of a set up play with the E at e10 which just might go unnoticed if she was playing fast enough. This plan went out the window after this move.
