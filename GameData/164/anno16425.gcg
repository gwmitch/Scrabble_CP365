>Dean: DENOZ 8D ZONED +50 50
>James: CEEOTTU H4 OUTE. +7 7
#note The computer prefers UTE 9F slightly, which I counsidered but I didn't like because of the potential of a 10F paraellel play underneath, which would make the board more closed and the game harder to play with a deficit of at least 60 points. Dean's a very good defensive player so I didn't favor it at all. An exchange was not what something I favored either for identical reasons. 

Q also favors CENTU F6 which is 8 more points and probably worth it, but I liked the openness of OUTED in my position.

If this was only ODS, ECOUTENT F2 or DOUCETTE H8. :( 
>Dean: IW 6F WI. +14 64
>James: CEEENOT I3 CETE +20 27
#note ZEE D8 looks a lot better now. I'm really bad with these hands. COOEE E7 also looks preferable. 
>Dean: HU 9F UH +20 84
>James: AEIMNOP D8 .ONAE +28 55
#note Lots of interesting plays here - ZONAE, CAMPION 3I, IPOMOEA 4D (which I missed), and CAMPO/CAMPI 3I. I think I liked ZONAE for some weird reason, like it set up IMP 11E at the least. I like CAMPO, though Q likes the 4 further points. 
>Dean: AIT E10 AIT +14 98
>James: AEIIMPT 3I .AMPI +22 77
#note Interesting - aside from CAMPI, PI C12 13 is also up there. I'm not sure why, since the board has no good spots to play if I don't try to play outwards. Hence why I played CAMPI. 
>Dean: GI K3 .IG +12 110
>James: EEEEIST 5K .EE +4 81
#note This is just a weird game. I have 8 Es, and Dean's played one. Exchanges of EEI/EEE/EEEI are all suggested as well, though I just wanted to open up another spot. 
>Dean: AY C9 YA +21 131
>James: EEEILST J6 STEELIE +71 152
>Dean: HIT K9 HIT +23 154
>James: AEGKMOU B10 KA +34 186
#note I really didn't want to play KAGU because I was sure Dean was going to bingo sometime soon, and my letters aren't too bad to try to find an A11 play further. The two together should keep me in the game if a bingo comes down, whereas a bingo off 14B is a lot harder to come back from. Q very much preffers KAGU, then KEG B10, though since Es are already an endangered species I thought to hold off. 
>Dean: BDILU A11 BUILD +31 185
>James: EFGMOUV C12 VUM +22 208
#note This game is so bizarre. 
>Dean: IPRST 8J .SPRIT +40 225
#note Wow, I wonder what the others were at this point... I think one was an R and maybe the other was N? What a ridiculous game. 
>James: ?EFGIJO 5E JO +23 231
>Dean: ELSVX N7 S.LVEX +24 249
#note I know that Dean's hand here was ridiculous, but I forget what the other letters were. Again, I think it had an R and an F? Dean later said that he was worried about giving me good scores back with the other letters, and thought this was quite safe overall since I needed the case I to play off O11. All other plays off M11 would give him playback. Not a bad set of reasons...
>James: ?EFGIRY O11 FIERY +51 282
#note I couldn't believe he blocked both REFRYING and GENTRIFY! There's nothing else to do with this hand that's comparable, but I still died a little inside playing my case E and I. GRIEF 13I also sims very highly, which I can see because I have the blank and the Y is not bad at all. It also takes out Dean's best playces for counterplay while I have a very good setup with playing NiXY next turn for 42, which he can only really counter with BOX/FOX or OXO in that area, the former of which my Y really plays well into. I considered GRIEF but thought 21 more points was too much to throw away at this point in time. 
>Dean: FNORW 13I FROWN +38 287
#note As it so turns out, GRIEF would likely have worked out well, as FOX 12L 38 would be countered by Y- something for at least 51. 
>James: ?BDGLNR M2 G.B.D +9 291
#note No real clue what to do here - GIBED plays off the most consonants, which I thought was worth it if I drew something to the Y on the bottom. I completely missed the cute NG play to CAMPI, which Q favors the most, but it then likes GIBER M2 (makes sense with the Rs left), GIBED and for some reason LIBER M2 (not seeing why, personally... the NG is not really that useful, is it?). CAMPING also has the advantage of setting up Qi 2M 37 if I need it, which makes it Qs runaway favorite (the other plays are about tied). 
>Dean: ?AQ 15L QuA. +25 312
#note Well, this was the other problem I guess. If Dean has the Q?, my odds of winning go down a lot. 
>James: ?ALNNRR F2 ARR.. +10 301
#note This sim is not making any sense to me. I have NO idea how I win after AIR 11D, which Q favors a lot, as well as AR G3 (which I thought was a little too easy for Dean to block). The only thing about NARROW is, the N has to be in the bag. I'm not sure if I have to definitely avoid drawing it because Dean's response is not likely to be taking any points if he doesn't have it. AR G3 is also a possibility (and Q's second favorite), though I thought that was a little too easy to block. I also needed some points to put mei n contention. 
>Dean: ACDGOOR 2E D.GO +6 318
#note This is a really hard hand. DAGO loses to so many permutations on my hand I think, but ORCA actually sets Dean up really well, I think. The logic goes like this:

- given I have NN 
- assumed I have ? (or I wouldn't have even tried most likely)
- need to have S in order to win (as otherwise I can't bingo out and he can probably use the S to parlay enough points to win out) 

so then he can draw one of ALNO. He does not want to draw L, as I would have NONFANS. Otherwise, he threatens DAGO 1A regardless of what I do if I play at 1F and he has DONGA F11 in addition if he draws the N. 

Draw the O or A, and I have too few vowels to go anywhere. As it is, he plays DAGO, because that's not a bad play as it requires me to work at the ending. DAG 2D may be a little smarter, because it doesn't give me so many easy ways to play back, but then he has to play his endgame perfectly in less than 10 seconds, and the endgame is at least 2 moves more for him. 
>James: ?ALNNOS 1D NONAS +39 340
#note So then I luck out into the ending, and go gentle into that good night. Hooray. 

Absolutely weird game though.
