#note Quackle wants to trade down to AERT or AEIRT instead; Elise prefers playing through with YETI 8G. Not sure who's right here.
>Trip: OOOOO -OOOOO +0 0
#note 3-ply winprob simulation (80), -26.56 / 45.2%
>Mike: AEINRTU 8B URANITE +66 66
#note As far as I can recall, this is the only time I've played the same bingo twice in a tournament day. As for where to put it, I'm in favor of cutting off access to a TWS whenever reasonable.

>Trip: DGHOU F10 DOUGH +31 159
>Mike: AGIRTVZ M9 VIZ.R +42 272
#note Each of the next four choices would have been different if I'd known that DOUGH takes a T hook. TZAR 15F is best.

#note TEFF 15F.

#note TOWAGE 15F, though I'm less sure that this is right than I am about the previous two plays.
>Trip: NO 10H .ON +8 223
>Mike: DEEEOTV K4 DEVOTEE +79 419
#note And the last of the missed-hook plays is the biggest one.

#note I'm not seeing why burning the S with AYES/EYAS/YEAS in this spot is better.
