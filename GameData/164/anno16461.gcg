#note Is the point sacrifice worth putting a less dangerous letter in the triple lane? Both sims suggest the 5H placement is a marginal improvement.

#note Or at K3.

>Mike: ADEFITW H1 WAFTED +49 230
#note WAIFED never looks right.
>Ron: BIRU -  +0 178
#note Attempted KUBRI*, challenged off.
>Mike: AEGIINV M1 VIGIA +24 254
#note Given the known information, Quackle prefers REIVING 12G, which I don't get at all. Elise wants to make him come up with something else by playing KIANG 15D, which makes a bit more sense.

>Mike: EELNNPZ 2F ZE.L +33 287
#note SPLEEN M8 is preferred by the sims. Not entirely sure I agree; the Z isn't incredibly useful on this board, so it may be worth taking the points now.
>Ron: EIMO 1K MO.IE +33 244
>Mike: EIIJNNP D3 NIP +24 311
#note JINNI D5 looks like an improvement.
>Ron: TY 12F T.Y +24 268
>Mike: EGIJLNN C1 JIG +30 341
#note NEG in this spot threatens JINN next turn. (turns to Elise, speaks in a dramatic voice) Clever girl...
>Ron: EE 1C .EE +11 279
>Mike: AEILNNR J3 INLAN.ER +63 404
#note The highest-scoring play here is amazing, and in any other situation but a must-win game in a tournament, I'd play it if I saw it. (I didn't.)
>Ron: ER 2A RE. +6 285
>Mike: ?AHLLST A1 T.ASH +27 431
#note Even if I had been 100% on SHALLoTS M8 (I wasn't), it's the wrong play, so I'm not counting it as a missed bingo. (Even after going up by 179, PROCAINE or PROFANES still beats me.)
>Ron: CEFINPS B5 EPIC +19 304
>Mike: ?ALLOX 2K AX.s +35 466
#note OXId is a point better.
