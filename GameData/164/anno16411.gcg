>Jim_Burlant: ADRRSTT 8G DART +10 10
#note I'm a little surprised by the sim result.  Even though I'm sitting on an S, I'm supposed to not risk the 2x2 hook by playing DRAT 8F for the same points this scores.  Seriously? 
>Darrell_Day: AANO 7G ANOA +17 17
>Jim_Burlant: EGIRSTV K1 GRIVETS +77 87
#note I don't have any bingoes that don't slot the 3x3 (this also plays at 6A, 6I, and 9A), so I have to maximize my points.  Quackle agrees - this is best.
>Darrell_Day: ILMOW 2I WO.MIL +26 43
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAIKNS 1G KIAN. +37 124
#note The 7's in this rack are KALIANS, KINARAS, and BANKSIA.  I didn't know KALIANS or BANKSIA, and I didn't see KINARAS. That said, I did see AKINESIA 3E 72.  So why didn't I play it?  I've seen enough sims to know that Quackle thinks AS? is worth more than 40 points  (AKINESIA only outscores KIANG by 35 points), so AKINESIA comes up a bit short score-wise.  Secondly, the board position with AKINESIA leaves a lot to be desired.   Not only does it give up the M3 S hook back, but it also makes it even easier than it already is for him to hit row 1; where he already can place an A or O at 1I, if I play AKINESIA he'll now be able to place an E there as well.  I took a LONG time on this turn weighing all this before I decided to play KIANG.  Quackle agrees with me:  if you don't know bANKSIA, this is the best remaining option you have.  BANKSIA 1C was definitely best; this is second best, still winning 91%, simming 9 points down on bANKSIA.  For reference:  AKINESIA wins 1-1/2% less often than this and sims 8-1/2 points down on this.  And KINARIAS/KALIANS 6A sim 4 or 5 points down on AKINESIA and win 5% less often than this does.

>Jim_Burlant: ?ADPQSU 8A QUADS +53 177
#note I saw this, saw 53 points and figured this was the no-brainer choice.  As for quackle, the sim and chamnpionship player are conflicted.  Championship Player says this is the best play, winning just shy of 91%.  The sim winner (my choice is second in the sim, 4 or 5 points down) seems reckless at first, but upon further inspection, has a lot of merit:  it wants me to play  10B QUAD 37 to set up my S down the A column.  While the initial inclination is that setting up the S hook would be reckless with Darrell probably 50% or so to have an S, there's already a juicy S hook open down the O column, so QUAD doesn't open up anything that isn't already there to some degree.  And, sitting on PS?, the right draw could guarantee 90+ on my next turn.  All that said, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this choice.
>Darrell_Day: EF 10F FE +40 132
#note Ouch!  Then again, if I play QUAD, what does Darrell do with this?
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEINOP 3C EPIgONE +77 254
#note Any number of bingoes available; the two best choices are 3C PErEION and this.  This is marginally better due to vowel placement.  95.4% to win.
>Darrell_Day: EJU D1 JU.E +42 174
>Jim_Burlant: BEEFTTU 11C BEEF +27 281
#note Given that there were only 4 E's unseen and the bag was down to 41 tiles, I was not thrilled about playing both my E's and keeping TTU.  But Quackle confirms:  none of my other options scores more than 22, and I don't have a good rack balancer/cleaner available.  So I'm going to have to take the points.  This is the one decent scoring option available and the rest of my choices are mediocre.  If you don't mind sacrificing points for a feeble attempt at rack grooming, other reasonable, but not great, choices are 11C BUTT,  1M BET to take out potential X plays, and 11C TUFT. 90% to win.
>Darrell_Day: DHINS 12B HINDS +39 213
#note Play incorrectly scored as 37.
>Jim_Burlant: DIMTTUU 4G MUD +22 303
#note Tile drawing failure.  As you can see, my best options on my previous turn forced me to have to keep a U...and with AAAEEEOOO unseen, I draw the lone U in the bag?  Seriously?  Anyway, I can't take out O1, but I *can* kill bingoes on row 5, clear out one of my U's, and score in the low 20's.  Again, the 2-ply sim and Championship Player mildly disagree.  Championship Player says this choice is best.  The sim says that I should get cute by playing TUTU 9J for cheap to unload the U's and give myself an easy play with the M at M8 on the next turn. Given that these are my two best choices, I'd make this play again.  87% to win.
>Darrell_Day: BIR 13A RIB +29 242
>Jim_Burlant: EITTUVY 9J TIVY +17 320
#note No great options.  I considered M1 TIVY or this.  I ultimately rejected M1 TIVY because if, for argument's sake, his intended play was AX 1N, all I do is give him 3 more points for it while I've left myself with way too many vowels.  If I'm going to be stuck with the U, the least I can do is eliminate as much of the vowel overload as I can.  Hence, this.  The sim is conflicted, saying this wins hair more often than 1M TIVY, though 1M TIVY has higher valuation.  Championship Player has no such qualms, and says this is clearly best, with M1 TIVY winning 2% less often sind evaluating 3 points down.

>Jim_Burlant: ?AERSUW A13 .AW +18 338
#note No bingoes play. An AW dump is the play, but where?  The sim says I should play at 4K with VAW for identical points and says this is a 5-point dog.  Championship Player is much kinder, saying that it's stylistic preference between this or 4K VAW.   At the time I didn't think the W would give up a whole bunch while, in the meantime, I was sitting on ERSU?.

>Jim_Burlant: ?AERSTU 14C bURSATE +65 403
#note Missing the much better WAFTURES or WATERBUS 15A for 83; I looked from the W but didn't know WATERBUS and never saw WAFTURES.  Championship Player and the sim are conflicted.  The sim says VATU L9 is best.  Can someone explain why, with 14 in the bag, I should pass up the bingo? If I had it to do again, WAFTURES would have been my play.
