#note Or FAVE. I prefer holding the A for ZA, though.
>Pamina: OX 4C OX +41 147
>Mike: AEMNPSV 13C PAM +29 118
#note VAMP B1 is a pretty clear improvement on this.
>Pamina: GIR 14B RIG +25 172
>Mike: EFINSVY 15A FENS +46 164
#note Elise agrees with me, while Quackle prefers VERIFY J6. I think I'm going to prefer Elise's analysis here; if Pamina gets this spot first, I could be in big trouble.
>Pamina: IQ 9C QI +23 195
>Mike: EEIRVYY G2 EVERY +36 200
#note Forgot about the hook. While Quackle thinks this is best, Elise rightly prefers VEERY in this spot. (At least I think it's right. I'm willing to be persuaded, though.)
>Pamina: KNR I7 K.RN +13 208
>Mike: EEEIJWY J6 WI.E +23 223
#note Elise prefers JEE 2F to take out the hook, but I think I'll side with Quackle on this one.
>Pamina: ENORSTT -  +0 208
#note Attempted TORTENS* 1E, challenged off.
>Mike: AEEJOOY -AEJOOY +0 223
#note Hm. Does my opponent see STENTOR here? If she does, there's really not a whole lot I can do about it, as it plays in three spots. Hence, it's probably worth playing through and taking points with AJEE 2E. I'm curious what other people think, as I typically find these positions really difficult to analyze.
>Pamina: ENORSTT 1G ROTTEN +33 241
>Mike: CCEILLM B2 MIC +26 249
#note MELIC is the play I was looking for and couldn't find. Elise wants it at K9; Quackle, at 11H. (I'd also forgotten about KERNE.)
>Pamina: AAH A1 AAH +27 268
>Mike: BCELLOO K3 BOLO +17 266
#note Both sims prefer COBLE K9 to this, albeit by different amounts. LOCO in this spot is also worth considering.
>Pamina: AW L3 AW +24 292
>Mike: ?ACELNR M3 gLANCER +88 354
>Pamina: AJOS 11I SOJA +30 322
>Mike: ADLOPTT 8L P.LT +27 381
#note Sims prefer either DOAT or DOTAL at 12J. Upon looking closer at the pool, I guess that is the more dangerous hotspot.
>Pamina: DGGOY 12J DOGGY +40 362
>Mike: ADEEIOT 13K TAO +26 407
#note TOYED N10? Why empty the bag here? What does this accomplish that my play doesn't? I don't get this one at all. (Granted, we're talking about the difference between being 94% to win and 96%, but that still matters.)
>Pamina: DEI 10B DIE +22 384
>Mike: DEEEINU O4 DUNI.E +9 416
#note UNITED is two points better.
>Pamina: EIOSU 11A OES +18 402
>Mike: EE 3G .EE +7 423
#note LEE N8 is one better...which explains why UNITED was better!
>Mike:  (IU) +4 427
