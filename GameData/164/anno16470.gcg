#note With Rafi Gibsonized, this game is for second, straight up. Though there's no guarantee I stay in the money if I win.

#note Didn't consider FUN E7, which wins both sims.

#note Elise wants me to burn the blank, but I'm not doing it. Quackle recommends trading down to LY?, which has merit.

#note It's not often you make two negative plays (which I define as a phony, a blown challenge, an accepted phony, or a missed bingo) at once! UNANELEd is the play.

#note Elise is suggesting VOLES 2J, but I'm not that desperate to clog things up quite yet.

#note EASE 11D and ASEA M2 are plausible, but I think I can afford to exchange here.

#note Spread still matters here, as I'm only 27 points ahead of Kolton and 83 ahead of Doug, who are playing on the next table. To guard against having second sniped from me by one of them blowing the other out, I need to maximize here. (Kolton would wind up winning by 53.)

#note Attempled SAR N13. What can I say--I was tired. Of my fourteen "negative plays" this tournament, seven happened in my five on-camera games; I went 1-4 in those games, and 13-2 otherwise. Given that I was plenty comfortable on camera last year, I believe this is just a fluke--correlation does not imply causation!
>Michael: AOO F14 .O +9 331
>Mike: AIRS 1H RIAS +18 465
#note And so I manage to hold on for second. Overall, I played decently, but not well enough to win the tournament. Still, first and second in back-to-back years is pretty good.
