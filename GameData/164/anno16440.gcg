#note Both sims prefer VOE 9F instead. I can see why they say so, but 3-4% seems like an overestimation of how much better it is.
>Leah: MY 10F MY +36 92
>Mike: AENORTX 11D AXE +25 94
#note Quackle prefers OVERTAX; Elise prefers VORTEX. I don't like where either of those places the X, though. I actually kinda like just dropping the X at D8, though it's not clear where my bingo will go unless I draw an S. Tough position.

#note I'm not seeing why ROTL 13C is better than this. Anyone?

#note Quackle favors my play, but Elise strongly prefers ARE or ORE at K13. Not sure what to make of that.
>Leah: II -II +0 259
#note 3-ply winprob simulation (80), -50.95 / 26.9%
>Mike: AEFNORZ 14B ZOEA +39 288
#note FOE in this spot wins the sims. Gotta say I'm not understanding that one.
>Leah: ENR F9 ...N.ER +28 287
>Mike: DEFINPR 15E D.IP +25 313
#note Maybe PRIDE instead? I don't want to run into all of those Ts in the pool, though.
>Leah: HMOU E5 HUMO. +20 307
>Mike: AEFGNPR F3 FRAP +30 343
#note Quackle prefers AGAPE K11; Elise prefers RAPE F4. Not sure I like either of those choices; granted, a bingo is unlikely, but I'd rather block all the lines and take the 40-point lead.
>Leah: DITT H4 DITT. +8 315
>Mike: EEGINTT 3D GI.T +9 352
#note What exactly is the scenario where NEIF 3C wins and GIFT loses? This is what I wish Quackle/Elise were capable of spelling out.
>Leah: AO D3 .OA +14 329
>Mike: EEEINST 7B TEE.S +18 370
#note Can't allow plays at K11. TERNE J11 sims best.
