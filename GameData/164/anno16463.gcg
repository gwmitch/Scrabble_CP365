#note Challenged RAGGEDER.
>Mike: ACILOQU D3 QU.LIA +32 188
#note Quackle thinks OCA F9 is best; Elise prefers QUAG F2. I can see the arguments for both, and I'd probably play OCA.

#note Or MON, or any of a number of other reasonable options.
>Lester: CERU H1 CURE. +27 164
>Mike: CNORSTY 1H .ORNY +14 270
#note Sims prefer CYST E9, but I think I want to keep the board more under control.
>Lester: ADX 14A AX.D +31 195
>Mike: BCILNST A12 CL.N +27 297
#note BLAT or TINCAL would be a mild improvement.
>Lester: AF F10 FA +34 229
>Mike: ABEGIST B6 GIB +15 312
#note BEAT B8 is what I was looking for. BRAWEST 3G is pretty. Elise's choice of GIST I11 makes no sense to me.
>Lester: ATV A5 VAT +11 240
>Mike: ADEEOST B6 ...ED +22 334
#note Or ODA B10. Again, Elise suggests playing at I11 with EAST, which I don't understand at all.
>Lester: DHI 3J .HID +22 262
>Mike: AEOORST 7H .O.TOR +16 350
#note Sims prefer fishing with ZOO 15H or LOO 6D rather than trying to inhibit the lane. At least this way his S-hooking bingo can't hit the double (unless he hooks both S's, which is very specific).
>Lester: ?EKNSST N7 SKlENTS +72 334
#note (Misscored as 73.)
>Mike: AEEENOS M11 AEON +16 366
#note This is a good test case for Elise's pre-endgame engine. Quackle suggests that this play or EEK 8L both win 34/36 endgames, while Elise doesn't have AEON winning anywhere near that amount. I have to block VOLITION and give myself a chance to go out. The at-first-glance-seemingly-obvious EKE 8M doesn't actually block VOLITION, but I think for peace-of-mind purposes, I'd rather play EEK to not allow plays at O8.
>Lester: EILNOTV O8 ION +30 364
>Mike: EEINS M3 .INE.S +14 380
#note Quackle suggests INS L10; Elise finds ESNE 15L. Anything reasonable wins, though.
