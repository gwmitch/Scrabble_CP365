#note The kith of death. It isn't an awesome play, though, merely a lucky one. Too easy to spot if you know the word.

#note Overlooking the phony two. Very unawesome.

#note Quackle plays FUN 13M, but at this score, I prefer to eliminate the possibility of FERNINST or some other horror story. @Lipe: Yes, I see Collins bingo.

#note This was a rather respectable play. It unloads the garbage and sets up the J. Golly, that rhymes!

>Carl: ACGIJRV N8 RAVI. +16 505
#note Careful! A HUGE inference can be drawn from Mike's last play! He pretty much had to have held all three Es, an S, and fewer than two Os last turn, or he would have played one or both (probably OOZE 12F). If he had no Os at all (EEENSST), then all three tiles in the bag were Os, and he has drawn SOONEST. If he had one O already (EEEOSxx), then two of the remaining three tiles in the bag were Os, and he has drawn SOONEST 67% of the time. Mike will bingo out at N1 or O7 roughly three times out of four, no other bingos are possible, and RAVIN is the only move that blocks. Sweetening the deal, RAVIN also permits JAG/ JIG 9M/12A, and I can't get stuck with the C.
>Mike_Baron: ENOOOST 4H TON.O +14 307
#note Even though Mike managed to dodge the likely bingo, even though RAVIN sims best even without the inference, even though the position was completely inconsequential because I once again drew like a fiend, this still seemed like a suitably awesome position. How often will emptying the bag for 16, keeping CGJ be correct? So rarely, I trust, that RAVIN takes the #8 spot on Carl Johnson's 2013 Awesome Play Countdown!
