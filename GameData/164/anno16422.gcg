#note GAMODEME! Didn't know it.

#note Best, although REEMIT 5H is a clever setup worth considering.

#note Both sims prefer MET C2, but I don't think leaving the line wide open is wise. (I also had momentarily spaced on TWITTED.)
>Pete: EZ D10 .EZ +24 120
>Mike: ENNPRST C1 PENT +23 133
#note Hm. Elise strongly preferse NETS 11C, while Quackle strongly prefers PEN C9. I can see the merits in both of their choices (as well as my own). Open to suggestions here.

#note 3-ply winprob simulation (1460), +12.44 / 66.3% [56.67s]

#note Sims prefer playing through with OXO 9H. I considered it, but didn't think it was quite worth opening more space.
>Pete: LUU 1H .ULU +4 223
>Mike: AAEHRTX 9H AX +22 282
#note ETH C13 makes sense. Guess if I'm going to exchange last turn to avoid opening up the bottom-right, playing AX doesn't make a ton of sense.
>Pete: BGI 10H GIB +28 251
>Mike: ADEHORT K7 HATED +25 307
#note I was looking for a way to inhibit the LULUS hook and take out column K without giving back another S-hook. ORATED is what I was looking for. As it happens, Pete had the one good rack that cared more about parallel plays than S-hooks...
>Pete: ?AEORTU L2 OUTwEAR +72 323
>Mike: FIINORU M7 OF +19 326
#note Trying to bait Pete into hooking HAOS* seems like my best chance at this point. Elise prefers FIN or FINO at M1, but I don't like the choice of emptying the bag or leaving too many clunky vowels.
>Pete: IKP M1 KIP +28 351
>Mike: AIINRTU 1M .IN +21 347
#note Best, but there's no win.
