>Diane: ABJOT 8D JABOT +44 44
>Josh: EINOPRY 9E YIP +27 27
#note First game of the tourney! I start with a hard rack, where I consider YIP 9E, YO 9G, PONY 9C, and I miss (J)OINERY and 9C YONI. All of those plays seem quite decent.
>Diane: EO 10F OE +16 60
>Josh: EEFGNOR E5 FOR.. +22 49
#note Here I failed to consider FOG/BIOG, but I don't really see why I should play it. I considered 7G REF, but I felt like scoring and defending more with FOR(AY) seemed a good plan after the fishy play I had just witnessed. FOR(T)E also seems like a decent option.
>Diane: III -III +0 60
>Josh: EEEGNOY D1 YOGEE +31 80
#note F2 YOGEE seems like an improvement, although maybe I should set up points for myself.
>Diane: AGIRU 2A GIA.UR +18 78
>Josh: DEINPSS H10 SPINED +33 113
#note Damn, I missed S(I)DESPIN B1! This wasn't the best play, seems 6D S(O)P is better. I guess I got the "first game of a tournament nervosity" this game.
>Diane: EHU 7G HUE +26 104
>Josh: ?AADSTW G12 TAW +17 130
#note Damn, this time I missed 14H (E)ASTWArD. I didn't know its anagram, RADWASTE, which also plays. I wanted to gain board control with this play.
>Diane: EIORU 1F OURIE +17 121
#note That's 3 U's!
>Josh: ?AADELS 1A AL +17 147
#note Alright, I missed 2 more bingos I knew, gELADAS and (E)ScALADE on lane J. I didn't know ScALADE or ALcADES. I wasted so much time here that I just laid this down in annoyance. I knew I had just made a bad play.
>Diane: AUV F13 VAU +22 143
#note Jeez...
>Josh: ?ADEINS 15H .ANDIESt +80 227
#note 3B SI(G)NAlED is beautiful. This really isn't.
>Diane: ?GILOST N8 oLOGIST. +70 213
>Josh: EEIISTV O6 VIE +21 248
#note Hmm, I guess I shouldn't fish and play EVITES here. It's a lot of points.
>Diane: NOOZ 13J ZOON. +28 241
>Josh: AEEIKST 11H .EAK +20 268
#note Any thoughts?
>Diane: HIMW 2J HM +28 269
#note She laid down WHIM 6I and then took it back, as she was rightly scared of J2.
>Josh: AEEFIST F5 FE +20 288
>Diane: ERW 12L WE.R +28 297
>Josh: ACEINST M2 CINEAST +72 360
#note There it is.
>Diane: DM 3L M.D +6 303
>Josh: CLNNQRX 10M C.X +12 372
#note Here we both thought the bag was empty. I played this as if it were an endgame. 
>Diane: ABDIRTT O2 RIB +15 318
#note There is an L missing. I can't know if this wins or not. If I draw it, she has a few wins. 
>Josh: LLNNQR 12B L +0 372
>Diane: ADTT -  +0 318
>Josh: LNNQR B1 ..NN +4 376
#note This loses...
>Diane: ADTT 1N AT +24 342
#note D(RIB) wins. This is phony, but I was only 99,99% sure. 
>Josh: LQR 1A ..L. +9 385
#note I11 (E)L.
>Diane: DT J11 .D. +13 355
>Josh: QR H6 R.. +3 388
>Diane: T 5C T... +10 365
>Diane:  (Q) +20 385
#note Bizarre game.
