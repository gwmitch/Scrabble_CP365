>Mike: CEILMOU 8H OLEUM +20 20
#note Quackle says it's either this or ILEUM; Elise prefers LOCUM instead. It's close enough to not matter, but I think I prefer the defense of this.

>Irene: BOW 6I BOW +20 64
>Mike: EHINOTX M9 X. +34 189
#note Didn't see NIXIE M9, which looks best. Quackle is liking TOXIN 5J for no good reason.
>Irene: JT C7 J.T +19 83
>Mike: AEHINOT 6F HA +28 217
#note Very little to separate this, VAHINE D8 (co-first choice according to Quackle), and NEATH 10B (Elise's choice).

#note BEWEEP 2A is pretty. Wish I'd seen it.
>Irene: IKP 2A KIP +26 198
>Mike: BDELNUY 15B BLUNDE.Y +65 490
#note Thought process here: 1) I actually gave this a nonzero chance of being good (maybe 30%). 2) It's round 1 of an open. (Irene actually said afterwards, when we discovered this was phony, "Well, I'm never challenging you.") 3) There are FOUR S's AND A BLANK unseen. The last good bingo line has gotta go.

>Mike: ?AACGOS 5J COG +28 518
#note Didn't realise this allowed ARRISES. GAS in this spot looks best.
>Irene: AENRRSS F10 SAR. +18 235
>Mike: ?AAIS M1 rAIAS +15 533
#note SAIgA 4K is best.
