#note ACERVATE or PRECAVAE. Didn't know either. This is third.

>New_Player_1: EINNPTW M6 P.WN +10 103
#note I really didn't know what to do this turn. TWIRP and GWINE are the best plays, and I missed both of them. This is low in the top 10 plays, winning 72%.

>New_Player_1: EIINOTU 10D TO.INE +27 130
#note Despite the shit leave, this is best, as I realy want to take out the possibility of a play like DEFI 10H which scores a gazillioin.

#note Q wants me to play GUV over this, but I don't see enough bingo lines available for that to be the right play. I didn't know NUTMEG.

#note Board vision is lacking. EURO, ETUI and FOUR are obviously better plays.
