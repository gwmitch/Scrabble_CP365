>Toh_Weibin: ABKNNSX 8D BANKS +28 28
#note Honestly, this move was just for fun. Out of all the possible extensions, I only saw CANBANKS and thought keeping an N might work. Turns out there's CUTBANKS, EYEBANKS, NONBANKS and SEABANKS. NABK is quite obviously the strongest play here, IMO.
>Tony_Sim: ALNNTVY 9E LAY +27 27
>Toh_Weibin: ABENOOX 10F BEANO +36 64
#note Keeping the X for anything along row 11.

>Tony_Sim: ?EIOSUV --  -80 103
>Toh_Weibin: AEGOOST 12I GOA +20 191
#note Weak move - failed to spot Tony's EVUlSIO(N). This blocks the obvious SOUVENIr - though I was seriously considering leaving it open for an S hook next move.
>Tony_Sim: ?EIOSUV 7H OUtVIES +63 166
>Toh_Weibin: EEIOSTT 8M TOE +13 204
#note Blocking what would be a very nice TEOSI(N)TE. CP suggests I(N)TO or OI(N)T, but those look nowhere close to good plays.
>Tony_Sim: FZ 6D F.Z +35 201
>Toh_Weibin: ADEISTT L9 TI.D +22 226
#note T(OXO)ID would be a great alternative move. I don't know who'd be able to find it though... TIND is alright - somehow CP suggests DINT or DANT. Weird.
>Tony_Sim: LLPU M3 PULL.. +16 217
>Toh_Weibin: ACEIRST 5G RECITA.S +70 296
#note Better than ARTICLES, IMO.
>Tony_Sim: CIMR H1 CRIM. +36 253
>Toh_Weibin: ADEFGLO 2F FO.AGED +24 320
#note Apparently CP says keeping the D is good here, but no thanks. Nothing on earth at this point would make me play the Speedy Player's choice, FOG(S) N2.
>Tony_Sim: AAEIORU 7C EO. +12 265
>Toh_Weibin: HJLNORR N2 JOR. +28 348
#note This is alright I think - he can obviously get some points out of this, but he's going to get points anyway. JOHN B4 is a much better play, though.
>Tony_Sim: AE O1 EA +15 280
>Toh_Weibin: DHLNRRY 4L H..L +26 374
#note This is just me scoring points to offset a possible bingo score. HID 3G is ranked higher on CP, but anything decent that doesn't empty the bag seems to be right.
>Tony_Sim: AEIINUU B6 UNI +9 289
#note Not entirely sure what he had here - but I think he showed me the last tile (blank) after he made his move. Hell, I'm not even sure he played this. After drawing the R, I saw his only possible bingo EqUINIA - wouldn't win him the game, though.
>Toh_Weibin: DENRRRY 13D DERRY +16 390
#note I was thinking that if he did a 1 tile fish, I'd play RENY or DENY B5, and if he played more than 1 tile I'd go with DERRY. Was low on time.
>Tony_Sim: ?AEIU H13 .EA +18 307
>Toh_Weibin: NR 14H .RN +5 395
#note Yes, was low on time.
