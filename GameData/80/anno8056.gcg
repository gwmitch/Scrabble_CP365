>Matt_: ADDISTT 8G TID +8 8
#note Not a lot of great choices here.  DIST > DAST by about a point apparently.
>Bob: BGIO 7F BIGO +19 19
#note Knew this was bad in TWL, but thought it might be good in Collins.  Phony here as well.
>Matt_: ADEGRST 9F GAD +15 23
#note Didn't know RADGEST#, and saw DRAGGIEST after I hit the clock of course.  Didn't want to give the easy I or O hook by playing at 9H.
>Bob: ADDET J5 DATED +22 41
>Matt_: EHLRSTW K2 THREW +33 56
>Bob: ILNO E8 LION +14 55
#note Scored as 14 apparently.
>Matt_: EJKLRSU D10 JUKE +41 97
#note It's close, to burn the S for 12 more on this board.  I like keeping my S's if I can still score big, plus he can't hit a J play in return unless he also has an S/blank.
>Bob: AOY 3J A.OY +20 75
>Matt_: ?CGLMRS 13C G.RM +14 111
#note Looking to draw into a bingo...lots of plays through the E sim close together.
>Bob: AF 2I AF. +27 102
>Matt_: ?CLSSTX M2 X.ST +14 125
#note This actually does pretty well.  Short of QI he can't really hit the X hot spot that hard, and I keep my blank  The duck suggests SeXT or XyST row 1 for 32, but I just have a hard time burning the blank just yet for that little.
>Bob: AILRU H1 URIAL +25 127
>Matt_: ?CEHLST L6 LaTCHES +80 205
#note ELTCHiS# is the CSW-only bingo in this rack.
>Bob: AEMNQ 1D MANQ.E +22 149
>Matt_: ENOORTZ 8L .OZE +39 244
#note I like ZOON here in retrospect; it takes out the danger of the Y hot spot in row 2, and it doesn't create a new hot spot like OZONE would.  ZOOT 2B  doesn't work because he can just play the Y for 38.
>Bob: INPSY 2B SPINY +55 204
#note Yeah, I probably deserve that for not playing ZOON.
>Matt_: EEIORTV N6 VI.OR +27 271
#note Eliminating the lane I just created, plus dumping the V.  I didn't feel the need to open the triple with the V, hence why I passed on VOE 3A.
>Bob: AABC 8A CABA. +30 234
>Matt_: EEEIOTW K10 EWE +29 300
>Bob: EFR G12 REF +16 250
#note So many of these  words get an E tacked on in Collins, it's hard to know when to challenge unless you're solid on stuff like this, and you're not used to the 10-point challenge rule.  I should have held a lot more plays than I did this weekend, including this phony hook.
>Matt_: EIIOOTU 15F ETUI +19 319
#note Quackle suggests a bunch of exchanges and vowel dumps.  With the blank and S unseen and only up 50 points, I felt I had to block the triple lane and score this turn.  If he hits something on row 14  I likely have a comeback down column O.
>Bob: ?ENNPRU 14I PUNNERs +74 324
#note Held him for a long time while I worked out the endgame and made sure that I could sitll win without challenging this off.  Drawing the V of all things saved me in this game.  Of note: NENUPhAR# 4B 68
>Matt_: AINOOSV O11 AVI.O +33 352
#note VIA 3A among other candidates blocks both his outplays.  I just wanted to score enough to outrun him, which AVISO does just fine.
>Bob: EILO A4 OLEI. +8 332
#note Not quite the shootout we had in the morning session, but a hard-fought win just the same.
>Bob:  (NOS) +6 338
