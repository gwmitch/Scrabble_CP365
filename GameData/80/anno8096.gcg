#note Too bad AWN wasn't on the board.
DK: I figured that without an S Joey couldn't do anything on the K column, but that his only place to score would be on row 12 underlaps.  There are also the possibilities of D and L ending bingos at 12I, so that seemed to be the better spot to take out.  I also figured that with him building toward a bingo on the last few turns, he was less likely to have high point tiles, so that the H15 spot would probably be more profitable to me.  The main downside to my play was giving him the R and the partially blocked E to bingo through.

#note Big mistake.  I couldn't convince myself that TINGEING could be spelled that way.
DK: Joey passed up TINGEING here and asked me about it after the game.  I told him that I knew for sure it was good, as I had won a turn with it against Ann Sanfedele at club 56 years ago.
(I had no idea that Dave has been playing for 56 years)
>Dave: AAEEISV F12 .AVA +22 129
#note DK: Almost immediately after I pressed my clock, I realized that I had missed AJIVA in this spot, which is a thousand times better.  Not only do I score 12 more points, I likely don't have to waste a turn clearing out more vowel drek on the next turn.  I didn't play my best in this match with Joey, and this was definitely my biggest wasted opportunity.

#note DAYSTAR is best.

>Joey: ?DNRRTU C7 TURD +19 258
#note I played too quickly here.  TUNDRA 15A is best.  It might even be worth burning the blank with OUTDRANK!
>Dave: AILNOTW B9 TALION +28 249
#note DK: I'm trying to win the race to the last blank, while also realizing that without it, a tile like the W is very useful for scoring on this board.
>Joey: ?CINPRU 4K CRU.. +20 278
#note No idea what's right here.  Probably something less defensive than this, since I have the case blan.
>Dave: AEHRRVW A13 HEW +34 283
#note DK: Case A, four more E's remaining.  Preventing C13-15 responses is good too.
>Joey: ?EEINOP O8 ElOPE +34 312
#note Maximizing my score seemed to be the best thing to do here.  If I fish and miss, I could fall too far behind.
DK: Just in time, as I was about to hit AERO in that spot, after which I would have liked my winning chances very much.
>Dave: AEOORRV C2 OVER +18 301
#note DK: I could not find any way to fish into a bingo that wouldn't be an easy block for him.  With this play I hoped to luck into a quick out and maybe a good score on row A, but I didn't see any way to win.
>Joey: BEEINNT 2A EB.NITE +22 334
#note Best is to play INCENT K2, threatening two nice spots for BE.  I was just content to find any winning sequence.
>Dave: AOPRU 1A PAR +39 340
>Joey: N 13A ..N +12 346
#note I've now won my last three tournament clinchers by a grand total of 17 points.
