>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EEG 8F GEE +8 8
>Jim_Burlant: AEEINTT F6 TE. +6 6
#note Q prefers E7 EAT and F8 GET, docking me HUGE equity for this.  Is this *really* 15 points worse than E7 EAT?
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADELSTU I2 SALUTED +66 74
#note E8 AULDEST 71.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEINTU 2B AUDIENT. +72 78
#note The only bingo, winning 42%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: HW 7E H.W +22 96
>Jim_Burlant: FFILSTU D2 .UFF +22 100
#note Urp.  The 21426 probability FISTFUL plays at D4 and scores 94.  As non-bingo options go this is solid...but really...I can't keep missing low-prob bingos like this.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EHU 1F HUE +31 127
>Jim_Burlant: ABEILST D7 STABILE +80 180
#note Definitely not as stylish as FISTFUL would have been, but I'll take it.  Now winning 69%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: GJOORV 11C V.GOR +18 145
#note Sam's first big mistake.  On this turn he initially put down OB, was reaching for what I presumed was the J...but stopped himself, took the O off the board, and thought for a bit.  He put down VIGOR, pulled it up, thought about it some more, and put VIGOR back down.  From all these machinations I figured he probably was sitting on the J and possibly an O.
>Jim_Burlant: ACDDILM 10F MAID +25 205
#note Against an uninferred rack the star plays are DECIMAL/MEDICAL/DECLAIM 13C, all of which score 32.  And, had Sam not implicately telegraphed his rack on the previous turn I probably would have put down DECLAIM.  But, given my inference about Sam's holding the J and probably an O, I have to block.  The sim agrees, though MALIC in the same location is better; I couldn't think of it.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: JOSY 14A JOYS +38 183
#note As expected.  And since I blocked his play, Sam had to burn the S to cash in his J.
>Jim_Burlant: ACDLLOW 15A ODA +47 252
#note Sim prefers 15A OW by not quite 3 points.  The sim is right - I should have unloaded the W.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: NOPX 13C P.ON +28 211
#note Sam flashed the X before pulling it back.
>Jim_Burlant: CEILLNS 5H N.LL +8 260
#note No really good options, I just figured I should balance the rack and leave something good.  Q's preference is 5H CULL for 12.  Since when does Quackle tell anyone to unload the C?  :-)
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AA E5 AA. +24 235
>Jim_Burlant: CEIINQS L3 QIS +29 289
#note I hate racks like this.  Q's suggestion is 3A QI...which I rejected due to the unseen blanks.  That looked like the sort of play that could kill me if he beat me to the blank.  This play didn't thrill me either becuase it would obviously give back more than I got as well as burning the case S.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IX M2 XI +40 275
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINOV 11I OVA +15 304
#note Q prefers 11I ENVOI and 11I OVINE to this.  Isn't that a bit reckless for only 19 points vs the 15 this play scores?
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: MN 3C M.N +20 295
>Jim_Burlant: CEGIKNW 12K WICK +31 335
#note Best...but dangerous.   Having to cross my fingers he doesn't have the blank.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EZ N10 ZE. +36 331
>Jim_Burlant: CEGNORR 8A GRO. +15 350
#note Q's preference is 10K CROZE...which I rejected as too dangerous.  This play isn't one of the original kibbitzer choices but it sims better than everything but CROZE.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IO N1 OI +22 353
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCENRR B6 BR. +11 361
#note I'm certinly not getting any help from the tile gods.  The sim agrees in principle with my choice to fish, though I should have played BRR12G for 15 instead of this for 11.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEOT O7 TOEA +23 376
#note Mistake #2 by Sam.  Sam had tracked incorrectly and he thought there was still an A unseen, so he felt he had to take this spot out.   If he knew he had the case A, he'd have left this alone.
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEINPR O12 sPIC +34 395
#note Predictably, Q says I should fish off the P at 1N.   Why pin all my hopes on a bingo that may not come?  Or if it does, he winds up blocking it?
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?EENRRY 12F REE +13 389
#note And this is where Sam's tracking error does him in again.  He thought that if he played ERN 13 I'd gio out on him as he thought I had an A in my rack (not sure of what he thought I had).  Championship Player says 5 plays win 100% for Sam:  9B RYA, 14F ENtRY, 13H tREEN or pREEN.
>Jim_Burlant: EINRT 13I RENT +13 408
#note Best.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?NRY 9B RY. +25 414
>Jim_Burlant: I J5 .I +8 416
#note Time on my clock when this went down:  0:04.
>Jim_Burlant:  (N?) +2 418
