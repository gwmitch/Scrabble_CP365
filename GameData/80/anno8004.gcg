#note this  does not sim well and is actually pretty bad.  Q likes YUG or YOU f2, which is too hot for my taste.  d10 YOGI seems better.

#note i didn't know 12h SMOUTING which is better defensively because of the A front hook to MOUNTING. SMOUT = MOTUS & MOUST.

#note this is statically good, but i guess it does screw the board up - M7 GAIT or TAIG is winning the sim. M5 VIGA also doing well.

#note i liked this play and statically it's ahead. it gets killed in the sim though losing out to J5 GI or 4k (V)IG.  apparently with the unseen pool i had to dump the GI combination.
