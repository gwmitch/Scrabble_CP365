#note At *best* a 1 in 72 shot. At the time, I figured that with my half win, spread didn't matter, so I could get silly with impunity. No!!! Bad dog! Spread always matters! As it would happen, Conrad (also with a half win, remember) had overtaken me in the standings and even had me on spread. This time, I was rewarded for my temerity. But now I am insoluble with karmic debt forevermore.
