>Matthew_Larocque: EEFSTXY 7F EX +37 37
#note According to Quackle's champ player, this is the best move. However, there is a neat play for 40 points that keeps the S. I missed it, can you see what it is?
>Peter_Yap: EIRU E8 .UREI +10 36
>Matthew_Larocque: EFLRSTY D11 FLY +27 64
#note This is the best play.... if you don't don't the obscure bingo. Can you guess what it is?
Hint: it plays through the I, and it ends with S.
>Peter_Yap: EHH F11 HEH +21 57
>Matthew_Larocque: AERSSTV G12 REV +17 81
#note There is a 7 on my rack here, but I didn't know the hook. There is also an 8, but I didn't even think to look for an 8. I was trying to be clever and set myself up because I had 2 esses.

#note This is the best non-bingo play. I didn't see the 7 here, but I should have. What is it?

#note This is obviously a weak play. I figured it might sound unfamiliar. But something like CORNETS scores 2 more points and provides superior defense - would have blocked Peter's bingo. He was right, trying to draw challenges with common words probably isn't worth the sacrifce. Sure it works sometimes, but pointless against people that know all these words.
>Peter_Yap: AEGGI H1 AGGIE +28 226
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEELNT B1 LEANED +35 279
#note There's a weird 8 letter bingo here. I also wasn't sure of any 5 letter words in this spot.
LATED is fine, so is NALED. ANTED is also there, but if he has an R he can hook onto it.
>Peter_Yap: ?AIOSTT K2 STATIOn +72 298
>Matthew_Larocque: LLNOTUY 2K .ULLY +16 295
#note This is the best play by far. Besides getting rid of junk, it ensures I will get a pretty good score next turn and maintain my lead.
>Peter_Yap: OOPR L7 POOR +15 313
#note According to my scoresheet, this is where Peter played this word. Could have been moved up for more points. He also had P(Y)RO for 30 that he missed. I had miscored this game by quite a bit - he probably could have won here if he had gotten these last couple of plays right.
>Matthew_Larocque: BCIJNOT 2F JI. +27 322
#note Quackle says this is second best. It suggests a play for 33 that doesn't use the J. Know what it is?
>Peter_Yap: AAIOR 1N AA +23 336
>Matthew_Larocque: BCNOT 1A B.OC +33 355
>Peter_Yap: IOR 4J ..OI +8 344
#note Besides missing (T)IRO, he also could have played off OI for ten points instead of 8. Can you see where?
