#note BIOGAS is the star play which doesn't require you to squander both S's. Unfortunately, I don't know it, even though the plural is a high-prob bingo. I dunno. Aside from BASSO, there's 14B BOGS and H10 QIS. But I give BASSO an edge since I know he has all 1-pointers. But really, you need to see BIOGAS here, or you're making a poor play.

#note Not an obvious position. I had considering QUART and QUAG at I9, but figured the open values saved my leave, and that I could afford to take the points with SUQ (knowing that his S is unlikely). What I didin't consider were plays which kept the Q. 12K TOG sims very well, interestingly. I dunno, I have a hard time passing up SUQ here, but it sims below all those plays I just mentioned. I probably didn't realise just how poor the leave was.

#note Not the kind of rack I would think to look for another bingo with. But yeah, GRITTILY might be a bit better. Although, I would be thankful for that E later on.

#note I missed DEGUM. But I knew this play wasn't good. I was shooting for the 600 and knew I'd need a big X play to get it.
