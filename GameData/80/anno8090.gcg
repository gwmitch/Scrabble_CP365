>Toh_Weibin: AAGPTUZ 8G ZUPA +30 30
#note Spent a lot of time on this rack. How would you start? Was seriously considering keeping an inferior leave with ZAG.
>Hubert_Wee: AEJN K5 JEAN +38 38
>Toh_Weibin: AABGHNT L3 BHANG +36 66
#note BATH and BAHT sim better, probably because of the NG synergy and a good chance of playing something /(JA)G immediately after.
>Hubert_Wee: EINO 9G ONIE +27 65
>Toh_Weibin: ANOSTUV 10E UVA +26 92
>Hubert_Wee: DDEERTU M6 DETRUDE +70 135
>Toh_Weibin: NORRSTT 13I TRONS +32 124
#note Again, the moves are quite close here. I still like my move.
>Hubert_Wee: AIW M2 WAI +25 160
>Toh_Weibin: AEEGORT N1 TOGE +32 156
#note GOAT 1N would have been more defensive and possibly better.
>Hubert_Wee: DLOOR O4 DOLOR +34 194
>Toh_Weibin: AEEEKMR 12D REMAKE +36 192
#note Was considering something like AKEE 12J but I wanted a chance at the blanks. MEE/ MAE N10 is Sinister, and possibly worth trying.
>Hubert_Wee: EIT 11E TIE +34 228
#note Nice overlaps.
>Toh_Weibin: AEEOSUY L10 YEA. +26 218
#note Was considering EYNE to bait Hubert into hooking an S behind it, but that would give him ample opportunity to score around K11.
>Hubert_Wee: EF O1 EF +30 258
>Toh_Weibin: CEFOSTU 11I FEU.. +24 242
>Hubert_Wee: ABG 9C GAB +14 272
>Toh_Weibin: CIOSTVW 14F VOWS +25 267
#note Quackle suggests WO 10B. Interesting.
>Hubert_Wee: RT 10L ..RT +9 281
>Toh_Weibin: ?ACIIOT 15G IO +23 290
>Hubert_Wee: DHIRS O10 .HIRDS +33 314
>Toh_Weibin: ?ACIMTY 8B CAY +24 314
#note I would think CAY is better than MAY - gives me a better chance at a bingo IMO. Don't really know, actually.
>Hubert_Wee: IQ 15M QI. +12 326
>Toh_Weibin: ?IIMNOT 6J M... +13 327
#note Should probably have played a bingo, but was very afraid of any counter which would end the game. I think I was quite rightly afraid.
>Hubert_Wee: C C7 C.. +9 335
>Toh_Weibin: ?IINOST 9G ....S +17 344
#note ONIES* - my unchallenged phony from day 1. This netted me good points to go ahead. Wasn't sure of SCAG so didn't think of fishing for a bingo there.
>Hubert_Wee: ?EILLLX 10A aXE +32 367
#note Probably not the best choice - CP says L(UN)E H7 and RILL D12 give a 75% chance of winning.
>Toh_Weibin: ?IINOPT A9 c.PTION +24 368
#note Was low on time when I played this - T(a)mPION (out of many better choices) would have sealed it. Anyway, at this point of time (though we didn't realise it), Hubert had underscored JEAN by 1 and I'd overscored VOWS by 4. This was hence "enough" for me to win.
>Hubert_Wee: ILLLN B10 .I +13 380
>Toh_Weibin: I 14A .I +4 372
>Toh_Weibin:  (LLLN) +8 380
#note So, I win unjustly by 5, and Hubert didn't do a recount.
