#note Huge break that David had to exchange.  Q prefers throwing the E back in as well.  How did Q know I would draw 2 more?
>David_Whitley: HIINQRY -HII +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: EEEFNNP 8D PENNE +20 20
#note Loath to keep the F but dind't think PEEN was worth giving up 8 scoreboard points.    The sim agrees.
>David_Whitley: BILNQRY -BIL +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: EFLRRTV E7 F.VER +22 42
#note Best.
>David_Whitley: ACEINNT 11B INT.ANCE +60 60
#note Not sure why David played this instead of ANCIENT at 7A.  I was about to hold this, but had drawn IQ after my last turn.  When I saw what this gave me back, I figured I'd cash the Q for 64.  
>Jim_Burlant: ADILQRT 10B QI +64 106
#note Given that I made the mistake of letting his phony stick, this is best.   Having said that, in retrospect I should have challenged off INTRANCE* and played TRANQ G5.  Given that he missed ANCIENT, does he find ANTIACNE for 64 if I put down TRANQ?  I'm still winning 65% with this play.
>David_Whitley: ?EMOOTT J5 MOTTOEs +72 132
#note I held this because I was preoccupied with trying to remember whether MOTTO could be extended with ES (it can).  Of course, if I'd bothered to anagram ACEINNRT I'd have challenged the play off the board.  Being unsure of MOTTOES, David had only scored this play as 62, and my feeling was that I had 33 coming back, I'd still be in the lead, so it wasn't worth the risk of challenging especially if he only cashed the blank for 62.

#note Best.
>David_Whitley: DEW C9 W..ED +26 158
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEKLNT F10 D.NK +20 159
#note Only bingo in this rack is H2 sKLENTED 63, as the 7 TINKLED doesn't play.  I knew SKLENTS, not SKLENTED.  But it's close - the sim docks me not even 3 points for this despite giving up 43 on the scoreboard.
>David_Whitley: ADIOU K4 AUDIO +27 185
>Jim_Burlant: ?AELOST 15H .OTALiSE +74 233
#note Note to self:  LOOK AT THE WHOLE BOARD.  L4 ETALOnS scores 84.  This miss allowed David a brutal run of scoring that I couldn't match.

#note Best.
>David_Whitley: AILYZ N1 .AZILY +52 307
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINOR O3 ANOA +26 292
#note Not thrilled about burning my bingo tiles, but the first priority is to stay in the game and Q agrees.  This is best, nothing else is close.
>David_Whitley: BDEM 8J ..MBED +42 349
>Jim_Burlant: CEIIORR L8 .OIRE +14 306
#note This posiiton is where I stareted feeling like I was in a box.  I felt like anything I did to open the top of the board would be too easy for him to shut down and I needed to turn my way out of this rack.  Of course N10 CRIERS would have been much better than this.
>David_Whitley: HIRW N11 WHIR. +22 371
>Jim_Burlant: CGIRRSY M8 .Y +20 326
#note 13F KYAR is best; I didn't see it.
>David_Whitley: AAS 12A AS.A +26 397
>Jim_Burlant: CGIORRS A12 .RCO +18 344
#note Q prefers G4 CORING to set up the S.  I saw that and rejected it, as he'd block that in a second.  This has the highest valuation.
