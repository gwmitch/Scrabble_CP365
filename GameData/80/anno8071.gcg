#note I completely forgot about GRAMA.  YACK J7 is the star play.
>Chris: EEHIRRS K1 REHIRES +81 95
>Dave: ACEHIOS J2 HAO +34 56
#note Best both because of the strong leave and the way it sets up the C hook.
>Chris: OOZ 6F ZOO +39 134
>Dave: CCEIISS 1J C.ISIS +36 92
#note I thought of CRISIC, which is far and away the best play, but unfortunately I did not trust it enough to try it.  My word knowledge let me down a few times this game.

#note Another word I saw but doubted: UNCURL.  I thought I might be confusing it with UPCURL.
>Chris: DELNOTY K9 NOTEDLY +77 301
#note Chris reminds me that I've done a good job of showing in this game that I am "not Edley."
>Dave: ?ENNNPR 12J P.NNE +14 201
#note Wow, PRECRISIS.  It kind of needs to be played here, despite the hilarious leave.

#note Better to create another bingo line than block them up with JARL, despite the double R leave.  This move also had another mischievous idea.
>Chris: IIII -IIII +0 356
>Dave: ?IMNORR L10 RI. +9 253
>Chris: ETW O1 .TEW +17 373
#note Chris wisely blocks the ST- bingo spot on column O, which is my most dangerous spot available.
>Dave: ?AGMNOR 11A ORiGAN.M +70 323
#note Time was running short and I didn't think of the bingos on row 4, the best of which is NANOGRAM.  However, there is nonstandard value in continuing to leave that spot open.
>Chris: DII B10 I.ID +7 380
>Dave: AOPTTUW H2 OUT +24 347
#note If I am fortunate enough to draw the last A, Chris is helpless against the winning WATAP 1D... unless he realizes that he can challenge off JUBAH*.  JUBA, JUBBAH, and JUBHAH are all good.
>Chris: AEEEINS D8 SIE.E +14 394
#note After the game, Chris was mad at himself for not challenging, but I say take the sure win if you're not sure.  At least I saved myself a bunch of spread.
