>Joey: AEENRRU D8 .URANE +18 18
>Dave: ACEHOSX E10 EX +38 64
#note DK: I don't like HEX as much.  It gives up easy scores off the X, and the leave is much more potent with the H.
>Joey: EEKLRTU C11 LURK +32 50
>Dave: ACEHLOS H1 COALSHE. +95 159
#note DK: I won my final $5 "skin" of the tournament for this word.
>Joey: EEGISTW 15A WEST +33 83
#note I would have rather left this spot open for later, but nothing else really appealed here.
>Dave: ABDHOQT E5 QAD. +28 187
>Joey: EEEGIIN F2 GENIE +27 110
>Dave: ?BFHORT G7 F.OTH +25 212
>Joey: EINOOVY H11 OVINE +41 151
>Dave: ?BBIIJR 3C JIB. +26 238
#note DK: Oops, JIB I9 was two more points.
>Joey: DOORSYZ 4A ZOOS +59 210
>Dave: ?BEIMOR A4 .OMBI +54 292
#note DK: Heh, he gave me the letter for BROMIZED/S in the triple-triple lane, but not in the right spot.  I did think of EMBODIER but not COMBINER here.  It's a hefty point difference, but this is not too much worse than bingoing, given that it takes Z scores away from him.
>Joey: ADNPRTY 15G P.DANTRY +65 275
#note Getting back into the game, but only for a moment.
>Dave: ?EEELRS N8 SEREnEL. +74 366
#note DK: Oops, I missed CELERIES.  The only thing I could think of off the C was CLEEKERS*.  Glad I didn't play that.
>Joey: ACEEGNU 8J UNCA.E +33 308
>Dave: ?AGITTU K2 AbUTTI.G +66 432
#note Ha ha!  He missed TAUNTING!  But I'm still losing, so ha ha on me too.
>Joey: ADEGILW 2J W.GED +36 344
>Dave: AIMNPVY 1M YAP +32 464
#note DK: Didn't have the motivation to think this endgame out carefully, especially because spread was meaningless at this point.  The one thing this play has going for it is that drawing an I gives me VIMINA.
>Joey: AAIILRT B6 AIT +17 361
>Dave: IMNOV 13J MOVI. +20 484
>Joey: AILR 4K .RIAL +12 373
#note Not much I could do about this one.  A rubber match shall be necessary.
