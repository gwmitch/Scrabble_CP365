#note Not exactly a good omen - for the second time in 5 games, I go first and my opening rack has to go back into the bag.
>Kevin_Leeds: AEPTY 8H PEATY +28 28
>Jim_Burlant: AACHIST 9H AHA +25 25
#note I had to wait a LONG time between the finish of round 4 and the start of this game, and from the looks of it it took my brain 2 or 3 turns to reengage.  I'll give myself a pass for not knowing the 8 CHAPATIS (the 7 has probablity 16619), but there's no excuse for not finding the non-bingo 2x2 CATTISH K5 48.  This is terrible.
>Kevin_Leeds: CFILRST -CFIL +0 28
#note Best.
>Jim_Burlant: CFILRST L3 FLIRT. +24 49
#note This wins by a hair over K4 CLIFT.
>Kevin_Leeds: Q 5K Q. +22 50
>Jim_Burlant: CIJLNOS 10F JIN +31 80
#note Hated opening the 2x2 with DDDD?? unseen and Kevin having drawn 4 a couple of turns back, but this rack doesn't leave much choice.  This is best, nothing else is worth consideration.
>Kevin_Leeds: EEGZ 11H GEEZ +35 85
>Jim_Burlant: CDEELOS E8 LODE +22 102
#note Sem prefers E10 DECO.  Since when does Quackle ever tell anyone to not keep the C? :-)   Q doesn't like this much, but against Kevin I feel like I have to go out of my way to keep the board open.
>Kevin_Leeds: ORUX D11 ROUX +24 109
>Jim_Burlant: CEEOPST 14B CO. +24 126
#note Too bad he didn't float an I for PICOTEES.  This is best, narrowly beating out POX.  Of note:  SE(X)POT.
>Kevin_Leeds: EIORU D4 OURIE +15 124
>Jim_Burlant: EEEPSTV C7 PEEVE +27 153
#note Saw the cute play of PEEVE and didn't look hard enough to find the better play.  E2 VEEP is definitely better; maybe the difference in the game, maybe not.
>Kevin_Leeds: ADO 12K ADO +19 143
>Jim_Burlant: HNRSTUV 13G HUNTS +25 178
#note Didn't think of the S front hook to PANG.  Best play is 7F TUSH but this play doesn't even sacrifice 1-1/2 points at 1000 2-ply iterations.
>Kevin_Leeds: ?AELNRS 3H SNAR.LEd +72 215
>Kevin_Leeds: ?AELNRS --  -72 143
>Jim_Burlant: EINRRUV 14F VINE +24 202
#note Now I get stupid.  Before making my play, I took time to anagram every 7 in his rack.  AELNRS? has 25 bingos...and I only found 23 of them.  The two I didn't find:  ENSNARL and STERNAL.  I considered VINE E3 but didn't want to give him a 70+ RELoANS on row 2, so thinking that I had cleverly sealed off the triple because I didn't think of STERNAL or ENSNARL, I put this down.  Best play here is probably E2 RUIN.  The points traded come out in the wash...but the board positoin kills me on his post-bingo turn.
>Kevin_Leeds: ?AELNRS 15I EnSNARL +74 217
>Jim_Burlant: IKRRSTU 6J KI. +28 230
#note 3I TURFSKI wins.  This sims pretty well, but maybe KURU (which I didn't think of and sims pretty much interchangeably with this) would have been much better given his post-bingo rack.
>Kevin_Leeds: ?AGLMOS 5B MO.LAGeS +70 287
>Jim_Burlant: DIRRSTU B2 DRU. +14 244
#note 3I DRIFT is the preferred play, but I feld like i didn't have time to grind through racks; rack grooming for the late bingo felt like the way to go.,
>Kevin_Leeds: AFN 13M FAN +22 309
#note Finally, a bingo I know.  Of course, it doesn't play.  Sigh.  Perhaps I should have played H1 STAYED instead of this, but I don't think it would have mattered.  My annotation ends at this point - I fail to draw any of the remaining vowels and do the best I can one and two-tiling while Kevin plays cheap defense to ensure the win.  Final score 330 - 368.
