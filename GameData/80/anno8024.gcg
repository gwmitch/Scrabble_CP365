#note I was pretty happy with this play. Besides scoring well and unloading consonants, drawing one of 8 E's will give me PRENOON, or I could get an M for MIDNOON. Nonetheless, DRIP 9B sims slightly ahead.
>Jesse: CHRSU D10 CHUR.S +36 282
>Carl: DIIIIPR -DIII +0 254
#note Rather dispiriting draw. Not even a place for IRID. Trading 6 wins the sim. (-2)

>Carl: ?AIOPRT E11 OP +22 300
#note I found the only bingo in AIOPRT? + G, but sadly, it didn't play down column M.

>Carl: ?ADINRT 5B RID +11 311
#note A moment of utter stupidity. I tracked and retracked to make sure I had the bag right. Then I went through the entire alphabet to make sure I wasn't missing any hooks. A-RID, B-RID, C-RID, D-RID, E-RID, F-RID, G-RID, H-RID, and, much like Homer Simpson, I thought I was safe. Never mind that I considered playing the one I missed *earlier in the same game.* Quackle says it's only -12, I say it's (-$1,050)
>Jesse: BIILM A1 LIMBI +41 398
#note Yup, so instead of setting up a hook Jesse couldn't have, I set one up that he practically had to have. Smooth move, ex-lax.
>Carl: ?AINPTT 11D ..T +6 317
#note Technically, another poor decision: If I draw the letter I need, he bingos out. On the other hand, I have to make something happen, and SPATTING won't be enough.
>Jesse: EEEILNT M9 TIN.LE +16 414
#note What if you aren't 100% on SELENITE? In the last game, for all the marbles, you play something you're positive will win, even if it sacrifices 170 points of spread. That's less than graceful, but it beats the hell out of losing because you took points that weren't there to be taken.
>Carl: ?AEINPT O2 sAPIENT +91 408
#note As ironic an outplay as ever there was.
>Carl:  (EE) +4 412
