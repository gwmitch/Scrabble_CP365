>Jim_Burlant: EHOORTX 8C EXHORT +48 48
#note Great start!  Unfortunately, Paul had an even better start.
>Paul_Holser: AELMNST I2 LAMENTS +78 78
#note Sim prefers C2 TALESMEN by a hair.  Whatever.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DIIORS C7 D.RISIOn +72 120
#note Saw OXIDISER D7 and wasn't sure it was good, and couldn't find IODIzERS 5D.  Not finding a row 5 bingo would normally be a mild equity slip...but in this case it cost me big.
>Paul_Holser: ACFINRU 4B FRANCIU. +82 160
#note BEAUTIFUL find!!!
>Jim_Burlant: EGMORRY 12A GR.MY +26 146
#note Saw REFRY, couldn't remember if it was good.  Despite the points given up on the scoreboard, this doesnt' even give up 3 points in the sim.  And this worked out much better for me than REFRY would have.
>Paul_Holser: EJRTT 10B J.TTER +31 191
>Jim_Burlant: ABEORST 15C SORBATE +89 235
#note So much for my planned 2x2 of BOATERS.  This is still nothing to sneeze at, and it's winning 63%.
>Paul_Holser: DIU A12 .UID +18 209
>Jim_Burlant: EEHNOUY H10 YOU +24 259
#note Best, winning 71%.  But things were about to turn for the worse.
>Paul_Holser: AIW 7F WAI. +18 227
#note Not sure of Paul's exact rack but he said he was looking for TAILWIND and couldn't find it.  While this play only scored 18, it hurt me quite a bit and really put me into catchup mode.
>Jim_Burlant: EEHKNVV D6 VE. +16 275
#note A bad miss on my end.   I had planned on dumping V's with VIVE G3 but that was blocked...and my brain melted.  3G KNAVE looks right; I couldn't see it.  This is third best but really, it's a much weaker play.
>Paul_Holser: ?DEEGIL 14I DELEInG +73 300
>Jim_Burlant: BEHKNOV 5I .VOKE +24 299
#note Blind to KNAVE agaon. This is in the top tier of plays but it still coughs up lots of equity to KNAVE.  KNAVE wins 38%, this wins 31.
>Paul_Holser: AEW O12 WA.E +36 336
>Jim_Burlant: ABFHNTZ M11 HAF.Z +40 339
#note Q feels I shouldn't burn all the ammo, instead preferring 13J HAFT by 5 points.  One thing to be said for HAFT:  it doesn't offer up any sizeable comebacks...something that can't be said about this play.
>Paul_Holser: NOO 11C .OON +27 363
>Jim_Burlant: ABINNST L10 NAB +23 362
#note Best, and I'm back up to 48% from low 30's a couple of turns ago.  Can I land EI in the nick of time?
>Paul_Holser: EEPP K8 PEEP +34 397
#note I wanted to scream when I saw this come down.  Not that I didn't expect him to take out what I just opened, but I had just had a potentially game-killing draw and it was clear that the E's had made it all into his rack and that there probably weren't any left in the bag.
>Jim_Burlant: GIIINST 8K .IING +27 389
#note Here we go again.  In the 5-ply sim, Quackle thinks I should just fish with PI 8K or L5 KI.  I felt I should take this to an end game and take my chances there since I didn't like my chances of finding a playable bingo with those duplicated I's, as the L or M columns were sure to be blocked on Paul's next turn.  Paul and I post-mortemed this one extensively and he agreed with this the best - it set me up well, but I just didn't get the right tiles.
>Paul_Holser: DELN N2 LEND +24 421
>Jim_Burlant: AAIOSTU 2G SO.ATIA. +10 399
#note Phony.  I was down well under 30 seconds and the only legit out in two I saw, OUTSAIL and a U dump, gave him 33 for his Q.  I was 80% sure this was phony (it is), but I figured I'd put the onus on Paul to risk losing the win by potentially challenging a word he might not have been 100% sure about.    This went down with 0:04 on my clock.
>Paul_Holser: CLQ M7 Q. +21 442
>Jim_Burlant: U E4 .U +4 403
#note Time on my clock when this went down:  00:01.
>Jim_Burlant:  (CL) +8 411
#note Well done, Paul - GREAT game!
