>Tunnicliffe: AHIIIRW 8F WHIR +20 20
#note I dunno, pick your poison with this rack. It really bothers me that all the other placements for WHIR sim better. I don't get that. Must be because of WHIRLYBIRD. Anyways, a couple trades sim close as well. In hindsight, I wish I'd done Ex. AIIW.
>Balkan: AV F6 VA. +17 17
>Tunnicliffe: AAIILMU J4 MIAUL +20 40
#note MILIA is 6 points more. I dunno if that's worth it, but Quackle seems to like MIAUL.
>Balkan: ADI K3 AID +18 35
>Tunnicliffe: AEEEINU 6E U.EA +7 47
#note Best in the static evaluator, but then drops like a stone. I guess my leave is bad, but it's especially bad on the board I'm creating. What is my plan for next turn? Cross my fingers and hope I get lucky. I need a better plan than that, which means I should trade here.
>Balkan: AELOR H1 AREOL. +21 56
>Tunnicliffe: AEEIINQ E5 Q.A +26 73
#note Failure to think. HEINIE cleans up the rack and sets up my Q. I'm really not thinking ahead this game.
>Balkan: AELP 4B PLEA +25 81
>Tunnicliffe: EEEIINR G8 .EINIE +11 84
#note Quackle likes B2 REPINE? Okay, but I'm understandably wary of vowel-heavy leaves at this point.
>Balkan: ?EGINOS K8 SIGNOrE +76 157
>Tunnicliffe: AEENPRT L12 PE +17 101
#note She placed and picked up bingos in half a dozen different spots before settling on the one which blocked both spots for APERIENT. Okay, that sucks. But yeah, I still have a bingo. I just don't know it. I don't think I've studied any PP bingos yet. That's the game right there. And yeah, PE is pretty piss poor.

>Balkan: ?AHLOST N7 LOATHeS +68 265
>Tunnicliffe: EEIORRT O4 RETORE +31 253
#note I dunno what to do here. I want to block the X spot, but there's another one at L4. I want to fish for a bingo, so maybe I should do that with O7 ORE or something.
>Balkan: EVX L2 VEX +52 317
>Tunnicliffe: CGIITUW -GIUW +0 253
#note F2 WIT? No Quackle, I am not going to win that way. Not against a human. I dunno what my play accomplishes, but it feels like my best chance.
>Balkan: EMN A5 MEN. +7 324
>Tunnicliffe: CGIORST B8 .RGOTICS +80 333
>Tunnicliffe: CGIORST --  -80 253
#note Whatever, that was my chance and I took it.
