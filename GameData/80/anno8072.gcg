>opponent: CDEEU L8 .EDUCE +20 20
>scott_jackson: AAEGILR 7G AGA +15 85
#note Missed both REGALIA and GALLERIA. Not good. This rack always gives me trouble for some reason. 
>opponent: AEU 6H EAU +12 32
>scott_jackson: EFILRSY 13K F.Y +18 103
#note Best. Defensive value and keeps a bingo-prone leave for column M and elsewhere.
>opponent: ?EMORTV 11G VERMO.Th +74 106
#note Nice play.
>scott_jackson: EIILORS F1 ROILIES. +67 170
>opponent: ?AAHINS E5 HA +22 128
#note Opponent's actual rack - best is HARIANAS on the top row. 
>scott_jackson: EEGIKMN 1F .EEKING +42 212

>opponent: EIVW D6 WIVE +20 232
>scott_jackson: CDEILMS C9 MEDIC +33 256
#note Quackle likes 2H MID 27 
>opponent: DIP B10 DIP +24 256
>scott_jackson: FLOOSXY 14B FOXY +45 301
#note I saw 2J FOOLS 50 but I wanted to keep an O for the A column. Quackles likes this choice much more than my play, which is admittedly less safe. The S isn't very good on this board anyway, so keeping the X is better.
>opponent: AEGU 15E AGUE +20 276
>scott_jackson: ALOSTWZ 14J ZA +36 337
#note Should just take the points with 15A ZAS 53. Even if my opponent bingos I'm in decent shape. 
>opponent: AJOT N6 JOTA +29 305
>scott_jackson: OTW A8 TWO +22 359
#note Didn't record all my racks from this point on - my opponent was playing quickly due to time pressure.
>opponent: BRR 15K BRR +14 319
>scott_jackson: BOR B6 BRO +13 372
#note I had the last two O's so there was no risk of a big play on the right column.
>opponent: I I1 .I +6 325
>scott_jackson: EHLNOST 3I THOLE +26 398
#note Blocking UNSPILT/UNSPLIT. Better sequence is 3I TELS 13 in the same spot then H10 NOH 33.
