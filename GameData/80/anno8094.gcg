#note What I am.  Well, not really.
>Dave: AHOOQUW K9 HOW +23 52
#note DK: I couldn't justify taking the points with QUA J2 here when I had no A to hook and my leave wasn't that good.  Better to wait and see what else develops for the Q.
>Joey: AEEFILN 12G FINALE +30 77
>Dave: ANOQRTU H10 QU.NTA +45 97
#note DK: I don't remember considering QUINOA at all, which seems like the more natural play.  I wonder if I subconsciously was thinking about the fact that three O's and no T's had been played already.  Whether it was that or just dumb luck, my play did lead to a much better rack.

#note DK: I liked this better than GARTH to set up the S hook to A8.

#note There are several 83-point bingos here.  I was just glad to at least find one that reached the triple.
>Dave: EGILNST M9 GLISTEN +80 287
>Joey: ADENRST D8 .ARNDEST +72 332
#note Finally a rack with more consonants than vowels, and well timed.
>Dave: AGOPRSU 15K PU.G +8 295
#note DK: The only way I could see to give myself a fighting chance.
>Joey: DEERTUY 13M .RY +6 338
#note A lot of equity needed to be sacrificed here, especially with the possibility of ZITS or ZOOS.
>Dave: ACOORSZ O12 R.AS +48 343
#note DK: FAIL.  I gladly would have scored with the Z and kept the threat alive to score here later if I could have found any Z play that scored in the same neighborhood as this.  I completely missed ORZO C7, which gives me a *much* better chance to win.
>Joey: DEEITUV B8 .UTVIED +26 364
#note Lucky that I was able to play a lot of letters while scoring well and blocking the potential BORTZ.
>Dave: ABCOOTZ N6 BAZOO +31 374
#note DK: Again I missed a better play.  ZEBEC makes it five points closer, but it's still not enough.
