>Verbie: BEINSSS K5 B.SINESS +90 104
#note (cue deer jumping through a window) Hello!
>Rafi_Stern: EJO 10F JOE +34 68
>Verbie: AAAIINO 11D NAOI +19 123
#note Considered punting here, but this is good enough for the moment (-5/ AN is 3.7 back)
>Rafi_Stern: ?ABDEGR 12D ARB +28 96
>Verbie: AAIIOOO -AAIIOOO +0 123
#note Had this been club, this would have been face up.
>Rafi_Stern: DEIRW J10 WEIRD +38 134
>Verbie: AEEEFHT M3 HEFT +35 158
#note What's weird here is not that this is behind FEET and FEAT (by 4 and 2, respectively), but that I apparently didn't consider FEE L8... or if I did, decided to take the points.  (-7)
>Rafi_Stern: AAEELOS -AAEELO +0 134
#note It probably wasn't this exactly...
>Verbie: AADEENO 15H ANODE +31 189
#note Top.
>Rafi_Stern: LY 7K .LY +30 164
>Verbie: AEEEEUZ 13C ZEE +30 219
#note Only question is where. 
>Rafi_Stern: LX 4L L.X +20 184
>Verbie: AEEMNUY N2 MA. +29 248
#note There were better ideas, but 14A YEA seemed dangerous, nothing else was similar score wise.  (YEA is top by 4.5.  UNMADE or MAYED 14F and HEY 3M are also ahead of the play chosen.)
>Rafi_Stern: ?AEFGRT O1 FAG +32 216
#note He told me this one.
>Verbie: CEENPUY 14F YUP +20 268
#note I should have seen this at 14 L for 1 more... but the real star is PUDENCY 14H.  (-19)
>Rafi_Stern: ?EGORT I5 G.O +11 227
#note Seventh tile unknown.  It's not A, I, N, or S.
>Verbie: CEEINRV 15A EVINCE +41 309
#note Best.
>Rafi_Stern: ?EOORTU -OUE +0 227
#note I will assume a leave of ERT? still.  OOU or OUU seems a good placeholder.  Weirdly, in either of those cases it seems better to dink out of the rough.
>Verbie: AADIIRR 5M .IR +19 328
#note AIRRAID* being bogus and unplayable anyway.
>Rafi_Stern: ??EKRST M9 KiRTlES +85 312
#note Missing the two 95-pointers, RESTRucK O5 and TRiSKElE A8.  The latter would have put me into a major problem.
>Verbie: AACDINR A8 RADIANC. +86 414
#note As in where would I go with this blocked?
>Rafi_Stern: AILMOUV -UAVIO +0 312
#note Bingozuma's revenge.
>Verbie: DIOPRTT N8 PIT +16 430
#note Lot of slightly-better options, plus the much better DOPED 14J (-6.5)
>Rafi_Stern: ATV O7 VAT +37 349
>Verbie: DEGOORT 8E GEO.D +13 443
#note I'm not trusting GO at B9 (opens lane for a miracle draw) so I'll count DOG 10A as top of what I might actually do. (-9 to DOG, -15 to GO)
>Rafi_Stern: AHILMOU E5 LOU.H +18 367
#note Q is misbehaving, likes HELM leaving AIOU.  srsly?
>Verbie: LORTU F4 TOR +11 454
#note needed to block obvious AIM F4 (but should have just gone ahead with ROTL B9... )
>Rafi_Stern: AIM N12 AIM +21 388
