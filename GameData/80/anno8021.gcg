#note Encouraged to see a blank in my opening rack.  That is, until I saw what Tony had drawn on his.  Q gives slight preference to keeping AIL?.
>Tony_Cook: AEEGLNT H2 ELEGANT +68 68
#note 8H placement sims roughly 1 point better.  Whatever.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEELRV 8H .RAVELEd +83 83
#note 8A cERVELA(T) (which I didn't know) scores 92; this is second best.  There are no 2x2's available.
>Tony_Cook: HOO I3 OHO +18 86
>Jim_Burlant: AINORRT L5 ANT.RIOR +66 149
#note Best.
>Tony_Cook: EJU K11 JEU +40 126
>Jim_Burlant: DEEGLST M11 GELD +26 175
#note Best - nothing else sims within 5 points.
>Tony_Cook: ?AIINRT O8 .AINTIeR +71 197
#note Though M1 RINgTAIL Scores 73, this or DIsTRAIN are the sim winners.  
>Jim_Burlant: AEIINST I8 .AINIEST +60 235
#note So much for my planned bingo of DAINTIES O8.  This is the only playable bingo and it wins 62%.
>Tony_Cook: AEHMOP 15F APO.HEM +51 248
#note Beautiful play!!
>Jim_Burlant: AIMRSXY H10 MIX +43 278
#note Spent a while looking for a 5 from 14B ending in Y before giving up...with good reason.  While this is a darned nice post-bingo rack, there are no 5's available from 14B ending in Y.  This is best, and I'm winning 66%.  
>Tony_Cook: CEP 14D CEP +23 271
>Jim_Burlant: AADRSYY K3 YAY +28 306
#note Best.  
>Tony_Cook: QU J6 QU. +32 303
>Jim_Burlant: ADFIRSW E11 WIF. +20 326
#note Wasn't entirely sure of this play as I didn't like giving easy hooks for 7's.  The sim doesn't outright trash it, but this wasn't best.  M3 DAW wins, with this choice simming 2-1/2 points down.  I was too obsessed with unloading all the bingo inhibitors in one play.
>Tony_Cook: CNO F10 CON +18 321
>Jim_Burlant: ADDRSTZ D8 DARTS +28 354
#note Saw M2 TZAR and didn't like it due to the DDS leave.  Quackle suggests one cool play I didn't see:  (QUA)DS J6, which sims roughly 1 point down to this, which wins the sim.  I'm winning 72%.
>Tony_Cook: KL N8 .LK +35 356
>Jim_Burlant: ADDIOUZ 8A AZI.O +45 399
#note  DIAZO C6 52 wins the sim.  But do you take the chance on a 10B comeback like FEIGN for 48?  Whether Q is right or I am is debatable.   What's irrefutable is that, for this game, this play was much better and you'll see why in a bit. 
>Tony_Cook: EFW C7 W.FE +29 385
>Jim_Burlant: DDEGTUU M3 DUG +17 416
#note Best, and my winning chances have fallen to 56%.  
>Tony_Cook: EORSV F4 ROVES +32 417
>Tony_Cook: EORSV --  -32 385
>Jim_Burlant: BBDEITU 6E TUB. +8 424
#note I was so giddy about the extra turn that I forgot there was still one in the bag, and I thought I was setting myself up to go out in two.  Only after I put this down did Tony remind me there was one in the bag.
>Tony_Cook: ENORSSV 5C OVEN +20 405
#note Tony was also low on time 
>Jim_Burlant: BDEIO B3 BIDE +18 442
#note Best sequence here is BI(CEP) followed by ODE 4B.  Good thing for me Tony hadn't played off the R to make ROVEN...but he was  short on time and went over.
>Tony_Cook: RSS J6 ...SS +25 430
>Jim_Burlant: O 14I .O +11 453
#note Tony went over on time.  Final score recorded as 455 - 420.
