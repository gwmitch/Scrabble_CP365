#note I couldn't decide whether to bingo. FOE wins the sim (-2.7)
>Conrad: GIRRTTW -GRTW +0 38
#note CBB: W(O)RRIT. Excuse me for making such an offensive bad play to you, Quackle.

>Carl: IMNOQST 6F QI. +32 159
>Conrad: AAEHRST 9E HAA. +23 136
#note CBB: I have plenty of time to open the board. I have no idea what Carl left after QI(S), so no HA.
>Carl: MNNOPST 10C NOM +12 171
#note A positional consideration. If I play PUNTO 5A, and he bingos across Row 4, the board will be difficult to open.
>Conrad: EFINRST 14A RIF +22 158
>Carl: ABNPSTU A1 TABUN +26 197
#note Nothing I can do about the new lane, so I'll create some of my own.

>Conrad: CEEIORR O8 ORRICE. +36 279
#note CBB: the plural of ORREX.
>Carl: AEEETUW B1 AWE +28 307
#note I would have thought that playing off one more vowel would have been fine, but WE 14F wins the sim by 10 points! What gives?

>Conrad: EGHIOTY 13K HOY +35 342
>Carl: AEELORW N8 LEA +13 352
>Conrad: AEGILNT 15K NEG +22 364
#note CBB: Oh this is just awful. I spent whatever time was left on my clock, and STILL missed his outplay. I had no way of winning based on his outplay, but since I was unaware of it, the exact situation I thought would happen DID happen.
>Carl: EORVW 14F WO +33 385
#note We both missed REWOVE 4C! See, if this were Bing's Game of the Day series, things like that just wouldn't happen. @#)%*{!!
>Conrad: AILT 7K LATI +9 373
#note CBB: So the first endgame sequence I saw was NEG then TELIA, which won by one to WO (remember, I didn't see R(E)WOVE, which is sad, because I saw the word on his rack AND saw the E. sigh. But I have no idea if TELIA is a word, or if I am just making it up. So 8 minutes later,  I finally see LATI, and realize I have a "for sure" tie. So I decide to take the sure tie over the maybe win. So while I can get over not knowing TELIA enough to play it...REWOVE? eek.
>Conrad:  (ERV) +12 385
#note Looks like we both gave this one up. At least it made things interesting.
