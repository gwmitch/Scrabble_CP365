>Richard_Charach: AGNTY 8D TANGY +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEIIOU E8 .UDIO +12 12
#note I always hate  starting out with junk like this. It tends to follow me around for half the game.
>Richard_Charach: FOT 7H OFT +15 35
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEEIU D4 AUDI. +12 24
#note Probably shouldn't be worried about opening the triple word score with adieu 11D. There's very few options with letters like these, and 22 points + balance should be a no brainer.
>Richard_Charach: EEEHRST J7 .EETHERS +65 100
>Matthew_Larocque: AACEEEP E3 CAPE +29 53
#note Never saw E(S)CAPEE, which would be good to start a game full of carnage.
>Richard_Charach: EW F6 WE. +29 129
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEIUV 14J .UAVE +16 69
#note I was extremely hesistant to play this. I had a blank in hand, but if he managed to bingo there I would end up between a rock and a hard place. Championship player slightly favours (H)IVE for 20 points. I just wanted the UV combo gone altogether.
>Richard_Charach: ER 15N RE +8 137
#note No reason to play this over SUAVE(R)/RE, is there?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEIJLN D12 JIN +38 107
#note Couldn't help but cringe a little when playing this too...
>Richard_Charach: OOSZ 15A ZOOS +54 191
#note He would have played ZOO(N) for 39 instead of this... 
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DELNPY L12 PL.Y +26 133
#note Yeah, two bingos. Too beyond my knowledge, and I'm really crappy with the letter Y anyways. This seems to be among the best non bingo options.
>Richard_Charach: Q 13C Q. +22 213
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEFLN 10G LEF.hAND +65 198
#note If it consists of two regular words, it should be a somewhat believable phony right?
>Richard_Charach: CEGINOS N3 COSIGNE. +64 277
>Matthew_Larocque: ABINRVX O8 AX +42 240
>Richard_Charach: DKU 4K KUD. +18 295
>Matthew_Larocque: BEILNRV 5J VINE. +33 273
#note (E)NVIER to the triple word score. I must have looked at that spot, probably just didn't see the word.
>Richard_Charach: ILNOT H10 .NTOIL +21 316
>Matthew_Larocque: AABLORT G12 ABO +19 292
#note  O(V)A and A(V)O 13M are a nice fit. But slight danger of getting overloaded with consonants. This ranks 8th on Champ's list. Everything else involves playing various words using the (JO)B hook. Including BORA. Why doesn't that seem familiar. I play BOTA and BOLA all the time, but never BORA. *shrugs* 
>Richard_Charach: OR 3L RO. +21 337
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AGILRT 10B GIL. +10 302
#note Was unsure how to proceed - was hoping to draw into an 8 letter ING bingo, I think. Either way I have a to create openings here, Quackle's top suggestion of SUAVE(R) won't accomplish that.
>Richard_Charach: HI B10 .HI +7 344
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABRRST K4 ..R +7 309
#note Kind of out of options... I noticed I could have played R(ODE), but he had an E and would have scored 30-40. TAB/B(AA)? Easy to block. I was running into overtime, so I guess I forgot about SUAVE(R).
>Richard_Charach: AEMR 3E .REAM +13 357
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABMRST H2 T.B +8 317
#note Well, that was helpful. Still not enough, but fun way to end a game nonetheless.
>Richard_Charach: EITW 2H .EW +18 375
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AMRS 1D MARkS +45 362
#note There's two plays for 48 and one for 54. 
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IT) +4 366
#note -20 points for me, and his final score was 373, I'm too lazy to see why.
