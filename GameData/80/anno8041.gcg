#note this made me so sad. ALODIA almost fits on the 5 row. TIDAL felt like it opened too much without having much to do. didnt see ALIDAD M6. q says ADO 5b is better too - i debated between the two. -5

#note talked about this one, too. Q says TRET 2L - pretty cool play to keep the score closer, try to draw an A for G column and keep blank.

#note debated over playing the E. ultimately decided to take one more tile, and make it a little harder to play in the O column. also, i was 100% that triazine was good, and 98% sure of triazin.  quackle wants me to keep the E
