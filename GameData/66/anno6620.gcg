#note Best; the runner up, HULL, sims almost 5 points and 2% winning chances down. Nothing else is even close.  FLUISH L10 scores 42 but breaks up too much of the rack. I'm still winning 60%.

#note The game-deciding position.  I saw JAMS, JEES, etc. in the unseen pool and felt that, given how bingo unfriendly this pool/board were,  GIVING looked like a setup for a J bomb at L1.  Problem is, I had no idea whether GIVING took S.  After thinking about it ("Misgivings is good, why not givings?"), and after not being able to come up with any way to block a potential J-bomb at L1,  I thought that, worst case, I was still up 26, I had the blank and some good scoring tiles,  I could waste a pitch and take my chances in the end game if need be.    Though it didn't occur to me at the time, I caught a huge break.  GIVINGS# is good in Collins, and Sam plays Collins.  He held this play for several minutes before finally accepting it.  Of course, if I know GIVING doesn't take S, this is a much easier position; I probably play I8 PUG and hope that his probable H1 play on his next turn gives me a line for an 8.  Quackle's preferences are 13L THUG and I8 PUG.

#note Best - have to block JOULE 2J.
>Sam_Kantimathi: EJ 2J JE. +26 378
>Jim_Burlant: ADERSTU N11 RATED +18 437
#note Didn't think of OREADS or DERATS, the latter of which would have been best.  Even DERAT would have been much better.  While this still wins, it hemorrhages 30-some points of spread.  Horrendous end game play by me - I was just happy to have won, but I really needed to think this through more than I did.
