#note Saw J10 XI and didn't like the CDENST leave.  Felt I'd rather turn 3 than 1 out of this rack.  Either way, I'm winning 85%.

#note Close call between this and J10 QI, but I felt the blank was worth 30 and this scored 35 more than my next best play, so it was justifiable to cash in the blank.  Quackle agrees, and this play wins the sim by roughly 6 points over J10 QI.

#note Normally I wouldn't be looking to fish out of this rack, but that open T at A8 is a SATINE 8 waiting to happen.  If the fish goes bad and/or she blocks that line, then I won't worry about rack building.  But while I have the SATINE 8 available, I'll try to get one.
