#note Tournament on June 19th, round 4 of 6. He's 3-0 and I'm 1-2.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEINOX 12H .EE +12 12
#note Simulation likes (t)oxine for 26 the best. Ex for 22 is second, and exi(t) is tied with (z)ee. I guess I value the x too much? 
>Timothy_Anderson: DEFY 13E DEFY +34 84
#note Hm, did he hang on to the y purposely?
>Matthew_Larocque: DEINORX 14B INDEX +86 98
#note Now this is how I like to cash in! Redox also plays, and sims a smidgen better.
>Timothy_Anderson: AIMO C11 AMI.O +14 98
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIIOOR 12C .OOR +26 124
#note I guess 26 points was good enough for me to delay an exchange. After 1000 sims, it's about tied with aio(l)i for 7, and oroi(de) for 14. But, my knowlege of six letter words can only be described as terribad.
>Timothy_Anderson: AIPRTV J6 PRIVAT. +20 118
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AACIIL K2 CILIA +18 142
#note After 1000 iterations, ties for 4th with ca(rex). Quackle prefers to fish off ai for 10 points at k10. Essentially, Quackle values the C greatly, while my abilities to bingo are somewhat lacking.
>Timothy_Anderson: ELV 3J V.LE +14 132
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABDINO 8A BOArDIN. +83 225
#note Convenient.
>Timothy_Anderson: ISTW K10 WIST +36 168
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAKLOR 7C KOA +27 252
#note Um, koala in the same spot.
>Timothy_Anderson: DENU L7 DUNE +12 180
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILORS A6 LO. +5 257
#note At the very least I should had seen and played ooralis or rialtos. When you fudge up a rack like this, and miss easy bingos that I KNOW... well I just don't deserve to win.
>Timothy_Anderson: GNOS M10 SONG +17 197
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AINRST N1 NARcIST +74 331
#note But I still have that "trains" stem memorized.... 1000 sims only ranks it sixth however. transit sims best. However, transit wouldn't have drawn a challenge either.
>Timothy_Anderson: EEHRS -  +0 197
>Matthew_Larocque: EFMNRTU O1 UM +22 353
#note Quackle likes Me(n)u slightly better, but I wanted to keep a vowel just in case.
>Timothy_Anderson: EEHRS 5A SHEER +22 219
#note If I was him, I would have tried to get a bingo there...
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGNQRT 4D FERN +26 379
#note I'd be hard pressed to find a way to lose now, all my choices are 99.9% in my favour to win. So, kind of lazy playing. Fret scores more in that spot, and eft 9b scores 28. Or I could have dumped the Q for 22.
>Timothy_Anderson: ACEH O7 ACHE +29 248
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGQRTU 9B ET +13 392
#note Now I'm just low on time and this felt like a stupid play. Quackle seems to be obsessed with playing of the G and an E. What am I missing? playing off the Q doesn't rank anywhere in "generate choices" list. Also, gipped myself and scored it 12.
>Timothy_Anderson: AOTY H1 OATY +48 296
#note Ugh. I would have challenged this instantly. But, he played it quickly while I was writing stuff down on my scoresheet. Sure, it gave me a nice place for my Q, but ultimately costed spread points.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGJQRUW 2F QU. +32 424
#note uh, quag.
>Timothy_Anderson: ABPU E2 AP.. +19 315

#note -10 for time, 431-331.
