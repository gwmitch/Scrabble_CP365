#note June 19th, round 3, looking for my first win. This was a nice starting rack.

>Samuel_Settle: ADO 8A ADO +17 33
>Matthew_Larocque: CENOOTZ J6 COT +20 53
#note Cool, ectozoan. With all the Z plays available, I thought "he probably doesn't know baht and might challenge". STOP THAT FOOLISHNESS AT ONCE.
>Samuel_Settle: IPW I7 W.IP +26 59
>Matthew_Larocque: ADENORZ B6 ZE. +33 86
#note Quackle likes (f)roze or (f)rozen. Not sure I even like putting the Z near a DWS like that. Enough short words end in Z.
>Samuel_Settle: CEL E6 CLE. +9 68
>Matthew_Larocque: ADLNORS 11C LARDONS +79 165
#note Why do I know this and ladrons? "fail of the year" which I observed in another annotated game.

>Samuel_Settle: EM 12D ME +18 86
#note He changed to this, after playing it at D4. He does need a bingo or two at this point.

#note Gr(a)tinee
>Samuel_Settle: AH D4 HA +24 110
>Matthew_Larocque: IIKLLRR H13 .LK +21 274
#note I didn't like this, but it simulates second to (p)rill, and ties with r(a)il.
>Samuel_Settle: X A8 .X +9 119
#note I'm really curious what his rack is here.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABIILRR 15E BIR. +10 284
#note After what he just did, I wont even leave a K open.
>Samuel_Settle: N 7I ..N +6 125
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIILRW K11 WI. +14 298
#note Yeah my superb knowledge of sixes pulls through again. But opening up a TWS might give him just what he needs, on the other hand.
>Samuel_Settle: R 7A R. +12 137
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEILRT 11K .E +5 303
#note I really shouldn't open, but even if he slaps a bingo down, I can probably retaliate. 
>Samuel_Settle: I 4C ..I +6 143
#note hm, what the heck does he have?
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEILRT E3 A. +2 305
#note Now it's just two fishermen catching no fish. Epic scrabble!
>Samuel_Settle: EEGINRT M9 TREEING +74 217
#note I'm pretty sure he didn't know treeing until he saw me play it.

#note What is this I don't even

But, (g)uv is ok, apparantly I was too blinded by the suck in front of me. Quackle also likes noon/noun for 11, keeping jn, or keeping n.
>Samuel_Settle: EOV N8 VOE +14 253
>Matthew_Larocque: ADOSTUU O10 DUO +9 381
#note I could also play it for 18 at N13, that would be better.
>Samuel_Settle: ?QU 5J sUQ +27 280
#note Scored 28.

>Samuel_Settle: IJN M2 JIN +26 306
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANOTUV 15M .UV +21 426
#note Have no time left, although this allowed a nifty outplay.
>Samuel_Settle: EOOSSY N1 YO +28 334

>Matthew_Larocque:  (EOSS) +8 474
#note I have aues written as the leftover tiles, so I have to wonder if the tiles were mixed up? -10 for me from timer: 464-335.
