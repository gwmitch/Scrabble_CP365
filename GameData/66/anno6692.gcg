#note Huge huge huge blunder here. Despite what quackle says, I think I should have played CION here, for it's defensive qualities. Obviously phoneying is stupid.

#note Crap. Really pissed at myself for playing the phoney at this point.

#note LYNX, in my opinion, is suicide. But then again, certain parallel plays to the D after OXY (like TAD) would really destroy the board as well. One thing to take into account at this point is that I was playing VERY fast, and Jeff was under some pressure to make quick decisions.

#note Still playing extremely fast. Maybe AULIC or CAULD could work too, because there are three G's left to hook LED.

#note With such a closed board and the Q and Z unseen, the blank here is key.

#note KING looked pretty safe to me. I think Jeff was down to around 1-2 minutes at this point.
>Jeff_Widergren: AAEIISZ A1 ....SIZE +66 379
>Jeff_Widergren: AAEIISZ --  -66 313
#note Jeff played this almost immediately. My first inclination was that it wasn't good, but I had to see if there was a way to win if it was. After much deliberation, I challenged it off. Jeff showed me EQ as the curtesy tiles, so I was faced with an interesting decision.
>Rafi: ?OORTTU -  +0 324
#note Knowing Jeff's rack, plus the contents of the bag, I really should have put more thought into this play. My mistake was that I thought I could Z (and maybe Q) stick him if I passed twice, because with AAEIIZS he had no Z plays. However, with the second E, he would draw ZEE in the top right, something I didn't think of. I think passing still wins 100% of the time, but definitely not by as much, and if I make a mistake in the endgame I could lose. The best play is probably TO/TYE, threatening QUaRTO, and cROQUET if he plays AZO - his only Z play.
