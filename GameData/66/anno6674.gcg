#note m1 (I)NVITAL or j8 ANVIL are liked better.  i'm a bit too fond of the V - i'm not sure what's best here either.  i guess playing 6 off with INVITAL gives me a much better shot at getting the ??

#note i'm blind to that d6 AVIO(N) spot, though i'm low on time.  That scores 29 and keeps me really in the game.  The next 2 best plays are 13i O(L)IVE or A(L)IVE which i strongly considered. Then 12h VI(T)AE and then a drop off in win% to my play and 6b VIO(L).  My thinking was to keep a bingo lane open (N column) whilst giving myself another potential lane if i got the S or ?.   I wish i could think these situations out more clearly under time pressure.
