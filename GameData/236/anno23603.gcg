#note I really didn't want to do this and almost played 6F BR(U)IN. But this could really work out for me if Marty has a good play somewhere other than column O, and since BRR doesn't scream fish (it screams "no vowels!"), playing there might not be a high priority for him.

#note 7F MA(X)I is 28, but keeps one more vowel when the pool is very vowel-heavy. MAXI also makes it less likely that the top left corner of the board ever gets opened.

#note I didn't see 5J (T)I(N)E until next turn. (R)A(T)I(N)E is even better. I was too focused on overlapping/underlapping WEPT.

#note STREElING or STREEkING are probably better to minimize chances of a bingo comeback.

#note FEW(E)R might be better even with all the A's in the bag, but hanging the E out there is much more helpful for theoretical Marty bingos than the A. Quackle prefers 10I AW by quite a bit...does this give up scoring plays more often than I think?
>Marty_Gabriel: HO E10 OH +22 329
>Charles_Reinke: AEEEGGV 5E VEE. +16 377
#note All of Quackle's preferred plays keep the V. It must be more useful for scoring than the two G's. I think I would have played A3 GEEGA(W) had I seen it.
>Marty_Gabriel: JO L14 JO +23 352
#note Marty was at around thirty seconds when he made this play.
>Charles_Reinke: AAADEGG 10I AG +20 397
#note 2G AGA(P)AE is nice because I'll always draw an out-play. I should be playing more tiles so I can go out quicker, I think.

>Charles_Reinke: AADEGI 13M .G +3 400
#note Blocking plays involving HAJIS. I don't necessarily have to block, though, if I do something like 15G AGI(O). I didn't realize that Marty could just go out with UN(A)IS; luckily, that won't win him the game.
