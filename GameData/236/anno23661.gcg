#note this was deeply frustrating. i have no idea whether he's going to see EEEW next turn; he played FELLO* incredibly quickly and thought since he made EEW that he would think and see it next turn. having no way to block both spots, i have to make my best play; something like K3 LOVAT. OVAL is actually not that great because he can't hit that spot anyway. however, i could just do something like TAV/GIT if i'm pretty sure he won't see it. i just don't know. -6.5

#note this type of move never works agaisnt a human being. no use trying it. he might also get suspicious about eeew. quackle of course likes it best... maybe HEFT? scrabble is hard.

#note if that one didn't make him suspicious this must. so frustrating. -4, quackle suggests DEV/VET taking the spot... maybe i can beat him on a closed board.
