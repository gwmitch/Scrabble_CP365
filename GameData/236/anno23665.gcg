#note Final, winner-determining game for Division 3 at 2016's Arden Cup tournament in Chicago.
>Dan_Heck: DIY 8G YID +14 14
>Tim_O'Hara: DV H7 V.D +7 7
#note Racks were not recorded by either side.  Still, I like to preserve matches like these for posterity.

>Tim_O'Hara: AF D12 FA +20 42
>Dan_Heck: ?AEHIJS J2 HEJIrAS +82 143
#note Happy to remember this word.  Quackle likes this position best, and doesn't even consider the FAH hook from D14 among it's top choices, presumably because of the danger of a powerful counter-score.
>Tim_O'Hara: ILT 4J .ILT +22 64
>Dan_Heck: DEFOTU 13C F.DEOUT +42 185
#note Aggressive move that sets up a Q-danger, but I figure this play gives me a double-bingo-sized lead and turns tiles.
>Tim_O'Hara: AEINPRT 14H PAINTER +78 142
#note Turns out the open bingo lane was more of a threat than the TWS!

>Tim_O'Hara: ?AEINOT A8 ATONIEs +79 267
#note Excellent setup for a key bingo.  As I told Tim later, I tend to forget this hook even exists.

>Tim_O'Hara: IORT 12J RIOT +18 285
>Dan_Heck: Q K11 Q. +22 329
#note Lucky to be given a place to dump this, as late in the game as it's become.
>Tim_O'Hara: AALX B5 AXAL +29 314
>Dan_Heck: ACELT A1 CLEAT +26 355
>Tim_O'Hara: CEU C5 CUE +23 337
#note This was the true turning point.  Had either of us known that TAC* was phony, the endgame changes dramatically, as you'll see in a few turns.
>Dan_Heck: L M1 ..L. +12 367
#note Biding my time here.
>Tim_O'Hara: EY 10I YE +14 351
>Dan_Heck: BGIRSSU D1 GRUBS +26 393
#note If Tim had been purposely bluffing with TAC* and challenges the equally phony plural off, he has an easy out-play for the win.  As it is, I had to score, and my tracking dictates this play instead of the higher-scoring BURGS (which allows BOWING).
>Tim_O'Hara: GINOW 1D .OING +21 372
#note Outplay LOWING at L4 doesn't score enough.
>Dan_Heck: IS N4 SI +14 407
>Dan_Heck:  (W) +8 415
#note Final score tallied as 414-381.
