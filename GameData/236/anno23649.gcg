#note Championship player took a while here, as did I. N1 (E)N is at 80.56% to win. My thinking here is as long as she doesn't bingo from the B or O, I win. Those are both VERY hard letters to bingo with considering the unseen pool.

So if I fish and leave DEPORT on my rack, a lot of my draws result in bingoes. I wouldn't have thought like that, given my lead. If she doesn't bingo, and I don't draw into a bingo, I still win because of my lead, so I should have considered a fish. 

After a 3 tile draw, I figured I would take my chances that she doesn't bingo with the B AND W unseen with 2 in the bag.
