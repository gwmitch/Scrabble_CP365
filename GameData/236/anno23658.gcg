#note i actually didn't really bother looking for a bingo after seeing CODIFY keeping E? -- however, COnFIDE/COIFfED at 5I score significantly.  oops. -8

#note 1G GLOM sims a lot better, because of the leave, but the board only really has a couple good lanes right now. i thought i would score with MELLOW and keep the pressure up. B10 GLIME is anther in-between choice. -6.5

#note quackle likes playing AVGAS here at 14J to kill the board. it actually likes it much better by win%. the bag is pretty decent.
>d_weiss: BMO 1A MOB +30 387
>cesar: ADRRSTX 14I DART +13 430
#note i was low on time, but not that low. this is a poor endgame play, although it still wins. DARTS is better, but 13E RITARDS is far best as it goes out next turn. i should have seen it but i wasn't even really thinking through the "i" other than DIRTS which doesn't work. -28

#note and then i somehow manage to do this with 2 seconds on my clock. why did i even have 2 seconds on my clock? what a stupid game.

#note lol.

#note Sadly, this was the first time I've ever seriously considered stopping playing Scrabble competitively, mainly because I was thinking I'll never be able to not make dumb mistakes like this. But then reason took over again. It's just practice. I should go to club more often.
