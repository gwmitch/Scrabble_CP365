>Marty_Gabriel: GLORY 8H GLORY +26 26
>Charles_Reinke: DEENNOR L8 .ONDER +20 20
#note Or L6 DO(Y)ENNE, which sets up two DLS-DWS combo spots. I definitely like this over RODNE(Y) to set up an S hook.
>Marty_Gabriel: AEU 13K U.EA +8 34
>Charles_Reinke: EEIJNST 10J JI. +26 46
#note Missed O8 EEJITS, which is the most effective way of dealing with Marty's apparent setup(?). Obviously EENST will bingo often to make up for not blocking.
>Marty_Gabriel: NO M10 NO +16 50
#note Scored as 15.
>Charles_Reinke: ?EEINST O8 TENnESI +76 122
#note I spent way too long here looking for something that didn't put such an easy letter at O8/O9.
>Marty_Gabriel: ELT N12 T.LE +14 64
>Charles_Reinke: BCEFHMW N6 CHEW +25 147
#note 14I CWM actually looks really good. I always miss that word. K12 B(U)MF is probably an improvement also.
>Marty_Gabriel: ADEIRST 14E TARDIES +64 128
>Charles_Reinke: BFHMPST -BFHMP +0 147
#note Is I13 F(I)B worth it? Probably. Bad time for a draw like this.
>Marty_Gabriel: AGIILNR H1 GLAIRIN. +83 211
>Charles_Reinke: DRSSTTU H12 DU.S +24 171
#note Missed STARDUST and DISTRUST. That's bad. I will apologize now for feeling a small amount of resentment at my "bad" draw.
>Marty_Gabriel: AOP G2 APO +19 230
>Charles_Reinke: FNRRSTT 6F FR.T +15 186
#note Couldn't remember if you could spell this with two T's. You can.
>Marty_Gabriel: AMW E5 MAW +24 254
#note Forgot about that hook when I played FRIT. I'm really playing well this game!
>Charles_Reinke: ENORSTV 15A TROVE +38 224
>Marty_Gabriel: AMU D3 AMU +14 268
>Charles_Reinke: ADINNOS C3 NOD +22 246
#note Forgot about MAW(N)...8A ANION.
>Marty_Gabriel: III -III +0 268
>Charles_Reinke: AFINSUX 13F FA.X +48 294
#note 8A AUXIN is not an option for reasons stated earlier.

>Charles_Reinke: ACELOUV 2G ..EC +12 390
#note Couldn't risk Marty finding something from the G, down to the R, through AL, or through PA. PlIGHTER is the only thing that works.
