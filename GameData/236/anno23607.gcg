#note There's something to be said for playing 10F EASIER and building up a bingo-sized lead. I was focused on fishing though.

>Charles_Reinke: DEHIRSS 10F DISHERS +84 221
#note Phony. Seems like something I would have played when I was rated 900. Maybe if I had thought about it a little harder I would have realized that it didn't look familiar.

#note (OR)EODONTS was sadly blocked. I considered ODEON in this spot but didn't see that it played at 11I. I think that's definitely better since it sets up an S hook and scores quite a bit.

#note Second phony bingo of the game! Take that loser! Unlike DISHERS, this one seemed off to me, but I played it anyway.

>Charles_Reinke: ?EEEKLO O11 EKE. +13 414
#note Weird situation, since I have to block the triple-triple but can't do it while also scoring a reasonable amount of points.
