>Charles_Reinke: EEHIKLO H6 OKEH +22 22
#note I saw HOELIKE. It's probably worth trying on the first turn, especially since it's a word.

#note Maybe something simple like 11C AHI, although that just makes scoring plays on row 13 even higher-scoring.

>Charles_Reinke: ACEEESZ D7 ZEE +18 235
#note This was a tough one. I wanted to get rid of the Z; maybe I don't need to this turn though. 13A ZEE is an obvious candidate but it will often give up just as many points as it scores, on a board with few scoring opportunities other than row 1. I didn't see 14H SEZ which deserves consideration.
