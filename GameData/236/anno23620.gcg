>Joshua_Sokol: AABCMOQ H4 ABOMA +20 20
#note The Q has been absolutely destroying me lately. Bug off!
>Michael_Fagen: FLW 6G W.LF +18 18
>Joshua_Sokol: CEFINQT I3 QI +23 43
#note Thought it was close between this and 8G Q(A)T, which leaves Michael with much less to do. Ultimately decided that based on WOLF's range, QI should be fine. 
>Michael_Fagen: DNOR J6 .ROND +13 31
#note I was right!
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEFNTU 3I .UEEN +28 71
#note Wasn't thrilled with this position. Debated (W)EFT G6 for a while as well, and I probably should have played it. QUEEN gave back much more, although I also relied on inference to judge how much it really gave Michael. It looked like his leave was not that great, and at least not something that could burn me after QUEEN. Also, I thought he might not know the new hook for the word.
>Michael_Fagen: IMO 4L MOI +20 51
#note I was only mistaken about one thing after QUEEN, and that was judging what the worst thing that could happen was.
>Joshua_Sokol: CFGPSTT 8G F.G.T +9 80
#note And drawing this, although not the worst thing, is pretty bad if it's coupled with Michael's gutsy last play of MOI.
>Michael_Fagen: ITZ 7J .ITZ +25 76
>Joshua_Sokol: ACGPSTY N2 PY.C +40 120
#note That was a good draw, though! Michael challenges the play, as I suspected might happen
>Michael_Fagen: AEEEGII -  +0 76
>Joshua_Sokol: ADGOSTT J2 G.T +11 131
#note I was very unsure of whether or not FROND took an S. I knew it was pretty safe if I played FRONDS, but did not know what I would do if he did. In that sense I should have played 11E DATTOS here. This was a middling play. I should have considered more things here. I also considered 8M AGO but my previous experience of leaving 4 consonants stopped me in my tracks.
>Michael_Fagen: ?ALNORS 11D ReLOANS +72 148
#note I held for a while, and finally let it go. I was very unhappy here though, as although Michael had lost a turn, he was in very good shape after this. I had seen that he drew another S, and a U. If it weren't for me seeing that U I might have had to challenge, since I was really not in good shape at all.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDOSTV H11 .VAST +36 167
#note I considered AVO 8M, and again, did not want to leave myself with no vowels if I didn't have to. I considered ADD in the same spot, but didn't like leaving myself with the useless V with not many ways to use it, unless I draw something lucky down H11. So I decided reluctantly to just score points here. I knew he had an S, so there was no value in me using my own to make a setup later, which diminished its value significantly.
>Michael_Fagen: AAHSU 8M AAH +29 177
>Joshua_Sokol: DDINOVW D10 D.OWND +26 193
#note Hoped he would challenge, but apparently he knew this. I think it came up in one of our previous games throughout the years.
>Michael_Fagen: EIOX 15A OXI.E +39 216
#note Hit his clock, then realized he missed (ZA)X. Just the story of my games against Michael lately. How does he do it?
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEIIV O6 AC.IEVE +16 209
#note I was definitely on tilt this turn. Perhaps I am answering my own question from the previous turn. I know he still has SU. I can exploit that, since it means he doesn't have as much flexibility as a normal rack would have. I missed using these same tiles for 10 more, achieving my largest mistake in this game. Blegh. Can't afford mistakes against Michael. VE(S)ICAE should be an easy find.
>Michael_Fagen: DESU 14A DE +27 243
#note still keeping that U, eh? I hope he will draw one of the two other U's, so that I can have some exploitable fodder
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEIIJT C8 AJI +21 230
#note EJI(DO) is safer and I missed it, but he has US. He should be in trouble here.
>Michael_Fagen: EGSU 8A US.GE +24 267
#note Finally he is forced to sacrifice a lot to remain in control of the game, sort of.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEEHIT 14H .HEETIEr +74 304
#note And then I just blow everything to shambles. To be fair, this is the only play that puts me in a good position, besides other, worse phonies. I thought it was good, and so did he. 
>Michael_Fagen: BEIKLOR E1 ROBELIK. +78 345
>Michael_Fagen: BEIKLOR --  -78 267
#note Wonder if he would have challenged if he didn't have a possible comeback play. I was very wary about this being valid. I had no idea, but I had to challenge. Lucky it's no good. It should be a word.
>Joshua_Sokol: ALNNUUY B2 ANNULU. +18 322
#note My tilt got so extreme while I was holding ROBELIKE*, because I had just draw the two remaining U's, when justice should have dictated otherwise. Just don't miss VE(S)ICAE, Josh...

Hoped to get another free turn here
>Michael_Fagen: BEIKLOR B10 KI +34 301
#note He can't realistically win here, so perhaps trying to outrun me if I have PRRRSTI or something should be his go-to here.
>Joshua_Sokol: EOPRSTY E1 SEROTYP. +76 398
#note But I got the good draw. Justice was served!
>Michael_Fagen: BEILORR -  +0 301
