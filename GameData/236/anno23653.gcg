>Andrew_Fisher: BCGGNOO 8G BOG +12 12
#note BOGONG is much stronger but I wasn't 100% on it, fearing confusion with BUGONG
>Ayorinde_Saidu: AIKSV J4 KIVAS +27 27
>Andrew_Fisher: CGLMNNO 5F CLON.NG +20 32
>Ayorinde_Saidu: DHO 6F HOD +35 62
>Andrew_Fisher: AHIMRRS 4B MARRI +22 54
#note There is a play to OD, namely RAMROD which sims best. Otherwise it may have been better to keep an R as well (RAMI), or go for score with MAHSIR M2
>Ayorinde_Saidu: DVY C3 D.VY +22 84
>Andrew_Fisher: AAEHLSY 4H HA.EA +53 107

>Andrew_Fisher: AELPRSY 10B SPARELY +91 198
>Ayorinde_Saidu: ?AEEOTT B7 EcO.TATE +64 176
#note The only bingo, but saving the blank is not unreasonable (e.g. TOTE 11B)
>Andrew_Fisher: ABFGTWZ A12 BAFT +50 248

>Ayorinde_Saidu: INNRU 15D INRUN +22 206
>Andrew_Fisher: GIOQUWW A5 WOW +14 307
#note Never saw QUICH which is clearly best, perhaps on later moves too. Failing that, WOW is quite adventurous but perhaps a good ploy with such a strong lead
>Ayorinde_Saidu: DEL 12A ..LED +26 232
>Andrew_Fisher: GIIOQSU 8A S.OG +48 355
>Ayorinde_Saidu: AELMNOT 14F OMENTAL +73 305
>Andrew_Fisher: IIIQTTU L11 QUI.T +30 385
#note With so many Is unseen, even dumps like TITI J12 fare quite well in the sim. QUILT beats out QUICH for similar reasons, as well as killing S hooks to CLONING
>Ayorinde_Saidu: PU 15L .UP +5 310
>Andrew_Fisher: EIIIIOT 14N OI +12 397
#note Saidu's play condemns me to an equity hit whatever I do, but this blocks most of his opportunities. EUOI 12K also works well
>Ayorinde_Saidu: ?CEEIRS M6 CERESIn +72 382
>Andrew_Fisher: EEIIITU 13G ETUI +20 417
#note OK, TIE/CERESINE has a slightly better net margin
>Ayorinde_Saidu: EJ I2 JE.. +12 394
