#note Phony. Not only that, but I've played this before and had it challenged off (back when I was rated 1000 or something). I will get my revenge though.
>Charles_Reinke: EGIMNSW 11G SMEWING +79 322
#note Phony. If I had stopped to think about this I wouldn't have played it, since I knew that SMEW was a noun.

#note Might as well keep phonying. I was a little doubtful of this one. NEOMYCIN is good.

#note I managed not to play a phony here. Should have tried MUXIT* or WAER* or something.

#note Sloppy game. SMEWING is embarrassing. I think I phonied more in this tournament than in the whole rest of my life (plus six past lives and an infinite amount of lives in parallel dimensions) combined.
