#note i need to learn to exchange i think. FOG/FOGY/FOB still sim a little better than exchanging, but this rack has no hope for a few more turns. -1.5 to just FOG; the Y is a good letter to have for DITZY, FOGY, etc.

#note this was a really tough move. i can't possibly leave that lane open, i feel, but N2 BIMAH is kind of creative as a spot to score for my Q next turn. also, i might have a good comeback if he bingoes at the bottom. I don't like B12 BIOG as it's not taking into account inferences. can someone come up with a better blocking move? GEM? :( -5.5
