>Andrew_Fisher: AACEEGT 9F GATE +18 18
#note With little on offer, I thought it made sense to offer myself an A-hook. More circumspect would be GETA in the same spot or over the top, and it does look as though Ayo is manoeuvring to bingo soon.
>Ayorinde_Saidu: ?EEILNP E7 ELaPINE +71 83

#note CANOPIES scores 80, nothing in it

>Ayorinde_Saidu: HINOOST --  -40 127
>Andrew_Fisher: OOOPQRS 10B Q. +31 201
#note MOMA* no good - after the game he wondered if I should have blocked his OMA backup, but 34 is hardly worth concerning oneself with when a Q can be dumped. Of course the rack may also mature to a bingo if drawing E
>Ayorinde_Saidu: AMO K4 OMA +34 161
>Andrew_Fisher: OOOPRSU L4 OUP +41 242
#note I overlooked POROUS L1 here for an extra ten points - the S retention and greater defence virtually make up the difference on sim
>Ayorinde_Saidu: ADEFGMN 14B F.G +14 175
#note Actual rack - the sim bears out that he chose well here, hoping to bingo soon while conserving the tile pool
>Andrew_Fisher: ADOORST I11 ADO +17 259
#note My choice aimed to restrict the easy bingo lanes in 11 and 13, while also providing myself a further S-hook. I think it's better than POD 10E as favoured by Quackle
>Ayorinde_Saidu: ADEMNTU 15D UNTAMED +87 262
>Andrew_Fisher: IKORSST 8A SK.I. +30 289
#note Just KAIL crossed my mind, but it's a bit too cute and will be blocked anyway
>Ayorinde_Saidu: HN H11 H.N +13 275

>Andrew_Fisher: ?ADIOTT 10E .OT +18 429
#note This actually tops the win% sim - clearly he hadn't held the X last time, but it would be easiest for him to score over 30 here with A/E/I, whereas the C column would require A or E as well as the X. Also not unreasonable bingo prospects from 14I, especially if drawing an R.
>Ayorinde_Saidu: EVX C3 VEX +42 422
>Andrew_Fisher: ?ADIRTV D4 AT +29 458
#note Mine scores well and kills off an easy 35 for JA, but that's a bit of a chimera because his putative rack leave would be so bad. Better would have been HAVARTI 11H which wins virtually all games
>Ayorinde_Saidu: ADIJNRW M1 WIND +24 446
#note HADJI is slightly better, giving RAWN outplays at M1 or 14I
>Andrew_Fisher: ?DIRUV K8 yRIVD +23 481
#note As far as I could see there was only one outplay, but rather than blocking it and running a small risk of feeling foolish I just went for the score (especially with AJI on offer if he elected not to play out)
