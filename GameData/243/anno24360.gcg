#note this sucks. i knew after that move that he must have kept a pretty good leave (probably with the S) so i did not necessarily want to give up some easy points, but maybe it's worth trying to draw out the S. my PIRN sims about 4 points worse. I don't know what the right thing to do is here at all. most likely i am not going to win.

#note FUN is significantly better. he can't hit the triple, and i have the case N, and my leave is ok through his E maybe. wish i was better!!! -4.5
