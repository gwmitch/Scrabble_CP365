#note T: F4 NAV (not to mention a bunch of other stuff) sims a lot better, with a vowel or two on the draw I could easily bingo with the CHNRT leave.

#note T: 6B WINY, don't think I saw that which is weird.

#note M: Thought VIEWTUBE* might have been added, but thankfully talked myself out of it - confused it wiht VIEWPORT+

#note T: 36 points is 36 points.

>Mack_Meller: ?BEEEEL 4B .EE +18 270
#note M: First missed bingo of the tournament is a real toughie: C5 ENfEEBLE. This isn't so much worse anyway since it keeps the blank, about a 12 point mistake.

#note T: Tough play here, I didn't like the obvious 2B TO, but it's the only thing that has a chance here against an aware opponent. With TO I can draw for the top row stuff in TENAILS, stuff in STEARIN, TAWNIES, or EARSTONE on the O column. With PIU I was going for one of the three unseen O's for OZONATES, but can also draw EARSTONE. The problem with this play is it basically needs to have OR in the bag to work, and hope Mack blocks the wrong lane.
>Mack_Meller: IIILORW 15F WI. +15 419
#note M: Anything that blocks OZONATES wins.

>Mack_Meller: IILOOR C11 ROIL +18 437
>Thomas_Reinke: AEST 6H .AST +27 410
#note T: Ran out of time, missed 6J STEAD for 37. Not a well played game by me at all.
>Mack_Meller: IO A1 OI. +11 448
#note M: The blank in DROPPER was actually the second P, not the first, but I'm just going to leave it as is since it doesn't change the game in any material way except that ROIL actually scored 18 instead of 21. The final score was thus 450-410. T: Fixed it, I can't live with annotated games not being perfect representations of what actually transpired on the board.
