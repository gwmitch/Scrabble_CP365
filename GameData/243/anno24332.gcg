#note Oh my god, this is phony and I didn't even think about it. I suck.
>Morris_Greenberg: HLNOSST A4 HO.TS +36 226
#note I was choosing between 15H HOLTS, and HOOTS this turn. Because there's only 1 L in the pools left that can go in the RIA spot, I felt comfortable with leaving that open (I have 2 letters that can go there). Quackle likes this more of the two plays I considered, but likes OH 7H just as much! That didn't even cross my mind at the time, but I still prefer playing off the 2 extra consonants here.

>Morris_Greenberg: BEEHIJO B1 JIBE +31 333
#note There's something to be said for EH N13 here. It scores almost as much, and leaving the J unexposed could make it very hard for Chuck to decide how to play next turn. The problem with JIBE is not only that it gives back A(J)I, but that once I play it to tie Chuck, he can make a huge Z or Q play in column D without worrying about big counterplays.
