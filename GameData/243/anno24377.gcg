#note W: Missed the much superior 7D spots.
>Thomas_Reinke: BILTTWX 13C TW.XT +30 116
#note T: Only considered this and 14D BETWIXT. 15D BRITT looks (and sims) a lot better, blocking the triple and setting up my X.
>Will_Anderson: ?AALMNU 15A MANU.iAL +140 244
#note W: Undeserved after missing my best play last turn. Can't really complain about how the rest of the game unfolded.
>Thomas_Reinke: BEILRUZ F2 BRULZIE +99 215
#note T: Lucky to have this to keep me in the game.
>Will_Anderson: ADDEOPY 11K YOD +30 274
>Thomas_Reinke: ABGIILO 12D O.A +33 248
#note T: Keeping up the scoring as best as I can, didn't see 14A OBI. I was looking at all the N's in the pool and thought this leave didn't seem so bad.
>Will_Anderson: AADEEMP 14A APE +25 299
>Thomas_Reinke: BCGIILP -BIGLIP +0 248
#note T: Any possible play here blocks bingo lines, which I didn't want to do for a mere 14 or whatever points.
>Will_Anderson: ADEEMQU 5C QUA.MED +38 337
#note W: Oops, not good. I played it without a second thought. Actually all of my energy this turn went into whether I should play DEMARQUE*. Funny that if I make the normal play of QUEUED I'd have an M to play on top of his response.

>Thomas_Reinke: EIJORSV D1 V.RJ.S +40 368
#note T: D3 JUVIE is so much better than this, it's actually kind of embarrassing.
>Will_Anderson: BEGINNV 1G GIBE +37 403
#note W: Crud, BENIGN is so good. Blocks the two easiest lines, scores, and draws 6 towards the esses. Keeping the E with GIB is pretty important too. Really bad job by me here.
>Thomas_Reinke: DEINOPT 4H POINTED +86 454
#note W: Was cool to find out postgame that VERJUS left EIO T: Something something lucky, blah blah blah better than good, whatever whatever.
>Will_Anderson: AENNNSV B1 N.N +3 406
#note W: I think this is the way to go here but it's tough. Dumb 2 ply sim says I bingo 25% after it, with a ton of those hitting pretty hard, including EVASION on the most common draw of IO and a bunch more (AVENGES, AVENSES, ALEVINS, ENSLAVE) down A, and a bunch more nice options like EVANGELS and maybe the walk off grand slams VASELINE or NOVELLAS down O. On the negative side, my play scores 3 points - but given that the G is the heaviest tile in the bag, it's tough to imagine Thomas scoring well enough to outrun me without also emptying the bag, in which case a bingo nearly always wins.

#note W: This game was a pretty awful experience
