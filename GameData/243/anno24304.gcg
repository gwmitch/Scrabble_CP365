#note probably should play DOGGY here... his play is hard if he doesn't have or misses APOD, but this isn't the kind of board I should have here.
>Mike_Stafford: ADO G4 ADO +24 52
>Jackson_Smylie: ADGGISV F6 GIG +17 68
#note VIGS sims ahead, the S isn't particularly useful here. can also consider GAG cause an N draw works well with that spot. 
>Mike_Stafford: EHINO 8A HOEIN. +33 85
>Jackson_Smylie: ADNSSTV D7 V.ANDS +20 88
#note wasn't a fan of DEVS here, I think VIANDS ends up working better with my leave. Q prefers divans to give an A lane over a D lane. Sim likes DEVS best cause of opp scoring/bingo percent, but I feel like and open board here suits me well.

#note BECKET I didn't know. I like holding ECK here cause I get words like ACKEE, ICKER, and OCKER fairly often. 
>Mike_Stafford: ?AEELRW 12F RE.EWALs +70 235
>Jackson_Smylie: ACEHKQU M9 QUA.H +52 230
#note Quackle likes playing at L7 obviously. Lots to consider here and lots I missed. QUASH is fairly standard, and seems better than CHEQU(E) based on the leave. HACKE(E) for 6 fewer is interesting, with the QU working fairly well along the M column. QU is still kind of inflexible here, so I'd probably take QUASH over hackee, which is bad if my main spot is blocked. I didn't see cheque or hackee over the board, but instead debated between QUAsH and KAE for a long time - KAE 11K sets up QU(Es)T for 46, but more importantly gives us QUICH(E) for 80 if we draw one of the 5 I's! Quackle says I overthought this and should just play QUAsH, winning the sim by about 14 points. 
>Mike_Stafford: FRTU 3D TURF +23 258
>Jackson_Smylie: CEIKPWY 10B WI.KY +31 261
#note KEWPI(E) is an awesome word. I missed PE(A)KY. I was very sure I'd get away with this phony, and he may doubt the T hook.

#note ETA/SQUASHER is a play I missed, but is nice it can deal with J?T? plays with JUICE or JUNCO drawn a lot. I wanted a play that left me surefire options with the J but saw none. He also plays J??? plays at 4a a lot, which are hard for me to deal with. My hope is that an out in two after DIE and a J play could outrun him, especially with twinky in hand. Kind of iffy cause I'll be down 21 after a play like JANE. Q likes DIE or ETA, but what about CIAO? I should probably play that to prevent bad J scenarios, cause after CIAO this game is a lot more difficult. I am liking ciao more now, cause I can save squasher or die plays later (and there is a good chance squasher goes unnoticed, as it did for me). 
>Mike_Stafford: EJLO 4A JOLE +42 346

#note I couldn't find any win (there isn't any), but hoping he misses GAMINS and fucks up I could go out next turn.
