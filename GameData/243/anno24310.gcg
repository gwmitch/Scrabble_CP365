#note lots of options here - fucked this up largely cause I missed TEGG. Even so, I thought VAGI kept things difficult and closed, but I don't want to play VAGI here and make the EGG hooks hard to deal with. VAGI is also really shitty for me, so an open board here is preferable, especially if I'm leaving tegg open. VIKING or VIGIA (to set up the K) are nice. I might consider KIVA in a different position, cause EGG doesn't often keep high scoring tiles, but still not good to set up that possibility if he draws something. Main thing is to not make a play like vagi, making the board more volatile

#note And I end up making a play that's even worse, setting up this big S hook. luckily I can block it with OKA next turn, but it's still gonna be a shitty play. I considered INVOKE as well, which i like a lot more now. I played very scared this tournament, which costed me.

>Jackson_Smylie: ADEHINT J4 DAH +35 137
#note Maybe I should play HA to set up a lane. he doesn't always play there, and might give me another lane after that. HA is probably better. I don't need a closed board!!!!!

#note ugh maybe I just exchange here... nothing is good. xOUU or GOUT are not very inspiring, but keeping EOU gets outrun a lot. Wishing I had played HA
