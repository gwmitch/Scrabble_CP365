#note actual rack. he said he was close to playing WICKYUP for 100 here, and I would have definitely challenged!

>Jackson_Smylie: ADEHILN 9H INHALED +69 135
#note INHALED or HANDLIKE? I figured INHALED gets overlapped a lot, closing things down.

#note A(NA)LOgIST for 86 here!

#note Y(E)W is probably better here, has more options than just O1 scoring/HUGELY. Q likes toughy, maybe cause now there's two scoring spots so I am guaranteed at least a 30something play. toughy is okay cause it will use the space on the top, but I'm happy to keep it tight right now. options after YEW are okay if o1 gets taken.

>Jackson_Smylie: DGHRTUY 4J HUG..Y +34 302
#note totally missed pUDGY (and purty), which is better to avoid this risk. I saw nothing close to comparable, and there is another binto lane on the board, so I figured HUGELY might just be worth it. it's not. have to avoid disaster scenarios!

>Jackson_Smylie: DDEIINR 6I IRID +22 324
#note DIN might actually bingo some on this board. I wanted to take out the S hook (perhaps shouldn't be a priority here, but I feel like I will want to take it out soon if I am to outrun, so now's a good time to make little sacrifice). Q says DIN bingoes 17%, which might make it worth it.

#note suddenly the pool is terrible, and especially for me cause odor probably didn't keep three consonants, stuff like LOR or ORU or maybe ORB make sense. FOVEA is the standard play, but I could absolutely get caught with junk, like UUVBP or something. might still win, but I wanted insurance that I'll be okay next turn, and the 4a spot isn't really going away without howard being fucked over. I wanted to draw few tiles here and keep a flexible leave with the pool. Quackle likes DEF, which is a clever spread play, but he could have 6s ending with S or even BRULOTS/RUBOUTS
