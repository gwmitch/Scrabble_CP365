>Morris_Greenberg: ADEKNRV N1 .ARKED +36 306
#note Maybe HANKED instead, because the only bingo lane starts with a P, so the R is better synergy than the N.
>Dustin_Dean: Y 4J Y.. +6 230
>Morris_Greenberg: EGHILRV H13 .GH +21 327
#note Even with the blanks out, the spot Dustin created isn't that probable (have to end in A, B, M, or O), and also low scoring. It seemed more important to block the triple 7-lane.

>Dustin_Dean: A 9B A. +2 237
>Morris_Greenberg: AELMPRV 14K MEAL +20 378
#note I have to assume he had to  like BEINS? or something similar and missed/passed up bingos like IKEBANAS or PEMBINAS. He created a very tough spot to block, though something like VA(T) does block his new bingo lane. However, he's still likely to bingo next turn if I block that lane (Quackle says 48% after VAT). I can easily outrun 1 bingo. 2 is tougher. MEAL blocks the highest point lanes, which is pretty important to take care of if high point bingoes 2 turns in a row is my main concern.
