>Thomas_Reinke: DEOPRSS 8D PRODS +22 22
#note T: Exhanging the D looks best, how come I never think of stuff like that?
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEINOVY E5 OVA.Y +22 22
#note C: i had to talk myself out of playing SYNOVIAE* here. i wrote it down on my scoresheet and then kept looking at it later and being mad at myself. i was only like 20% on it though so there's no way i should ever play it.  also, i missed IVORY. need more practice anagramming, even though OVARY is close enough.
>Thomas_Reinke: AEELNRS H1 REALNES. +77 99
#note T: YES. I AM GOOD AT SCRABBLE.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEEFIIN 5H .EIF +14 36
#note C: already a pretty tough situation. quackle likes G3 FEE, and it's worth the score, just don't like blocking that many lanes... but i really really really need to score. -9
>Thomas_Reinke: EEIMPVZ D3 VIM +20 119
#note T: Uncharacteristically passing up the 39 points for 4J MEZE. Why? I don't know. IPV seemed like a crap leave, I guess.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEGINSU 1A SEIGNEU. +83 119
#note C: that is a really lucky draw to EEIN
>Thomas_Reinke: DEENPRZ 3G Z.P +27 146
#note T: Missed all the stuff through the I like PRIZE and DIZEN.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ABCKLUW 4C W.CK +27 146
#note C: G6 WUD actually sims a tiny bit better. ABCKL is a leave with a lot of scoring potential.
>Thomas_Reinke: ?DEENQR J4 Q. +11 157
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ABBELUY 6K ABBY +24 170
#note C: this is phony. i have a funny story about this play, but the margin of this notebook is too small to contain it. the right play is the really nice G6 BEDAUB. -3 
T: I KNEW this wasn't good, but I could still bingo so I let it go like a weak ineffectual non-man.
>Thomas_Reinke: ?DEEGNR L6 .REEDiNG +74 231
#note T: BERINGED is a little safer, I totally forgot about it.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?CELLTU N2 CULL. +20 190
#note C: wow, i actually missed 8 bingos here!!!! SCUTELLa is the best one. i wasn't sure enough of CULLETs (or BREEDINGS for that matter). never seen dulcetly or luculent, there's also cloudlet and lucently. christ. i should have probably found CULTLIKE, too. i'm pretty sure i was running low on time since i'm the slowest player ever, and after a little bit of time just decided to play CULLY and try again.

there is a bingo, though, that i did see, and i'm going to be mad at conrad for this one. TELLURIC through the C plays, but a few years ago he played TELLURID* on me and i challenged it off pretty quickly because I knew it was only TELLURIC. but then, thinking about it, i couldn't remember anymore whether i challenged TELLURIC or TELLURID*, and then I remembered that TELLURIDE was a word, so if TELLURIDE is good, why wouldn't TELLURID* be good? this is all your fault Conrad. -21
>Thomas_Reinke: AENOOTX K10 OXO +41 272
#note T: Trying to block a little bit, that's why I didn't play 2E OX, okay? Actually I didn't even see it. Tunnel vision is a real and dangerous thing.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?EJTTTW 3M J.T +20 210
#note C: one of the best karmic indications that i've missed something is drawing badly right after it. at this point, i knew that i must have missed at least one bingo.
>Thomas_Reinke: AEILNOT G8 .ELATION +61 333
#note T: I had to convince myself this was really a word and not just me making up something. Pretty funny, having doubts on top 20 bingos.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?AEITTW 15D TAW.IEsT +83 293
>Thomas_Reinke: AANNRUU 13C URAN.A +12 345
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEENRST A1 .TERANES +77 370
#note C: that's a super lucky draw, not gonna lie.
>Thomas_Reinke: AFIMORU 8K F.UAR +24 369
#note T: 2E OF, blocking one of his H places and slowing the game down a bit.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DDGHIOO J9 OH +28 398
#note C: misplayed this pre-endgame pretty badly apparently. i should go through all the possibilities here, but J9 OH loses 3 out of 8, and 12E DOTH apparently wins all games. i was definitely low on time, but, boo. he has HOMIE at B5 many times.
>Thomas_Reinke: EIIIMOT 14B ITEM +22 39
