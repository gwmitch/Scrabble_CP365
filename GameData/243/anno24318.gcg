#note There is something to leaving this double double lane open and play OY for 6 less at 7G or 9G, but I prefer to keep the board less volatile.

#note I held this, but wasn't sure enough to challenge. The real word in here is REPULS(E)R.

#note I prefer this to PAD(R)ONA and AP(R)ON at 14J, but if you're more aggressive, then those are preferable.

#note Maybe VA(G)I first? I have by far the most powerful tile for the spot Kristian opened, so maybe I should sit tight.

#note Quackle really dislikes this play. As I see it, This sets up a pretty high point play for me in DOOMING on a now very closed board. Although keeping the line open is the easiest way for me to take the lead, it is also the easiest way for Kristian to lock up the game. I am happy with this, though I may be wrong.
