Worth noting that throughout this entire game the J goes unseen.  After the game, we found it under his foot.

#note HELP!
HOG F2 beats my play by 9 equity points and is 5% better to win?  Admittedlty, I'll get ht with an X-play there soon.  But AAIS leave?  Yooky.

Not by tons, but CP likes AECIA L10 best?  I'm ahead.    No idea why  should slot anything in a tws lane.

#note Joel put a bingo on the board before pulling back and taking the 30 up top and saving his blank.  CP likes TuRDINE by 10 equity poiints over it.

This isn;t taking into account that I know he's sitting blank.  I want to much up that bingo possiblity in row 15

#note Aaaand I'm lucky he didn't happen to spot any of the mutiple W-bingos he had available.

>Joel_Horn: ERZ O13 REZ +40 353
#note I horribly mistracked here - I had the Z gone already somehow, which was balanced by the J under Joel's foot for matching the number of letters left to be played.

CP seems to indicate the J would've been mine and REZ wins him the game.   But I would've played JUS or something, not FUSER* the turn prior.
