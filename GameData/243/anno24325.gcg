#note This is an interesting choice of SHADOW N9 for 54 versus HOW at 8M for 32. I admit that this is a bit of an adjustment based on my ZERKS versus REZ position against Panupol on day 1. HOW is 22 fewer points, but also gives me a more controllable situation with a better leave. I prefer doing this, even though it's a lot of equity to sacrifice.

#note Quackle suggests playing ERUVS instead to leave 2 in the bag. I was choosing between 13E VERTU and this. This allows fewer bingos (and for less points), so it is preferable.

#note I convinced myself I was making up AGATE after I have had some shakiness on my knowledge of the fives throughout the tournament, so I didn't play TaRGETS 13E.
