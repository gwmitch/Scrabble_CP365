>Paul_Holser: AEPTX 8H EXPAT +30 30
>Morris_Greenberg: DEFNNNW K7 W.NNED +20 20
#note Either this or F(A)WNED. I prefer not doubling up on N's here since this board can get shut down pretty quickly.
>Paul_Holser: BDL 11I BL.D +7 37
>Morris_Greenberg: AAFGINS 7H FA +21 41
>Paul_Holser: AEY 9H YEA. +32 69
>Morris_Greenberg: AFGINSU M3 FAGINS +37 78
#note FUNGI 12E is also interesting, and Quackle prefers it. FAGINS is the kind of play that minimizes risk. If Paul has an S on this turn and I don't take this spot, he likely will and could build a huge lead on a suddenly tight board.
>Paul_Holser: AGMO L4 MAGO. +36 105
>Morris_Greenberg: ?LNNUYZ 12F LUNY +15 93
#note Z(AG) is also an option, but being patient with the Z seems fine.

>Paul_Holser: AEO L10 O.EA +18 160
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ADHKNR 13B DARK.N +27 152
#note DARK(E)N vs. HARK(E)N here is interesting. As I saw it, he just played 3 vowels so he probably is less likely than average to bingo. The D at B13 should benefit me more, while the H should on average benefit Paul more, becaue of easy underlapping opportunities for points. Quackle slightly prefers HARK(E)N naively, but it looks to be a result of DARK(E)N allowing bingoes 2% (from 11.9 to 13.9) more often to Paul with no rack inference. Given rack inference, I think that tips the scales to DARKEN.

>Morris_Greenberg: AEMPRTU B1 AP. +23 283
#note Tons of interesting options here. I missed the awesome (J)U(R)AT (I somehow only saw JURA). That or (E)RA 12B are probably a bit better as they score a bit more and get rid of an R, which is good given that there are 3 in the bag. A key here is to play short to not draw too many I's or O's.
>Paul_Holser: ILO D3 .LIO +8 283
>Morris_Greenberg: CEMRSTU C7 MUT +21 304
#note CUT is definitely better than MUT here, as seen in a few moves.
>Paul_Holser: GITW E5 TWIG +25 308
>Morris_Greenberg: CEIRRRS 1A ..RRIERS +36 340
#note I was choosing between (HA)RRIERS and (NO)IR 10K here. I thought he'd be able to block NOIR too often with plays like ET N6 that I should take the points with HARRIERS and hope I don't get C stuck. Quackle says NOIR wins 79.17% of the time, while HARRIERS wins 77.78%. I'd love to hear more thoughts on this position.
