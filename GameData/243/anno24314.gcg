#note I considered ORDER for a while, after excluding ADORER. ORDER is fairly standard here, but leaves her a lot to play through, and DRONERS makes it a lot harder to bingo, and the space will get used up quickly.

#note sort of going against what I did before... pretty much all the half decent plays set somethign up. she does not necessarily have an S, and may not play there anyways. I can also play JOOK instead, to keep more balance, but there are only two O's left so it's not likely they'll get tripled

#note I somehow saw LA/ZA but not AL/ZA, or AAL, both of which are fine. I considered the standard LOYAL and also AZO/ZOA. both plays through the Z can let her fork the board, I think I"d play ZOA if I could do it again, cause it's easier to block effectively if she doesn't have the N next turn. But still, AL is the best play. I didn't need spread here, so didn't want to risk the game with loyal
