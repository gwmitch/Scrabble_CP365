>Morris_Greenberg: LNOORRZ 8G LORN +8 8
#note Quackle prefers ORZO, but not by a ton. This lowers Avery's score by 5 points next turn, and raises ours by 5 points nxt turn compared to ORZO, so not quite worth the 18 point sacrifice.

>Avery_Mojica: III -III +0 52
>Morris_Greenberg: EGISTUZ I3 GUT +13 51
#note Quackle much prefers ZIG. I was choosing between ZIG and this during the game. I was probably being too cute here.
>Avery_Mojica: ACIORSU 6A CURIOSA +66 118
>Morris_Greenberg: EIINRSZ E5 I.NIZERS +118 169
#note Good thing I went with my gut last turn.
>Avery_Mojica: Q 8D Q. +21 139
>Morris_Greenberg: AAFHILS F9 AH +37 206
#note FA(C)IAL. I figured keeping CALIF for next turn was probably fine, but Quackle still gives the slight edge to FACIAL. 
>Avery_Mojica: BRX B4 BR.X +13 152
#note I was shocked Avery played off the X for so few at the time with the huge spot at H1, but with no A or O (for COX A6), the X is pretty dead on this board.
>Morris_Greenberg: AAFILNS A6 .ALIF +39 245
#note With Avery keeping 4 consonants probably, opening up the bingo lane seemed worthwhile over the more conservative (C)AF.
>Avery_Mojica: HP D4 PH. +21 173
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AEKNSU D11 AUK +20 265
#note I thought I was making up UN(S)pEAKS when it popped into my head. ANKU(S)hES is also lovely. Still, this is winning over 97% of the time.
>Avery_Mojica: NVVW -NVVW +0 173

>Avery_Mojica: ?ADENRS B9 DANgERS +78 251
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AEGNNS A13 NAE +19 305
#note I wanted to be safe here, NoNAGES didn't seem worth it with this huge spot open.

>Avery_Mojica: IMV N2 VIM +21 293
>Morris_Greenberg: AFIOTVY O4 IVY +15 404
#note This is super conservative. I could just score some points.
>Avery_Mojica: DEU 8L U.DE +18 311
>Morris_Greenberg: AEEFOOT A1 FETA +29 433
#note I was choosing between this and TOEA, and decided that 9 points is a bunch at this stage of the game. TOEA is better though according to Quackle.
