>Bernard_Gotlieb: IQ H7 QI +22 22
>Joshua_Sokol: AGIJNNU I6 JIN +25 25
#note Missing NINJA(!), which has to be better. GUANIN is also a good option against this particular opponent.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EN 9I NE +15 37
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGNUU 6I .EU +12 37
#note Wasn't quite sure which route to take here, so I took the "keep the board as is and see what he does with it" route. This might complicate the game, but I think I should just go with the boring AGUE at K8. Too many ways he can defeat me (DJINN, JINNI, a 7, etc.) here
>Bernard_Gotlieb: INOR 10G NOIR +22 59
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGNUW 11D NGWEE +22 59
#note Still in rough shape here from the two previous mistakes, so I'm just trying to accelerate the process of seeing what I can draw after this. The board is out of my control, I have a crappy leave, and Bernard could have anything. 11E AGUE or AWEE were considerations of mine as well, but this is more my style.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: BDO 5G BOD +20 79
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDHLSU 4D SUBAH +41 100
#note Alright, not so bad now. The game is anyone's. Although missing BUSHLA(N)D is not a fun thing. I don't know if I would have been able to pull the trigger had I seen it. Hmm... As you will soon see, Scrabble is not about not making mistakes!

#note Scrabble is about timing. Getting the right things at the right time.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEOORRY 2L OYER +27 142
#note Timing is also about your opponent's mistakes. ARROYO at A6 might have helped, but Bernard was unsure.
>Joshua_Sokol: AHIOPRZ B10 ZI.PO +76 290
#note Timing is about hitting your fishes. Keeping ZOP and hoping for an I.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ALL -  +0 142
#note And when your opponent has no more hope, Scrabble is about making the best of that.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACHLOR 1H ORACH +52 342
#note Timing doesn't care if you miss SCHOLAR. Timing doesn't mind if you don't remember LOACH. 
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ALL A6 ALL +14 156
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DILMTX 2D MIXT +34 376
>Bernard_Gotlieb: IINORTT 5K NIT +10 166
#note Timing is about your opponent having a word like INTROIT on their rack when there is nowhere to put it.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEELNR 12H sLENDER +66 442
#note Timing doesn't care if you don't remember that ZIPPO takes an S.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: OTW A13 OWT +27 193
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEFOS A1 FA.E +38 480
#note Timing doesn't care if you overlook FA(V)A for a better leave and play FA(V)E... (of note was 1A AFtOSA for 61, but I thought better of it)
>Bernard_Gotlieb: GIM 13D MIG +11 204
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEOSSU O1 A.SEnOUS +131 611
#note Timing might just give you this gift after all of your silly mistakes.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: CEFIRTT -  +0 204
>Joshua_Sokol: ADG G13 GAD +17 628
#note Scrabble is all about timing. Most of the time, you can overcome that aspect of the game with skill. Most of the time you cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that winning the unwinnable games wasn't out of your control. But some of the time, this happens. I hope you have been entertained!
