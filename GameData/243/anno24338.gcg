>Morris_Greenberg: AHILNRS 3B LARN +34 227
#note This is a really tight decision between IN(T)HRALS, HARL, and LARN. To be honest, I didn't even see INTHRALS at the time. But, sort of blocking the huge spot seems like a good move here. It's important to point out that Steve almost definitely did not have the B or F  when he played OXY, unless he's a huge risk taker. Playing LARN or HARL now allows for the damage to be limited if he did draw it, and I could play HIS B6 next turn if I have big reasons to believe it'll be a problem next turn. That was my logic for LARN over HARL, but not sure which of the three is best.

#note Another tough decision! A(P)HORISE seemed way too risky for my liking on an already crazy board.

#note Tough choice between (V)EIN and (BO)ND. It seems likely he'll play at the VEIN spot given all of the A's and I's still out. However, I can come back from a lot of those plays. I can't come back from a bingo unless I bingo, and the pool and M(E)W suggests a bingo friendly leave. One major qualm with this is that if he bingoes here, he likely blocks all of my bingos, whereas if I play something like IN F10, I could bingo back. Quackle therefore likes IN best, which wasn't on my radar really at the time.
