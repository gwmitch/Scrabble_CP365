>Orry: EOV 8G VOE +12 12
>Will: AACEGHT 7I HAG +20 20
#note Debated between both HAG placements and GHAT. 9I HAG sets up ACETA/ACUTE/ACTED draws, but 7I gives me more future options/hooks if Orry bingos, which seems likelier after VOE. If I want to be very blocky I can play I6 GAE, which dramatically drops Orry's expected score, even though Quackle doesn't think it's reducing Orry's bingo chances much somehow. To me, it looks like it would reduce it quite a bit.

>Will: ABMNTTV 10J BAM +32 168
#note I guess TAV is okay here because if I draw something good with an S there's still plenty of lines open - not like I'm blocking my last comeback line. Still figured BAM was better for long-term openness - harder for Orry to close both HAGS and READMITS on one move after BAM.

>Will: DEENTTV D8 .VENT +16 184
#note Situation just got worse in a hurry...don't think I can stomach 10F VET, just helps Orry shut it down.
>Orry: AEILOSS O3 LOIASES +85 338
>Will: ADEFNPT N6 FAT.ED +37 221
#note Might be smarter to play FATTEN to keep the S hook alive.

>Will: AGOORSU J2 U. +4 299
#note Orry obviously has EE. I'm distracting him and trying to draw A(UT)OGIROS or A(UT)OGYROS 12A. Sucks to score only 4, though - probably not the best idea for that reason alone. Although the score is still kind of close going into this turn I felt like KING signaled that I'm a pretty massive underdog here, and that I'm less likely to get bingos a normal way. I envisioned a path to victory where Orry blocks hopefully weakly, I bingo blocking his setup, and somehow draw another heavy hitting play somewhere. Shrug, might just be the allure of making a "clever" play. Almost did more normal 12B AUTO to block EKING plays and set up a line; that's probably what I should do.
