#note Pretty ugly leave, but it doesn't give Nick many options.

#note I thought this was just worth it. Exchaning could be better though.

#note I thought of LU(FA)*, but not TU(FA)! I think I just really need to move some tiles here though.

#note Not a lot of great options here. This keeps what I thought was a pretty good scoring leave and leaves the board pretty open. One neat idea is UKE 14E, which keeps good bingo lanes with a bingo-prone leave. I also thought about HUNKIE, but I didn't really care for it. I do think that if I'm going to keep bingo tiles, UKE 14E is the thing to do because it keeps the board more conducive to my tiles. UKE 8D seems pretty good but I don't thik it scores enough. This play might not be so great.

#note What's interesting abou this play?
>Noah: CEEIIKN E5 KINE +20 297
#note Is this right? Hard to decide on a play here.
>Nick: ?LNRRVZ 6B ViZ.R +26 322
#note Tough play, and Nick's actual rack. Not sure if exchanging is really feasible here. ZoRIL might be a good play though. On the other hand, the V is poison on this board.

#note Here's another hint: this play is similarly interesting.
