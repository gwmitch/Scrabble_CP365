#note Jesse Day is Matchplay: Round 4, Game 4. After the thriller last game to go up 3-0, do I have the rating doctor on the ropes?

#note I don't really think I considered the possibility of (W)OOF. The point of this play was to go for something like C(H)ANOYU or any of other big plays next turn, but taking YUC(H) now leaves (W)OOF or OF for next turn, accomplishing the same thing. oops.

#note Struggled with this play. This play sims best. I think it's OK to get Quackly# here because theres lots of 1 point tiles to draw into bingos next turn. He won't always have ES, also. Open to other ideas, though.

#note blank vision fail - 7K plays. This play is still really good, but not good to miss the other plays.

#note Might have tried DEVISoR(Y)* if I hadn't recently heard a story about it being phony.

#note Blocked SKLENTS, but gave him this back. turning point, as it turned out.

>Doug: DDI D2 DID +20 391
>dacrON: AAAEENU 13C AA. +18 359
#note The thought is, he probably didn't have the Q after DID, so maybe I can grab it this turn, then go for a fish next turn. Alternatively, drawing an R or T leaves me in a position to fish for a potential win, too.
>Doug: OST M12 TO.S +31 422
>dacrON: AEEINQU 7K .E +10 369
#note Oddly enough missed QUE(Y). That's definitely the best play here. I can draw bingos in both spots and he can not have a bingo of his own. I was going for an L bingo. Considered dropping the E for 3 with (D)E and threaten ANTIQUE or something, but thought I might get outrun with QUINIELA or whatever after he plays in row E. After last game, though, Doug was on high alert.
>Doug: EGINORT A8 .O +2 424
>dacrON: AEINQRU L3 R. +2 371
#note I'm drawing dead here. Since spread doesn't matter in this tournament, I just did anything that gave me any potential bingo at all.
>Doug: EGIINRT 2G IGNITER +63 487
#note Oops, lol. Turns out I left the I in the bag, but he'd blocked anyway.
>Doug:  (AAEINQU) +32 519
#note Doug stays alive 519-371 to force a game 5. He'd have to win the next 3, though.
