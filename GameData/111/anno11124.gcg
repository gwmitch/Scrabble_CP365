#note this was a fun one.
>JD: ?CEIITY D4 CITY.IdE +80 80
#note phew! I did not see syenitic at all.

#note well, that's just lucky
>Joe_Gaspard: KNOO J3 NOOK +38 142
>JD: AEGNRTU F10 .UG +11 188
#note the next one won't go down! I had not realized how strong a leave GARNET is. just fishing a U is competitive.
>Joe_Gaspard: DIOOV C11 OVOID +20 162
#note neither of us play a ton of defense in this game.
>JD: AEFHNRT 14B F.RTH +38 226
#note taking the points with FATHER/HAFTER is a little better with a wide open board and many vowels to come.
>Joe_Gaspard: ADIQR 3H QI.DAR +34 196
>JD: AEEELNU 15A LA.E +26 252
#note I thought about this a decent amount and chose it over something lie ANELE. ANELE or ALEE are the two main competitors.
>Joe_Gaspard: IMTX 15F MIXT +46 242
>JD: EENRSUV 6A VEN.URES +65 317
#note crazy game! will I finally pull out a lead?
>Joe_Gaspard: EIPU H1 PI.UE. +54 296
#note the answer is, nope...
>JD: AAAAGOS A5 A.GAS +27 344
#note I am pretty pleased with this play. It was probably my toughest find of the game.
>Joe_Gaspard: EFH J10 FEH +32 328
>JD: AACMORW L10 MACAW +35 379
#note it was worth more on the other side, but still, another definite top play.
>Joe_Gaspard: ABENRZ L1 BR.ZEN +52 380
#note yikes! it took him a long time to play this. definitely took me aback. I'm surprised quackle thinks he's only 30% to win.
>JD: AAGNOOR 1J GA.OON +27 406
#note I thought a bit about gowan but there's just no point - among other things it allows for gowany. gaboon is a bit above 50-50 to win according to quackle - really depends on the draw.
>Joe_Gaspard: DEILY 14J DE.ILY +34 414
#note he must have known he was in trouble when he didn't pull the blank on his last turn. I don't remember if he said what his other two were.
>JD: ?ADELRT M5 DARTLEs +86 492
#note I actually couldn't find either of the bingoes to the Y, but the one I already had lined up was worth the same amount. I pretty much new once I found DARTLES that I was going to win with just about any play he would make.
