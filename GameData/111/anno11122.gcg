>JD: ?ADLOST 8F SOLATeD +68 68
#note what a nice problem to have! however, I wasn't 100% on DALTONS and didn't risk it.
>Keith_Valentine: DHU 7E DUH +22 22
>JD: EEIKNRV 7I KEN +26 94
#note with reinvoke blocked, no standout play jumps out. This or KINE is fine.
>Keith_Valentine: DERW 9D DREW +28 50
>JD: EINORSV 6D VERSION +95 189
#note this was probably my coolest play of the tourney.
>Keith_Valentine: AEGU 8A AGUE +22 72
>JD: IJNOOOT B6 JO. +27 216
>Keith_Valentine: X 7B .X +34 106
>JD: AAINOOT 10G NAOI +17 233
#note it's this or playing somethng really fishy like ODA - but that feels too crazy.
>Keith_Valentine: AAILORU L8 .UI +4 110
>JD: ?AFLNOT 7A F.. +18 251
#note I was hesitant to open a big lane because it's awesome for me if he keeps fishing and missing, but I think just playing AFLOAT is better than this. Maybe it would be better if I had some 9 to fish for.
>Keith_Valentine: EGOR E9 .OGER +12 122
>JD: ?AELNOT 12C AN.ThOLE +66 317
#note I thought I came up with ELONGATE - that would've been better D.
>Keith_Valentine: EFIILMS 13H MISFILE +85 207
#note as it turns out he was going to bingo anyway, but ELONGATE is considerably more defensive in general. I thought about challenging. This is a nice play.
>JD: IOORTTW 13A TOW +22 339
#note I really think I lost my way in the rest of this game. I may have chickened out on WOOER.
>Keith_Valentine: ACV E3 CAV.. +22 229
#note he's down a lot, but all of a sudden I might actually wind up losing this game.
>JD: INOPRRT N10 PIN.R +26 365
#note oh god, I chickened out of the real word to play a phony! PRIER is good, PINER* is no good.
>Keith_Valentine: AIQU O7 QUAI +43 272
>JD: CGHORRT 4D R.TCH +28 393
#note garth?

>Keith_Valentine: BNT L12 B.NT +14 310
>JD: ADEIRSY O13 DEY +37 441
#note I was all set to take a shot at DAYRISE*/PINERS*, I cashed in instead.
>Keith_Valentine: ABEIPTZ 15H ZIBE. +48 358
#note wow, good thing for me it didn't fit. interesting that PATH is the best play (blocking YEAH, sets up BAIZE)
>JD: AEEIRSY H1 YEA. +30 471
>Keith_Valentine: APT 2G P.AT +8 366
>Keith_Valentine:  (EIRS) +8 374
#note over by 10, final spread of 87 except I think I wrote it down as 77.
