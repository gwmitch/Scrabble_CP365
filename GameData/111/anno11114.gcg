#note Jesse Day is Matchplay: Round 4, Game 1. This is one half of the winners bracket semis - winner faces the victor of XP versus JKB. Remember, it's best of 7. The bracket can be found at http://challonge.com/bayareamatchplay. As for this play, nothing is worth playing, as far as I'm concerned.

#note Just don't have it in me to play through here.

>dacrON: BBNOPTZ 5D BOB +26 103
#note N(A)BOB is a definit improvement. Missed it.
>Doug: JLOW J2 JOWL. +31 132
>dacrON: EINPRTZ D5 ..PTIZER +44 147
#note 7B NERTZ is cute, but not as good.
>Doug: AEMN E9 NAME +35 167
>dacrON: GHNQRSU F12 SUQ +35 182
#note with QURSH blocked, it seemed like a calculated risk to go against him not hooking SUQS in the next turn. Also he'd be forced to block a lot, too.
>Doug: CIT G13 TIC +20 187
>dacrON: AAGHNRR 2J .ARRAH +32 214
#note This is an uncharacteristic play for me. Normally (C)HARR would be automatic, but I decided to mix things up a bit. Take a couple more points, grab an extra tile (plenty of vowels left).
>Doug: NOO 1M ONO +28 215
>dacrON: ?GINOUV 15G .OVING +42 256
#note Loved setting up the S hook here.
>Doug: DENOR 4J .ONDER +22 237
>dacrON: ?EHNNUW 9K HEWN +26 282
#note Amazingly I thought of N(E)W but not H(E)W. My board vision was a bit off today. I think this play is 2nd best. It kills COVINGS, but he could know the word, and I'm now in great shape after HEWN. 
>Doug: ACF 8A FAC. +27 264
>dacrON: ?AGNOUU A8 .UGU +8 290
#note Couldn't pull the trigger on UNGUA(L). But ANO? is great with this pool.

#note Not a bad effort all in all. I take game 1 to start up 1-0.
