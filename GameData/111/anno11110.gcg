#note Considered BILGE, BIOG, OBELIA... but I loved what GRIPT did to the board. Deen is going to have to play catchup on this dead board, and I'd rather force him to open it up. Sim doesn't approve, but I have to assume Deen's rack is getting pretty strong.
>Deen_Hergott: DENX 10C N.XED +33 193
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEILOTZ 3I Z. +21 235
#note This is just awful. I didn't want any of the board-openers, and I wanted to score. But I missed the beautiful ZLOTE 13E. That is so much better than ZA.

#note This is tough. I can either do my best to block the bingo, or I can just fish and hope I hit one of my own. No idea what I am supposed to do here. The finish is pretty unlikely.
