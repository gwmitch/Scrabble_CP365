#note I'm pretty lost here. not sure what I should be shooting for next turn - aquifers? faqirs? it hadn't occurred to me that SHAY would lead to more points for her next turn, but that's exactly what happens - 13C becomes a hotspot

#note this is bad for me! I needed that lane.
>jd: ?EFGNOQ K10 Q. +11 299
#note now what? the Q is clearly a major obstacle. but QI blocks my best lane. QUEAN looks like the best option though it leaves the volatile FGO?.

#note it's remarkable how much more often I bingo after EF than my choice of NAFF (60% versus 33%). I don't know where these all fit - probably from the R? in any case I am a reasonable favorite but I'm not sure  if the numbers in quackle tell the truth here.
>Leesa_Berahovich: EEINRST N5 ENTRIES +81 374
#note oh no! this is just about the worst-case scenario.
>jd: ?EGLORS O8 ERG +29 354
#note I was pretty low on time after struggling through the last few racks - the best idea I had was trying to see if she would get caught with lots of points if I just play ERG. However, Marlon pointed out that if I fish an O I can give myself a 3/8 chance of winning, and a shot at 5/8, by dropping ADO at 14C. it looks like a mistake since it still allows an X play, but if I draw an A I hit GASTRULAE, with an E I hit REGULATES and with a T I hit either one (all on row 6). If I draw an I, she has to get creative to block RELIGHTS, and she may well miss that I have a bingo at all. I could also just play the O elsehwere (say at 3C) but that makes it more likely that she'll get suspicious and try to block...dropping the O guarantees 3/8 even with optimal play on her part.
