#note He might be thinking I don't know that it takes an S, which is reasonable because I don't know much.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?BEGINU C9 BEGUINe +86 215
#note BEGUINs# is maybe safer. And BUNGIES# is a word, too.

#note Saw FEHM# but told myself it was just VEHM#. Anyways it seemed weird to turn down THEM, but I thought HM would be better on the board because I am giving myself OHM next turn. But maybe not worth it. HOMME# is also good here.

#note Kind of a weird play, but I hated opening anything here. I end up not following through on the board-killing strategy which makes this play look silly in hindsight.

#note Dammit, I made a note about ABAC# earlier, but completely forgot about it when I drew the C! But really, I should just to INLAND at N8 to seal the deal on this game.
