#note Phony.  Best by sbout 3.9 static.
>Ian_Weinstein: ?ACENRT L1 CENTAuR. +80 80
#note I think Gibson played this in the same place once on me.  Or I could be dreaming 2000-rated players raining down bingos on me.

>Ian_Weinstein: AAEELST N2 .EALATES +61 141
#note Yes, like that.
>Ryan_Fischer: FFGILOU O8 FILO +38 108
#note O8 FOU 35.  Yep, get rid of that U.
>Ian_Weinstein: EEMZ N11 MEZE +34 175
>Ryan_Fischer: EFGOORU 13K FUR.E +34 142
#note OUZO and FUZE rate a bit higher statically.

#note DUGONG and an O.  Quite ugly.  He complemented this play.  I guess he must have had at least an S here.
>Ian_Weinstein: EISV 15L VISE +49 240
#note Yep, definitely an S.  Though nothing much more, as I didn't block anything he couldn't hit me with down here.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGIMNR 12H DENIM +33 199
#note Q static wants to fish.  I need to score AND bingo to catch him.  A many ply sim says DIM splits the difference best, sacrificing 8 points to take the lead 3% faster.  I'd rather take points now and try to get at the blank.  Plus, the spots DENIM open are a little juicier.

#note I can't let him bingo.  I lose.  That WIG spot is juicy, and the O is possible.  So it took me a while to deliberate, but i figured it best to block and sacrifice the points.  I'm playing now as if he has the blank.  Something I find works and wins you more games than you lose.  If it turns up, great.  If not, I'm prepared.  The only deterrent here is no person's word knowledge is perfect, and JEW would create NAW (no -S).  Many an expert has tripped up on this word.  Maybe he would too.  Still, I decided to go for defense and a pretty even game.
>Ian_Weinstein: AGRV E8 GRAV.. +22 358
#note He said he might have made a mistake playing this, kept waiting for me to hit him with something like HAS 14D, but it never quite materialized.
>Ryan_Fischer: EHLNORS F6 HO +31 372
#note Autopilot play here.

>Ryan_Fischer: AELNRST H12 ..LT +15 387
#note Champ really loves (NA)N D12 3.  I have the better rack though the blank still hasn't turned up.  Two or three places to bingo now if I play down from (DE) or play (NA)N.  I could see him hitting me with something like EYETOOTH if I do that.  There's a T to come.  The L sucks.  So that's why I ultimately settled on DELT.  I figured to score he HAS to empty the bag, and if I draw reasonably I have a good chance of bingoing out as it's really hard to play down low to block unless he has both the Y and H.  Maybe this play is wrong, but I don't see how much righter (NA)N is, and still, besides trying to bingo, I *NEED* to score.  DELT accomplishes this.
>Ian_Weinstein: ENOTU 15D TENU.O +7 384
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AENORS 1B OREgAN.S +58 445
#note Apparently, the H and Y were in the bag, and I didn't look very hard for pERSONA and SENhORA, which I should've seen.  Cost me just 10 points, but still.  Unfortunate for him.
