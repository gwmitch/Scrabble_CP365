#note totally didn't notice that I played two guys named KK in a row!

#note how sketchy does dogie look? It sims better but I think ditching the Q is ok.
>Ken_Kasney: EGIORST 10D GORIEST +74 126
>JD: DEEGIOT 11B GEODE +25 119
#note I coud not convince myself that GEED was actually a word. this is a major downgrade. geed pretty much wipes out all of the socring spots on the board for him.
>Ken_Kasney: ILOPU 12F POILU +13 139
>JD: ?EIIPTU D8 PI..UT +24 143
#note took me a while to find, but definitely right

#note get as far ahead as I can
>Ken_Kasney: EMN 15F MEN +28 219
>JD: AAHITTU 14L HAT +30 300
#note I didn't want to give too easy of a comeback here. quackle's suggestion is to ignore the spot entirely and play GHAUT. I guess a lot of the tiles that fit at 14N are already gone.
>Ken_Kasney: ?EHLRST L6 HaRSLET +73 292
>JD: AEINTTU K3 ATTUNE +20 320
#note I liked playing on column K instead of M to minimize the comebacks. UNTIE at M3 is not a bad dea but most long plays are even in a sim.
>Ken_Kasney: AY M7 YA +21 313
>JD: DEILORV 3I .L.VE +20 340
#note I figured setting up the R on an increasingly closed board might pay off, and clave blocks the new lane he just made on column N. that said, just playing LAX is definitely appealing, since he can fish there any time down the road- I  failed to appreciate how annoying 13M could be at the time.
>Ken_Kasney: L M13 L.. +20 333
>JD: DEFIORW 9A OF +19 359
#note I didn't wan to play on N yet because it seemed like a great way to lose the game if he bingoed on O or even just ad a big play - I wanted to make him earn the win. my play saves WRIED if he doesn't play there and blocks a hail mary through the I. he's been playing extremely short, which means that his rack is probably better than quackle thinks it is and playing on O is probably worse. WIFEDOM is an intresting play, although it does set up some big scores - then again, his last play suggests he didn't have an F or a W! what a complicated decision.
>Ken_Kasney: BO 10L .OB +11 344
#note for some reason we both thought he was down 36, not 26. at 26 points down this is too desperate. down 36 it probably still is, but he can no longer count on scoring his way back into the game.
>JD: DEFINRW O7 WIFED +42 401
#note what I don't like about LOB is that even if there are very few vowels left in the bag, I've quite likely been hoarding them.
>Ken_Kasney: DENRSUW N2 WRENS +31 375
>JD: AKNRV 13B VA. +12 413
#note REV then KA is the real go-to sequence since he now must go out in 3.
>Ken_Kasney: DU B7 D.. +7 382
>JD: KNR H7 K.R. +16 429
#note this play went down in 0 seconds because I was already at 00:00 I believe.
>Ken_Kasney: U B11 .U. +7 389
>Ken_Kasney:  (N) +2 391
#note We agreed on 429-381. My worst-played game of the tournament so far, but one with lots of tough decisions.
