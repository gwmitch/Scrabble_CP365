>Tim_Michaels: AEU 8H EAU +6 6
>Ryan_Fischer: AAJLOSY 7F JAY +19 19
#note Blind.  Shift one to the right for 17 more points!
>Tim_Michaels: ADEZ 6H DAZE +41 47
#note And then that doesn't happen.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEELOQS -EOQ +0 19
#note ALOES is not worth playing.
>Tim_Michaels: VX K5 V.X +26 73
>Ryan_Fischer: AEELSTV 9B VELATES +70 89
#note 7C VEE(JAY) 23 is the best non-phony play.
>Tim_Michaels: AEILNST C6 LIN.ATES +68 141
>Tim_Michaels: AEILNST --  -68 73
#note Oddly enough, no bingos play!
>Ryan_Fischer: EEMNNRS 8C MEN +15 104
>Tim_Michaels: AEILNST G9 .L +2 75
#note Funnily enough, I gave him a 9: ENA(ME)LIST for 74!  SALTINE + ME = ENAMELIST.  So... eat too many saltines and "me" will need an enamelist?  :P
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEINRS 11A BARNIES +71 175
#note BARNIES is phony too.  That one I didn't think I was making up!  Real words: (U)RBANISE and another 9, BAS(EL)INER!  EL + BARNIES* = BASELINER.
>Tim_Michaels: AEIINST L7 ISATINE +75 150
>Ryan_Fischer: DFLPRSW 13J FL.W +20 195
>Tim_Michaels: AQ 10J QA. +32 182
>Ryan_Fischer: DPRSUUY A11 .URDY +36 231
#note I passed up PURSY to play a third phony!  This rates higher.  Also considered BURPY, less likely.  And you'd think DPRS is a good leave -- not when you draw UUY!  At least I was able to make something of it.
>Tim_Michaels: HO M8 OH +20 202
>Ryan_Fischer: ?PRSTUU N2 UPTURnS +73 304
#note Another chance to play RUPTURES.  This, TURNUPS, or PURSUIT is best.
>Tim_Michaels: AEIMNOR 14D ROMAINE +74 276
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEFOO 15H FADO +48 352
#note FOE for 41 leaving a bit better leave.
>Tim_Michaels: BEK 11K B.KE +28 304
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEGOOT O9 GODET +20 372
#note At 13C it plays for 28.  Less defensive, though.
>Tim_Michaels: CEP 7B PEC +19 323
#note Said he didn't have the blank yet, was just hoping it'd turn up.  Smart.
>Ryan_Fischer: EINNORW 6A WO +13 385
#note Now's the needlessly defensive part of the game wherein I give up massive equity to secure the win.  Inferring a blank, Champ rates this 4th.
>Tim_Michaels: IIII -IIII +0 323
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIINNR O1 IN +8 393
>Tim_Michaels: HOT M1 THO +26 349
>Ryan_Fischer: EGILNOR 5B LINGO +17 410
#note Champ doesn't find this, even with blank inferrence, which sims best.  The T is a little worrisome, but looking at the pool, there's not TOO much to worry about.  Zyzzyva says there are no 8s ending in T in that pool.
>Tim_Michaels: ?CGIORT 1H sTRIC. +30 379
#note Best statically.  Champ agrees.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIR 12F REI +10 420
>Tim_Michaels: GO 13C GO +8 387
#note At 4B it's 12.
>Tim_Michaels:  (I) +2 389
