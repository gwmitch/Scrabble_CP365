>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AADIMNV 6F VANDA +26 56
#note Surprising play near the top of the sim: N9 UVA#. I guess AIDMN is strong, and VANDA sort of kills the board when I am down and likely about to go down further. 10I AVID is probably the play for that reason. All three are close.

#note Ugly rack, but I could have played it much better. N11 MINT is the play.
