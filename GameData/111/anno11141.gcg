#note the QI play suggests a really good rack, quite possibly with an S. It seemed like a good idea to play here.
>Bruce_Ward: AEEGNSV K3 VEGAN +31 42
#note as it turns out, I threw him off of finding his bingo with this rack.
>jd: CDEORSU L7 SCOURED +79 183
#note had he played genevas I would have had scourged for more points anyway.
>Bruce_Ward: HLOY 4H HOL.Y +30 72
#note bruce said I blocked something here too.f
>jd: AGHKMMS E7 G.MMA +20 203
#note HKS seemed like the most tractable leave I could come up with from this mess. playing MAGMA at E4 would set up HM, which I didn't consider. but this is fine.
>Bruce_Ward: AEENSTT 3C NEATEST +76 148
#note whee anteaters!
>jd: ?AEHKRS 2A SHARKEd +95 298
#note he challenged because it was just about the only way he could stay in the game. I didn't realize that SHARKER was also good.

#note I got away with one here...it's only BLYPE. I've played this one before but I kinda knew it was phony here.

#note there were many Is waiting to be played at this point.

>jd: DIOOPRX 3K .OX +31 530
#note OX at M9 apparently blocks his 1-in-4 shot at DISORDER. I did not spot this. OX at 13F is an ok idea that I came up with too. in the end it doesn't matter much.
>Bruce_Ward: DEIIRRS 15F SIRED +24 320
