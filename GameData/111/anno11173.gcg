#note An interesting rack. The other option I thought about was OI 9G, but I thought exchanging and keeping a good leave made it tougher for him. Nick will probably have to open something next turn, and I just groomed my rack to get ready for an opening.
>Nick: EM L6 ME +17 41
>Noah: DEEIINR M7 DENI +17 83
#note DIE keeps a much stronger leave than this, but this prohibits a lot of the bingos that DIE lets in.

>Nick: EILOOST 15H OOLITES +81 149
>Noah: DEGINRW 14B REDWING +81 185
#note I remembered REDWING having an anagram, but on the other hand WRINGED sounded really bad. It's good, and Nick would've challenged!
>Nick: AVY 12L VA.Y +28 177
>Noah: ADEELTU 15A DELE +26 211
#note DEAL seemed like the other option, but I thought it gave better counterplay. I'm not sure if that is true though.

#note Don't know what to do here. He could still have FINNMARK, which might be a problem if he gets it. I thought I should keep my U, since vowels are important, and leave one in the bag. Didn't love playing TS(K), because the leave sucks and he could hit me hard. This didn't seem to ever lose. Then again, TSK might not either.

#note Actually made the second best play. I didn't know VIVARY though, and that is best by far.
