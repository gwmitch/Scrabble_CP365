#note Couldn't make up my mind between this and (A)DVERB 12H. BAD(E) G12 and D(E)V 14G are also decent options here. I put this down because I didn't want to use too much time thinking about the decision. If I want a more closed board, I should probably go with BAD(E), but I opted for an open board here. D(E)V is interesting, since the ABDER leave is stronger on this board than most boards, but I think I'm just sacrificing too many points to play it. I don't see too much difference between this and (A)DVERB. Perhaps I should've played BAD(E) here, but I'm still uncertain of Nick's playing tendencies.

#note Other plays here are (M)IAULED, A(G)UE, and (K)UE. I didn't like MIAULED because DEIL seemed quite good here. It's also more balanced than ADEIL, hence no KUE. AGUE is interesting--though it opens up for my bingo-prone leave, it also opens some potent scoring spots for Nick. I still like this play best.

#note p(E)NCILED, INCLuDE and NuCLIDE are other options here. I'm fine taking the points here, even if I do open up a big spot.

#note Good thing I didn't play NuCLIDE!

#note I saw this, DUP, and UPEND, but missed UNPEG. I liked ditching the G in this position, and I think a case can be made for this over UNPEG, too, since DT is kind of awkward. EPT seems to score best on column H, and plays at F5 for decent points next turn.
