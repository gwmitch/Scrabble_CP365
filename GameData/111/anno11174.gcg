>Noah: ?AIISUV H7 VAU +12 12
#note This is the first game of our 2012 bay area matchplay match. Winner lands in the prize money!

Noah: Maybe I should exchange. I played this so he wouldn't get many opportunities, but on the other hand, this already makes the board unfriendly to a bingo. VIA isn't great either, so I think exchanging (IIUV or AIIUV) looks pretty good.
>JD: ACDEIIP I8 EPIC +20 20
#note Jesse: he didn't give me an E. this seemed like the best available defense.
>Noah: ?IIRRST 11I .RIT +12 24
>JD: AADEIIT G9 TEIID +15 35
#note Jesse: quackle despises this move. I read him as having a very powerful leave and I didn't want to do something like AI at 12L. However, AI at 10K might make some sense just because the leave is so much more powerful. inferences make the sim results closer but still suggest that I blow up the rack too much.
>Noah: ?EINRSV 13G .IViNERS +80 104
#note Noah: Not sure what gums the board up most--anything here is going to leave a lot open. VINTnERS could be good, but on the other hand that allows a really easy fork. I still like this play.
>JD: AAAELST F10 AA +10 45
#note Jesse: if I play at AA at 12L he can play on column H and kill all the remaining S hooks.
>Noah: AAEEEHL 12L HEAL +32 136
>JD: AELLSST 14A STELLAS +75 120
#note Jesse: I started this game playing really slow, but from here on out I actually felt really good and played relatively fast by my standards.
>Noah: AEEEFNO 14J FOE +35 171
>JD: BGINOQR A12 QI. +22 142
#note Jesse: BORING hits surprisingly few bingoes. quackle suggests that this is far worse than my best option of BORINGS, which maximizes the chances that I get to do something useful with the Q (3 Us out also).
>Noah: AEEMNOS D11 AMO.E +16 187
#note Noah: Don't know how I missed MAE 13C. That looks right. This is vulnerable to easy scoring plays, like...
>JD: BEGNORW C11 BOW.R +40 182
#note Noah: This! Ugh.
>Noah: AEHMNOS O8 MOHE. +30 217
#note Noah: Also considered MOSH 15H. HO 14N I didn't see, and that is also a decent option.
>JD: ?DEGNOT N3 iNGOTED +67 249
#note Jesse: thonged is a little better. I thought of it and then promptly forgot it.
>Noah: ACGNRSZ 3M Z.G +24 241
>JD: AEJKNOR O1 JO. +33 282
>Noah: ACDNRST 4K CRA.S +40 281
>Noah: ACDNRST --  -40 241
#note Jesse: the game-changer...it's hard to feel confident challenging 4s against a great player but it just looked wrong.
>JD: AEGKNNR 4K GRA. +21 303
#note Jesse: NAN bingoes more often next turn, but it seemed more important to make sure to start limiting how many lanes he had. hence GRAN.
>Noah: ACDNRS 6J DACR.N +13 254
#note Jesse: not cardon because this way he opens a lane
>JD: EKNNUUW E7 KNEW +17 320
#note Jesse: not the best leave, but the most important thing here is blocking. he's guaranteed to try to open a lane next turn, probably on row 8 - but still, if you 4-ply sim, KNEW significantly lowers his bingo chances.
>Noah: ILSTTUY 8A LYSI. +27 281
#note Noah: Don't know what else I can do here.
>JD: ABDENUU B5 BUN.A +12 332
#note Jesse: this is it, key move. I considered BUY, BEAK and BUNYA. BEAK scores a bunch, but is vulnerable to something like a setup at K2 due to the inflexible leave. BUY at B6 blocks and is good if he bingoes now (he'll have 5 tiles) but also allows him more tempo to fish. finally, my choice doesn't score that much but leaves him with just one relatively weak lane, and if he fishes I'll have a good sense of what's in the bag. I'm ok with my choice.
>Noah: FIIOTTU 15H TUFT +32 313
#note Jesse: I guess he had no fishes he could hit.
>JD: DENOPRU 5B .URPED +22 354
#note Jesse: low on time, just didn't want to go over or give a 50 point X play. this is bad because he can play OXEYE but I still win.
>Noah: EIIOXY 4G OXY +24 337
#note Noah: OXEYE is 13 better.
>JD: NO 7J ON +7 361
#note Jesse: just trying not to go over
>JD:  (EII) +6 367
#note 1-0 Jesse
