#note (!!!) ... okay, that's not even a (!), but still, one helluva sequence.  I thought UMTEEN might be good too, but no, it's UNMEET only.  This is a weird inconsistency too, because postmortem in Dallas, Carl Johnson posed a puzzle over one of his games.  EEHMNTU? had two solutions.  I found one just as a guess.  The other is even more obscure.  But this spelling is odd if the cardinal is no good.  It should be noted that UMTEENTH, UMPTEEN, and UMPTEENTH are all adjectives, and none of them take S.  This much I didn't know until Ian pointed it out after the game, debating whether to hook a later bingo.

#note No A for STRAVAIG/GRAVITAS, E for VIRGATES, N for STARVING.
>Ian_Weinstein: ?AAINRS L6 SARcINA +71 326
#note Nice play.  This or SANGRIA scores most, and this at least gives him a chance to hook an E for another bingo.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACIPRST M7 PA +18 399
#note Champ says C11 T(O)PS 28.  My instinct says why not try to get a bit more spread while he still needs a bingo to catch me?  It might be playing with fire.  Who knows.  I played PA to give myself another spot to bingo.  Don't know if it was smart.  Thoughts definitely welcome.
>Ian_Weinstein: FX C11 F.X +51 377
#note ...I see now why Champ said to play there!  I totally forgot about the X, of course, and now it's a close game.  Of course TOP(/S) makes sense now, at least.

#note And then I go and miss SATYRIC, which, while I've never played it, I probably should've seen it.
>Ian_Weinstein: BGIJO 11I BOI.G +23 400
#note He wasn't sure, thought BOING might not take an S.  I was pretty sure it did.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIRSTV N9 VASTIER +83 493
#note And I stumble into another bingo quite clumsily.  He pointed out he was considering JINGO but decided to fish for something like JAILED up top.  He got it, but I got mine.  Weird, messy ending after a back-and-forth middle.  Six bingos, all vertical.  11 turns each, and out.  Beautiful.  I love games like that.
