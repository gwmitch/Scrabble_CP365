#note wow, that sequence sucked... TENTH sims best though because i score more next turn on average, despite bingoing slightly less. but i still like TETH. (-3.5)

#note oh geez what do i do. zits/zins are dumb. no? maybe just FLAW by itself. (-3.5)

#note sacrificing a lot of points to not keep VY. this, 11E THY, which i was going to play before this came down, and HINTS 14J are all close together. what is right? when do you make each play? maybe there is no right answer. i want to devolatilize the board a little bit because my play will almost catch me up and i have the S. HINTS scores a lot but it opens up dangerous scoring spots and keeps a bad leave. THY is really good though too.

#note bring on the bad draws! i don't care about luck anymore.

#note 4A BURN looks like the play here. i cast a brief glimpse at david's face and he seemed kind of dissatisfied with his rack, which would make it better for me to play BURN, keeping a more bingo prone leave and leaving lane 12 open. (-1)

#note 14F FOE is fine. i think i like points too much. (-2.5)
>david_p: Q -  +0 331
#note fortunately for me, that drew a challenge! i had to convince myself the word was good on the way to the challenge computer so that i didn't do my requisite finger-crossing before every challenge.
>cesar: EFGLNPW M13 NEW +20 357
#note 10 vowels and 6 consonants unseen, i remember counting, but still could not fathom leaving 5 consonants. i figured a 2-consonant draw would be horrible if i did 14F WE.  but i'm bound to draw vowels out of that bag if not this turn next, plus i go ahead by more and make the bottom of the board ugly. so i don't know if i was too paranoid. quackle says i was. (-5.5)
>david_p: ACEEIQT E5 Q. +22 353
>cesar: CFGLLNP 3B P.LF +9 366
#note that was horrible, i shoulda taken the points with WE. quackle likes CELL 3B best; PELF sims badly i think mainly because of bad anti-synergy between C and G, and the possibility of getting C stuck. (-11%)

>cesar: CEGLNTU 2A LU. +20 386
#note quackle says the only move that wins the game for me is CUM. i guess i blew the endgame. i thought as long as I kept two C spots i was probably ok.
>david_p: AAEIIOR J11 RIA +9 378
#note but then quackle finds no win for him, so i don't know.
