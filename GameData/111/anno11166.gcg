#note there are a lot of reasons to challenge. For one, I wasn't sure it was good. it blocks my bingo, and there's a chance that his next play might give me a spot. but ultimately, this was just a bad call on my part. I kinda knew it was good.
>Ed_de_Guzman: HKNO E10 HONK +27 103
#note this is what I should have figured would happen - I just give him an extra chance to pull away.
>JD: EEILNOR 13C EI.ON +20 50
#note LINER is a surprisingly eak leave.

#note ugly play but I made a lame choice....quackle says block row 15 or play OLDEN. I'll take the block of row 15 with ON. Lots of vowel left, could luck into a bingo. I thought he may not know TONDOS.

#note huge swing! if I get my bingo down I have a chance. instead I have to create a lane.

>JD: ?DDGLNT 4M G.D +6 220
#note I wanted to play off two consonants to make sure I could bingo on columns J and K as well. I could also exchange.

#note if he had just dumped the J I could've fished for egalites as an out bingo on K. instead, I ran out of time, but quackle still likes this play.
