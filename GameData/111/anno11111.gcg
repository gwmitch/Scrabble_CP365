#note ehh.. even if i'd seen FEW N5 it seems so gross. but i guess it's more defensive and scores. (-5)

#note this is quite the play. he told me later he was trying to bait me into sticking the S on it, but i saw it a completely different way; he must have quite a strong leave, and almost surely an S, to make this play at this part in the game. i'm lucky i DIDN'T have the S.

#note now he surely has the S

#note 13K KAE looks good, but 10J QUIET sims best.  i'm not sure what to do here. i like my play because if he's so close to having a bingo, i'm taking out the ZAGS lane, and he's not likely to have kept a U with CAGE, so i might have a good shot at another one. what's the best play here? (-5.5)

#note it seems reasonable to assume he has an S here, and maybe an i. does anyone do something crazy here like F4 KILN? i'm pretty sure that even with the strongest leave for him, QUALIA is the play. it sims much better than anything else.

#note i was actually more sure of this than the other two plays that fit here (didn't even see KYAT). i knew that two-K list would come in handy.
