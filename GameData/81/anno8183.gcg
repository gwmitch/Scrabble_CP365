#note Best.   8G FAD also worth consideration.
>Marty_Gabriel: ITV E5 VIT. +14 14
>Jim_Burlant: AADEGOT D8 .AGOTED +24 48
#note Hmmm.  Q prefers 9C GAED by roughly 2 points.
>Marty_Gabriel: GINOR C11 GIRON +24 38
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABEKOS I6 BOSKAgE +77 125
#note This is not the best play - B10 BAKES scores 56 and still preserves the blank.  And it wouldn't have given him his juicy comeback.  Even with this miscue I'm winning 80%.
>Marty_Gabriel: ILWY H12 WILY +51 89
>Jim_Burlant: ?DNOOPU J4 UPON +16 141
#note Too bad the I was blocked - DOUPIONI would have been a sweet play.  I had no idea what to do here, but since I was sitting on the blank I figured it couldn'thurt to open up.  The sim feels B13 OP is best. This is runner up, conceding 8 points in the sim; for this game it was more like 20.

>Jim_Burlant: ?DILOTW J10 WOT +34 175
#note Best.
>Marty_Gabriel: CEILNNS F8 .NCLINES +68 197
#note Despite his lead, Marty is only winning 50%.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DILNQR 6D Q. +11 186
#note Well, that changed things - so much for the easy 21-point Q dump.  Q prefers B12 LIN, B10 QaDI, and B12 DIN to this.  I wonder if I should have just tossed LQ into the bag.  
>Marty_Gabriel: EEHR B12 HERE +33 230
>Jim_Burlant: ?DILNRR K8 RIND +22 208
#note This is best, nothing else comes close.  Youll notice that despite the unseen E's, I haven't seen any since I put down BOSKAGE.
>Marty_Gabriel: EGIU K1 GUI.E +20 250
>Jim_Burlant: ?ALLMRR 2J M.LLA +26 234
#note Mural is better - couldn't think of it.  This is close in the sim, but really - MURAL should have been my play.  This mild equity slip comes back to haunt me in a big way in a couple of turns.
>Marty_Gabriel: EISTU A8 ETUIS +26 276
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEFRRY 8K .EFRY +36 270
#note Best, and I'm winning 61%
>Marty_Gabriel: AAH O1 AHA +29 305
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABCEER 15A B.. +15 285
#note In this position I saw REBRACEd# and did well to talk myself out of it.  I also saw BREAChER and did not do very well to talk myself out of that, and I didn't see any of the 7's.  Of course, if I think of MURAL a couple of turns back, I have a no-brainer RECABLEd and clinch the game.  At any rate - more often than not, given that I'm on the blank this miss will simply be 20 points of spread blown in a game I still win by 30 points.  But the sequence that this set up has to be seen to be believed.   B2 ACERBER wins 79%., and BREACHER wins 71.  This still wins 61...but storm clouds were brewing.

#note Trailing by 39 points I can't forego the bingo, especially with all the rack killers in that bag.This is definitely the right play given this pool. If I take away the N column, he could easily burn me with ZAX for 48 at B6 or hit me with a comeback at O15.  Despite whiffing on my previous turn, the only way Marty can win is if he has a bingo.  I was feeling awfully good...until I saw his next play come down.
