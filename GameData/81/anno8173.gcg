#note no spot for bingos unfortunately, but this gives me some nice tiles to worth with for my IST leave. best.

#note Yes I really did not see SETTLING somehow. Obviously this is a very rare, foreign word. This is good in CSW though which is probably why I got away with it.

#note This or 13K KOA are best. My play at least gives a chance to still bingo through row 14.

#note No idea what is best here. I only have one realistic bingo line so I have to open another one, which is why I didn't play on the 4th row. Quackle likes it anyway, but whatever.

#note BORDURES gives me a fork, but a B in a triple line is pretty worthless with the horrible pool that's left. Still it was probably my only shot to win, in case I can draw a miracle AEILORT for LABORITE or something similar. Quackle likes passing on the bingo and playing in the bottom right, but then Tim can just block the top part row D and it's game over.
