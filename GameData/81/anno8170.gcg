>Toh_Weibin: CEEEEVW -CEEEVW +0 0
#note Geez, I know not what to do with these racks. CP says EWE 8F? Was considering keeping a C but I imagined having to overlap the next move - making the C not that useful to me.
>Michael_Tang: IKNO 8F IKON +16 16
>Toh_Weibin: DEEEOTT E5 TETE +17 17
#note Keeping the O for more flexibility, and also 9G. Should however have played something like TEED or TOED E6, scoring me less points but keeping the board tight.
>Michael_Tang: RZ 6D R.Z +32 48
>Toh_Weibin: ?DEIOOS C4 OStEOID +71 88
#note Wasn't 100% on EIKONS. Wasn't that important to me, anyway.
>Michael_Tang: ANRW D1 WARN +26 74
>Toh_Weibin: AAEFPRT 1A FAT.A +33 121
#note CP says this is inferior to WATAPE, 9F FAP, WAFTER, even FETWA. Hmm.
>Michael_Tang: EEGGHIJ -EEGGH +0 74
>Toh_Weibin: AEHIPRV B9 PAV +19 140
#note I think this is a decent move - besides missing FATWAH entirely. HIVE is the play/ FATWAH.
>Michael_Tang: GINT 2B GI.NT +26 100
>Toh_Weibin: DDEEHIR I6 HI.DERED +68 208
#note Thankfully, GIANT blocked FATWA(HED), so I don't have to agonise over missing a better play here.

>Toh_Weibin: BGILOQS H12 BIOG +40 248
>Michael_Tang: AAG A12 .AGA +36 189
>Toh_Weibin: CELOQSU J1 CLOQUES +81 329
#note LOL moment of the tournament. My only possible excuse would again be that I was under time pressure, with Michael probably having used under 5 minutes of his time at this point. If you don't know what I'm talking about, CLOQUE H1 scores 5 more points and keeps the S.
>Michael_Tang: EEFN 1G FEN.E +30 219

>Michael_Tang: BM K3 B.M +26 298
>Toh_Weibin: CEILTYY 12H ..YLIC +26 413
#note Weak move in terms of winning percentage, but I was really just waiting for the game to end and playing equitable moves. I'd have YE I3 to score with, anyway.
>Michael_Tang: MOSW O1 MOWS +46 344
>Toh_Weibin: AAEIOTY N2 YA. +27 440
#note Hmm, I'd considered playing OILY K10 before deciding on YAE. To be honest, I was just a bit greedy.
>Michael_Tang: ELLPRTU 10H L.. +10 354
>Toh_Weibin: AEIOPTT M9 TOE.AP +22 462
#note TIP(C)AT is the best. My move gives him NoURSLE.
>Michael_Tang: ?ELNRSU 15M SUR +20 374
>Toh_Weibin: IRT L8 RIT +8 470
#note Think I had 3 seconds when I played this.
