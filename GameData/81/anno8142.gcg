#note Sims best, though SQUATTY is something I didn't dare try. Might have been better IMO.

#note This was just me trying (hard) to be stupid - I somehow reckoned that Victor didn't keep an S with VIDS, and hence I'd have a decent score if I picked a vowel. Sticking a Y there would also make it hard for him to score /QI. CP suggests PUT/PI 7H - not sure why. Pretty horrid position IMO, but I think moves like S(UT)TLY H7 (which I wasn't sure of) are still alright.

#note I pointed out to Victor that INsPECT would have been a double-double, much to his dismay. PECTINS also allowed me to play a bingo to a tile he opened.

#note Had inferred that Victor probably didn't have the X or Z (from his last 2 plays), so I took this risk, hoping to draw either one of them. L6 (L)UD might be a stronger play, if not (H)AT(T)ED D8. Anyway, look at what happened next.
