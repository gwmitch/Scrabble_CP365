>Jim_Burlant: DGIPRUU 8F GURU +10 10
#note 8C UPGIRD wins by roughly 6 points.  Given how the last game went, I just wanted to unload all the garbage up front.  What that doesn't explain is this idiotic placement.  Where is my brain?
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: AIMO F5 IMA.O +14 14
>Jim_Burlant: ACDIIPR E3 DIP +20 30
#note You have to know the bingo (in this case, the p=20292 DIAPIRIC) to play it.  The triplicated I's in this word take this bingo way past any probability range most of us have not studied.  This is the best non-bingo option...but not knowing this bingo puts me in a huge hole shortly.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: EJO E9 JOE +29 43
>Jim_Burlant: AACIILR 3C RA.ICAL +28 58
#note Best.  This wins 47%.  But not for long.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: ADEIRST 12B DIASTER +79 122
#note Best bingo for Yvonne is ASTRIDE 12D, but it's really style preference.  She's winning 73%.
>Jim_Burlant: EIIIIOO -IIIIOO +0 58
#note This was my actual rack; yuck.  Q says that this is best. And if I had found DIAPIRIC for 102 this would still be an even game.  You don't need to have the sim tell you that my winning chances are only 13% to know that I'm in serious trouble.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: CEHL H1 LE.CH +39 161
>Jim_Burlant: ABEGNVW H11 B.AVE +30 88
#note C9 WAVING is best, winning 10%; this wins 7.5.   Smart money says I was rattled by her continuing skein of high scoring plays. as I just didn't see waving.   But I catch a break very shortly.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: ?ILNNRU 11H .URNLINe +68 229
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: ?ILNNRU --  -68 161
>Jim_Burlant: AEGNORW B10 WO.GE +36 124
#note With nowhere to put the bingo down, Q agrees - this is too many points to pass up.  This is best and I'm back up to 22%.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: ?ILNNRU 11H .URN +12 173
>Jim_Burlant: AALNNRS I5 ANN.L +12 136
#note Not one of the original kibitzer choices, this sims decently, just outside of bronze medal range.  Best from the rack management standpoint, it gives up a few too many scoreboard points to A7 ANNAL, which I didn't look for and is the best play.  Then again, this did bear fruit on the next turn.  Play incorrectly scored as 13.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: IKLO A7 KILO +29 202
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADERRS L8 DRoSERA +75 211
#note After almost 4 or 5 minutes, I opt for this, which is the best bingo.  Back in the game, winning 42%.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: FX D2 F.X +44 246
>Jim_Burlant: AAGNSWY 15L SWAY +42 253
#note Best, inching up to 46%.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: EFY 8L .EFY +33 279
>Jim_Burlant: AGIINOQ B6 QI +37 290
#note Every play should be this easy and obvious.  Best, winning 41%.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: MO 14N MO +21 300
>Jim_Burlant: ABGIINO M1 IBOGAIN. +74 364
#note Pulled out of my nether regions, this is the game saving play.  If I don't find this right now, I probably lose.  Anyway - it wins 78% and that's about to go up.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: ?EENNOS -  +0 300
#note <<Lost challenge>>
>Jim_Burlant: EETV 1K EV.TE +36 400
#note I don't have this rack written down correctly.  This play wins 95%, even with the blank not in my rack.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: OPU J4 UPO +19 319
#note Pkay incorrectly scored as 21.
>Jim_Burlant: EINOTTT O4 NITT. +9 409
#note Come on, Jim -  you know better than to empty the bag, especially with the Z at large!  This is how to potentially throw away an otherwise guaranteed win.   Kids, do NOT try this at home!   I was completely convinced she'd pulled the Z and I was trying to block something like ZESTY, as I hadn't noticed the spot for FEZ until later.   Rather than gamble on her not having a playable bingo, I should have taken the sure bet and guaranteed the win with G8 UT 14.  That way I don't empty the bag and if she bingos and I pull the Z as my only tile, I can still play FEZ for 35.   My extremely flawed reasoning was that I that, between the triplicated E's in any bingo and WODGE's obstruction of the triple line, she wouldn't find a playable bingo.  I lucked out, but that doesn't mean that this wasn't a horrendous play.
>Yvonne_Knickerbocker: ?DEEHNS K5 SHE +36 355
#note The only 8 in her current rack is ENMESHED, and it doesn't play anywhere.
