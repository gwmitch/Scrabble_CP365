#note No idea. After his last play he obviously has an S so there's no way I'm playing FEIJOA. 9G OF is best. My play ranks eighth.

#note Missed YEARN in the same spot, oops. I decided to pass on PIXY. PR(EF)IX is another nice option. My play is a distant fourth to REFIX, PREFIX and YEARN. I don't feel too bad about missing those though, and I felt I needed to take out the most probable bingo line first.

#note No idea, but I wanted to hold the X for a possible AX(ONE) 14A 42 if I draw the case A. There's really no play CP likes that much, as my winning chances look to be shot no matter what I do.

#note AAGGGH. At least i can still clean up my rack.
