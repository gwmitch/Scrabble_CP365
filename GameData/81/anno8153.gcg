#note TRAWLING B8. I somehow thought TRAWL was not good, confusing TRAWL/TROWEL with TROWL*.
>opponent: DEEINRR 12B NERDIER +80 120
>scott_jackson: HIKSTTX D1 SIXTH +37 179
#note Better to play KITH in the same spot. Not enough value out of the S to be worth it.
>opponent: AI C3 AI +24 144
>scott_jackson: AKOPSTY 1A YOK. +33 212
#note CP barely prefers 11G YAPOK, which I considered, but there's no way I'm leaving that S floating. My play takes the spot, only scores two left and gives me a great leave.
>opponent: ?ADEISU 11H AUDIlES +66 210
>scott_jackson: AAEPRST J3 ASP.RATE. +64 276
#note Blocked PALESTRA 2x2 but no worries. M8 ASPERATE but is worse defensively. Also how often do you get to play a nine?
>opponent: AIJOR L8 JAI.OR +40 250
>scott_jackson: DENNTUU 4G UNU.ED +16 292
#note How could I not see JUTE? That's horrible. No spot for my bingo, and UNTURNED doesn't fit. I'm better off just playing UN in several different spots for the leave.

#note All the best moves are exchanges. 
>opponent: AG N8 .AG. +14 354
>scott_jackson: CCELLNR O3 CLENC. +14 371
#note Best is 14F CLONE. I'm guessing there's enough possible bingos out there to make it worth blocking.
>opponent: EIMM 3I M.MIE +38 392
>scott_jackson: AELORTY 15F OR.ATELY +62 433
#note Well that was fortunate. My opponent basically got 100% of the crap in the poolat the end (BGGGMM etc.)
