>Jim_Burlant: ?CEOOPR 8C sCOOPER +76 76
#note A minor, but significant, equity slip on my end.  PRECOOk, COOPERy sim 1/2 point better.  For this game the difference was probably 40 points.  What does Marilyn do with her rack if I put down COOPERy or PRECOOk?
>Marilyn_Wilkins: DEENTTU C4 UNTE.TED +60 60
>Jim_Burlant: EINNOSU I8 .EUNIONS +60 136
#note So far, so good; this is definitely looking like my game.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: BGU 15F BUG. +21 81
>Jim_Burlant: JLOOQRU 11C .OJO +24 160
#note The runner up, but there was another play available. LIQUOR 12H (which I didn't see) scores 32 and is definitely best.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: BY 10F BY +23 104
>Jim_Burlant: ALLQRRU 13G QU.LL +24 184
#note Out of the choices I know, this is best.  13H RORQUAL scores 32 and is the sim winner.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: AIW K10 WAI. +14 118
>Jim_Burlant: AAEFRRV 4A FA.VE +30 214
#note Sim is a close call between this and E5 FAVOR.  If I had known just how much difficulty I would have drawing into an E, I might have played FAVOR.  FAVOR also would not have given as many points back as this choice did.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: AEHIRRS 5E HARRIES +100 218
#note Play incorrectly scored as 95.  This would have still played at J2 for 81 had I put down FAVOR.  Marilyn is winning 44%.
>Jim_Burlant: AFRTVWX J4 V.XT +30 244
#note This would turn out to be a very costly miss.  I didn't let myself look for other plays once I saw I could score 30, keep my only vowel, and turn 3.  The best play is WAFF 1A 39. I would see this on the next turn...which was one turn too late.  This is second best, but at a sizeable gap to WAFF.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: EIL A1 LIE. +21 239
>Jim_Burlant: AAFMRRW B9 AW +28 272
#note Had no idea what to do here.  This is by far the best play on static evaluation but it sims horrendously.  The best plays, which I either didn't know (D8 CAMORRA 28) or see( D10 FORAM 25)  as a close runner up.  In the absence of seeing good plays, my idea was to implement the old, "you'll take one spot and I'll take the other." 
>Marilyn_Wilkins: EGK A7 KEG +28 267
>Jim_Burlant: AAFMNRR 3E FARM +19 291
#note Not sure I have this rack written correctly.  If I do, despite the dangerous vowel placement, this is  my best play.  I can finally turn 4, leave a good combo, and maybe draw into an E if I'm lucky.  I'm winning 55%, but that's about to tank.  BTW, you'll notice that the only E I have seen since my bingo was my FAUVE play a few turns back.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ?DEIOST 2F TOaDIES +70 337
#note Marilyn gets hit by the bane of the blank racks:  her best bingo is 1A LENTOIDS for 77, which wins 80%.  This choice wins 65.  But given my next rack it really doesn't matter, as it's pretty inert.
>Jim_Burlant: AIINORR 1L IRON +18 309
#note 1H RIA (explain to me how I don't find that?) wins 16% and is best.  This wins 5%.  I was more worried about her having hit something like ADZE for 49 given the dwindling pool and the fact that she had just drawn 7.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: EGM 1H GEM +40 377
>Jim_Burlant: AAEILRT 4J .IA +14 323
#note Q prefers dumping one more tile with 4J VAIL, which seems a little silly - why not set up an exclusive hook for my L?
>Marilyn_Wilkins: IN L11 IN +10 387
>Jim_Burlant: AELOPRT 12D POT +32 355
#note Again, best on static evaluation but not best in the sim.  Best is 14B LEPTA leaving OR.  This wins 15%.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ADY 10K .ADY +22 409
>Jim_Burlant: ADELRTZ 13A DAZE +33 388
#note The annotation ends here and I cannot reconstruct the sequence in full.  Final score recorded as 394 - 465.  Maybe this turns out better if turns 4 and 7 aren't flat out beyond my skill set.
