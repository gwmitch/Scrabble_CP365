>Matt_: DEKNTUZ 8G ZEK +32 32
#note Best, but what it will eventually do to the board will lead us to a crazy endgame.
>Steve: AHI 9G AHI +32 32
#note He originally counted this as 32, then 33, at which point I counted myself to find 32.  Very key as you'll see.
>Matt_: ?DGHNTU 10D HUNG +23 55
#note THUD or THUG are better, since DN and GN are more synergistic than DT, which makes sense.
>Steve: AEVY D10 .EAVY +28 60
>Matt_: ?BDFIST 12C F.TBIrDS +63 118
#note Only bingo, happy to find it.
>Steve: DJU 14A JUD. +30 90
#note The first # of the game.
>Matt_: DEEIMRT 10I DEMERIT +72 190
>Steve: LUX 11J LUX +40 130
>Matt_: EEOPQSU O10 .OQUES +75 265
#note Not a bongo, but it serves the same purpose.  OPE 15A is interesting but the triple lane has to go.
>Steve: ?GIIRST 15H STRIGIl. +80 210
#note Nice play.  TIRInGS#, STIRInG and STRIGInE are Collins bingoes of note.
>Matt_: ABENPRW 15A APE +49 314
#note Can't read my handwriting so this rack might be inaccurate, but I think it's right.  Debated playing WAB 9L now, but with 7 O's and 6 A's still out I thought the J hook was the bigger threat.
>Steve: EEIOPST M3 POETISE. +74 284
#note So I've scored 63, 72, 75, and 49 the last 4 plays and he still is within 30.  But with the S's and blanks gone now, there's not much room to extend to the upper left.  
>Matt_: ABIMNRW 9L W.B +25 339
#note In hindsight I wish I found L4 BRIM.  The lack of security on WEX hooks bit me hard later on.
>Steve: AO 13C A.O +30 314
#note And now he proceeds to take every hotspot right before I can.
>Matt_: AAIMNNR L4 NAAM +24 363
#note AIRMAN as an overlap in column N is crazy.  I tend to not even try to look for stuff like that when I should.  I wanted to play along column L to not give big plays back on column O.  
>Steve: EL 12L EL +32 346
#note Ouch.  He keeps scoring.
>Matt_: AEIILNR K5 NEAR +22 385
#note This is probably a big mistake, keeping the two I's.   Championship player suggests RAI K6 11, but I'll get killed with the F if I don't draw it.
>Steve: EN 11D .NE +19 365
>Matt_: CGIIILW N2 CIG +20 405
#note I'm afraid of the 2 T's out, so WIG was out of the question with the score so close.  I have IWI# down low later if I need it.  CP likes this the best.  
>Steve: ADO 13K ADO +38 403
#note Ugh.  I confused WOX (which does not conjugate other than WOXEN) with WEX here.  I also thought that WEX may just be a noun as well.  I thought he was getting desperate for points with the board all but shut down at this point, so I took the chance to challenge in order to achieve a sure win.
>Matt_: FIILLNW 6J F... +15 420
#note WILJA# would have been a lifesaver had I known it, much less been able to see it.  I'd sure have liked to have drawn one of those 4 unseen O's to kill the OBI hook.  I still have an over 50% chance of winning according to CP.
>Steve: OV 8M .OV +23 426
#note He finally cashes this O hook, and grabs a lead for the first time since HEAVY.
>Matt_: IILLNNW 14F IWI +10 430
#note Still not seeing WILJA.  NINJA I did see, but really felt I needed to get rid of the W before it became unplayable in the endgame.  Playing IWI at G12 keeping an I is much better though.
>Steve: O 14N O. +6 432
#note I'm sure I'm not the first or last to let go a phony 2 because it played against a blank.  I was so focused on my own endgame strategy with the junk in my rack that I didn't closely examine his play until he had drawn replacement tiles.  It creates an interesting hook though that I'd use later.

>Matt_: ELLNNOT 14J ON +11 441
#note Just wanted to score here.  I have a 1/8 chance of pulling the C out of the bag, so maybe I should look to take my chances with a C stick and play in row 3, but it was yet another thing I wasn't concerned about when I should have been.
>Steve: ACORRRY 3M ..C +7 439
>Matt_: ELLNTT F14 .N +2 443
#note So my thought process here: he can dump YO in this spot, then dump his one R at REH.  This way he has to play his Y at YEH.  I'd win eventually with my T scoring, but I missed one of his potential plays.
>Steve: AORRRY A12 RA.. +12 451
#note Didn't see this for one, and now I think I'm in big trouble.
>Matt_: ELLTT 11N T. +8 451
#note Cashing the first T now.  If I play rEIS H12 I block a lot of his O and R plays, even if I sacrifice LEV.  Just not that good with my board vision/endgame playing yet.
>Steve: ORRY H7 Y.. +9 460
#note He cashes his Y.
>Matt_: ELLT O6 LE. +6 457
#note I'm thinking he's gonna play DO, and that I might pull out a win by 2.
>Steve: ORR H11 O.R.. +4 464
#note But then he plays this for 4 instead.  Sneaky Quackle figures out that he can play Or for 1, then play OrRIS for 4 and win by 1!  Freaking crazy game.
>Matt_: LT M12 ..T. +7 464
#note And now that phony 2 I let go allows me to tie the game.  Not going to make you click through the 6 passes, but we each get docked a point and end up tied at 463.  Thrilling to the end.
