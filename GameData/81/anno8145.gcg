#note O8 BEMEAN for 2 more
>trashman: EGILLST 8E LEG.LIST +60 140
#note TILLAGES doesn't set up a hook, but Q values each equally
>_bill_rexhausen: AACEPQV N6 CAP +21 159
#note Q prefers shedding the Q at I13 for the same points. Note that CAPIZ is now available, as Bill pointed out to me afterward...
>trashman: ADDLOTU 15F LOAD +35 175
#note Q slightly prefers TOAD or 15H ODA. I prefer keeping the T over the L, and the front extension possibilities (PLANE, TRAIN, TRUCK, UNDER, and WAGON hit the TW)
>_bill_rexhausen: AAENQRV 13H AVE +32 191
#note Q prefers L4 QANAT, though this scores best
>trashman: DENORTU K2 ROUNDE.T +68 243
#note Q ranks this equal to E3 ROUNDLET, which seems highly volatile. Note that UNDERLOAD was also available...
>_bill_rexhausen: AEGINQR 4J Q.AG +28 219
>trashman: ?CDKOTU 15A TrUCK.... +54 297
#note I looked for a while, but missed the only playable bingo. Not sure this was worth the blank, but Q lists it just behind the bingo, and 2J DROUK/TRUCK. Can you find the bingo? Answer on next turn... 
>_bill_rexhausen: EIINRTW 2G WINT.IER +76 295
#note 2E DUCTwO(R)K 68. Should've found it...
>trashman: OORVZ H1 V.ZOR +54 351
#note So much for CAPIZ. I didn't have an A, but I don't think I'd have seen that possibility...
>_bill_rexhausen: ADFIOPW 1L APOD +33 328
#note Q slightly prefers 1M WOP/FOP/WAP/POW
>trashman: ADHNOSY 5E HYD.O +24 375
#note Q prefers playing the case S at 6D with HOYAS or YODHS, with this close behind. The S is worth holding on to in a tight game...
>_bill_rexhausen: FIIORTW A12 WRI. +11 339
#note Bill struggled with this play. His choice doesn't make Q's cut. Q likes 10C WIFTIER and a host of other low-scoring options, including Exch. 7.
>trashman: AINNNOS I7 A.ON. +19 394
#note Q slightly prefers 4B NONA. Better leave, but I'd rather not open up lanes...
>_bill_rexhausen: ?FGIOOT 4D GO +11 350
#note Doesn't make Q's list, but it's a smart play, though it empties the bag. I see his bingo immediately, but see I can win without blocking. In a tourney, where spread matters, I block...
>trashman: EEIMNNS 15L SEEM +42 436
#note Q agrees. None of the blocking plays score nearly as well, and I'll give Bill the satisfaction of bingoing out and boosting his scoring average. Good game, Bill!
