>Matt_: CEGINNR 8D CRINGE +24 24
#note I pull yet another bingo out of the bag, that I think about playing, but in the end I can't pull the trigger on CERNING#.  As you'll see, that doesn't affect the luckbox.
>Steve: II -II +0 0
>Matt_: DEFGINU 9F FEUDING +81 105
>Steve: AELX 8L AXLE +40 40
>Matt_: AAEJKOS 7L JA +31 136
#note This does well, probably because it balances and takes the X spot while keeping the S.  
>Steve: HILT N6 HI.T +25 65
>Matt_: AAEKOST D5 OAT.AKES +78 214
#note Thought this was a junk rack at first, but eventually found this and prayed Steve didn't block. 
>Steve: ELOPSTT C1 POTTLES +77 142
#note Ah, the fun fits that Collins gives.
>Matt_: ?EILNRU 1C .URLINEs +80 294
#note Glad to see I didn't miss a 3x3.  This scores highest with PERILUNe and PLUNkIER.
>Steve: INOR K9 .OIR +8 150
>Matt_: ?BILOOO 10B BO.O +16 310
>Steve: EFIRSV 2I FIVERS +36 186
>Matt_: ?DIILOQ O5 QI +16 326
#note Was hoping for an open S or U for SOLIQUID.
>Steve: BDEOR C9 B.RED +33 219
>Matt_: ?DDILNO J8 D.DO +30 356
#note DILDO in the same spot blocks row 13, but as I have the last blank/S I'm not concerned with closing that lane.
>Steve: AHW E3 HAW +30 249
>Matt_: ?ILNNVW 11C ..WIN +26 382
#note VENIN is much better, as column L is a riskier hotspot than row 11.
>Steve: STYZ L1 Z.STY +54 303
#note And I realized it just as he plucked this down.
>Matt_: ?AELNVY K4 ANY +24 406
#note No reason to open the 3x3, even with a Y.  ZEAL might be worth it with the blank.
>Steve: ACM J4 CAM +37 340
>Matt_: ?ELMORV F4 LEV +23 429
>Steve: AAPU B2 PAUA +32 372
#note Nice play here.  I held him, then let it go once I saw I could go out.
