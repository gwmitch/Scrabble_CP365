>Matt_: IIIMNPQ 8G QI +22 22
>John: AADELNW 7H DANELAW +66 66
#note He was hoping for a challenge, but knowing DANEGELD I thought this was a legal term in that vein and let it go.
>Matt_: AIILMNP 9F LIMP +30 52
#note Didn't play LIMPA because of the hot spot creation.
>John: DEGOT 8K TOGED +37 103
#note Another nice play.
>Matt_: ABEFINS 6M FAB +25 77
#note Note the FLIMP# hook.  I take the lesser placement of FAB.
>John: LOZ 6I ZOL +32 135
>Matt_: AEINSTU 10H SINUATE +72 149
#note The rack pruning pays off.
>John: AEIUVX 10A EXUVIA +38 173
#note Scored as 36, which he didn't catch when he recounted the game.  I'm sitting over with my rack hoping against hope for an E 3rd position...
>Matt_: ARRSTUY A8 TR.ASURY +158 307
#note ...and he miraculously gave it to me.  EXUVIA is probably the right play for him anyway, just very unlucky.
>John: ??GIMPW 12A .WaMPInG +82 255
#note Undeterred, he bingoes back.
>Matt_: BEHNOOR 11I NOH +29 336
#note HOBNOB would've been a fun find.
>John: AY 9A .AY +28 283
>Matt_: BCEKORV H12 .ECK +33 369
#note RECORK scores 11 more, and he doesn't bingo back next turn.  
>John: ADEESTU 14E EDU.ATES +67 350
#note And he's right back in the game.
>Matt_: BIORRTV E6 ORIB. +18 387
#note Couldn't block row 15 well, so decided for some extra volatility.
>John: DEINR -DRNEI +0 350
>Matt_: CNORRTV D3 VROT +16 403
#note My kingdom for a vowel!  Once again I didn't like much blocking row 15, so getting rid of the V seemed best.
>John: HILOT 15K THIOL +47 397
#note Ouch, but expected nonetheless.
>Matt_: CGJNNNR -CGNNR +0 403
#note Man where are these vowels?  I was happy to find there were 7 in the bag so I could exchange. I keep the J to score next turn, especially with 5 E's unseen, and the N is extra vowel insurance that I ended up using.
>John: ADEEIRS 4D .ERAISED +60 457
#note He has 2 other choices for bingoes, but this one hurts him the most with my draw.
>Matt_: EEEIJNO 3G JOE +41 444
#note I played this right away, keeping EINE for flexibility in the endgame and going for a quick out in 2.  It was only when I confirmed tracking (remember, John's at 455 here by our count) that I actually had him on the ropes.
>John: CFGNNOR 2I FROG +16 473
#note FORK and CRONK would have led to a tie game.  He spent his last 12 minutes figuring this out, including recounting the game to see if he could win by one.  Unfortunately for him he couldn't find the EXUVIA error.
>Matt_: EEIN 3A NIE.E +18 462
#note Took awhile to find this, but I had plenty of time while he figured out his endgame.  Just really lucky, and I'm gonna pay for this kind of fortune down the line unless I improve my game in response.
>Matt_:  (CNN) +10 472
#note Final score recorded as 472-471, reversing the W/L result.
