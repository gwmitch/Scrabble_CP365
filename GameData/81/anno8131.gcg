>Steve: ELZ 8G ZEL +24 24
>Matt_: ADDEIMN 9G AMID +28 28
#note This sims at the top, which surprised me.  Thought there had to be something better.
>Steve: EITY K8 YETI +22 46
>Matt_: DEEGNNR 11H ENR.NGED +60 88
#note I'm not sure how this one stuck.  It must have been seeing ENRINGS# when I studied some high-play 7's, and remembering it was a verb.  Either way, happy to find any CSW bingoes.
>Steve: ?CEENTU 12C CUNEtTE +73 119
#note I thought he was fishing for a challenge when he made the blank a T, as this is #-only.  He later bemoaned that he didn't find CUNEaTED for 89.
>Matt_: BENOOUX O5 UNBOXE. +51 139
#note He blocked UNBOX for 61, but this way he can't extend EX to the triple.
>Steve: AAAIIIW -AAAIIIW +0 119
>Matt_: AEHIOSU M8 HOA.IE +22 161
#note This or N11 EUOI#.  He mentioned he had a big J play through the G before I played this.
>Steve: EJST 14J JETS +38 157
#note This play changed the whole dynamic of the game, as you'll see.
>Matt_: EEQSSTU 10A QUEESTS +82 243
#note I was all set to play QUEST at 14J for 79 (!), but the extra time I took allowed me to find this #-only bingo.  If I had looked harder though, I might find SEQUENTS E7 and not have to worry about the Q in the triple lane the rest of the game.
>Steve: CHNO 15H CHON +38 195
>Matt_: FIIMNOR 9B NORI +14 257
#note This isn't very good, and doesn't really block the Q all that well, which is what I was trying to do.  Should just play QI if that's what I'm going for.  Of note, JETSOM and JETSON#.
>Steve: AABIL L4 LABIA +26 221
>Matt_: FFILMPR 5I PIL.F +20 277
#note EFF N11 is nice, since it'll block his W play next turn.  I start to struggle with awkward racks from here on out.
>Steve: DW N10 W.D +32 253
#note He just never stops scoring.  Such a tenacious player.
>Matt_: FGMRRVW -FGMRRVW +0 277
#note With two other R's unseen, thought it best to throw back the entire rack.  Just ugly.
>Steve: ORTY 6G RYOT +17 270
>Matt_: AAAGKOT 5D TAKA +18 295
#note He told me afterwards he liked this play to keep the board manageable.  AKA# is out because of the bingo potential down column D.  Didn't even see OAK/NEK# 13G.
>Steve: ?AIRU A10 .UAIRs +45 315
#note And I finally get hit for leaving the Q open.  There's no more bingoing on this board, so burning the blank is the right play.
>Matt_: AFGOORV 8C GOV +22 317
#note This does pretty well.  D1 GAVOT is another option, but he's likely to score there.
>Steve: AW 13H AW +22 337
>Matt_: AFMOPRV 4A FORAM +36 353
#note I figured I had to take the points and hope for the best in the endgame.  This valuates really badly by CP (-51.5!), presumably because of stuff like SOLDIER/SMA#, but I have a 5% winning chance.  He asked about JETSAM/JETSOM, but I can't empty the bag, keep FPV and hope to outrun him. 
>Steve: DGILORS A1 GOL. +24 361
#note IDOLS 3A 32 is fun.
>Matt_: EIPV 6B VIE +17 370
#note I thought he had RIDE, not RIDS, which is why I didn't bother blocking the G with OP.  He said he'd have played DIES K13, and if I know CIVE#, we tie.  With perfect play, he finds SIRDAR G1 and blocking is moot.   
>Steve: DIRS 1A .RIDS +9 370
>Steve:  (P) +6 376
#note Final recorded as 377-370.
