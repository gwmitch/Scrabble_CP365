>Jim_Burlant: AAIRSSU D8 .ARUS +16 16
#note The only 8's in this rack are SAURIANS and SAMURAIS.  Nothing really scores, though Q says I should have played SAU I8 for 13.  Q may be right - not enough bang for the buck to justify playing off the R, and this opens up too much.  One other thing worth noting - his opening play of VOLTE takes a back S; I had confused this with VOLTA and VOLTI, which do not.
>Orry_Swift: DEIJ 10B JE.ID +33 57
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAIIST C12 AI +6 22
#note No 8's play and a fish is obviously called for.  Q prefers this at 9F, but I didn't want to block G column in case I needed the T.  And, like I said, I was thinking that VOLTE didn't take the S.
>Orry_Swift: DEFGPST E5 DEP.S.T +46 103
#note WOW!!!! This is a FANTASTIC play by Orry.  This was Orry's actual rack, and it took him a while to find this - it's clearly his best play, as nothing else scores more than 23.  
>Jim_Burlant: ?AHINST H1 AbSINTH. +83 105
#note Best bingo, and it's 42% to win.
>Orry_Swift: EFGIR F2 GRIEF +37 140
>Jim_Burlant: ADIIIOT B10 .IAO +16 121
#note OIDIA scores 16 at 14A, but it gives way too much back.  The sim makes it clear that it's either this or 14B IDIOT.  In retrospect, IDIOT looks a lot better.  29.5% to win.
>Orry_Swift: BELQTUZ -BELQT +0 140
>Jim_Burlant: ADIIOTW 3C WAI. +14 135
#note Not looking hard enough at the board.  I1 WAIT scores 19 and is the best of a weak lot.  While it wouldn't have stopped him from bingoing, the bingo he would have gotten would have given a lot more back.
>Orry_Swift: EINORTU 3H .NOUTIER +68 208
>Jim_Burlant: AADEIOT O1 AD.OIT +24 159
#note Q has an interesting suggestion:  opening up a 3x3 in the A column with TOEA or ODEA.  This wins almost as often, however.  12.7% to win.
>Orry_Swift: ADQ K2 Q.AD +28 236
>Jim_Burlant: AEELNNS F10 .EN +7 166
#note No 7's in this rack and the only 8's, LEANNESS and ENPLANES, don't play.  This play was the right idea with the wrong execution.  I wanted to open up row 13.  Q wants me to fish at 4C for 13. At the time I was worried about making sure the southeast opened up, but given that the J, L, and N columns are bingoable, I don't need to trade the 6 points for the more open board.  NEE N1 should have been the play.
>Orry_Swift: ENNRUY 12F .UNNERY +22 258
>Jim_Burlant: AELNOST N6 ETALONS +65 231
#note Couldn't think of ANOLYTES, which scores 2 fewer points but is the better bingo.  Regardless, this is still bleak:  12% to win.
>Orry_Swift: BKR 8L KB.R +45 303
>Jim_Burlant: BCEEFLM D1 FL.B +26 257
#note Q wants me to play 4A FEEB - I'm protecting my E's and don't want to play both of them.  Nothing wins 10% at this point; it's pretty much over except for the final score.
>Orry_Swift: ?IZ L1 ZI.s +57 360
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEMMV H12 .AVE +21 278
#note I've pretty much given up at this point and am moving tiles to end the game.

#note Tip of the hat to Orry - well played.  Frankly, I'm surprised the final spread wasn't worse.  While I had several minor equity slips, I don't see how this one was mine to win.  Better play on my end undoubtedly loses by less, but there were just too many inert racks where, outside of his exchange, he was always able to score.
