#note A few times we had some disagreement or misunderstanding about the score and Glenn uses the Moore Method apparently to resolve them.  What do you believe the score is now?  The eyebrows raise.  If anything should be in a movie about Scrabble, I nominate this.  (I only know a tiny bit about the Moore Method.  The professor from U. Texas who started it has a biography recently published, available in the Austin Public Library: Robert Lee Moore. At Georgia Tech, George Cain taught topology in the same way, interrogating.) When I asked Glenn whether he used the Moore Method he gave a quick grin and went back to asking the questions :)  Besides the score, after the game Glenn also asked about the words.  Why shlub instead of blush?  (I was shy of blushing or blushers etc, actually.  I just replied it was only two points less.) Are you sure shlub is correct? How did you know to challenge izard? (Izzard has two Zs, I replied.) Why did you put an I after B? That didn't do anything to the board. (I don't have a very good answer for that one.) He seemed to admit my game was superior, but I kind of don't think my game is really too perfect.
