>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: FHKOQWY F2 ...KY +27 107
#note There's quite a few good options available. I liked this because it saved QOPH if I needed it. The sim says take WHITY, though. Save the K for a big overlap to JUNK?
>Cheryl_Tyler: BIR 5C BIR. +28 94
#note Now I understand why JUNKY didn't sim great

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEEFOQT 6B FOE +23 158
#note Damn, if I could remember with certainty that FICO didnt take the S, I would have laid that trap at K11 for sure. That would have been huge. FOE is weak.

#note I hated leaving this overlap open. But of course, this creates new problems which will cause me a lot of stress later.

#note Tough call. I risk weakening my S-hook on TOOL since she can play to the T to close it. (BO)VID instead? Nah...

#note Not much to say. Several large mistakes this game. It was closer than it needed to be.
