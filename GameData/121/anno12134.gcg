#note I don't see any short plays here that I like. but I have better choices of long plays - GOALIE wins the sim by 2 points, and GALIOT is a little better than my play. It's hard for me to explain why GOALIE is so much better defensively - something about it makes it hard for her to make good overlap plays.

#note at the time it felt like a tough play, and it used a lot of my time, but now it looks easy. OE is clearly an upgrade on my play. I was way too paranoid - OE bingoes 50% of the time next turn versus 36% after PORE. the lane that gets opened isn't that great anyway.
