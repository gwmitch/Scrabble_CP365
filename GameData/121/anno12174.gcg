#note The beginning of day 2.  I don't clearly remember what it was like to play this one.  It seems Cheryl Melvin vs. Nigel Richards was the first game ever uploaded onto Cross-Tables, so I'm happy to be in that company.  On my 5th play I felt sure that DIADEM couldn't take an S hook due to some strange Latin reason, sort of like MEDIAD (towards the median) with its obvious meaning, so I held the S and luckily drew a bingo rack. Trying to go out in 1 I put 'dongo' on the board at the end, which was gently challenged off the board.  Seems like pretty much easy decisions through the game for me and I didn't have to work my brain too hard for once, just because I was drawing well, and Cheryl's plays were mostly 3 or 4 tiles only.

>Kevin_Leeds: ACEHORS 9B ROACHES +78 216
#note 'Roach' means to arch something or bend it in the middle, it's a verb.  I first heard it as a noun when I was in high school.  I did not hang with those ppl.  The rack makes a compound 8 to an R in two places here - the first part is a common large four-legged animal historically used for transportation and the second part is a more modern very common mode of transportation :)  I never knew that one before :)  It's ROACHES, CHOREAS, ORACHES which I've practiced on Zyzzyva but didn't take the effort to recall it during the game.  Misscored as 77 instead of 78.

#note There's another seven letter bingo with ?=U, and also one more bingo lurking on the board with EERSTV? - very tricky to find.  In my next turn I am about to play a POO word and then discuss its meaning, so if you are very easily disturbed then skip it, but if you think Gilbert Godfrey is funny then you may not mind


>Cheryl_Melvin: CLY 15A CL.Y +39 304
>Kevin_Leeds: EJS 1L JE.S +66 422
#note JEWS: A word from the POO list, not allowed in school scrabble.  The meaning is really dodgy since the sound and spelling are similar to a religion, but the activity can be done by anybody.  What's the best non-scapegoating synonym for it?  To lawyer? To take advantage by superior use of information and position? To chump? Many various associations and emotional meanings might be connected with this. Or it can just be a way to get 66 points!  I have used the same spot, top row, right four squares, tile in the 3rd spot to put ZAPS on Chris Cree.  He is not that hard to beat if you draw ridiculously well.  My goal is to get as good at Scrabble as Chris Cree.  I will probably never get there though.  I spent too much time as a youngster doing chess.

#note QI is Chinese life force!  I am lucking out with the power tiles here. Hint: The tricky bingo with EERSTV? was a 9 with ?=L. I will tell you it the turn after next!

>Kevin_Leeds: DGNOO --  -18 471
#note Convenient mental hybrid of  DOGGO, DINGO, BONGO, GONZO etc.  The answer to the tricky bingo is TRAVELERS on the bottom row before CLAY was there.  The reason I thought it was so exceptionally tricky was that i thought the L was an i so it looked like TRAEIERS, which you could only find if you are in Division 1, but I was quite mistaken; it is not that tricky a bingo, unless you think all 9s are automatically extremely tricky and abstruse (which I am tempted to think.  I study 8s about 1000 times harder than I study 9s since they're rarer. It's not the correct approach.)

#note Final score recorded as 416-486 as ROACHES was given a score of 77 instead of the correct number which was 78.  Good game Cheryl! Try to draw better and make some longer words (in advantageous places!) Good luck in the rest of the tournament!
