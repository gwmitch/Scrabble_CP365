>Randy_Greenspan: ADOR 8F ORAD +10 10
>Jim_Burlant: EFINNOT 7H FON +16 16
#note After debating whether FONTINE* was legitimate (FONTINA is the legitimate bingo, and the word I was confusing it with is PONTINE) I put this down.  This is a little dangerous, but given the EINT leave and the fact that I've got the T in my rack, I figured that this was the play.  Quackle agrees - this is best, and the next best plays - 7H FINO and 7H FONT win almost 2% less often.
>Randy_Greenspan: AEGJTU K3 JUGATE +35 45
>Jim_Burlant: CEEIINT G8 .EINCITE +62 78
#note The only bingo.  55% to win.
>Randy_Greenspan: IQZ F10 QI +64 109
#note Randy told me post-mortem that he had the Q and the Z in this rack.  
>Jim_Burlant: AELNRSS 14D SAL.ERNS +62 140
#note I had expected him to come back with something on row 15, and as such was getting ready to play ENSNARLS on the 2x2 for 82 when his play of QI threw me for a loop; it took me a while just to find this.  The best bingo is clearly 15B REALNESS; I whiffed on it.  REALNESS wins 63%; this wins roughly 56.
>Randy_Greenspan: GMPRZ 4I GR.MP +20 129
>Jim_Burlant: BDEHOSW 12G .HOWED +38 178
#note Strong choice, but not best.  L7 SHOWED scores 51.  I saw this, thought it better than BOSH 15A,  and tunnel vision set in, preventing me from looking at the rest of the board to find my best play.  
>Randy_Greenspan: ELZ 13C LEZ +37 166
>Jim_Burlant: BEFIISX H14 .X +54 232
#note Hard to turn down 54 points, but that's what Quackle wants me to do; Q says I should play 11K FIB for 29.  Awkward leave or not, I have  a hard time turning down 54 points.  74% to win, but not for long.
>Randy_Greenspan: AAELMSY N2 AMYLASE +92 258
>Jim_Burlant: BEEFIIS O8 FIB +39 271
#note O8 FIE is also a strong choice.  45% to win.  
>Randy_Greenspan: EINNV D8 VENIN.. +28 286
>Jim_Burlant: DEEEIPS 11K PEED +25 296
#note This is one of 4 plays that stands out at the top of the sim, and they're pretty much identical in Quackle's eyes:  the other 3 are M2 PEP (which I considered but I didn't like the lack of turnover as well as the potential for what it gave back if he had something like WYE in his rack), 11K PIED (which I didn't think of ) and another play I didn't think of, 11K PEDES.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, Randy had jsut drawn both the blanks.
>Randy_Greenspan: EHOY O1 HEY +36 322
#note Randy told me post-mortem that PEED blocked his intended play of HOY 11I.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIIST -II +0 296
#note What do you do if, like me, you don't see the 13I plays? Q agrees that, in that case, your best option is to exchange.  AIT 13I was the play.  AIT wins 31% (my last choice was one of 4 which won 46%); this wins roughly 25.
>Randy_Greenspan: AO 5K .OA. +13 335
>Jim_Burlant: AEIISTU N11 .UIT +10 306
#note Quackle likes ADIEU N10; I didn't even consider plays that unloaded my E.  This was a setup play for my S.  This fares poorly statically, but it's respectable in the sim.  One thing to keep in mind is that, due to several math errors on both sides, we thought I was 8 points closer to Randy than I was, and this factored into my play selection.
>Randy_Greenspan: KTU 13M K.T +14 349
#note Randy put down KUE M9, pulled it up, then put this down.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGISV 15L VISA +39 345
#note Best, but only 30% to win.  Due to the aforementioned scoring/math errors, we thought that this gave me a 341 - 337 lead.
>Randy_Greenspan: BOW 10J BOW +26 375
>Jim_Burlant: CDEGRRT 11C R.C.. +14 359
#note Given the closeness of the game and what I perceived as the low probability that I'd draw into a bingo, I tried to keep things as close as possible w/o opening up.  In retrospect, Q's runner-up suggestion looks best:  9C REG, as I have the D to back hook it.  However, if he's got a blank, that could backfire.
>Randy_Greenspan: ??LU 8B LU. +6 381
>Jim_Burlant: DEGIORT 9A GIT. +11 370
#note Then again, if I played REG like Quackle wanted me to, I would have been sitting on CORDITE.  This position had me stumped. I saw possible bingos like RATIONAL, etc., in the pool and blocking those without emptying the bag seemed like the right thing to do; if he didn't have a bingo ending in A or O, it would be a potentially interesting end game depending on the draw.   Also - we thought that this play brought me back within 3 points, which makes it an entirely different game.  In reality, given his next rack, it didn't matter at all what I put down - I was toast no matter what.
>Randy_Greenspan: ??AIORU 3C cURIOsA +68 449
>Jim_Burlant: ADEOORT 5D ROADEO +18 388
#note GAROTED A9 30!
>Randy_Greenspan: N L4 ..N +7 456
>Randy_Greenspan:  (T) +2 458
#note While there was definitely room for improvement in how I played this one, I'm not convinced it would have resulted in a win.  Post-mortem, RAndy told me he was already sitting on both blanks when I put down PEED.  While I did make a few mistakes - SALTERNS instead of REALNESS, CHOWED instead of SHOWED, exchanging instead of AIT - it seemed like the points missed from those first two came out in the wash, and by the time I exchanged, he was already sitting on the blanks.  My gut says that, unless the 2 or 3 tiles Quackle says I should have turned yielded one of the blanks, I may have been dead no matter what.  But I definitely should not have lost this game by as much as I did.
