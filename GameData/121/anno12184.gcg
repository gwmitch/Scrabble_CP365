>Cynthia_Pughsley: EGILORS 8D GLORIES +70 70
#note This game was played on a board that was arched up in the middle (ROACHED).  I noticed a gap of about half an inch between the arched playing surface (transparent, with the grid on it) and the power square markings (flat, not arched). I thought about messing with the director as follows: a) Make the first play to miss the center by one row b) Tilt the board at a steep angle to make the word be located vertically above the marking for the center square, when the director comes to evaluate the challenge.  After he rules it still a phony though, I do not know what the next step would be in the game.  Well, the other side should pass somehow equally creative.

#note Good start!  Why didn't I play it two squares to the left? for 7 more points! and no dangerous S hook?  I thought of that after I'd played already.  I never thought of GROOMING until now (haw haw!) After the third day we did our laundry, but we had no laundry soap; we just used some shampoo or something - body wash.  It didn't work, my shirts smelled a lot like armpit the fourth day and the fifth day and especially the sixth day after we'd driven back towards Dallas and Austin through the night.

#note This isn't how the board looked - I think it was rotated, the first play being vertical

#note INFLICTION didn't really seem wrong to me.  I thought it might be wrong and this blocked my bingo spot.  30 points seemed like a hit I could probably absorb and still win so I tried the challenge.

#note There's also RUbEOLA or AUREOLa.  Conversation: (stops clock) 'You have to state the blank! (I''m a director!)' 'No I don''t! It's a T.' (starts clock) 'Well maybe you don''t.'  'They keep changing the rules.'

#note This was at C2 not 3B because the arrangement of tiles is reflected along the diagonal.  This might be the best tactical move I made the whole tournament.  There's a prize for best strategic move, which is impossible to evaluate - prize for worst strategic play would be much easier and fun to do!

#note Around this time Cynthia was thinking hard and some people sat down at the table to the right of us, and started talking loudly about what they would have for lunch, so I said SHHHHHH extremely loud.  Soon it happened again with Stefan Fatsis on the other side of us and I said SHHHHHHHH really loud again, and some a few people laughed from division 3 over on the other side of the room.  So that is about how famous I am, after all my efforts to be famous :)

#note Time to enter the turns into Quackle: About seven hours.  Started, got a phone call, drove to pick up girlfriend, went to dinner, came back, entered more moves, tried to figure out what tile the blank was, tried to find a lost earring, tried to figure out why there were five Ls, tried to find a move that scored 59 instead of 60, finally added 1 + 1 to get 2, finally got done; then added funny comments.
