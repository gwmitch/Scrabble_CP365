#note Brilliantly it turns out I saw YARD could be a nice leave and decided to keep it instead of playing JAY for more points.  NURD seemed like it could turn out to be kind of a nasty leave I thought.  A three-ply sim indicates they're about equally good plays according to Quackle-land evaluation at least

#note Played it here because I felt like making the board more compact.  I think that's better in this situation because the other player gets first shot at scoring if it's open.

#note About here while my clock was running I heard sounds like "hm hm hm" coming from the other player so I stopped my clock and mentioned (I guess rudely, sorry) that these sounds were distracting so then they stopped.  I had had too much coffee.  What is the right approach?  My clock is running and I believe I am being distracted.  So I stop my clock.  I state that I am hearing distracting sounds from that side of the table.  After that I am not sure what words to say. What would the referee rule? Is it distracting to make soft hm hm hm sounds while a person is trying to think of the best scrabble play? I think I found a good play here although it doesn't score very much, for the tiles I had at the time.

#note challenged CADGER because I'm all confused about CODGER, CADGER, CADGE, CADGED and I hate when people put phony R hooks on me! But this wasn't one!

>Diana_Spiller: ?AENRTT 3F TERTiAN +61 257
#note We scored TERTiAN as 62 instead of the correct score for it, 61.  A better winning chance is RATTENeR for 74.  Quackle finds over 50 bingos available for this turn.

>Kevin_Leeds: IINOQTU 4C QUOIN +32 318
#note Here I took a while to think about whether it would be good to fish for an S for QUESTION or an A for EQUATION or an R for QUERN.  It seemed very hard to compute, and I didn't really know what to do, but it seemed like there wasn't any really intelligent place to dump an I.  Two points is just not enough points.  It's an interesting position to me, I hope I'll understand it some day.  My decision was made thinking there would not be another bingo (not too great an assumption), and that some higher scoring tiles would be required, and that I should attempt to draw the medium value tiles that were out like H, C, G, P.  Quackle's Championship Player seems to agree with me that QUOIN is best, and next is OI on 2G, and next is OI on 10A, both nearly as good; I didn't consider those. QUOIT is after those.  It is showing my Bogowin % as only 38 or 37 percent though. 

>Diana_Spiller: OR A13 .OR +12 322
>Kevin_Leeds: ACHIPTU 14J CH.TA +32 350
#note Wow, my choice 'che(t)a' for 32 would have been great if it hadn't been phony. It's almost not phony: CHAETA is good, and so is CHETAH. I should have remembered all the tiles unseen were light so leaving a hook on 14O would not have been a problem really. It's kind of ironic that my idea of drawing the CHEAP tiles worked so well, given that I didn't know how to use them properly. The best idea is to block the bingo lanes created by BEVEL, and a good way is to play CH(E)AP on N6 for 24.  In an alternate universe, Diana has played OR to hook O(F) and R(IFS), and then I might have drawn ACHIOPT and played APHOTIC and TOR for 100.

>Kevin_Leeds: IINOOPU O5 POI.U +7 357
#note Here Quackle absolutely recommends POILU as the best.  So that makes me proud that I picked it, though it would also be nice if I could be even more smart than a bucket of bolts

#note When thinking about the word 'DOWIE' the main challenge is not to think that it's a golf club.  If it were a golf club it could take an S on it.  The meaning is 'dreary, dismal, depressing'.  (There are hidden artistic gems in the minimal OSPD definitions!) On the other hand, there's another golf word 'DORMIE' that also does not take an S after it because it means something about how many strokes ahead (behind) they are before the last round of the golf game.  I am sure it must apply to Scrabble tournaments too. (Also in Scrabble a 'back hook' is confusing to get at first, so maybe if making a multi-letter extension to a word then maybe one of the spots in the extension could be 'dormie'? I'm speculating. This is how I gloat. I am a bad person. I hope that people don't hate me. I want to be a writer when I grow up.)

#note We submitted a score of 344-386 because TERTiAN was counted as 62, not 61.
