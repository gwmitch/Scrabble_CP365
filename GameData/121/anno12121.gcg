#note I really thought about cashing in a blank for WAVER here and figuring that P? couldn't be 18 points worse than AV??, but I had visions of disaster draws to P? and therefore decided to play it safe and hold both blanks. Then again, even if he starts playing really defensively after seeing the first blank there's not much he can do to stop me from bingoing. One way or other I am the heavy favorite at this point.

#note I didn't especially want to do this after ALA, but I actually figured that he probably didn't have great letters to go with it and the worse that could happen would be a 3X3 with an A in 7th place...much harder to do without a blank. Any high-point tiles he has would have to have just been drawn.
