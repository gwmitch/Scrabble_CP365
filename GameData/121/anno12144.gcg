>Jim_Burlant: CJLMRRV -JLMRV +0 0
#note Best exchange.  Exchanging 6 keeping only the R wins nearly 1-1/2% less often and sims 3 pionts down.  
>Jason_Li: DINORU 8D DIURON +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: AAACQRX F6 AQ.A +15 15
#note Hated giving up the easy E back hook on row 10, but this rack doesn't leave me any choice.  This is best.  Interestingly, the second best option is exchanging AAQX.  This wins 40%; exchaning wins 38.5.
>Jason_Li: KORU D8 .ROUK +20 38
>Jim_Burlant: ACGIRRX I4 RAXI.G +17 32
#note  This is the runner up and it does have the saving grace of unloading the G, but the crux of the matter is that it gives up too much on the scoreboard to...well...11B CRUX, which I somehow missed - just couldn't think of the word.  CRUX should have been the play.
>Jason_Li: FIZ E4 FIZ +41 79
>Jim_Burlant: CDEORTY H1 DECOY +44 76
#note Well, my last play was a miss but this is on target.  This is clearly best, as the next best choice sims almost 15 points down and wins 5% less often.  39% to win.
>Jason_Li: GIL G6 GI.L +35 114
#note Nice!
>Jim_Burlant: AEMNRTT E11 MAT +24 100
#note The only 8's in this rack need an I, so there are no bingos.  Any number of strong plays available - D1 MATE, E11 MATT, MATTE...I didn't want to part with the E, and anything I put down at 11E left a potential E back hook, so I saw no reason to play the extra tile.  Q agrees with me:  this is best, winning 37%.
>Jason_Li: AEGU D1 AGUE +22 136
>Jim_Burlant: EENRTVW 14B VENTER +28 128
#note A row 14 play was obviously called for, but this was the wrong one.  RENEW 14B scores 38 and should have been the play.  Just like the CRUX miss - again, somehow I didn't see it.  RENEW wins 34%; this wins almost 32. Surprised I don't take a bigger hit in the sim for this.
>Jason_Li: BEN 15F NEB +19 155
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEILW 13E .WAE +18 146
#note Again - right idea, wrong execution.  13E TWICE scores 22 and leaves AEL and a less volatile board position.  I've been holding steady at 31% winning chances or thereabouts.
>Jason_Li: PW 5H ..WP +24 179
>Jim_Burlant: CEHILTU 12H HELIC +37 183
>Jim_Burlant: CEHILTU --  -37 146
#note Note to self:  CHIEL and CHILE are the only two words in CEHIL.  HELIC* is not a word!!!!!   The best legitimate plays are 2A CHUG and 1A HULA, the latter of which I couldn't think of.  HUIC 12H, which I considered, isn't bad, either.  The latter would have prevented his next play; playing for 0 on this turn was bone-headed.
>Jason_Li: EILNRSS K5 .ILSNERS +70 249
>Jim_Burlant: CEHILTU 2A CHU. +20 166
#note Tunnel vision from the previous turn.  Now that I had dug myself a rather sizeable hole, my first priority was to keep hope alive.  Best looks to be 8K SCHUL and 8K SHUTE.  No need to open the triple up, though this did help me stay in the game.
>Jason_Li: AM 3B AM. +23 272

>Jason_Li: DEV 1M DEV +27 299
>Jim_Burlant: ?AENOST M1 ..tONATES +72 310
#note Luck box!  This is also my best bingo.  The only row 12 play is TREASONS, which scores 69.  40% to win.
>Jason_Li: HIIL N6 HILI +34 333
>Jim_Burlant: AEFNOOT O7 EF +36 346
#note SI saw FOOT down the J column (couldn't think of AFOOT), and passed on that due to the unseen Y.  Between that and the unseen pool's threatening BIOtYPE O9 and JOINs O4, my primary concern was blocking those plays.  I chose this over EFT for 42 due to leave; ANOOT looked better as a leave than ANOO, especially if he left the vowels in the bag.
>Jason_Li: ?EIJOP 12H POI.E +27 360
#note Blocking the out in two that I did see.  With my rack of ABNOOTY, I would have otherwise had an out in two of STONY/BOA that would have won.
>Jim_Burlant: ABNOOTY 4L T.BY +26 372
#note With all my mistakes to this point, I don't have an outright win.  But I still have a tie.  But to see it, I had to worry more about what I could have done with my tiles rather than worry about what he could do with his.   I was so worried about blocking his potential TaJ L2 that I missed my own out in two when his POISED blocked my intended play of STONY.  BO 4A sets up a (B)OTANY out, and if he blocks that cheap with BOT or BO, I've got a sneaky NOTARY on row 11 for the win.  And if he doesn't block it and plays TaJ for 36, we tie.  Instead, I played this.  Jason held it, and let it go when he realized the only way to lose was to challenge.
>Jason_Li: ?JOT 10J J.T +26 386
>Jim_Burlant: ANOO C12 ON. +13 385
#note This was definitely winnable; I flat-out didn't execute when I needed.  Congrats to Jason for playing the better game.
