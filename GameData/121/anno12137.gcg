#note PUgGIER 9B, PUdGIER 9B, even G(L)UmPIER K6 (didn't know it) , along with several others are all better than this weak shit.

>Peter_Huszagh: A E2 A. +2 285
#note Creating a second spot. For some reason I was more focused on disrupting cloumn O...I guess the logic was that he would score more from the C than he would row 1. O, the dread of miscalculation.

#note With perfect information, there was no excuse (beside the beer) for missing his out-bingo. And why RISER and not ROSIER? Lack of vision apparently.
