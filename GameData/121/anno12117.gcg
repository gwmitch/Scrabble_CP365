#note Didn't record racks this game.  Highlights of this game:  We each had a phony bingo.  At the end Player 2 emptied the bag but then had to play the Q, so I got to go out in 2.  I came out ahead 471-391 by our score.

#note WOO seems to sim a tiny bit better on 8F over 8H
>Kevin_Leeds: ACEN 7F ACNE +33 45
#note Nice combination of tiles to study - Cs are tricky

#note There's BRASSED and SERDABS playable.  I thought I remembered this from before - apparently forgot it was phony though, sorry!

>Shelley_Ubeika: ADMR J3 DRAM +27 90
#note It was almost impossible to figure out what happened here since my scoresheet says PRAM for 27, and then later a D appears out of nowhere.  But with my great Scoresheet Detective Brain I put it back together.  It would be easier if I could write more clearly.

>Kevin_Leeds: EFHILNS I9 F.L +10 151
#note Seems my rack might've been EFHILNS.  In that case Quackle says I'm fishing too hard, and should take 28 points using the COXA+E hook.

#note This is phony but REMINTED is good.

#note Now obviously I have too many consonants.  There was no miracle play so I went fast and just picked a move, since I started to think too long.

>Kevin_Leeds: ENV 2L NEV. +14 334
#note Vs are a real challenge, I had many games this tournament where a V got in the way with big consonants.  If I were really good I'd plan better for a V landing in my rack, by keeping the board more open.

#note sadly for Shelley she got the Q while I was holding the U

>Kevin_Leeds: BDELRUY D10 B.. +8 419
#note Here my scoresheet is very hard to make out, it looks like a squiggle with an I after it, for 48 points, increasing my score from 411 to 419 - something going wrong with my pen.  This is most consistent with the score and tracking - I noted the tiles left in Shelley's rack (EETTW) so the B had to be somewhere.  And she played the I ...

>Shelley_Ubeika: EEIQTTW 2A QI +26 393
>Kevin_Leeds: DELRUY 14E RUDELY +36 455
#note The correct score is 34

Apparently the idea I had was to play the B and see if maybe I could play out after that, so this time the endgame worked.  Most of my games the endgame is a mess, you'll see if you keep looking!
