>Kevin_Leeds: AEEHSVW 8G WAVE +20 20
#note Obviously WEAVE is more points, I think I was blind to it - played quickly and chose WAVE 8G to see if I can get the S to benefit me there.  Silly idea because there are Ds and Rs around

#note I remember a lot of plays like this are coming up - two tiles and scoring efficiently. It could be the player's style or a coincidence.  I end up losing twice to Mark in the tournament.  He's kind of inscrutable, quiet, motionless when he plays, and usually looks off to the side of the room. Distant. I imagine he's got talent for theater and such - fine control of motion. (Here I am being all insightful.)
