>Charles_Reinke: AKU H7 AUK +14 14
>JD: CILNOPS G4 CLOP +18 18
#note it had not occurred to me before the sim how powerful CILNOS or CINOS would be relative to the leave after CLOP. CLOP has worse defense. PA bingoes 67% of the time next turn, CINOS 50%, although quackle is likely playing much more open than Charles will.
>Charles_Reinke: AM F5 AM +22 36
>JD: ABFIJNS E3 JIB +34 52
#note again, a misevaluated leave - FINS bingoes 22% of the time next turn, FANS just 15%.

>Charles_Reinke: ?AEGRSV 2H SAV.GERs +88 149
#note goodness me! this is phony! I couldn't bring myself to challenge since the blank could've been a Y. I did hold though.

>JD: ADILSST M1 D.ILS +21 228
#note not an intuitive choice, but it does win the sim.
>Charles_Reinke: ERY 11J RYE +26 264
>JD: AIQSTUZ 2B ZA +25 253
#note what an interesting draw. without a good spot for the Z, the Q seemed most likely to give me a big score. ZA scores 49 a turn next turn versus 42-43 after SUQ.
>Charles_Reinke: ENTW 12J NEWT +35 299
>JD: IOQRSTU O4 QUOT. +24 277
#note I didn't really consider any other plays here, but QUOITS for 39 takes it pretty handily. there are not a lot of good bingo letters, and a lot of vowels - hence, an intermediate leave like IRS will do a lot worse. Just SUQ or going for the points with QUOITS looks much better.
>Charles_Reinke: BEILR N6 BI.L. +25 324
>JD: EHIIPST 4D H. +20 297
#note I'm not in good shape here. had I seen PEKE this turn I would've played PHI, which sims best. Instead I did this which is next best.
>Charles_Reinke: ?EELRTW -?EE +0 324
>JD: AEIIPST F9 PIA +17 314
#note if we're both going to bingo, I really need points to have any chance of winning. That said, dumping the P drops my bingo chances by 15%. Either TIPI for 23 or VAIR for 11 sim a little beter.
>Charles_Reinke: ?EFNORU 12A REFOUNd +76 400
>JD: EISTVWY I2 .Y +9 323
#note not the best draw...I figured I would at least fish for viewiest and give him a chance to screw up. any other fish doesn't really seem to threaten to score enough points.
>Charles_Reinke: HIIILOT A12 .IOT +12 412
>JD: EEISTVW O10 .EVIEW +48 371
#note counter-intuitively, my best move is SET for 5 at B11 because it's now impossible for him to block REVIEW. cool!
