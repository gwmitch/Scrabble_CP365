#note Not nice luck for Verna this game.  I can tell she is fishing for the bingo and drawing the W etc.  Seems like she had some good wins this tournament so I'm glad for her in that.

#note Bad math by Kevin; I scored MARINERS for 80 but added wrong and wrote 436. There were four or five times during the tournament when the other player corrected my math and gave me the points I was failing to award myself (it can look like banking points, but I am not great at adding fast).  I appreciate when they treat me well!  Of course it is my fault and nobody else's if I do this to myself! It's completely understandable people focus harder on different aspects of the game.  Later I scored 20 for mEDIA and counted it as 22, so the total difference is 18 and the score we recorded for me was 472 instead of 490. Kevin's record for the first day of the National Scrabble Championship 2012 is now 4-3.  Tomorrow I go 5-2, then 4-3, then 4-3, then 2-1 so every day I came out ahead except the last. Overall it seems the level of play is somewhat poor compared to division 1, especially at table 1. But every game is hard fought and we try to stretch our brains to figure out the puzzle the best we can.
