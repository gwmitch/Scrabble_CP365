>JD: GIJLMTV 8G JIG +22 22
#note I like opening as tight as possible against Ian, within reason
>Ian_Weinstein: DEOW G8 .OWED +17 17
>JD: EHLMOTV H11 HOVEL +45 67
>Ian_Weinstein: ELW 14F WE.L +15 32
#note I figured this move guaranteed him an S. he later told me he just had a regular bingo leave, which seems crazy!
>JD: BCHMNOT 12D CON..M +22 89
#note I was really hoping to block the S hook for JIG if at all possible, but there was no apparent way to do that and score.
>Ian_Weinstein: AO I7 A.O +6 38

>Ian_Weinstein: BFI 1H FI. +24 138
>JD: ADEIORS 6B ROADIES +64 235
#note I saw outraised but roadies seemed to give him less cheap points.
>Ian_Weinstein: EGI 2F GIE +13 151
>JD: ?ADENOS O4 S.AsONED +82 317
#note I should've worried a bit about the spot I created for PUTZ, but I am such a heavy favorite that taking the points should be fine

>JD: ADEITXY A7 AXE +64 381
>Ian_Weinstein: PZ N3 P..Z +66 291
>JD: DFITTUY N10 DITTY +36 417
#note quackle suggests taking C3 now with DITTO or DUIT and keeping the F for a potential big play at N10.

>JD: BCFIRTU 5D FIB +31 448
>Ian_Weinstein: MNR 3I M.RN +12 331
>JD: ACRRRTU E9 CRU.R +14 462
#note I figured I wouldn't try to block EVASION since he's just as likely to have INVOKE at 15A, but quackle likes playing ART at K5 to take out the last lane just in case. Either way I win.
>Ian_Weinstein: AEEKNOS M11 KAE +28 359
>JD: AIRTV A1 VI. +18 480
#note I have VAT for 9 more points at 4H, although still giving up the big out-play.
