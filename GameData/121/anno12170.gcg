#note Should have challenged.  Is this a physical unit? No, it's phony!! Is it in honor of Dan Milton, the great retired geologist and active Scrabble player? If I had had that rack, I would have just played LOMEINS, since I have practiced that one, since it is high-prob and kind of hard to anagram! The idea I'm having here is to set up a nice X spot for myself.

#note My idea here was to set up the X spot.  It would have been less defensible if I'd played IROKO with SI, but then I didn't know what vowels I might draw.

#note Excellent rack!  There is a 10 (ten letter word) from ZOO, an 8 from the Y, a 9 from KA, and a 9 through (OD).  I wouldn't have seen them either

#note Around here my score sheet seems to be severely incorrect.  I have a pass recorded for Bradley, with the word "challenge".  It seems to me I challenged off something that was played, another bingo attempt.  However how this play INSPHERE makes it onto the board is very unclear.  I am sure I had seven tiles and I seem to recollect playing through an E.  The word INSPHERE seems certainly to be in the right location.  The tiles at the end of the game seem to be correct - I seem to have had HLUT as my last four, and played the H for supposedly 18, which is inconsistent with the R being there on 11I.  My tracking seems to allow for RE, LE, TE, or UE from NE.. or I..   Maybe Jim Kramer could help? Why didn't I just play INSPHER(E) two squares to the left?  Oh well.

#note What's weird here is that I think I put the H on 13I for EH and UH and got 18 points, not 15.  So there may be something along row 11 I'm incorrect about. My score differences are turn 1 +1, turn 16 +3, time adjustment -20 and my final we agreed to was 422 instead of 438.  For Bradley's somehow we left out the three points for IRE (I would have given the three points if I'd understood the issue!).  We underscored TURF as 31 instead of 33 so his final agreed to is 365 instead of 370.
