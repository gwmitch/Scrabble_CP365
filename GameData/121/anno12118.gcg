>JD: DGORUYY 8G GUY +14 14
#note throwing the board wide open with a bad leave is usually not a great idea. GRODY is best statically but GUY jumps ahead on a sim.

#note things seemed to go downhill from here

>JD: ADEIIJN 6J J.IN +27 116
#note I'm not sure if I would ever see INDIE at L8 over the board, but it makes a ton of sense - turning over 4 tiles to draw an R or a T, which there should be a 40-50% chance of doing.
>Dave_Wiegand: EEEGINZ 8K .ZINE +72 225
#note dave actually had ENERGIZE as a bingo, he told me after.
>JD: ADEGILP 13B GID.AP +28 144
#note I really liked this play given the game situation.

#note dear me, I have no idea. the board is very volatile but I have none of the letters I need to do anything.

#note it seemed that everything I did this game helped dave out.
>JD: EEHLNSW 1F WHEEL +60 351
#note I could have left off the L and hoped to not empty the bag and draw a bingo, but if I come even close dave will block anyway.
>Dave_Wiegand: ELNOOTV 3E LOOT +18 501
#note his best
>JD: EIINRST O6 ST.RE +23 374
#note I thought I was clever to block his out, but given the upcoming series of events taking the points for INSET is better by 4 points.
>Dave_Wiegand: ENV L12 V..E +16 517
#note EN this turn at 15L sets up VALE for next turn and there's nothing I can do about it. 6 better
>JD: IIN G11 NI... +7 381
#note I should make the play he makes next.
>Dave_Wiegand: N M13 ..N +8 525
>Dave_Wiegand:  (I) +2 527
#note after a couple of games with major mistakes on my part it seems there wasn't much I could do here. 0-4 for the morning, a first as far as I can remember at nationals.
