#note David wins this one - He shared with me his stem 'I glare' and an anamonic for it as recompense.  Fish for what you know, he recommended me!

#note I knew this was not a very smart choice but I had trouble finding what looked decent.  A great play is CE(C)ITY, blindness - ironically or not, I missed it! I got stuck trying to find something reasonable and took a vowel heavy leave, AEI

#note Quackle says (G)ERENT is even better (word didn't come to mind). But even better than those is 12B EXTER(N)E forming R(AMI) for 36.  I was glad I found this one.  Just simply J12 REX looks a tiny bit better than (G)ENET to Quackle.  I only seem to have 10-15% chance of winning (it's a guesstimate / approximation, not very exact but supported by some statistical analysis.)

#note Found the right spot and idea but used the wrong tiles -W(E)PT leaves me with better synergy

#note I don't know David's rack.  What could he be keeping to burn the blank now? If he was very short on vowels he wouldn't burn them both.

#note It seems possible that I have a small chance to win, depending on what David has vs. what is in the bag, if I play TO by VUGS for 17, or PEW and PYA for 24, or ROW for 20 (Quackle says.  I don't claim to understand it.)  That is really hard to see I think, so I don't feel too bad about this choice.  The board is remarkably closed up I think.
