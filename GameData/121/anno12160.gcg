#note UNBURDEN and UNBURNED both good

#note There were a lot of Is out, I think I had four of them here

#note VANLOAD is valid - held briefly
>Kevin_Leeds: AMST 12A MAST +34 281
#note MAST was a poor choice, I should have played on G1 where Brian's about to play

#note I even coffeehoused a little, I said: "this works against quackle sometimes".    I counted and thought about his probability of having S, his probability of having dreck (I guess I overestimated that), his probability of having the blank, his probability of wanting to use the blank; the idea that only a bingo could really hurt me (not true it seems).  I think my overall judgment was pretty much "just try it", intuitively.  It didn't work though, I could have thought more carefully.

#note Missed (A)TELIERS going under (Y)UP for 83.  After this play I drew all six tiles from the bag, or so I thought.  The ones on my rack were DOGRWU it seems.

>Brian_Galebach: EENOOVW 4B OWE +23 418
#note Brian played OWE and then, we concluded, he drew a tile out of the bag that I'd failed to draw. To handle the underdraw, we agreed I'd missed drawing an I out of the bag.  (For Kevin this was a difficult conclusion to eventually arrive at. It seems to be the most likely interpretation of what happened. Kevin's tracking showed Brian had VINO, since he had miscounted the Es.  It is definitely Kevin's fault that he lost.  He also apologizes for referring to himself in the third person here on Brian's clock.)

>Kevin_Leeds: DGIORUW 1M WIG +26 407
#note Quackle says the best shot at a smaller spread is GOWD.  I figured out that lost, so then I just tried something else instead - of course it lost too.
