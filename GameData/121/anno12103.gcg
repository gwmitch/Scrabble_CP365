#note this is not an especially strong play. I was hoping to keep things relatively tight against Jason because I remembered him bingoing a lot against me the last time we played. The best way to do this is to play WIREMEN.

#note moment of truth...I wasn't crazy about scoring 4 ponts but it blocked a lane and kept a leave about as good as an exchange. Quackle comes up with a superior option of REIF at 2G, which scores a lot more and keeps tolerable letters. I'll take REIF.

#note this is kind of a huge gamble, but especially with both blanks unseen I have to take the points and get into the bag. If I'm lucky maybe he won't bingo.

>JD: ?BEFIJV 15D JIVE. +23 330
#note I considered this or JEFE, but BF? seemed like it would be easier to work through. also, the highest scoring bingoes are probably blocked this way.
>Jason_Keller: ACEENST 12H .ENACE +22 253
#note his actual rack, I do believe. wih two blanks unseen this jumps to the top of he sim. he's in a lot of trouble though, and turning over tiles may prevent him from bingoing twice (which he probably needs to do to win).
>JD: ?ABBCFN M5 FAB +20 350
#note I almost went ahead and played FAB at 13M, but my spread was already good and losing to a 3 X 3 was unappealing. 13M FAB at least cuts into his bingo percentage a bit. 13M reduces it to 15%, but with a huge variance...
>Jason_Keller: AGRY N2 GRAY +29 282
>JD: ?ABCINR 14G b.RBICAN +85 435
#note I failed to find the other bingo which fits here (CINNABAR). I am guaranteed to win after this play but I worried about giving up cheap spread to him if he hooked BARBICANS. Quackle suggests that best of all would be fishing BIT at 13B, in which case I may be guaranteed to bingo next turn - but taking the guaranteed points is likely a sound option over the board where such things are harder to figure out.

#note unfortunately for jason, the blank was in the bag. this happened a lot on day 2.
>JD: ?P B13 Pi +11 446
#note remarkably, I drew all 14 blanks on day 2 of this tournament. I'm not sure if that will ever happen to me again at a nationals. I used my good fortune to work my way into second place by the end of the day.
