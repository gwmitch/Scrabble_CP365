#note Honestly gave no thought to just fishing off a U, but that's the sim favorite. Should have given this position more thought.

#note I didn't know what to do here. But obviously I am in a ton of trouble. F6 PEA ties the game, but I don't think it's going to win often. I have to play for the bingo. OP gives me a good shot at it, but it gives too much back. In any case, I'm screwed if he has a blank and good tiles with it.

#note Missing AUGEND and failing to consider fishing U instead of UNWIT were the biggest mistakes there. Could have gotten to my bingo much sooner.
