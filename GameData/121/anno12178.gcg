#note Not sure what I had.  Too many vowels apparently.  Risky to open the board up.  I remember looking hard at places to play and didn't like some of the openings I could have made.

#note Wow, had UNTRIMS for 94, like when the decorations are removed from the Christmas tree.  Instead I find an out in three, very inefficient due to the difficulty in figuring out what the blank should be.  My dear Grandmom always used to say the first idea should be an S, but I didn't channel her right.  I think I missed an exchange by Mason so the turns are out of synch, because at the end there's a play that doesn't make sense.  This would have been to block the bingo lane from the E just in case obviously - makes more sense if the pool had DGSSEYH but only if I tracked quite poorly.  I'm out of time, I lose 20 points for going over the 25 minutes allotted.

#note RABID+S is phony - That's amusing since I acceped VIRAL+S the game before, maybe he saw it happen

#note Not sure what happened here.

#note For the final play I recorded 10 points from the rack, which is correct for DGS, so I am sure we didn't forget to record a scoring play - probably an exchange.
