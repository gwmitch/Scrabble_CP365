>JD: AACDEEN 8G CADE +14 14
#note The leave after this play is not very good. ACE is a major upgrade, guaranteeing me a good lane to bingo with.
>Scott_Appel: ALLT K8 TALL +16 16
>JD: AEFHNOO L9 HOOF +29 43
>Scott_Appel: QT H7 Q.T +12 28
>JD: ABCEINU M5 NUBIA +18 61
#note a lot of choices here. depending on my read of how good his rack is. this seems fine
>Scott_Appel: AHI N5 AHI +33 61
>JD: ACEGILS I6 GI. +18 79
#note GLACE is definitely an upgrade.
>Scott_Appel: EINOV O1 OVINE +30 91
>JD: ACEEIRS 6I .IE +6 85
#note I saw SAICE but figured I would take a shot at the bingo. however, the board is very tight after SAICE and it becomes really hard for him to score decently if I take out the triple lane.
>Scott_Appel: DEIIKRR -DEIIKR +0 91
#note this game looks totally different if he can just get a play down on this turn on column O.
>JD: ?ACERST O7 TAnRECS +88 173
>Scott_Appel: EKP K3 PEK. +20 111
>JD: ?DEORRT 4E REsTOR.D +68 241
#note I wasn't thinking about the P hook at the time. That makes this a little too volatile.
>Scott_Appel: ETVX H1 VEX. +42 153
>JD: DEFISUZ 10D FUZES +50 291
#note It seemed safest just to cover this hook now while I ahve he chance.

#note DOW sets me up much better for next turn and quackle claims it doesn't really give back more points. sure, why not.
>Scott_Appel: EY A14 YE +33 224
>JD: DNOPRTU D1 DROPT +42 394
#note at this point I might as well just go for spread and play POUND.
>Scott_Appel: OS 13E SO +11 235
>JD: AEIMNNU 1A MAI.EN +27 421
#note if I play MUNI here he doesn't have a great chance of doing much of anything in response, and I might even bingo. but it doesn't matter much.
>Scott_Appel: OW H12 .OW +6 241
>JD: AAEENRU 14F NE. +13 434
#note EN at I14 keeps AURAE and doesn't give up as many points as NEW. I wasn't even positive that NOWS was good.
>Scott_Appel: GIMNRSU 15H SIGNUM +51 292
>Scott_Appel: GIMNRSU --  -51 241
#note I felt bad for him here. I figured this was good, but SIGNA is an adjective
