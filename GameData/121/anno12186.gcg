#note Ugh, VINTAGEST*. This isn't even a great play. C9 TOWEL is fine.
>Erickson_Smith: ILLP M9 PILL +20 315
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEHIQRU O1 E.QUIRE +51 373
#note The sim prefers C9 HEWER. I had a hard time assessing the risk of leaving the S open versus opening up the cheap comeback. I decided he probably didn't have the S when he did PILL, and he may not know ESQUIRED (is it a common word?), so it could be worth the gamble. Second-guessing in hindsight and seeing the sim results, but I don't know if I wouldn't do this again.

#note I have no explanation for this lapse in board vision. I was locked on the big RENOVATED spot. Idiot. There are 50 points for WHIFF/HOWFF in a very obvious spot and I just couldn't look there. 84% win to 64% win. Absolutely awful!
