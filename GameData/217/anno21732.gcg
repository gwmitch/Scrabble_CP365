>Evans_Clinchy: AAAHOST 8F AHA +12 12
#note Perhaps an overly aggressive placement, even with my T in hand. He could have any of HHMMTTTTT for the back hook here.
>Austin_Shin: ?ADEGHR E7 cHARGED +82 82
#note Ouch - indeed he does.
>Evans_Clinchy: AIOOSTT D12 TOO +13 25
#note Yuck - again too aggressive, and obviously so. For some reason I couldn't come up with OOT in the same spot. What's wrong with me?
>Austin_Shin: NOOZ 15A ZOON +47 129
>Evans_Clinchy: ACINSTU 9G ANICUTS +70 95
#note Thought this might be a tad safer than NAUTICS I2 despite the lower score. Sim still favors NAUTICS by a point or two.
>Austin_Shin: ENORUY L9 .OURNEY +28 157
>Evans_Clinchy: DIIILOW 8M IWI +20 115
>Austin_Shin: ABJ C11 JAB +39 196
>Evans_Clinchy: ADIKLMO 15H MILK. +42 157
#note Aw, man! I even looked for ZOON???? words. ZOONOMIA is good. That woulda been big.
>Austin_Shin: ELLQ 11K Q.ELL +28 224
>Evans_Clinchy: ADENORR O2 REORDA.N +60 217
#note Happy to have this volatile bingo option available. It puts me back within striking distance and also opens the PREORDAIN hook with both P's still unseen. A lucky draw here can put me back in front.
>Austin_Shin: INX 7K NIX +36 260
>Evans_Clinchy: BCDFRVY 3L FYC. +24 241
#note ...not exactly the lucky draw I was looking for!
>Austin_Shin: AEINPST 4F SPINATE +80 340
>Evans_Clinchy: BDERTUV 5B DUVET +20 261
#note I'm still delusional enough to think I can come back and win here, so I make the play that opens a line and keeps a bingo-prone leave. The reasonable spread-cutting option is just to take TUBED 5H for 35.

#note ...ouch
>Evans_Clinchy: ADIIRRT A13 RI. +12 304
#note Fishing is almost certainly not worth it here. LAIRD for 21 is fine.
>Austin_Shin: ?EFOSTU 13G FOrTU.ES +78 502
>Evans_Clinchy: ADIMRST H1 MID. +21 325
#note Best is EMIR 14L for 20, followed by DRATS 10D for 22 and out.
