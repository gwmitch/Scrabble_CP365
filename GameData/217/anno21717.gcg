#note I'm not going to lie: I was nervous as all hell during this match with Jesse. I think it showed in my play. I wish I could have represented myself a little better in these games. I definitely played better if my non-live games. I guess calmness under pressure is something that comes with more experience. Jesse certainly seemed to be holding up well.

#note My plan was to set up another S hook in case SOJUS was blocked. This was misguided. I'm opening up too much and breaking up my rack when I don't need to. 5G SAW.

#note My tracking was way way way off in this game and I had played way too slowly, so I was low on time. I thought there was only 1 vowel left when actually there were 3. TRIOS was me planning to outrace a consonant-choked rack. It's not a bad idea, but it would have been nice to be tracked properly.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABFIRRU B11 BARF +22 337
#note Here's where the tracking kills me. I somehow have the unseen poolm as BCLNSTYI, which is totally wrong. I therefore don't see me winning in any case. My plan is to set up BARFI and just hope he misses it. I  had about 5  minutes or so to spend on this turn, so I really should have had time to fix my tracking. Even if I do that, though, this game is looking pretty dire.
