#note Tasha's Eventful Events in Reno, Episode 7 & Tasha's Endgame Misadventures, Episode 107.  I was eager for this game because Joel beat me before and I have this thing where I give nicknames to players I'm 0-2 against.  So throughout the game I'm wondering what Joel's nickname would be if I were to lose.
