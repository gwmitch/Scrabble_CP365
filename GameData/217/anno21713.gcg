#note Semi-finals Game 1. Off to a lucky start.

>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: KNO A12 .ONK +51 79
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EGJNORT J6 JO. +26 152
#note The other option is J(A)G. JOE is the more conservative option, reducing both players' bingo chances. Not usually my style, but the pressure of the matchplay format kind of forced me to change it up.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EHIQSTT 13F Q.IT +14 209
#note The other option is to just drop the Q for 11, which again errs on the side of defence. I suppose if I want to be consistent with my early plays, I should do that. But really either play is fine. I also strongly considered HIE/H to keep grabbing points.

#note Could not have asked for a luckier sequence.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ALX 1F .XAL +33 260
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEFILOR N2 FOLIAR +28 398
#note Now is the point this the game where I have to start thinking about maximizing spread. FOLIAR locks up the win, but it doesn't do much to help me run up the score. It was tempting to roll the dice and go for a bingo.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEINPRS 9A PE. +10 442
#note I considered leaving it open and building more spread, but I was so sure he'd hit ROBINIA or BORONIA.
