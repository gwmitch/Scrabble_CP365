#note I knew I was making a bizarre play at the time. I guess I was hoping Quackle wouldn't hate it too badly. I was really uninterested in plays like HAOLE and ENHALO which blew up the rack for not a great score. With so many open tiles to play through, I felt like keeping a good leave. OVA is cheeky for setting up my H in two spots in case I miss my bingo. The play only sims a couple pts back of HAOLE/ENHALO. But its quite a bit further back from 7H HMO, which admittedly I missed entirely. (And yeah, MHO looks really good.) Oh well, I'll take my 45-6 equity loss and a lesson learned.

#note Dumping SLOJD under VARMINT was tempting, but setting up a 63-pt SLOJD with a lucky O draw seemed like fun.

#note This or 12L WONK? I decided to block the easiest spot for Rafi to score with his W or Y. But really, those tiles are going to score well on this board with or without this spot available. Meh, WEEK is still fine

#note I kind of went off the board here. I'm expecting Rafi to bingo to the S. I can take a low score to block it, but then I risk losing to an basic scoring play at 12A or hooking FUNDIC. Or a bingo on row 14. My logic is that I can let Rafi have his 80+ pt bingo if I set up a huge comeback to outrace it... ie. JEFES. Its questionable logic because Rafi can simply pounce on JEFES now and still beat me with a FUNDIC play. There's no clear path to victory here. My way ended up working, though.
