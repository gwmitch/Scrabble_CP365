>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAGISSV 11H .AVA +20 44
#note Not strong statically, but it sims well. Keeping IG together with the floating N is nice. And I never telegraph a spare S unless I need to. So no to FAVAS.
>Jesse_Day: EGILNOS 13B LIGNEO.S +70 156
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EGISSTV K2 VESTIG.S +74 118
#note Against someone else, I may have played VESTINGS for a shot at a challenge. But VESTIGES is clearly much stronger positionally, and Jesse probably wouldn't have challenged.
>Jesse_Day: AEMY B10 MEA.Y +32 188
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIIPRUX A8 PIU +19 137
#note The sim prefers PIXIE, which makes a lot of sense at this score.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEILORR E5 BRIO +21 210
#note I hated blocking up this part of the board, but I was already running really low on time. 12K BROIL simming best is evidenc of how slim the pickings were this turn.

#note My time was super low, but I felt like this gave me a good shot. M11 ODA draws into a lot of bingos which I can force Jesse to block. It doesn't really have a good Plan B, though.

#note I missed a winning endgame here. SUQ, followed by G12 LOO and A14 OR. I was under a minute on my block and a lot of pressure. Tsk, oh well.
