#note mmm.. can take the 40 and keep DLLR and make the board kind of grosss, or block this spot, which was worrying me in terms of overlap plays, and make a Z setup and hope to cash on it.

#note talked about how i blocked joint after the game.
>k8: AAELOPZ C2 AZO +50 392
#note another hard choice. ZA makes AR, which hooks better for future plays, but AZO scores the little bit more and PALE looks nicer than APOLE to me.

#note the only bingo i could figure out that i could draw with a one tile fish and also play was NOPLACE. two tiles felt like it'd be too improbably to draw a bingo, and also easier for joe to figure out the possibilities of what i might have.  KEA scores one more than this.
