#note lol, i don't know what to do against someone who plays so aggressively. ALBA should be automatic against most people, but i wasn't sure what was going on with these plays. (-34)

#note don't mind me. i clearly have no idea how to play defense, after my disastrous first game in which i attempted it, so i will be mr. equity. nothing here has as much equity, but some smart people might do EDHS. yay, i suppose?

#note how lucky am i that she didn't have the K or some other thing that didn't require using the blank? i was aware that opening up like that could result in a monster comeback, but i suppose my only consolation is that if it was a J or Q play, i'd have the momentum on a totally closed board.  quackle likes 15B SEDGY best and that is exactly the type of play i was looking for. SEDGY basically forces her to empty the bag and i'd have perfect information, but i couldn't figure out any freaking 5-letter word. I'M TERRIBLE. (-3%)
