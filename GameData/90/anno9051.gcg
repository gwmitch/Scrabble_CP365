>Mike_Lean: EJKLNNX D5 JE.K +20 227
#note i thought REALLY hard about this.  the way he was looking at his tiles, i thought he was close to another bingo.  it was between this and JEAN for me.. i wanted to get rid of the K and also have a spot to score if he had a bingo to ARBS.  this doesn't sim as well as JEAN (#1) but i stand by it.
>Suhas_Rao: EILT 11B TILE +20 236
>Mike_Lean: LNNOOUX E4 NON. +28 255
#note i see OXO for 38 which leaves me LNNU.  with a few spots on the board to play the X, i'd rather be a bit moer defensive and leave myself a more balanced LOUX.  i may be wrong, but i also stand by this.

#note time to just dump my Gs.  GATS G2 pretty much ruins the 4 lane and i like knowing that i have 2 lanes to bingo if i pick one up.
>Suhas_Rao: BO 10F BO. +16 336
>Mike_Lean: ?AMORST M9 MAeSTRO +78 369
#note saw TRAnSOM, but kind of just wanted the 4 extra points.  if he hits that A with a D, G, or H, he'll just be giving me a TWS lane.  NOT playing MAeSTRO 4H and giving him a cheap way to beat me with an s on the TWS lane.
>Suhas_Rao: AFY N8 FAY +34 370
#note as expected, i guess
>Mike_Lean: EHIIIIQ O7 HE +30 399
#note i see QI A1 for 36, but also see there's still a blank out.  if i play QI, i may as well just say inb4 PILOTeD.  i play HE instead of HIE because it's more defensive and doesn't give him the opportunity to open something else up.  if he uses the last I at A1, i can just play QI G2 then use the last of the Is at H1 for big.  HIE sims way above QI, so i'm happy with my decision to hold on QI, but i guess i should have played HIE.
