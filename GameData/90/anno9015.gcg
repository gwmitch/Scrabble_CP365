#note frank's getting low on time and i'm playing pretty fast at this point. it helps that i'm gibsonized and don't have to think too hard about what i'm doing.

#note this play makes no sense. i guess i was thinking i might draw the blank, and if he didnt have it he may get paranoid and block this area up. POINT 9e is the stylish play. i had thought abotu that bottom hook at the beginning and then forgot.

#note the debate between outrun and try to bingo was stressful.

#note there are three bingos that play here (two are the same word in diff spots). frank had a minute or so left and he said he panicked 'cause he never runs out of time. thought he could outrun me after this play.

#note i was more sure of entia than trine. i also had the score wrong - i think he both thought frank had 382 after OUTCRY, so ENTIA wins by 1, except it wouldn't on the recount.
