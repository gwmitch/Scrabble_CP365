>Evans_Clinchy: CEILTTY 12I T..Y +14 86
#note Sims best. I like my chances of bingoing with CEILT -- there's an open D and an open S, and he can't block both.

>Jason_Keller: AEGJR D3 JAGER +32 152
>Evans_Clinchy: BEINQRT 12D Q. +22 182
#note Sims best -- not surprising, since any one of the AAAAAAIIIOOOOOOOTTTUU? in the pool will hit a bingo in line M.

#note Yuck. Why am I fishing? BICEP 13C is 39 points.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEIINRT 13B ERI.A +25 249
#note I think taking points with either ERICA or RICIN is best here, although the fish/setup move of IRE 7C sims surprisingly decently.
>Jason_Keller: OTY K3 TOY +24 267
>Evans_Clinchy: EIINNTU F3 ENNUI +17 266
#note Or UNITE or UNTIE for one point less. Do I want an N or a T here? Does it matter?

>Evans_Clinchy: AILPTXZ 14F XI +50 316
#note ZAX 8A is obviously tempting, being 66 and all. And it does indeed sim best. But I kinda like splitting up the X and Z, making two huge plays instead of one. Keeping ILPT doesn't excite me on this board, with a bingo looking very unlikely. I'd rather chase a big Z-bomb to get back in the game.
>Jason_Keller: CEIOV 1D VOICE. +48 375
>Evans_Clinchy: AALOPTZ 5C A. +3 319
#note There are a few ways here to get cute and set up the Z. There's PALET B10, leading to AZO; ZA 12A, for PLOTZ; and this, for an even bigger PLOTZ. Is the the best option? It's got the biggest potential payoff, but it's also the most likely to be blocked. I think at this deficit, I've got no choice but to try it.
>Jason_Keller: LRRU B10 RUL.R +14 389

#note It works, but it's not enough if he's got the goods.
>Jason_Keller: ENRSSVW 15D WRENS +48 437
