#note i considered FRUGAL, missed ARGUFY. thought bnjy was more likely to take advantage of scoring possibilities over on the right side of the board, plus this left more bingo lanes and scored more points. ugly leave, though.

#note normally i'd get really annoyed at this point in the game. somehow, i was feeling no stress over the outcome of this game, and it barely fazed me that i gave him a spot for a nongo. probably helped that i was sitting on a bingo.

#note i have this problem with the X where i keep it for too long. i was really concerned about this hotspot. i wanted to keep the I in 5 column open for ING bingos, and there will be a couple spots for X next turn, so i decide to take this spot out. quackle hates it, but it just felt right at the time.

#note i make mental note that ING still fits here.

#note happily, i draw the vowel i was hoping for so i can cash the X here.

#note i honestly had no idea there were only two in the bag when i played this. i was pretty resigned to losing and hoping that edley had beaten larry so that i would be gibsonized going into the last game. i did think about the kinds of -ING bingos i could draw, but assumed bnjy would block the lane, so i didn't think it through much. also, i didn't even consider playing the bingo. let's hear it for not thinking. i can only make brilliant plays when i don't.

#note pretty sure this is ben's exact rack. he put down QIS 5I first, but then thought it through for quite a while before playing what he did. he had 6 minutes left - i had 18:30. he does have one 100% win - can you find it?
