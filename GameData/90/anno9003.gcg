>Jeff: IORRTUU -IORRTUU +0 0
#note Top exchange in the sim keeps IRT. I always seem to pick up two more I's when I keep one, and I wasn't crazy about ORT, so I just went for all 7.
>Mike: ACFT 8G FACT +18 18
#note Some interesting extensions: FACTICITY, FACTOIDAL, FACTORAGE, FACTORIZE to name a few.
>Jeff: AEJMRSS K5 JAMS +36 36
>Mike: LNOOU I6 UN.OOL +10 28
#note Don't know what else you had, but L4 NOLO for 23 sims best with these 5.
>Jeff: EEEIIRS J8 .IE +11 47
#note Wow. Saw EERIE and didn't want to play it to the F. How did I miss it in the H line? Still, this is actually sims better, good to keep more bingo prone tiles this early on.
>Mike: DETV 11G VE.DT +23 51
>Jeff: EEGIRSU G11 .UG +9 56
#note Same line of thinking; Quackle likes 6K AGUE, but I'm not ready to hang something out in the triple lane yet.
>Mike: ?AENPSX 14B EXPANSe +92 143
#note It's slightly relieving to know you have a response bingo, even if it's less points...
>Jeff: AEEILRS 9A REALISE +65 121
#note Of course, the crazy Quackle suggests 15H for 77. I draw a D, but...
>Mike: EHW 15H HEW +39 182
>Jeff: DDLNNRZ B8 L.Z +32 153
>Mike: QT E13 Q.T +12 194
>Jeff: DDENNRS E8 R.ND +10 163
#note Q likes H10 D(E)N better; I'm being a bit defensive and getting rid of one more consonant after what seemed like a play close to a bingo, even though I'm down 50.
>Mike: ACERT A4 CRATE. +39 233
>Jeff: DEIMNOS L1 MISDONE +91 254
#note Lucky to have the fit. Also DOMINES and EMODINS.
>Mike: AF 13B FA +33 266
>Jeff: EGHIPYY 15A PYE +43 297
>Mike: BEG M5 BEG +31 297
>Jeff: GHIINVY 2J VY.NG +40 337
#note Whoa, didn't know CHIVYING!
>Mike: LOW 6A .WOL +15 312
>Jeff: AEHIIIN 1L .EAN +23 360
#note Leaving three I's is horrible- I was going for points and trying to run down Mike's clock so I didn't spend as much time on this as I should. D4 HI(L)I sims best.
>Mike: ORT 14J ORT +12 324
>Jeff: BEHIIIO L12 BO.H +26 386
#note Same thinking as last turn. Just kind of have to take the risk and hope he doesn't find a bingo in the two remaining lanes in overtime- there are too many possible bingos to try and block anything. HI(L)I sims best again, though.
>Mike: AIR 15L .AIR +21 345
>Jeff: AEIIIOU 4A .IAO +12 398
#note Again, above my skill level to calculate possible bingos here with the remaining tile pool. Here they are: aUDITOR, OUTRIDeR, and UTIlIDOR (that's an L in there). Thought of (B)EAU, which I think blocks anything, but I guess I thought there might be a C- bingo in there.
>Mike: ?DIKOTU 5C DIT +15 360
#note Quackle really wanted Mike to win; it gave him DIORTU? as his rack. Funny play: T(A)l(O)OK(A) (again, that's an L)
>Jeff: EIIIRU 10B .EI. +17 415
>Mike: ?KOU F4 OaK +20 380
#note N7 sOUK or M9 KUdO goes out.
>Jeff: IIRU 6F .I +6 421
>Mike: U -  +0 380
>Jeff: IRU 13L .UR +6 427
>Mike: U -  +0 380
>Jeff: I 4F .I +2 429
#note Final score 431-360 on paper (2 minute penalty)
>Jeff:  (U) +2 431
