#note i should ply FIDO - even though it has an unbalanced leave it gives me two letters to play through/from and three S's to hook on instead of one F.

#note quackle likes playing ZA first, but no way i keeping WU. this also makes another line is he plays from the H.

#note this is where it gets pretty nuts. I have a couple bingo lines on the bottom, and another bingo should win me the game. i also want to keep the U with the Q unseen. I really need a new lane with another S still unseen, and EINRSU is a pretty good leave to hit something.

of course if i had seen (PE)RILUNES this wouldn't have mattered at all, but let's just ignore that.

#note perfect. now i can draw to AEINRS and leave one on the bag. if he had played off QIS it would have been a bit more interesting. amazingly enough this is the only spot to play the U! i was freaking out because i couldn't find one for a while. not surprisinglythis play has the highest winning % by far.

#note his actual rack. his best plays are on the O column, but as it turns out those would let me bingo out. he guesses right and blocks the correct lane.
