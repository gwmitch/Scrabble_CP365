#note decided i needed to fish for bruxes on this turn. BRUX 7j basically took out the bingo line, which i didn't want to do. AVA lets me bingo through the A if that happens to come up, but mostly i wanted to take his attention off of the 15 row.

#note debated between this and WOE, which is quackle's choice. Just trying to move toward bingo friendly letters - maybe less necessary now that I have the score closer than t was. The J just felt really clunky on this board, though drawing an A would give me JAR J2. I dunno...
