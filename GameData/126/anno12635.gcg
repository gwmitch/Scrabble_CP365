>rhonda: DEEHQSS 8G HEED +16 16
#note With two esses, it's definitely better to snag the extra points and play 8D HEEDS 26 instead of HEED. While an S is a valuable tile, the second one doesn't add much. Spend it now. Also, HEEDS doesn't expose the 2W squares (at 7G, 7I, 9G, and 9I) like HEED does. Another option is to Exchange HQ. The Q will plague the first several turns often enough to warrant just throwing it back, and DEESS will bingo fairly often on one of your next two or three turns. In general, I prefer taking points in situations like this over exchanging, but the exchange is also reasonable.
>harry: BEKLLRT I7 K.LT +14 14
#note 7F KERB 29 outscores everything else by a mile. Take the points, and move on. 
>rhonda: NNQRSTT -NQT +0 16
#note Obvious exchange. It's pretty close on what to keep. NST, ST, RST, etc. are all pretty close. I prefer keeping RST. Rhonda's choice (keeping NRST) is fine, but it leaves us prone to still being consonant-heavy on our next play.
>harry: BEIJLMR 10F JIL. +27 41
#note Harry's JILT is best. The only play that scores more is JIL(T)ER, and the extra points aren't worth a vowel-less leave.
>rhonda: EENRSTW K6 WESTERN +79 95
#note Best. The only bingo.
>harry: BEMRRYY F10 .ERRY +23 64
#note L12 EYRY scores well, gets rid of both ugly Ys, and un-doubles the Rs. The only drawback is that it opens the 3x3 lane, but when a play accomplishes so many good things, you can't worry about the one drawback. Also reasonable are: L3 BYRE 23, 7F YER(K) 20, and Harry's F10 (J)ERRY 23. All of these plays get rid of a Y and an R, and they score decently.
>rhonda: DFLNOOT L3 FLOOD +26 121
#note Rhonda's FLOOD scores well and doesn't offer too much back to the opponent. Seems right to me.
>harry: BDMTUWY 11E W.D +17 81
#note We are all guilty of seeing racks this bad and just mentally checking out of the position. We see drek, so we just slap something down and hope to draw well enough to get ourselves out of the mire. But games are often won or lost on these sorts of plays, and really trying to find something worthwhile in positions like this will vastly improve your game. In this case, 11C WYT(E)D scores 27 points and turns over enough tiles that we have a decent chance of drawing a refreshingly better rack next turn. 11C TUB(E)D is also decent, but it scores 12 fewer points. Also notable is 12I WY(N)D 22.
>rhonda: EINPSTZ M2 ZEIN +40 161
#note M2 ZEIN 40 is strong. Equally strong is M2 ZEINS. Normally we don't think of tacking an S onto our plays like this, since it scores well without the S. But in this case we're scoring 8 extra points for the S, which is enough to make it close just on raw equity along. But now look at the board: where are we going to use the S to score? We may bingo to 7G, but other than that, there just aren't a lot of opportunities to use an S for a big play. Taking the extra points is fine here; that said, it's also fine to keep the S, so we'll call it a player's choice.
>harry: BGMOTUY D10 BOGY +28 109
#note The star play here is D11 OUTBY 36. Scores well, gets rid of somef the clunkiness, and doesn't shut the board down (SOWED, TOWED, ROWED, etc. could all yield bingos down the C column, and the Y at D15 is likely to create a play along row 15 that opens vertical plays down columns A and B). in a situation where we need it to stay open since we're behind. D8 GUYOT 30 is also worht mentioning, but it's clearly inferior. Harry's BOGY comes in just behind these plays.
>rhonda: AILNPST N1 PANT +43 204
#note PLAINTS. Don't miss PLAINTS. If you do, I guess it's nice to have PANT for 43, which is the second-best play.
>harry: DEMORTU O3 DEMO +21 130
#note O3 DETOUR 37 is best. There are a dozen play I prefer over DEMO. DEMO closes down a lane without scoring, which is not something we want to do when ahead.
>rhonda: ?HIILNS O3 ....LISHINg +101 305
#note Brilliant play, Rhonda! 11-letter bingos don't come around often, so it's nice to see 'em when they do.
>harry: BCRSTUX J2 CRUST +23 153
#note I prefer plays at C13 like BUT and BUR. At this point, the game is unwinnable for Harry, so it's easy to mentally check out. These plays score well and open the possibility of a big X play at B14 (XI, TAX, etc.) it if stays open.
>rhonda: AAACINO -AAOCI +0 305
#note I generally try to play through bad racks when I'm ahead. In this case we can score decently with C12 AA, and our leave is fine (ACINO).
>harry: AABGGOX C13 BOX +38 191
#note Harry's BOX is best.
>rhonda: AEIINNQ 15A NI.E +36 341
#note Rhonda had the right idea, but 15A NI(X)IE score a bit more. It's close, though, becuse that I might come in handy since we have the Q.
>harry: AAGGSTV 12I VA.G +16 207
#note B12 VAG(I) 30. Nothing else scores close.
>rhonda: AAINOPQ N11 QI +24 365
#note Interesting position. If the score were close, this would really be a head-scratcher. The top scorer is N10 APIAN 32, but then we keep that ugly Q. But wait: the unseen tile pool still includes three U's, as well as five A's, three I's, two T's, and a blank. Those are all good tiles for our Q (QU-, QI, QAT). Drawing five tiles, we are all but guaranteed to pick up some of those tiles (they are 11 of the unseen 28 tiles). So APIAN makes some sense. But it does keep the clunky Q, and it also opens up row 15 for an -S hook. But look at this unlikely candidate: 7B ANOPIA 16. It leaves the lone Q, but it also opens up a place for Q(I) at F6 so that we can score 31 on our next play. If we draw a T, we will have Q(A)T at B6, and if we draw an I, we will have QI at 8A. All of those potential plays score well next play. For this reason, I like ANOPIA.
>harry: ACGORST 10B GO. +10 217
#note B12 RAG(I) 24 is best. C9 GAT or GAR are also reaonable.
>rhonda: AAEFNOP 11A NO +5 370
#note I don't like Rhonda's play here at all. I understand why she did it, as she feared the bingo along column B. But she holds the last N, so an -ING bingo requires Harry to use the blank for the N, and Rhonda gives up so much in terms of scoring that it's just not worth the block. 7E APEA(K) 20 or 14A AP(O) 20 both score fine. 7B APNOEA 18 blocks the -ING bingos and scores much more than NO, plus it brings the end of the game much closer, which is something we want when we have a large lead.
>harry: ACIRSTV 9M VI. +10 227
#note This is a pretty desperate situation. I12 (V)IVA gives us a remote chance of winning, but only if opponent doesn't block the 3x3. In reality, she is always blocking, so it's sort of pointless to open it up. (V)AV sets up a play that she is less likely to block, but it's not enough to win even if we draw a bingo to play along row 15. I would probably just play 7F CAR(K) and try to make up as much spread as possible.
>rhonda: ?AAEFPU 7F PEA. +19 389
#note PEAK is weird for a player who was so worried about a bingo last play that she scored a measly 5 points. With unseen S and blank, no reason to give the S-PEAK hook. 7E APEA(K) or 14A AP(O) are probably best.
>harry: AACORST E5 OCA +21 248
#note E3 or E1 OSTRACA. Harry said he knew the word, but missed it. It's the plural of OSTRACON, so no OSTRACA(S)* along row 5. 
>rhonda: ?AEFIRU 5D F.UR +7 396
#note 3C ARgUFIER, 4B FAILURE, and 3C UnFAIRER are the bingos here.
>harry: AAERSTT I12 .AT +7 255
#note Might as well set something up to try for that late consolation bingo.
>rhonda: ?AEIMRU H13 MAE +21 417
#note 15I UREMIAs, 15I URaEMIA, 15I, URAEMIc, 15I URAEMIa, and 15H MURIATE are the bingos here.
>harry: AEERSTU H1 TRUES +26 281
#note Harry missed the consolation bingo 3C AUSTERE(R).
>rhonda: ?AAIIU 12A AA +10 427
#note 4A UnAI 18 is best.
>harry: AE 4C AE +14 295
#note Harry's out play is best.
>harry:  (?IIU) +6 301
