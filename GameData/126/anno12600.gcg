#note This isn't a word. I should have taken a lesson I learned a while back. If you can't undo it, you can't redo it. I learned that from RESLICED*.
>Avery_Mojica: ADEFGGS D12 FAG +24 44
#note I couldn't bring myself to play FAGGED. I knew I had studied bingos, so I could bring myself up. I didn't want to play a phoney and lose a turn. There's a lot of better plays than this though. but they're all FAGGED or FADGE.
>Meredith_Leigh: FLW 6C FL.W +18 112
>Avery_Mojica: EGHNPSS 13C G.SH +28 72
#note I really should have taken the triple. But I knew Meredith doesn't intentionally phoney (not in games I play with her), so she wouldn't challenge REPIERCES, if it wasn't good. (I didn't know during the game...) GASH comes up 3rd on the list anyway. PEHS and PEGS are still the big-time winners.
>Meredith_Leigh: DN 9E .ND +12 124
#note If you're looking at my next rack, I was upset she blocked the U for my bingo (can you find it?)
>Avery_Mojica: BDEINOS 14B BO. +15 87
#note Wow, best play.
>Meredith_Leigh: APT 15A PAT +23 147

>Meredith_Leigh: N G7 N.. +5 152
#note Oh no... fishing
>Avery_Mojica: IIOSSTT 10C TO.I +11 136
#note I couldn't bring myself to OTITIS. Can you find the flashy fit for it? And also, I didn't even think about NODI. Then, postgame, i was like "dammit that IS a word"
>Meredith_Leigh: DO 15H OD +21 173
>Avery_Mojica: IIOSSTT 13I TO +17 153
#note I didn't feel like trying TOITS, similar to FAGGED. It just sounds like an adjective when you look at it without knowing the definition. I didn't want to do TOIT because, if it took an S, she would bingo more easily and I want a way to catch up.
>Meredith_Leigh: ?AELNRS K7 SLANtER +65 238
#note Well, I had suspicions about this, and I was right. I didn't give this thought at all the rest of the day either, but it isn't good. Dammit, I should have looked at the hook STERNA and knew SLANTER was no good. Stupid mistake.
>Avery_Mojica: AIIOSST 8K .ITAI +18 171
#note OSTIA L11 is the best.
>Meredith_Leigh: EV 12J V.E +25 263
>Avery_Mojica: EEOSSUU -EOUU +0 171
#note My exdchange is 4th, behind SO(L)U(M), (R)OUE, and OUSE(L)
>Meredith_Leigh: AHW 7I WA.H +19 282
>Avery_Mojica: BCEEMSS 12D ..CES +19 190
#note This looked like a pretty nice fit, considering there was nearly no hope of winning.
>Meredith_Leigh: KLNY N7 L.NKY +22 304

#note Best play (y)

>Meredith_Leigh: ET D3 ET +10 371
#note 15E placement is best, and would have helped her spread more.
>Avery_Mojica: AELNORS 2D LOANERS +64 353
#note I didn't look carefully to see whether she had 2 Es for ZEE 1H. Oops. RELOANS may have been better, but either way, she could get rid of the Z.
