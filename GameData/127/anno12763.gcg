#note Very weak. I spent too much time deciding PSHAW was an interjecting. Which is idiotic because I have studied it as a bingo.

#note With the board open up top, I knew it was time to make the bottom more volatile, too. Don't want Scott to block it all up. This is risky, but it could work out very well.

#note This is a key play. Scott ditching the D made me sure that AREOLATED wasn't good.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACDENRU 3I CEDAR. +24 373
#note I should have put more though into it to realize I absolutely had to play AREOLATED. I probably win if I play there. This play needs the Z to be in the bag. DAMN!!!
