#note I like this better than all the other bingos that I saw, but I didn't see MANLIEST (I thought "AILMENTS, ALIMENTS, SMALTINE, MELANIST, that's all four!") I actually might still like this, because the resulting board is pretty nice, but I'm not sure.

#note He laid down AN(E)ROBE* first, which I wouldn't have challenged, given my rack.
>Noah: CEHIINR O3 .ICHER +36 390
#note Some good options here. I didn't like HAG because it kept the triple open, and closing that down was a good thing. I thought about IR(E)NIC to keep HAG, but it was too much of a point sacrifice to justify. I then thought about this and HIRCINE. It seemed like HIRCINE gave a better comeback chance, so I went for the safer route. HIRCINE could be better though, just because those extra points help me if Gunther plays some sort of tricky setup.

#note I considered RAG and LAG, but I really wanted a flexible rack to deal better with any annoying plays he might make. I kept the R because of RAI and the C because it is a decent scoring and blocking tile. I did miss a cool play: LINGC(OD), which I don't think I will have any trouble winning after.

#note SCROD is another option which I didn't see until next turn. Yet I think this is better, because it defends better against setups like LO(G) 2H, which I didn't notice, but which are evidently defrayed by plays like MOPEY, but not SCROD.
