>Eric_Mesko: ACER 8F RACE +12 12
>Tasha_Asberry: DEEINST E5 DESTINE +89 89
#note Underscored as 81.  I think I counted this as 3 instead of 4.  Either that or I think 8x4 is 24.  I'm just now realizing that this is a odd place to play RACE.  Must have had the X... (CAREX!!!)
>Eric_Mesko: LOX F4 LOX +54 66
#note Humph!
>Tasha_Asberry: ?IIMNRS H8 .ReMINIS +86 175
>Eric_Mesko: INPT D9 PINT +20 86
>Tasha_Asberry: GOORTTY J7 TROY +23 198
#note I passed up 13C GOY.  I wished I would have seen TOYO.  I like that play best.  5E (DO)GTROT is cute.
>Eric_Mesko: AEU K9 EAU +13 99
>Tasha_Asberry: CDEGOTV 14F VO.CED +22 220
#note A walking dictionary would have played (DO)VECOT.  But I'm Tasha Asberry so I have to settle for the runner-up play.  Gotta play with what you know, right?
>Eric_Mesko: BIO K5 BIO +12 111
>Tasha_Asberry: BEGOTUV D4 GUV +31 251
#note I'm not a stickler for the rules, but well after I drew tiles, Eric announces he's going to challenge.  I'm a little confused because he never said hold (if he did, I didn't hear it) and because I'm not sure what he wants to challenge.  I guess it's either GUV or UDO (I asked him after the game and it was UDO).  My tiles were still face-down on the table, and had the word been a bingo, I probably would have just let him challenge anyway.  Because I KNOW this is good, I just gently told him it's too late to challenge because I already drew and that he needs to say "hold" so his opponent doesn't draw beforehand.  No worries.  
>Eric_Mesko: IIII -IIII +0 111
>Tasha_Asberry: AABEOPT C10 BOAT +22 273
#note I spent about two or three minutes here.  I was going back and forth beween L3 ABATE and C10 BOAT.  I decided that ABATE is out of the question.   I like 13C BOA, though.  Keeping the T is a good idea.
>Eric_Mesko: EIT L3 TIE +10 121

#note I missed B11 PREZ.  I didn't even look there.  
>Eric_Mesko: ADEW B12 WADE +24 190

>Eric_Mesko: OT N1 .OT +27 217
>Tasha_Asberry: AALLNRW M1 ....N +18 420
#note I forgot to write my rack down after this play.  I know I had ALLNW (I remember looking for a place to play WALL).  But I'm not sure of my last two tiles.  I'm fairly sure I had an extra A.  Anyways, if this rack is correct, A(TO)NAL is the star play.  Blocks both remaining bingo lanes.  
>Eric_Mesko: ?AHIRSS O3 SHARIeS +93 310
>Eric_Mesko: ?AHIRSS --  -93 217
#note I held this play long enough to write the rack down.  I also asked him again what the blank was before challenging.  Making sure he said E and not A.
>Tasha_Asberry: AAILLRW O3 ILL +8 428
#note I saw the better spot for ILL right after hitting my clock.   6M ILL blocks the bingo lanes and he won't have a bingo through the L.  I was mentally kicking myself after this.  Oddly though, this sims at the top after I added it to the list.  I have no idea why unless it's because I'm all but guaranteed a 40 point comeback regardless of what he bingos with.  
>Eric_Mesko: ?AHIRSS C3 HA +13 230
#note ...
>Tasha_Asberry: AAEELRW 2B AWARE +29 457
#note I spent way too much time trying to decide which placement of AWARE is better. Or if I shoud make a shorter play instead like WEAL.  In the end, I said "Blah, this isn't rocket science.  Go for the most points!"
>Eric_Mesko: ?AIRSSU 1F ASSURe +17 247
>Tasha_Asberry: EEGGHLO B4 HOGG +20 477
#note Eric is literally probaby one of the nicest guys I played.  He took this loss very graciously.  He even asked me for my ISC handle aftewards.
>Eric_Mesko: IM L7 MI +10 257
>Eric_Mesko:  (EEL) +6 263
#note Final scores recorded as 259-468.
