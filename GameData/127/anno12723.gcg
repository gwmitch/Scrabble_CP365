#note Dan plays G, U, I, D...I look down and track GUIDE. I look up 5-10 seconds later and am dismayed...
>Will: AACILRR I8 RAILCAR +63 63
#note ...because I'm in hugely better shape if I challenge and play this in a safer way!

#note Is LOUCHE too 'regular' of a word to induce a phony hook?

#note Well, I didn't think this would be challenged, but it's really not worth the risk - OSTIA scores nearly as well. In fact, OSTIA being available was the factor that convinced a dubious Dan not to challenge after a long hold.

#note Worried about a possible double V stick here, as well as possible B4 bingos (which don't in fact exist, I really should have trusted myself to see any possibilities from BEEEGSTTVVY). Most plays don't really deal with the V issue, but I think 2K HUNG is probably the play here just to hang on to the vowel.

#note I lost 10 on time, hate slapping tiles down in a frenzy if the game is decided regardless. I'm far too smooth for such shenanigans.
