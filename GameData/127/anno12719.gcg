#note I missed WORTHIER.  I wasn't even looking for a bingo.

#note This sort of makes up for missing WORTHIER.

>Tasha_Asberry: AABLPRT H11 P.ARL +31 206
#note Yes, I was tempted to play PARTABLE* but I resisted.  I spent about a minute trying to decide if I should play PEARL ior PEART.  PEART to see if I could hit a VALID ABLE bingo on row 3 or PEARL because...well to be honest, I like Ls better than Ts.
>Don_Rathberger: AEEGINT 13C ATE +18 106
#note It would have been annoying if LEGATINE went down as I decided to play PEARL vice PEART.
>Tasha_Asberry: ABEKLOT 3C BETAK. +34 240
#note Whoa, best.  I thought 2L KOB was going to the top play.  I know that Don is still sitting on EGIN and he probably has a blank or S by now.  KOB is silly.  
>Don_Rathberger: EGIN 11D GIE +20 126
>Tasha_Asberry: ADFLOQS 4B FADO +28 268
#note 5D FOLDS sims best.  I don't like it.  It's important that I block WIZ/hAFIZ.  Playing FADO vice FAD wasn't as big as a mistake as I thought.  FADO is runner up and sims better than FAD.  I STILL wish I would have just played FAD, but now that I'm analyzing this game, I see he could have bingoed through the L on row 15 anyway.  And the game would have had a different turnout since I will bingo on that lane near the end of the game, hitting the 3WS on 15A.  hehe F6 FL(O)OD(ER)S...

#note 5E WALY.  I looked there, but couldn't see a four that started with W and ended with Y.  Okay.  I'm going to review my fours.  I really am.

>Don_Rathberger: EEJLNRU -  +0 302
#note Don thought this was an outplay so he challenges.  But before we leave the table, he checks the bag and a C falls out. When we get to the computer, he apologizes and says he knows what a carousel is.  I personally never challenge "because it's an outplay" if I know the word is good.  That's actually a Scrabble pet peeve of mine, but it made for a funny little story this time.
