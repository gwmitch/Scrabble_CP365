#note Can I infer from ENTRAINS and VIRION that Larry is missing REEQUIPS? I didn't think so. The bingo is better and VIRION is best with practically any 7th tile except an E. Regardless, it seemed like playing through the V now and saving RE was better than leaving ACDVS and letting Larry hit the V. Sim disagrees, but sim also predicts that Larry will hit REEQUIPS himself more than he is likely to - surely some of the time he will not be thinking about it.

#note Missed CONVEYER. Once I saw CEREMONY played in two places, I kind of stopped looking (not that this is a legitimate reason/excuse, it's just what happened!). Pretty nutty game.
