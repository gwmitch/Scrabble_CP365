>Lester_: AZ 8G ZA +22 22
#note Lester was such a nice guy!  Before the start of our game, he was telling me he was feeling a little vengeful because I beat his wife the round before.  He said I had a beautiful smile but he hopes to it wipe off my face! :D

#note Annoying.
>Tasha_Asberry: EGOQUVY 4C QUO.E +28 137
#note I struggled a bit here.  I'm screwed regardless of what I play.  I just decided to go for the points.  He's going to bingo next turn and a high 60/low 70  bingowon't hurt too much if I keep scoring.  
>Lester_: ??CEELU E6 LUCErnE +72 191
#note VERY annoying.
>Tasha_Asberry: GIJTTVY 12D J.TTY +38 175
#note Pulling an Andrew here.

#note Oh no, not again.

>Tasha_Asberry: AEIKMRT L1 MARK +42 250
#note Funny,  I wrote down MIRK as the word I played, but EIT as the leave.  I haven't the slightest idea why I played MARK instead.  I think I just had one of my classic Tasha moments and accidently played the A instead of the I.

#note OMG...I SUCK.

>Tasha_Asberry: ACGIIOU 8A GUIA. +27 376
#note My deliberate phony is the best play.  I was 100% sure GUIAC isn't good (though I'm not quite so sure about the proper spelling.  I just know that the correct word is a six, not a five), and I was 75% he wouldn't challenge.

>Tasha_Asberry: CIILNOO 2L .NI +12 388
#note I suddenly decide to forego playing well and give a tutorial on how not to play an endgame instead.  Ladies and gentlemen, get those pencils ready and take notes.

#note Too late.

#note This concludes the lesson on proper endgame botching.  Thank you and have a great day.
