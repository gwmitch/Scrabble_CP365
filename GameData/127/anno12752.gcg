>Matt: AGNQSWY -GQWY +0 0
#note I didn't think much about this rack, just dumped the junk immediately.  I don't like keeping the G because I feel like that could go wrong if I don't draw an I or E.  
>Steve: IIIIUUU -IIIIUUU +0 0
>Matt: ABINRSY 8G BINARY +30 30
#note Was about to play BRAINY, then I remembered the anagram and saw it was more defensive.  What's the worst that could happen after he's traded 7?
>Steve: EEFIIST K5 FIE.IEST +94 94
#note Oh geez it's going to be lke this again?  We talked about this later and he agreed that BINARY was the right play, you just get unlucky sometimes.
>Matt: AEEKRSY J6 KE. +35 65
#note Wish I didn't have to keep the Y, but 9G is a good spot to dump that tile next turn.
>Steve: EFU J10 FEU +31 125
>Matt: ADERSYZ L1 ZERDA +55 120
#note Play the S for 9 more?  Y(UT)Z for 32 keeping ADERS?  My play kind of splits the difference, and I'm still in the game despite that 2x2. 
>Steve: EJ 2J JE. +26 151
>Matt: DHPRSTY M5 HYP +23 143
#note TR(UT)HY# looks like the play to me.  I'm having consonantitis yet again so I need to dump as many consonants as possible while still scoring.
>Steve: ?CENNSU 13D NUNClES +69 220
#note There's a bingo from the I that is sick.  Collins only, I'll let you discover it (or if you can find it, mad props!).  
>Matt: DDIORST 3I DOR. +18 161
#note Oh man, 2 Collins only bingoes that I missed here, that are anagrams of each other.  Once again I was disheartened by how this game was going and didn't even bother here.  I certainly don't find the one and probably don't find the other though.  My play at least opens up another lane, but it's looking bad.
>Steve: ADEGNRT 9B GRANTED +69 289
#note DRAGNET plays in that newly created bingo lane for 83.  Whatever, I need a minor miracle to get a win now.
>Matt: ADGISTW 4H WAG +25 186
#note No Quackle, I'm not taking the 2x2 for 48 points when I'm down by so much.  However, M1 ADS scores 43, and leaves me at a shot for an ING bingo next turn, if I'm fortunate.  
>Steve: HMU 12C HUM +24 313
>Matt: DILLOST 1L .ILL +39 225
>Steve: OPW H12 P.OW +33 346
>Matt: DEIOOST 15H .OODIEST +89 314
#note Wow, I'm actually happy to see a W in a bingo lane!  Still need another bingo though.
>Steve: AELMOR 11B MORALE +34 380
>Matt: ABEIQSV -AQBVI +0 314
#note This draw sinks my chances.  I kept ES because I wanted to bingo ASAP.  There aren't any good options here unfortunately at this score.
>Steve: ACGNO N10 CONGA. +30 410
#note Yeah I'm done.
>Matt: EIIOSTU O12 OI +9 323
#note Meh.
>Steve: AQT 14B QAT +28 438
#note Of course.
>Matt: AEISTUX 15A XI +38 361
#note TIX# scores 50 and gives me one more shot at the blank, but also another shot at those two V's.  
>Steve: ABO 8C ABO +19 457
>Matt: AEESTUV 5D VAUTES +27 388
#note Keep the S, but this is the right idea at least.
>Steve: ?ILNRTV 7C VaNT +27 484
#note Maximum Collins style points.
>Matt: EI N1 .EI +6 394
#note Or LIE, I didn't write down which one it was.  He complimented me on fighting hard despite my poorer tiles.  I end the day 3-4, but still in the top 5.  I just had to hope for a positive day 4 (4-3, 5-2) and I could still cash.
