#note Plenty of worth options here. My thoughts were DITZY, DOZY, BLITZ, and ZILL. I wasn't sure of DOZILY and didn't think of ZLOTY. DITZY looks like the best row 11 option, and BLITZ looks better than ZILL. ZLOTY is a very open choice. BLITZ is more closed choice, locking down the top left and also making the top right tough to maneuver around in. I didn't mind having an open board against Mike, so I went with DITZY. If this kind of play is my aim, ZLOTY looks better. What do you think? Is this what I want to do against Mike, or should I go for BLITZ?

#note I didn't see JEjUNA here, which is pretty cool. Both of these plays are pretty good. JEjUNA seems worth it on this board, where bingos don't score that much and often give back quite a bit.

#note This was a frustrating play. TWEE doesn't look good at all given DNNNTT pool and none of those on my rack. It looked like a toss up between (E)WE and this. Mike doesn't look especially likely to have an S, but this still might be unnecessarily risky, especially since it gives him a very easy scoring spot on row A. EWE makes him work harder, which is definitely a good thing. Finally, I didn't see E(T)WEE 11B, and I do like it. It doesn't give too much back while blocking a good bingo lane and keeping an S spot for me. I like ETWEE here.
>Mike: AIIKRTU A11 TRAIK +33 278
#note Mike's actual rack. He said he thought he should've played (T)RAIK here. TALUK and TILAK look even better.
>Noah: EEHNRRS 5C H.RE +22 310
#note Thought about INHERERS*, but didn't think it would stay, and seemed like an unnecessary risk with an already powerful rack. Though I didn't see (MO)N(T)H, I like the wieldiness of ENRS a lot more than EERRS, especially with RR left.
