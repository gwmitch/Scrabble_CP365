#note sims best by about 4. i had a long discussion about this with nick meyer during lunch and we finally agreed on WAIT; it keeps a good leave, the hook for AWAIT, and leaves WALTZERS open since i have ER. however, it looks like i have quackle on the brain too much. maybe AW IS best.

#note one often asks themselves: "what kind of dogshit leave for no points is best to keep when i'm down over 100?" exchanging sims best here but 9G TOLA looks good too. maybe this play is wrong. (-1%)

#note quackle likes COINAbLE best. i guess my phony gives up a lot of points too.

#note ugh, i think i made a mistake here. PAVING scores ok actually. LUV doesn't do that much except making the board less friendly. actually, i was looking for a good way to keep that 2-2 lane open but i can't think of a halfway decent move for that. PLUVIAN/AECIAL sims best. did not see. (-6)

#note quackle likes the standard poring/roping. 2I PANINO is cool 1C DIPNOAN is also cool. a significant mistake. i didn't realize the bag was decent. (-10)
>vicky: CDIKLOR 2J KO. +17 388
#note it also lets her do this and leave one in the bag. i need to bingo out to win.

#note i'm gonna lose this game with perfect play, but i have to assume she'll miss REINFUSE. i don't know what to play.
