#note Unfortunately, I spent several minutes this turn eventually talking myself out of FLOBS*. I didn't pull the trigger on the phony, but debating it distracted me from finding the good real playes. BIFOLD and FIENDS.

#note Didn't see 12D FEDAYEEN. I thought this play maximized my scoring potential for next turn, but FIZ does that better, I guess.

#note I really disliked giving him an easy FLED play, but I just didn't know what else to play here. I wish I were clever enough to come up with 2L OE, but he will obviously just play at 1M. The top-simming play is absolutely hilarious. K10 PONGEE gives him no bingos! Although I don't see how giving him a big PELTED is going to help me. Do not understand. Oh wait, I get it now. Joel has SPLENDENT, so that screws up all the sim results. Ignore everything I just said.

#note Sims best with inferrence. I wasn;t happy to give him the spot, but there was a good chance he couldn't use it. And I'm not going to win this game playing scared.
