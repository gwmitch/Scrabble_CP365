#player2 Joel_Sherman Joel Sherman
>Ross_Brown: ?EEHSUZ 8H UH +10 10
#note Ross: Quackle prefers ZEE by a few points. I like to keep the board sterile against Joel.
>Joel_Sherman: AIQ H7 Q.AI +13 13
>Ross_Brown: ?EEGOSZ 11D OGEES +26 36
#note Ross: SEGO is much better.
>Joel_Sherman: COPY 12A COPY +38 51
>Ross_Brown: ?DEITVZ B10 Zo.ID +68 104
#note Ross: Scared of a triple-triple; still, I could have scored 38 points with ZIT.
>Joel_Sherman: AIMU 7F MA.UI +24 75
>Ross_Brown: DEFKLTV 6J KEF +36 140
#note Ross: Best, or KELT.
>Joel_Sherman: INO A12 .OIN +23 98
>Ross_Brown: DEIILTV 5K DEV +25 165
#note Ross: The most I can score without opening column O.
>Joel_Sherman: AAEILM 8A LAMIAE +31 129
>Ross_Brown: DIILLPT G9 PL.D +19 184
#note Ross: Quackle wants me to spend an I, but there aren't many more unseen, and this has some defensive value.
>Joel_Sherman: AO C8 .OA +17 146
>Ross_Brown: AAIILTW N5 AWAIT +24 208
#note Ross: WAIT is a bit better.
>Joel_Sherman: ?ABEEHS M8 BEAcHES +81 227
>Ross_Brown: EILNORX N12 EXON +40 248
>Joel_Sherman: EGR O6 ERG +37 264
>Ross_Brown: ILLORRT 4J TOR +22 270
#note Ross: Opening a bingo line. I could get LITORAL or something like that.
>Joel_Sherman: EW O14 WE +27 291
>Ross_Brown: CILLRTU 12J LIT..R +20 290
#note Ross: Not bad, but CULTI is the prize play (at the expense of that bingo line).
>Joel_Sherman: INV 10J VIN. +15 306
>Ross_Brown: CDEGLNU 10B ..G +20 310
#note Ross: It's this or CUDGEL for 20, and I choose the wrong one, thinking that vowels are too scarce for Joel to bingo. DE(I)C(I)NG would be good also.
>Joel_Sherman: EIORSTU 3D STOURIE +61 367
>Ross_Brown: CDEFLNU 2B FLUED +37 347
#note Ross: Playing too fast (and perhaps hoping to draw the J), I miss FECUND for 54, which would probably win the game considering what Joel is holding. Held.
>Joel_Sherman: JNRRSTY D1 J..T +38 405
>Ross_Brown: ABCNNOT F2 ..T +4 351
#note Ross: Blocking SYN, but I don't see the other SYN play. Oops. Better to play BANCO and let him have SYN for 24.
>Joel_Sherman: NRRSY 2I SYN +30 435
>Ross_Brown: ABCNNO I12 BAN +18 369
#note Ross: Some tile-out potential here, but not enough to win (a further 10 points), and spread doesn't count.
>Joel_Sherman: RR E8 .R +2 437
