#note Didn't seriously consider VAW here - with no S, gunning for bingos/leave over points isn't likely to pay off. I did think hard about TWAE vs WARE. The TWAE spot is much harder to hit than line 12, so I'm not as likely to be able to play there on subsequent turns, and it also gives less back. Barring bingos, Jeremy will play something from 12A after TWAE and open the triple downward, and I should be able respond to 15A and maintain tempo. Instead, after WARE, he'll play to 15A, and then barring a nice draw my scoring options may be limited. CRV is also better than CTV. Whoever gets esses first will still gain command regardless of what I play here, though. I thought of most of this over the board and still did WARE! Oh well

#note Antsy to get S?...I guess BUNDT is worth playing, though.

#note Why didn't I see JIVED, the easiest play in existence to see and a better block to boot?

#note Preventable. (Nice play, Jeremy.)
>Will: AEITTTU M5 TATE +13 396
#note Almost played N13 TUI, thinking I held the case vowel hooks to UT, before retracking and spotting the other E. Of course it sims well but when Jeremy plays -ED words sometimes I'll end up regretting it. After TATE he might play TAP and I could struggle to deal with it, though. Maybe the straightforward 8A UTA is best?

#note TUN, obviously - sets up O14 TI, which wins me every(?) endgame. Should have cost me dearly...
