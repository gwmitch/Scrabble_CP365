>Fran_Silver: AFOOT 8H AFOOT +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: ADEORRT K2 TOREAD.R +68 68
#note Also plays at K7 for the same score.  As for placement, which is riskier?  Leaving a hot spot at 6J?  Or opening up an S hook on row 15?  I thought it was slightly riskier to give her the triple line (4 unseen S's instead of one unseen Z), and Q agrees with me. Barely.  In reality it's stylistic preference - this wins barely 0.1% more often than the K7 placement.  Equity difference is 0.3 points.  
>Fran_Silver: EINV L1 VINE +30 48
>Jim_Burlant: AEIJSUY 6J J.Y +29 97
#note I'd planned on playing JURY, but VINE blocked that.  This is a strong choice but it's not best - best is apparently to keep the J and play J5 AY.  This wins 1-1/2% less often and sims almost 3 points down.  However, given my next draw, it didn't matter what I put down here.
>Fran_Silver: BNO M2 NOB +24 72
>Jim_Burlant: AEIOSUU -IOUU +0 97
#note Best is either this or exchanging AOUU keeping EIS.  60% to win.
>Fran_Silver: EGG H7 G.GE +6 78
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEKLS 11B vAKEELS +77 174
#note Any number of bingos here.  I like this because it eliminates any possibility of a 12A comeback. Q gives slight preference to LEAKERS in the same place as this.
>Fran_Silver: OY N1 OY +24 102
>Jim_Burlant: ABEILLU 12C BILL +32 206
#note Best.  Other plays that do better from the leave standpoint either give up too much on the scoreboard or open too much up.  86% to win.
>Fran_Silver: AMR 13C ARM +32 134
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEHUU 9F HU.E +16 222
#note  Not thrilled about keeping ADEU, but between scoring 16 points and my ability to unload every duplicated letter, it's enough to justify playing through.  Q agrees, as the play is either this or HUGE 7F.  Either one is as good as the other.  The next 7 choices after those two plays are all exchanges.  
>Fran_Silver: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 134
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEIRU 8A UREDIA +32 254
#note The other 6's in this rack, UREIDE, REDIAE, and DEARIE (all play at 8A) score 29.  Between the 3 extra scoreboard points and better defensive position (this places the U at 8A instead of the D or R), this is best.  96% to win.
>Fran_Silver: W 1N .W +15 149
>Jim_Burlant: ELPPTTV 7C PET +20 274
#note PETTLE C3 does a better job clearing out the consonant overload, but it opens up lines.  This does a terrific job strangling the board.  She can't play a 7 if she doesn't have an S or a blank, and now she's pretty much limited to finding something down the A column or 9's down the C and D columns.  I chose this over PEP due to rack balance.  Q says this is a strong choice but not best - its preference is 7C PEP, which does make sense - if I draw an I (I is the most probable tile in the remaining pool) I'll have VITTLED.  Q also likes C7 VET.
>Fran_Silver: ACEMO D2 CAMEO.. +24 173
>Jim_Burlant: LNPSTUV C3 PUN +24 298
#note  VAUNT turns more tiles but leaves a nice healthy front A hook.  Too bad I couldn't think of VAULT.  But this still gets the job done. 98% to win.
>Fran_Silver: NR 10H .RN +11 184
>Jim_Burlant: ILSTVWX 5C ..WT +14 312
#note Either this or NEXT 5C.  SIX N4 scores 32 but gives bingo lines back up. I figured that it might be worth it to see if I could wait a turn for her to open up somehting better for the X.  Either play is as good as the other according to the sim.
>Fran_Silver: TU 11J UT +6 190
>Jim_Burlant: IILSSVX G3 VIS +18 330
#note I didn't want to give her any sort of scoring line back.  Worst-case, if she bingos on row 12, it's going to open up something nice for my X.  The sim indicates that it's either 12J SIX or this.
>Fran_Silver: HNO 12J NOH +17 207
>Jim_Burlant: DEILSSX 13K DEX +31 361
#note N4 SIX scores more, but I wanted her to think that an S might have still been at large. At any rate, Q agrees with me - this is best.
>Fran_Silver: ?ANZ N10 ZANy +43 250
>Jim_Burlant: IIILOSS N4 SOIL +12 373
#note Poor valuation, but this wins the most of anything.  
>Fran_Silver: AFRT O8 FRAT +34 284
>Jim_Burlant: IIIQS 14A QIS +30 403
#note Annotation stops here - she has no way to stop me from milking my Q for another 33 points at 15A, and she dinks a few tiles off each turn before going out before me.  Final score recorded as 436 - 305.
