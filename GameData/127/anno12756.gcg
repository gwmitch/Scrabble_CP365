#note I would usually play WO, but I figured taking the extra points an giving a triple lane to an S might be worth it since I have the blank.

#note well that worked out

#note I saw DEALATE but missed DEALATED. It was a board vision problem since the ME down there caused me to ignore it. Rob let this go because he said it let him clean up a pretty ugly rack, and he couldn't block both my bingos on the left side.

>scott: ?ACFLPR 5J .F +10 274
#note I figured most tiles would give me a bingo on the left, and perhaps on the right as well if it stayed open.

>scott: ?ACHLPR O5 PARCH +46 320
#note I didn't see CALTHROP or PARHELIC, but the latter is too dangerous anyway, and CALTHROP opens a 3x3 lane, whic might be the only way to lose this game if I do play it. I'm still 97% to win though, keep this in mind.

#note should've played GLED/MULED to retain the vowel, but it's pretty unlikely I won't get another one drawing three/17 with seven being vowels.
