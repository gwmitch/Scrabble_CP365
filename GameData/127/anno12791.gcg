#note i guess apparently keeping AERU is better. yuck at the U but it makes sense. (-2)

#note it started to go wrong here. unfortunately, since this was game 20, i had a brainfart and forgot about UVEAL (even though i had thought of it the turn before). this isn't a huge mistake but it's not my style. J8 LAP woulda been good. i also debated trying to get away with LAPINAR* but decided this was game 20 and my record was garbage anyway. (-2)

#note why is this happening? i was gonna do WENT but then she exchanged two so that didn't seem as smart. is this too much to give up? -- i can probably still score if she bingoes after WENT. (-12.5)

#note not only did she block my own 9, but now i'm losing again. time to try catching up. nope. this may be kind of a steaming play, but it was game 20 and i don't steam. i was just trying a phony.

#note cmon. i just need a triple-triple. keeping KING seems to help with that... 3G TUB by about 2.5% (3.8 to 1.2)
