>John_O'Laughlin: AAAEIRT -AAI +0 0
>Ross_Brown: EINOPTT H7 TOP +10 10
#note Ross: PETTO is the best, safest play considering he is likely to bingo, but this avoids a double-double bingo.
>John_O'Laughlin: ?AEENRT 8H .vERNEAT +74 74
>Ross_Brown: AEINTYZ L4 ZAYI. +34 44
#note Ross: Quackle likes the AEINTZ leave enough to sacrifice points and go with Y(E) - fairly close decision.
>John_O'Laughlin: ADDEEJU M3 JADE +43 117
>Ross_Brown: EILNOST 10H ENTOILS +67 111
>John_O'Laughlin: DEFIOQU J4 FIQU. +37 154
>Ross_Brown: AEIKOSU N2 KOS +35 146
#note Ross: Pretty daring to keep four vowels on this board, but I have a good shot at cashing in on the TWS on my next play.
>John_O'Laughlin: DEINOOW N6 WO.D. +34 188
>Ross_Brown: AEEIRUU G3 URAEI +10 156
>John_O'Laughlin: AEEINNO O1 NAE +25 213
>Ross_Brown: ADEEISU F6 ADIEU +18 174
#note Ross: 11E ADIEU scores more, but this makes some interesting hooks for my ES leave.
>John_O'Laughlin: EINNOTV H1 VINE +29 242
>Ross_Brown: AEEGRRS 11B GREASER +80 254
#note Ross: Best.
>John_O'Laughlin: ?AELNOT E3 TANgELO +73 315
>Ross_Brown: CEFGORT C9 FO.GET +28 282
#note Ross: Time to open more bingo lines while I still can.
>John_O'Laughlin: ABGMOWX 11J AX +38 353
>Ross_Brown: CLLNPRY 12I PRY +24 306
#note Ross: (A)CYL would be nice.
>John_O'Laughlin: BGMOW 13B M.W +8 361
>Ross_Brown: BCHHLLN -BCHHLL +0 306
>John_O'Laughlin: BDGMOTU B13 .UG +16 377
>Ross_Brown: IIINRSV I12 .I +5 311
#note Ross: Down to Hail Mary time.
>John_O'Laughlin: BDHMOOT D10 M.O. +28 405
#note Ross: Clever play, but it doesn't block the .....IN(G) bingo I'm cultivating.
>Ross_Brown: IILNRSV B6 LIVIN. +26 337
#note Ross: Time to give up; I can't dump that V anywhere without ruining my chances or exhausting the bag.
>John_O'Laughlin: BCDHLOT 14F BLOTCH +30 435
>Ross_Brown: BHRS 4D S.B.. +14 351
#note Ross: Things go a little weird here; the last C is sitting unnoticed under the inverted bag, but I have him tracked with CD and want to block C(A)D(RE). We don't find the C until after the deadwood is exposed, so the game ends with his next play.
>John_O'Laughlin: D H1 ....D +12 447
>John_O'Laughlin:  (CHR) +16 463
#note Ross: The lost C is not counted, so the recorded final score is 457-351.
