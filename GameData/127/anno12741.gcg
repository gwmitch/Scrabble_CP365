>Stefan_Rau: ALOPRR H4 PARLOR +22 22
>Ross_Brown: EGJMNTU 5E JUG. +24 24
#note Ross: Disappointed to see no D played. The best play is MUT(A)GEN for 40, but this play creates a decent leave.
>Stefan_Rau: ABDET D4 BATED +33 55
>Ross_Brown: AAEIMNT C6 AMENTIA +75 99
#note Ross: Incorrectly scored as 74.
>Stefan_Rau: IV 8A VI.. +24 79
>Ross_Brown: EFOOSWY 13C SOOEY +44 143
#note Ross: Quackle doesn't like the leave on this play, preferring either of the WOOF plays. I think he may have an S, though.
>Stefan_Rau: ????? -????? +0 79
>Ross_Brown: EEFKOVW D12 W.OF +38 181
#note Ross: With this rack, EVOKE is somewhat better, but I like the KEE(F) setup.
>Stefan_Rau: EILNRST F7 LISTEN.R +62 141
>Ross_Brown: EEEIKVZ 15A KEE. +33 214
#note Ross: ZEK would be somewhat better.
>Stefan_Rau: AIP 3B PIA +19 160
>Ross_Brown: EHIQTVZ B3 .ITH +31 245
#note Ross: I forgo Q(I) for a decent play that may set up QI for later, if I'm lucky.
>Stefan_Rau: AEEILSS 6H .EALISES +62 222
>Ross_Brown: EOQRVXZ O6 .OX +30 275
#note Ross: Quackle wants me to ignore Column O. I disagree.
>Stefan_Rau: FIORT 4H .ROFIT +22 244
>Ross_Brown: DEQRUVZ A12 ZER. +27 302
#note Ross: Z(E)D would be more defensive.
>Stefan_Rau: AHO 3L HAO +21 265
>Ross_Brown: ACDEQUV 2J QUA +38 340
#note Ross: Time to give up on getting an I, in the name of defense.
>Stefan_Rau: RT 2J ...RT +35 300
>Ross_Brown: BCDEGUV 11E D.BUG +18 358
#note Ross: I'm coming to the conclusion that Stefan has both blanks, so I'm starting to close bingo lines.
>Stefan_Rau: ACIL A6 CA.IL +19 319
>Ross_Brown: CEEIOVY O1 YO +30 388
#note Ross: Best. I need to outrun Stefan.
>Stefan_Rau: NN L6 .NN +4 323
>Ross_Brown: CEEIMNV M8 EVINCE +32 420
#note Ross: This seems to create a big enough leave to survive his biggest bingo.
>Stefan_Rau: ?DDEGNU 14K NUDGE +27 350
#note Ross: It seems Stefan just now drew his first blank.
>Ross_Brown: ?MW O12 sM.W +24 444
#note Ross: And so did I. Best.
>Ross_Brown:  (?D) +4 448
#note Ross: Stefan loses 10 points on time. Game is recorded as 340-447.
