#note i think my chances of getting away with BLINKY* are pretty good. i should have gone for it.

#note ok, so i don't know a word. in this tournament, that automatically means i lose.

>cynthia: R 7G R. +6 174
#note crap
>cesar: AEHHIIT N6 HEATH +45 227
#note there's a much better play available (solution next turn) (-6)
>cynthia: ACDEIRS I8 SIDECAR +77 251
>cesar: IIJLNNR 4A NINJ. +26 253
#note 3J HIGH was the answer. awesome. i woulda dodged the J and an N and drawn RATLINE.

#note PRAO for the leave. (-7)!?
>cynthia: OUY G3 YOU +25 305
>cesar: AAEEGLT K5 .....ATE +26 310
#note sigh, TELEGA is the play i was looking for. (-3.5)
>cynthia: EFU L12 FEU +22 327
>cesar: AAEEGLT J11 ALEE +24 334
#note i drew GALEATE again. TELEGA is still best, but there's also NEGATE or ANLAGE. it feels important to burn this rack (and take a scoring spot). (-9)
>cynthia: EOQU 6B QUO.E +36 363
#note this bones me; i needed to do NEGATE (or at least TELEGA might give me a scoring spot if i lucked out with the Z. 
>cesar: AEFGGMT C2 FA.G.M +30 364
#note does anyone have a way to steal this game? i'd have to make up a plausible phony, it would have to look like she'd still have a winning play if i did that, and then i'd have to go out with something she didn't see. i spent about 11 minutes trying to do this and played this with about 10 seconds on my clock. my second choice was MEGGAT* O10. that might have worked.

#note of course since i had no time i didn't see 2A GIFT
