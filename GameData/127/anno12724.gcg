>Will: EFLMNPW 4F FL.W +10 95
#note Yikes, tough call. I did not see AMP yet (becoming a bad habit) but waffled between FL(AM)EN and FL(E)W. Even after looking for a bit I don't know what I like best.
>Jeremy: AETUY D9 .EAUTY +22 68
>Will: EEMNPTU 10F PE. +31 126
#note Missed UPTIME.
>Jeremy: IQ J5 QI +21 89
>Will: EMNNTTU 13B MU.T +12 138
#note Haha, wow, no idea again. 5C TUNE makes an M spot, I guess.
>Jeremy: GOO 3D GOO +9 98

#note I really felt like I was going to get blasted down col. K imminently here, and had to address it. Not messing around with COZ. 
>Jeremy: IS K5 IS +33 185
>Will: CLOOORT 6B CO. +20 218
#note I was a little gunshy of LOCO, but it looks like the play.

#note Hi VV. Let's get some blanks...
>Jeremy: IL L2 L.I +6 214
>Will: ABCDEOR 2I COA.ED +39 257
#note What else can I do? Just hope to not get bombed with SCOW, I guess.
>Jeremy: AHR 1M RAH +25 239
>Will: ?ABGRUX 3A BUR... +18 275
#note X play incoming...
>Jeremy: ?AIJLRS 1C JAILoRS +101 340
#note Now I'll need more than that, though.
>Will: ?AGGINX 2A AX +40 315
>Jeremy: EN A1 N..E +21 361
>Will: ?AGGINV 14A ....ING +16 331
#note Doubt anything else gives me a chance.
>Jeremy: IILOTUV 15G OIL +12 373
#note I think this was Jeremy's rack. What a brutal situation! So many blocks don't work against my actual rack or similar racks. CP says this wins 75% and that nothing wins any more frequently.
>Will: ?AEEGRV 13G AVERaGE +79 410
#note Wow, what a clutch REE draw. Love my needless 9 point sacrifice here though. (breathes through mouth)
