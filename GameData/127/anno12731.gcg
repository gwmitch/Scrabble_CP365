>Joel_Sherman: ??????? -??????? +0 0
>Ross_Brown: BBIIPSU 8G BIB +14 14
#note Ross: Best.
>Joel_Sherman: AAELT 7G ALATE +19 19
>Ross_Brown: ?EFIPSU L1 UPFlIES +80 94
>Ross_Brown: ?EFIPSU --  -80 14
#note Ross: Duh. It's just DEALATES. And it's UPFLOW, not UPFLY*.
>Joel_Sherman: AUV K5 UV.A +14 33
>Ross_Brown: ?EFIPSU L4 UP +12 26
#note Ross: Best. (Joel's failure to block UPFlIES confirms to me that it's a phony.)
>Joel_Sherman: DEKMSU L8 MUSKED +39 72
#note Ross: Phony, but I trust Joel on these things.
>Ross_Brown: ?AEFIIS 9A FAIrIES +67 93
#note Ross: There are many safer alternatives worth about the same score.
>Joel_Sherman: AX 10A AX +55 127
>Ross_Brown: EEHILOR 11F HEROLI.E +80 173
>Ross_Brown: EEHILOR --  -80 93
#note Ross: Too tempting not to try. HIREE or HIRE would have been fine.
>Joel_Sherman: ERYY 11B EYRY +30 157
>Ross_Brown: EEHILOR M10 HIRE +33 126
#note Ross: Best.
>Joel_Sherman: ACHTW N6 WATCH +46 203
>Ross_Brown: DEGLMOO O5 LOGO +29 155
#note Ross: Cowed by two lost challenges, I decide that GLOOMED would probably come off also, but I'm wrong. This is becoming a stupidfest*.
>Joel_Sherman: AEJP 3J JAPE +33 236
>Ross_Brown: DEEMOOZ 6B ZOOMED +47 202
#note Ross: Best.
>Joel_Sherman: ?EGILNS 12F ELoIGN..S +59 295
#note Ross: First thing I saw after he played this was the more elegant INSELb(ER)G, but it takes an S and this doesn't.
>Ross_Brown: DEIINRR N1 RID +23 225
#note Ross: I'm thinking too much about RINDIER#, which would be challenged off even if it fits somewhere. I decide to exploit his unimproved rack and open a second bingo line.
>Joel_Sherman: DGLNOU 1I GOLDU.N +33 328
>Ross_Brown: EEINNRT J3 .ET +15 240
#note Ross: I don't see the better (KI)ER, because I'm intent on setting up another bingo line.
>Joel_Sherman: ORVW 13E VROW +20 348
>Ross_Brown: EEINNOR 14G OE +10 250
#note Ross: Betting on getting the case S. Could be tough to block.
>Joel_Sherman: NR H11 R...N +21 369
>Ross_Brown: EINNORS 11L ..ER +23 273
#note Ross: Playing for points and a shot at SINFONI(E).
>Joel_Sherman: AQT 8C QAT +28 397
>Ross_Brown: EFINNOS 5E OF +23 296
#note Ross: I get the E rather than one of the two I's as I hoped, else I could go out with SINFONI(E). SEN is better, setting up FOIN for the out-play.
>Joel_Sherman: ACIINTT 4A TACIT +21 418
>Ross_Brown: EINNS C11 .INS +14 310
#note Ross: Best.
