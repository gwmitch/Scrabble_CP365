>Stefan_Rau: ?EJMPTU 6D JUMP.EsT +74 74
>Ross_Brown: EEIORST 4C OE +18 140
#note Ross: Quackle would rather I push it one square to the right, for defensive reasons, I guess.
>Stefan_Rau: ???? -???? +0 74
>Ross_Brown: EIMORST 10C MORTISE +78 218

#note Ross: Best.

>Ross_Brown: ?EILTTU 15A .LUTTIEr +74 366

#note Ross: NAZ(I) is a bit better, but leaves Row 14 open.

>Ross_Brown: AADGIOU 13I GUA.O +16 413

>Stefan_Rau: GN 10K ..NG +12 354
>Ross_Brown: AADDIOU 8J A.OUD +7 420
#note Ross: OK, but A(L)IDAD is the play; the U is not a real problem.

>Ross_Brown: ADFIIRT 1F DIT +16 436
#note Ross: Fortunately, I have time to fix my tracking, and see SCORNED coming. I'm holding back the F for my out-play.
