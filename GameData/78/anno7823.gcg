>sneakyofverb: BEFNORT 8G FOB +16 16
#note Thought I was being cute and defensive with this opening.  Turns out it sims pretty high too.  (NOTE: 'Cute and Defensive' was my university nickname.)
>hey,_talon!: AAEENOR I2 ANAERO.E +63 63
#note Hey, it happens.  What was I gonna do, not play the B?!
>sneakyofverb: ?EEJNRT 4D sERJE.NT +80 96
#note As much as I hate to put it here, I'm not giving up 12 points for a safer placement.  Or in fear of the *other* hook.
>hey,_talon!: ACILXYZ L3 CYLIX +70 133
#note He said he debated between this and LAZY (also 70) because of the potential X-bomb.  CALYX is six more, sucker.
>sneakyofverb: AKMNOSV K6 MONK +23 119
#note The Duck isn't feeling my play.  It prefers KAV(A) 2f (21) (my original thought) or V(E)NOM e3 (20).
>hey,_talon!: AIOZ F2 ZO.I +33 166
>sneakyofverb: AEGOSSV 6C AVOS +25 144
#note How come I never thought of GO m6 (21)? Because I was too focused on dumping an S and shedding an A.  AVOS right behind.
>hey,_talon!: AOTW J2 WO.T +32 198
>sneakyofverb: EGORRST C5 G.RROTES +61 205
#note Nice setup, Magellan.  Now go and win the $8.
>hey,_talon!: ?ACGILR 11B R.LACInG +70 268
#note (S)uRGICAL 12c scores six more, but this mucks up the board better.

>hey,_talon!: EH H1 EH +24 292
>sneakyofverb: AADIOQU B2 AQUA +29 276
#note Quacker Barrel is claiming ADO m5 (24) and QUAI 3a (27) as tops.  Can't really see the former with all those Is and Us out, while the latter is decent but could get hit later with something like FIQUE/PIQUE.  My play sits third on the sim.
>hey,_talon!: AI C2 AI +28 320
#note He mentioned he was playing through awful racks the last two turns.  Not that you would have noticed.
>sneakyofverb: DDEFIIO L9 IODID +20 296
#note The sweet F(O)ODIE 9b (27) is the star, but IODID easily grabs the silver.
>hey,_talon!: EEENNUW 14K WEEN +22 342
#note Duck Daddy prefers the placement one over to the left for 23.  Looks equally dangerous, but doesn't allow for many underlaps on the right side.
>sneakyofverb: BEFIPTU 15M FUB +31 327
#note No debate here.
>hey,_talon!: EIMNRU 15F MURINE +29 371
#note After this, he's roughly got a 76% chance of winning...
>sneakyofverb: DEGHIPT 14B DEPTH +53 380
#note ...Until this, of course.  Although it tells me I'm only supposed to win one out of three times in this situation.
>hey,_talon!: ELNTU 13G LUNTE. +15 386
#note Think IT were his other two tiles.  Wisely blocking my A(D)D 13k (30).
>sneakyofverb: ADGILST 9E GLAD. +17 397
#note This and SAL(V)IA a5 (13) are apparently the only plays that win 100% of the time every time.  Take that, fractions.
>hey,_talon!: IPST E4 .P.S +20 406
#note He put down PI m9 (21) when his clock went under a minute, but eventually changed it to this one.  A better decision, but unfortunately came at a time when there was no chance to win.
