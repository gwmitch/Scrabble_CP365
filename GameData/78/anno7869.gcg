>Ryan_Fischer: ?BDEIOR 2H DEBO.aIR +82 230
#note Best (or RIbBO(N)ED.  BIcO(LO)RED for 65, too.  Didn't Nigel just play that?  (Oh yeah, welcome to the bagging!)
>John_Luebkemann: AOP 1H APO +32 107
#note John decided to get all British on me.  He played too fast for me to notice.  Oops.  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: ABFHPQR 3K F.B +27 257
#note H > B.  F(R)AP is another option.  Q likes this best.
>John_Luebkemann: ?AEEMRT A8 .ATERMEn +89 196
#note Although... I should've taken the 3x3 considering how close he was to hitting it.  He considered c(R)EMATER*.

>John_Luebkemann: GIJ E3 JIG +39 235
>Ryan_Fischer: DFHINPR O1 D.IP +30 315
#note B5 F(LO)RID or F(LO)RIN 29/27.
>John_Luebkemann: EIINOSV 12A .EVISION +74 309
#note And he's back in it!
>Ryan_Fischer: EFHNRTU 13G HEFT +29 344
#note This is way down, but it blocked LAXNESS for like 106, I think.  He considered ENE#.  Best is FUN in the same spot, apparently.
>John_Luebkemann: AELNSSX 9A .XES +41 350
>Ryan_Fischer: CEEINRU M6 .INECURE +74 418
#note That pretty much locks it up (though there's a couple ways he can still backdoor a win).
>John_Luebkemann: LUZ J11 LU.Z +33 383
>Ryan_Fischer: CDGLOTY K10 DOTY +36 454
#note That should do it.  Almost didn't see it.  Was considering GOD, DOG, or COG before that.  C(I)TY is notable, too.
>John_Luebkemann: ANOS F1 NAOS +27 410
#note Bonus points for obscure word play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDGLTY D11 D.CTY +15 469
#note Okay, it's sad I didn't see GLYCA(N) for 45.  It's not that hard a find.  Though at that point there was too much laughter, and John even made a point to fake as if he was going to check a word a la Connie Creed.  (D(I)CTY is 2nd statically.
