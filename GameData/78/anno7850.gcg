>Opponent: ?FOPTTT -FTT +0 0
>Nick: DEEINNZ 8H DENIZEN +104 104
#note I play denizen without thinking too much about it. Debating the merits of slotting it where I did likely would have its virtue, however I didn't bother to. The sacrifice is 28 points to slot it over, which in hindsight I would do if given the chance again. Opponent scores at least 54 by pluralizing without taking into account anything but the s.

>Opponent: ?ELOPTW N2 TOWPLa.E +78 78
#note Opponent finds the bingo. Interestingly, the non-bingo plays of sTOWP, PLOWs, etc.. score better and have solid leaves, making them better options than the bingo.
>Nick: ABGORTX O1 BOX +47 151
#note Best. Wasn't worth blocking the s from happening if I can could score 47.
>Opponent: BEIIKOS O7 IS +61 139
#note Topped only by OES O6.
>Nick: AEGNORT H8 .RAGONET +83 234
#note Best.
>Opponent: BEIKNOR L4 BRON.E +34 173
>Nick: CEEIOST 13C SEICE.TO +74 308
#note Bingo train coming through.
>Opponent: EGIIKRY 14J YERK +32 205
#note Personally I dislike this given the other options that don't open up the s hook. KIR 10J looks much more solid. A lot of people seem to be afraid of holding Ys though. Yerk also scores more in a few other places.
>Nick: DMOQRSU N11 MODS +38 346
#note Worst play of the game. Somehow I miss QUOD 12A. Bad board vision. Figure I'll keep qu and score well. Quite a few better plays here though.
>Opponent: AFGIIIR 12C IF +22 227
>Nick: LMOQRRU 10F QU.LM +42 388
#note Bailed out by the A. Best
>Opponent: ?AEGIIR 11E AI +15 242
#note Opponent clearly does not know 8s well. these are all top 1000.
>Nick: ADIJORR 12J JAR +33 421
#note Best
>Opponent: ?EGIIRY O10 GYRE +22 264
#note Need I expound upon the importance of knowing your 8s. He now has to wait another turn to bingo! Leaving II is definitely not the right way to do that
>Nick: ADIORTV 3M V.. +26 447
#note Praying for a T for Traditor 5E 2x2. Somehow it is also best
>Opponent: ?DIINOV C11 V.. +6 270
>Nick: ADIORTT 5E TRADITO. +86 533
#note Life is good sometimes. I must have done something right this week.
>Opponent: ?DIILNO E1 DILu.ION +58 328
#note Finds one of two. DILa(T)ION also goes.
>Nick: AAAFITU F2 FA +28 561
#note eh didnt even really debate changing, and didn't see AF(O)U(L) 6J. Thought I'd block the potential 3x3 and score a bit.
>Opponent: AACHHSU 3B CHA..H +36 364
#note Great play, but misses HA(LA)CHA. I remember seeing it in the very beginning of the 7 alphagrams (AAACHHL), but personally would not have found it.
>Nick: AAEITUW 8A TWAI. +27 588
#note going for points now - trying to break my personal high of 608.
>Opponent: AELNPSU 1A PLEA. +27 391
>Nick: AEEGUU 14A AGEE +23 611
#note the only play that gets me over 608!
>Opponent: NSU H1 NUS +24 415
#note Whew, what a game!

>Opponent:  (UU) +4 419
