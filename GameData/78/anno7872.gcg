#note This is best, oddly.

#note Best; no need to play JADE given she spend an S so easily.

#note Funny story: I always get this alphagram wrong.  Even in game play now.  :)  Well, at least never again.  It's OPULENCE!
>Liz_Gottlin: EHLT M9 H.TEL +24 171
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGHIRR 5A GERAH +28 203
#note Right idea, BUT 12D G(E)RAH 35 making SALVOR (which I didn't know) is best.  Else, HAIR D12 31.  'cause this loses the E, it's further down.
>Liz_Gottlin: ACDOT B1 COAT.D +26 197
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIIORR 1A I.IER +24 227
#note Best.  Happy I could play this instead of GORIER.

#note Ruh-oh...
>Ryan_Fischer: AABFIOR D12 OBIA +25 291
#note The best play according to Q static is 12D A(E)ROBIA (again, didn't know SALVOR).  As it is, with her fishing and there 6 spots for her to bingo, I can't do much to stop it.  I guess closing those lanes wouldn't do much either.  Should've left 'em for myself in hopes I could bingo back, but with this rack, I didn't see myself hitting anything for at least another turn.  OBIA static IS 2nd.  Small consolation.
>Liz_Gottlin: AEIMNST J8 ETAMINS +80 313
#note INMATES B8 is 6 more, opening the 3WS, though.
>Ryan_Fischer: AFRRSTW H1 ARR.W +24 315
#note I really didn't like WAFT, opening the 3WS for her.  I'd just lose those points.  Decided to give a couple up and outscore her in the endgame, maybe open a lane and hit something else of my own.  WART is another option in that same place, especially with 2 Rs unseen.  But no.
>Liz_Gottlin: DEGIIR 2H .IDGIER +26 339
#note This was a really brave move, emptying the bag.  I don't know that I'd make it.  But the bag doesn't look too ugly.  Kills the new line, prevents me from fishing anymore.
>Ryan_Fischer: FINPSTY M1 F.NS +27 342
#note Ooh!  FIN(N)Y 13G 16 sets up P(I)TS!  Does it win?  No, it still loses by 8 with perfect play (TOR(I)ES for Liz, then HOTELS/PST for me).  I played the phony hook here to try to eke some more points out, then I have GAWKY/YIP or JOY/YIP if she doesn't block.  Else, I can just go out with TIP(S)Y.
>Liz_Gottlin: EOORST C10 TORO +21 360
#note Apparently there are a lot more plays than I thought that win for Liz.  TORO is one of them.  Champ says OSE 14L or OOT(ID)S 14A is best.
