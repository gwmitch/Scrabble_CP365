>Liz_Gottlin: AEFK 8G FAKE +22 22
>Ryan_Fischer: CDHIORW K5 WHID +35 35
#note I played WHID 'cause DHOW isn't defensive enough.
>Liz_Gottlin: GG J8 .GG +9 31
>Ryan_Fischer: CIINORV 7D COVIN +19 54
#note J2 VINO 20?
>Liz_Gottlin: ACEM D4 MEC.A +24 55
>Ryan_Fischer: EEILNOR E2 NOEL +16 70
#note About a minute into Liz's next turn I realized I missed ELOI(G)NER for 61.  I hate that word.  Didn't even realize I had a 7 on my rack either.  Oops.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?AIOPST 2B mAI.TOPS +72 216
#note 2A SATI(N)POd 80.  Played mAI(N)TOPS to try to win the best BMPT word prize (using 3 of those letters) no one had qualified for yet.
>Liz_Gottlin: TT C1 T.T +6 84
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAELOX H1 A.EX +63 279
#note 1L OXALAtE 94?  Nah.
>Liz_Gottlin: EHT 1A TE.H +43 127
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADFLOR N1 ALFReDO +90 369
#note This is "best" but poor defensively.  I'd pay for getting greedy.  Of note: (A)ARDwOLF 1H 85!  FORELADY, FREELOAD, FALDEROL, FORELAND.
>Liz_Gottlin: IQU 1L QU.I +69 196
>Ryan_Fischer: AENRTTY M6 .NTREATY +79 448
#note Crazy.
>Liz_Gottlin: GIPSY O7 GIPSY +37 233
#note 14B G(R)IPY 38
>Ryan_Fischer: BJLOOUV 8A JU.. +39 487
#note With so many tiles left, I thought 600 might be possible, but this rack sort of slowed me down (or really, I guess the next one did).  JU(BA) is best, but prospects don't look so good.
>Liz_Gottlin: AM N9 AM +26 259
>Ryan_Fischer: BELNOOV 10B V..EO +19 506
#note G1 L(O)BO 27
>Liz_Gottlin: EILOOSW 12F WOOLIES. +74 333
#note Really cost myself some spread here allowing this and QUAI.  Gotta be more careful.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABELNOS G1 L.BE +27 533
#note 9H BA(G)S 32.  I should block D(O)ZER though.  I can't believe I forgot LOBO.  LENS accomplishes the need to block D(O)ZER.
>Liz_Gottlin: ADEIRRZ H11 D.ZER +45 378
