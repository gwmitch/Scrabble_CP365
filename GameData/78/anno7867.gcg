#note He says he got confused 'cause I exposed a G earlier and thought it was only spelled with the G.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAACEEI F6 AE.IA +11 41
#note Crazy racks I'm getting here.  This is 2nd to ACA(C)IA for 18.
>Vince_Castellano: EIMNRTT E8 .NTERMIT +74 74
>Vince_Castellano: EIMNRTT --  -74 0
#note Lucky I caught that.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEILOP 10F .LOPECIA +64 105
#note Although, I did pass up POE(T)ICAL.  I think this is the best placement, as it forces him to expose the end of the word to the 2WS.  I hope I draw an S.
>Vince_Castellano: EIMNRTT L4 INTERM.T +72 72
#note Of note, INTERMAT/MARTINET, which I guess he didn't know (or he may have played them earlier -- though that would have required him to notice NI*).
>Ryan_Fischer: EFORRST J4 FOREST.R +75 180
#note Forgot FOSTERER.  Oops.  Also, REFRONTS.  I saw FROSTIER.  Just glad I had the confidence to play this.  At least it obscures the hook somewhat.
>Vince_Castellano: EW K5 WE +25 97
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEFIJX M6 EX +38 218
#note I don't like I1 FIXED 37.  7I F(E)D(E)X 44 is a winner!  This is a close 3rd.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEFIJOW D2 JOWE. +32 276
#note I doubted JOW(L)ED, but I think JOWE(D) is a bit better anyway.  F(E)D(EX) is there again!
>Vince_Castellano: EHNY 3C H.NEY +30 157
>Ryan_Fischer: DFIIOSU 2B FU.I +35 311
#note Figured the points were worth the tradeoff and his play made mine score more.  Love it when that happens!
>Vince_Castellano: ?EEILMN 1E hEMLINE +76 233
#note Meh.  Nice find.  Only better is LInEMEN.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADINOST 1A NOD +24 335
#note Q actually recommends OD there instead of TOD or NOD!
>Vince_Castellano: AY 5C Y.A +22 255
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AIPRST N8 PASTIeR +85 420
#note At this tourney, there was a prize for best word using three of BMPT.  That in mind, I shoulda played mISPART.  Oops.  :)
>Vince_Castellano: ABDEEIT 13E EDITAB.E +63 318
>Ryan_Fischer: BDGNOTZ 12M B.Z +24 444
#note Don't see what's so bad about this.  Plays at 2K rank higher... I guess to obscure that part of the board?  But why open another easier 3WS?
>Vince_Castellano: AO H13 .AO +9 327
>Ryan_Fischer: DGGNOOT 9N .G +3 447
#note I see DOGGO.  Would rather take out the hotspot.  (A)G great restricts the damage he can do there (notably VULGAR).
>Vince_Castellano: AL O7 LA. +24 351
>Ryan_Fischer: DGGNOOT 12A DOGGO +22 469
#note Pulling the other G was fortunate, I guess.
