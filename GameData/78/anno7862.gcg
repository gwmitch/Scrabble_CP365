>Steve: AJP D4 JA.P +26 58
#note I'm not sure whether this or 14F JAPE is better... this is three fewer points and gives up an S-hook, but JAPE could get really ugly with words ending O-(numerous consonants)-A/E/I-D on row 15, as it would add 23 points to those scores. Considering he probably had the S in store at this point, I think JAUP is best. There are no S's on the board, so from his standpoint I could easily have one, too, but if he can't do anything on the triple, it's probably best to open up another big spot.
>Bill: ?AEEHNO 15B ENHAlOE. +95 173
#note If he plays JAPE, I still have this or ENHALOEs as a double-double for 90.

#note ORATOR leaves the preferable INS, but ORATION is best because there are literally a billion unseen (unseeing?) I's.

#note This is really bad. For some reason I was blind to 14H bingos (RESTRIKE, REEKIEST, PERKIEST), only seeing the O and U to play through. I saw MURKIEST but decided this was better (BURKITES, REITBOKS, INSTROKE also available through the O or U). I also wasn't sure about KIRNS. Finally, I didn't make any of the superior plays on row 8 (KENT, KINE, SKINT, KINS) because I initially counted this as 53 (I think I somehow counted M9 as a TLS in the main word and a DLS in KI) and had to be corrected after I hit the clock. I blame the guy who brought in one of the new boards with the different colors; it was messing with my head throughout that game, and I made this and a couple other counting mistakes in the two games I played afterwards.
>Steve: DEOR O6 DOER +34 305
>Bill: ?ACIMQT 3L QAT +41 356
#note F6 UMIAQ is a possibility, but I think it actually decreases my odds of bingoing while increasing his if he has the last S. QAT gives back more points to non-bingos using the S, but given the pool it shouldn't be that bad. The only big tile that could go on O4 is the Y, and the only play I saw with it was EASY (it turns out that is the only one... it helps that all the O's are gone). QAT and UMIAQ sim pretty evenly.
>Steve: BGIN K11 B.ING +26 331
>Bill: ?CFIMNS O1 FISC +49 405
#note Three straight turns of 40+ while saving a blank. I'll take that.
>Steve: EW 4D .EW +13 344
>Bill: ?DIILMN J5 ..I +6 411
#note I put down MINt(JEW)LI(P) here before realizing it disobeyed the Scrabble Square Exclusion Principle. I saw the possibility of UNMAILED if I drew an A or E, so I tried for that. UNMILLED and UNFILMED were also possible with the E, but I didn't notice those. I figured he wouldn't block the spot simply out of spite.
>Steve: AEIRTTY 15K .AYER +30 374
#note Actual rack. F10 TETRYL or F12 ARYL, so it turns out it was possible to non-spitefully block F6 bingos.
>Bill: ?DILMNR E3 R.I.e +21 432
#note Obviously dumb; I just felt like using the spot. To be honest, I actually didn't see the C7 spot for the M, so this is especially bad.
>Steve: EITT 7D ..TI. +12 386
>Bill: DLMN A7 M.D +10 442
>Steve: ET 10A ET +11 397
#note Pretty high-scoring game when you consider that we had to work through the U's, O's, and then I's almost completely in turn (all U's were played before an I or O was played, only one I had been played by the time 7/8 O's were played).
