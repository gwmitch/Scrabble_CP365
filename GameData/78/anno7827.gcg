#note i didnt spend too long looking, tho did find PADRONE that scored more but didnt like putting the E at A10.   i actually like PERNODs at a4 best in retrospect.

#note i played this endgame terribly. you may want to stop watching here. - i notice that without solid 4s and 5s knowledge in CSW i often screw up endgames.  i should have played WEB at 14a giving me RABIC as an out.
