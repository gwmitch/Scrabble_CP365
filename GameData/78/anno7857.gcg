>Jim_Burlant: BEIIORU 9C OURIE +13 13
#note I didn't like this a whole lot but didn't see a need to exchange if I could turn 5 tiles.  Best play per quackle is exchanging 5, keeping ER.
>Wally_Schultz: BOR 8A ORB +19 49
>Jim_Burlant: ABILTXY E8 B.AXY +34 47
#note Or C8 BOXILY.
>Wally_Schultz: CENO 12A CONE. +26 75
>Jim_Burlant: AEIKLLT A10 TA.KLE +36 83
#note Slight mistake - TICKLE is roughly 4 points better.  I couldn't think of it.
>Wally_Schultz: Q H7 Q. +11 86
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACIIJL B6 JA. +26 109
#note And if I played TICKLE like I should have on the previous turn, I'd be able to play AJAR and not give him the easy front hook.    This is best, nothing else worth consideration.
>Wally_Schultz: EU 6B .EU +10 96
>Jim_Burlant: ?CIILOW I6 WI. +28 137
#note Best.
>Wally_Schultz: ?EGLOST J1 LEGaTOS +80 176
#note All the J1 bingos score 80, and this is Wally's best bingo.  He's winning 63%...but not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: ?CILOPT 2H PO.TICaL +72 209
#note OTOH, while I get some style points for this, there are several better choices, none of which I could find.  15A EPICOTyL (which I didn't know) scores 92.  4H PL(a)TOnIC socres 82, and 4H CO(a)LPITs scores 76.  Nonetheless I'm winning 60%.
>Wally_Schultz: GMU O1 G.UM +30 206
>Jim_Burlant: DEEHHPS L1 H.DE +24 233
#note 10D HADE scores 30.  Interesting result - I needed to be more attentive to my rack vis-a-vis the board.  I missed the chance for a good setup by playing HIED L1 to allow myself something starting with CH on the next turn.
>Wally_Schultz: ANV K4 VAN +27 233
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHOPS H1 O.AH +39 272
#note Best.  When I saw my next rack I thought this game was about to be mine.  But Wally had other ideas.
>Wally_Schultz: DDEEIMN 10G DENIMED +70 303
#note Ouch.  And now I'm in trouble...
>Jim_Burlant: AEELNPS H10 .LAPSE +27 299
#note My old gotcha, word knowledge, does me in.  He not only scored huge but simultaneously took out both places where I could play SPELEAN.  I saw DEPLANES (which doesn't play) but didn't know SPALDEEN, which would have played at M6 for 80, and wins 74%.  My best non-bingo option is 9I ELAN, which I didn't see.  I didn't like this (neither does QUACKLE) but I figured my best shot was to open some more lines and hope to hit something.  Drawing 5 to NE from this pool isn't the worst thing I can do given this pool if I don't know the bingo.
>Wally_Schultz: OY G3 YO +23 326
#note Play scored incorrectly as 25.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINRV C3 RAV. +14 313
#note The only 8's in this rack are VALERIAN and VARIANCE, which don't play.  I thought I still had a good shot at an 8 with this pool and didn't see the need to turn tiles and score.  Q prefers SAVARIN 14H 36.   Given that the pool at 3 R's I wasn't concerned about playing off my R.  And I was rewarded on the next turn...sort of.
>Wally_Schultz: ADEINTT 12H .TTAINED +72 398
#note If I find SPALDEEN a couple of turns back, what does he do with this?  I was a little surprised Wally took the risk with this play, but the extra points tempted him.  He told me the game he saw INSTATED and wasn't sure which was better.
>Jim_Burlant: AEINNRT O10 IN.ENT +21 334
#note Throwing in the towel.  I know there is no way on earth any of my lines are going to stay open next turn, so I might as well keep the spread from ballooning.
>Wally_Schultz: FGIRU 15C FIGUR. +11 409
#note And if I'd left the triple line open, he'd have taken it out with DRUG.
>Jim_Burlant: AEORRSS D2 RES +12 346
