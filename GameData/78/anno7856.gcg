>Jim_Burlant: IIOQUWY 9I YOW +22 22
#note My thinking here was that, if I overlapped by playing at 9F, he'd overlap on row 7 and I'd probably have nowhere to play my Q on the next turn.  As for why this placement over row 7?  Thelogic I used at the time was that he needed one of 5 unseen O's and 9 unseen A's to overlap the W.  If I played on row 7, he needed one of 5 unseen O's and 12 unseen E's - 3 more chances to hook if I played on row 7.  Flimsy logic perhaps, but also - row 7 placement could give him 50+ if he has the J.  
>Winter: IJNOT 7I JOINT +42 50
>Jim_Burlant: IIILQTU M3 QUIL. +28 50
#note Not sure I agree with Quackle here.  I put down L4 QUINT (the sim winner) but changed to this.  While there's a big S hook available already with JOINT, I didn't want to add another one; if he S hooks JOINT it gives me something at one of the triples; if he front hooks QUINT, it potentially gives me nothing back.
>Winter: GHO 10J HOG +33 83
>Jim_Burlant: EEFIITT N2 FIT +25 75
#note Hated this play but couldn't think of GIFTEE L10, which would have been better for turning the rack.  Sim prefers GIFTEE by not quite 3 points.
>Winter: ADEIU O4 ADIEU +25 108
#note Well, that could have been a whole lot worse.
>Jim_Burlant: EEINOTT 11K TOE +21 96
#note Kept getting the math wrong with the 11I placement and unexplicably kept coming up with 18 points.  11I placement is definitely better than this, which is the runner up by 4 or 5 points - too volatile.
>Winter: AEEEMPR G5 PRE.AME +14 122
#note Winter told me his rack after the game and he admitted he had no idea what to do here, so he felt he'd try to turn some and tiles and maybe land a blank.   Plus, he knew the S hook and maybe I didn't?  Sim says his best play is to fish off an E with YOWE/EGO.
>Jim_Burlant: EIINRTU H1 UNTIE +22 118
#note Sim prefers H10 UNITER for 27.  I didn't look hard enough to find it.  This is where the game really gets going.  I have a really good draw on my 5-tile pick.  Unfortunately for me, Winter has an even better draw and he punishes me big-time for my mistake on the TOE play.
>Winter: ACERSSV N9 SCARVES +90 212
#note And if I make either of the right plays on my TOE play or my last turn, does he find CREVASSE?  We'll never know.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIPRRZ 5D ZIP..R +38 156
#note Saw the obvious PRIZERS on row 15, but I couldn't remember - had I lost a turn challenging PRIZERS when someone else played it? Or had I played it and had it challenged off?  PRIZERS is definitely best if I know it, but this was a compromise play, taking a sure 38 and keeping AER.  At any rate, this was the first play in a nice sequence that got me back into the game.  I'm winning 12% with this play.
>Winter: ESTW J2 WETS +35 247
>Jim_Burlant: ACDELRU E2 AUR.CLED +61 217
#note The only bingo and it wins 20%.
>Winter: EELN 15K LEN.E +18 265
>Jim_Burlant: ABBDNOV 8A ABOV. +42 259
#note Clearly best but my winning chances aren't improving, probably because both those blanks are unseen.
>Winter: INR 9A RIN +13 278
>Jim_Burlant: ?BDGMNX 2D M.X +28 287
#note Wasn't sure about giving him the invitation to a 1A play, but this is best.  I need to turn the extra tile to give myself a shot at a vowel, and burning the blank for 49 didn't seem right.  The sim agrees, and I'm now winning 47%.
>Winter: ADLRY H11 LARDY +32 310
>Jim_Burlant: ?BDGHKN C7 H..KiNG +36 323
#note Being slammed with all these consonants, I wanted to take the bag down to one.  I figured that, having just drawn 5 from this pool, Winter had probably landed a pretty hideous rack.  I thought that  if I built enough of a lead and he had landed AAIIE or something equally hideous, I could score enough with my remaining consonants garbage to hold on.  I hated burning the blank, but this rack didn't give me much choice.  While I was right to burn the blank, this was the wrong play.  I couldn't think of aNKH, which scores 53 at 1A.  But given his next rack, it wouldn't have mattered. 
>Winter: ?AEFNST 13E ENg.AFTS +61 371
>Jim_Burlant: AABDIIO F11 BI.DI +17 340
#note 12 BANDA scores 24. 1A OBIA 26. This play Incorrectly scored as 19.  Final score recorded as 385 - 342.
