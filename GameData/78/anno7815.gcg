#note very odd. I misscored this play by 4 when I was counting it up and neither of us caught it. I'd like to think I would've done something else if I'd realized it wasn't many points. HOD wins the sim.

#note I think he should've played on the right side of the board if possible. the comebacks over there are likely to be pretty big.

#note the key play. I thought that his last couple of plays indicated that he had the Q (he could be setting up a QUIN or QUIP play here) and I thought I would beat him on tempo if that was the case as long as he can't play QUAKE. quackle suggests a couple of reasonable plays that do slightly better like KORE or KNOT which both leave me huge Q plays if I draw the Q, although I have a hard time seeing how he wouldn't just play at D1.

quackle suggests that I'm actually a favorite here even without any inferences.
