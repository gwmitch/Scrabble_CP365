>Ryan_Fischer: AIIMNOP 8D PIANO +20 20
>Matthew_Bernardina: EFIJLNN E7 J.NNI +24 24
#note Q says 9C JINN 27.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIMOTUY D8 .OUTY +26 46
#note Almost didn't see this.  Saw MOTEY and MOIETY, and then PIETY, and finally was able to put this together.  Best.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AEEFLMT 9G EF +14 38
#note Q likes this (2nd).  C9 is 2 points better.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIMOSU C12 MEOU +19 65
#note I was feeling bold.  This is definitely better than Q's first choice of its anagram, MOUE.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AEKLMTT 15A AL.M +27 65
#note 14B T(O)TEM 26, 15A AM(U)LET, F11 TALK, 15A MA(U)T, and three more.  This scores most, but it's important to undouble the T.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEEISU 6E DIsEUSE +75 140
#note Best.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EKLNOTT H1 KETTL. +33 98
#note Q says KETON(E) H1 33 is 2.1 points better.  I don't know.  I'd take NO over LT any day.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEISWX 5K WAX +36 176
>Matthew_Bernardina: DENORSW 2H .NDOWERS +82 180
#note Q approves.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEHIOSU 1M HOE +31 207
#note I chose the wrong spot, in hindsight.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ABIRRRZ 4L ZA +53 233
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILRSU 4C URALI.ES +66 273
>Matthew_Bernardina: BIIRRRV 7K BRR +14 247
#note B2 BIRR 21, or B1 BIRR 21 (a bit more defensive).
>Ryan_Fischer: AGINRSV C3 G.V +14 287
#note Doubted RAVINGS.  In two places no less.  Oops.  Bad play, even if I didn't know the bingo.  B2 VIRGA 31, B2 VAR 21.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACEGIIV L7 .IVAGE +22 269
#note Best.
>Ryan_Fischer: AINORST 13F RATIONS +70 357
#note Best.
>Matthew_Bernardina: DDIINRT H11 NI.ID +21 290
#note I blocked NITRID(E)D, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIOPT J10 CAP.TE +18 375
#note Some draw I got, pulling ECTOPIA outta the bag.  Q suggests different sorts of fishes.  I want to lock this up.  So, I'm playing through the O to take out that column and the bottom row.  Worry about the R hook and the bingos ending in A or (hah) K later.  I didn't want to play PE or PA (essentially doing the same thing) because there's an off chance that he'd get a Q play like EQUAL.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ?CDFORT 10L .RF +14 304
#note Q suggests FO(UN)D for 21.  I guess he needs to set up that lane and pray.  Keeping the C might miraculously help him find his way to a bingo ending in K.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEGILO F11 LA.GE +13 388
#note Champ I think wants to just fish off one til, the O, at 15H.  I keep the A and I for the Q (not that the A matters if I don't draw two tiles).  I played LA(R)GE to try to Q-stick Matt, as if I draw the Q I can't play it anyway unless I draw the T (or blank) as well, and there's such a low probability of that happening (especially 'cause he just set up the ARFS hook).
>Matthew_Bernardina: ?BCDOTY O7 COBs +27 331
#note 15J (E)mBODY 42 static.  Champ approves of Matt's play of COBs.
>Ryan_Fischer: EHIOQ 1J OH +13 401
#note Champ says 1G O(K)E 9.  I guess 'cause then I can play HI/HOKE and then dump the Q?  Following that path, that is indeed what Q has in mind, though there aren't enough turns for it.  Champ would play D(ON) then block my QI play with (T)A or simply go out with TY(E).
>Matthew_Bernardina: DTY 5K ...Y +17 348
