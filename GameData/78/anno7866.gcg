>Ryan_Fischer: EEHOOSS 8H OHO +12 12
#note So many choices.  I saw SHOO and SHOE, settled on OHO, although it might've been a bit redundant.  Better defensively anyway.
>Rahn_McKeown: HNU 7H HUN +20 20
>Ryan_Fischer: EELNOSS K3 ENOLS +17 29
#note Q says OLES, which puts an O in an inopportune place.  Happy with this.  COAX woulda been worse.
>Rahn_McKeown: ACOX L1 COXA +45 65
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAEMQS 3K ..AM +26 55
#note 9B SQuAMAE 84.  Time to review power Qs.  (EX)AM is second best, as I thought.
>Rahn_McKeown: ALW 1L .LAW +27 92
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADENQS -Q +0 55
#note Q suggests QAt or (M)ANQuE for 36 before the exchange.  Nah.
>Rahn_McKeown: MY 4N MY +17 109
#note Kill the S when I fished.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADENSU 6B ASUNDEr +68 123
#note There's the U when I needed it!  I'd be inundated with Us and Ns this tourney.  And Ts.
>Rahn_McKeown: BDEIP C1 BIPED. +22 131
>Ryan_Fischer: CDKNSTU 2B D.CK +22 145
#note I wasn't sure YUCK is a verb.  D(I)CK sort of kills the triple.  (B)UNDTS is another option, as is DUCK 9J keeping NST.
>Rahn_McKeown: AOZ 4A ZO.A +46 177
#note Hindsight, shoulda played D(E)CK.  Aw.
>Ryan_Fischer: INNRSTU 9B INTURNS +65 210
>Rahn_McKeown: AEFT 10B FEAT +34 211
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEELO E4 EO. +20 230
#note A(K)EE E1 22, but it opens the 3WS.
>Rahn_McKeown: EEIRY 11E EYRIE +22 233
#note I think he passed up EYE/DICKY because he had an abundance of vowels and wanted to get rid of one more and kill that line.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEGLR 12I REGALEd +66 296
#note 12G EnLARGE 69
>Rahn_McKeown: AIIO M9 AIO.I +12 245
>Ryan_Fischer: GLNPQTW 9L Q.T +12 308
#note Tons of exchanges.  Q(A)T doesn't even rank.  I just wanna get this over, obscure the 3x3.
>Rahn_McKeown: IIIOU -IIIOU +0 245
>Ryan_Fischer: GILNPVW L11 W.P +17 325
#note Push the S-hook back a little bit.
>Rahn_McKeown: DERV C9 ..RVED +20 265
#note That actually helps a bit...
>Ryan_Fischer: GIILNTV 13G VIG +19 344
#note 5I VI(O)L 21.  My play, which I thought closes down the board, actually creates a dangerous situation.  It makes it possible for Rahn to create a hard-to-block setup I did not foresee.  I guess it's a matter of getting used to looking for those possibilities and not opening up any more triples than necessary in the pre-endgame.
>Rahn_McKeown: F H13 .F +5 270
#note Uhoh...
>Ryan_Fischer: ILNORTT D13 LOT +9 353
#note I had to assume he had the J or a bingo rack, and just hope to obscure the J or any other powerful play there as much as possible.
>Rahn_McKeown: BE O12 .EB +4 274
#note Pretty great play as it blocks (d)JIN and sets up his S in two places.  If it weren't for my having JI(B), he'd win.  I didn't expect to pull the J.
>Ryan_Fischer: IIJNRTU 1A JI. +39 392
#note I totally missed JUT for 45, though, which would've totally blocked his bingo.  Oops!
>Rahn_McKeown: AEGIRST 15H STAGIER +95 369
>Rahn_McKeown:  (IUNRT) +10 379
