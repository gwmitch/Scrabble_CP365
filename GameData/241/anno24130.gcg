#note was not totally sure on KAHUNA, but i woulda tried it anyway until i saw that HAKU was probably on par, and it scores more.

#note the equity play here is AGONE. i should be able to find it, but i wasn't looking for an equity play for some reason. i wanted to try to block the high scoring spots i created at the bottom (i don't know, it seemed easy for her to drop ape or fade or somethng of the sort) and at the same time open a lane for a 7. the other equity play is J2 AGEE, and i could not stomach OOS -- but it's about the same as EEOS, and i get 7 more points. this type of move is really really difficult for me. -6

#note i guess i should play SIZE. i need to be better at making the equity plays. it's fairly close but eh. i wanted to be aggressive maybe. -5.5  ... also i didn't see F12 TIZ..

#note i saw FIRMS but it blocks the board after giving her first dibs at a significant scoring spot. there are only two Es left though so maybe it's ok. but after FIRMS she can try blocking at the bottom left and then gg basically. totally hated my options here.

#note honestly i was pretty much positive that this was a word, and i held her for a long time and decided there's some off chance it hadn't been added for whatever reason, and i have to challenge. oh well. so i didn't have good equity losses ;P
