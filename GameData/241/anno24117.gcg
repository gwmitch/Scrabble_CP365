>Matt: ADHNOPT H4 HONDA +26 26
#note Wondered if I should open with PHT here instead to create a closed board against Mack (which is probably beneficial to me?). Elected to ride the equity instead but it's far closer in a sim than I thought it'd be. 
>Mack: CDIIRTT 4D DITC. +22 22
>Matt: AIMPTXZ 3C ZAX +50 76
#note Oooooohhhhh, MAXI for 40 sets up ZIT plays beautifully. 
>Mack: BINORST 8B SORBIT.N +61 83
>Matt: AAIMPTU 7A PUMA +22 98
#note And I whiff PUTAMINA now, yay
>Mack: ?ALLNOR F4 .ONs.LLAR +62 145
#note Missed BANkROLL, but I probably would have played this anyway since it's safer and might draw a challenge.
>Matt: AEIITTV 11B VITI.TE +20 118
#note Unsure what to do here. Saw right after I hit the clock that A(XI)TE scores 10 points better and holds a T with just 2/63 unseen Ts, but I also hold IITV and don't know how often I hit a decent play on top. VITIATE holds the board open longer-term, I think. Q sim likes AXITE. 
>Mack: EEORTUY 12F .EROUTE +21 166
#note Felt this game back less than TUYERE in the same spot, and I don't mind keeping the Y for scoring when I'm ahead
>Matt: ?AAEFGU B11 .AGUE +18 136
#note A strange play at first glance, but I felt confident about it: 

-Without an opening this turn, Mack can quickly start closing me in. 
-Holding FA? seems like I can draw some cool stuff along A12 sometimes (although it gets blocked a LOT) and can sometimes even hit 3x3s. 
-The bottom left of this board is going to require a large sacrifice in score to open, so I'd might as well do it with this rack since I won't be scoring well anyway. 

>Mack: EOPSSUY 15A S.EPY +39 205
>Matt: ?ABEFST M7 FABbEST +94 230
>Mack: EINORSU L1 URINOSE +71 276
#note Clearly safer than N1, and wanted to block the 8L spot, hence not J3.
>Matt: DEGILWY K5 WEDGY +45 275
>Mack: AIIKORV 2J KO.AI +38 314
>Matt: AHILNOO N5 OHIA +25 300
#note I'd love to play OOH somewhere but none of the spots really make sense. I liked setting up possibilities with AAL next turn, but my odds seem pretty unfavorable at this point. 
>Mack: EEIJMRV 6B JEE +60 374
>Matt: CELNNOW 12A W.NE +28 328
#note The only thing I can really see that makes sense is that maybe I can pull LIMACON and dodge QI/QI 1N or something? I think I'm mostly dead in this game.
