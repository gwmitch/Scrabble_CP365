>Ted_Blevins: MNO 8G MON +10 10
>Joshua_Sokol: AJLLOPV 7F JALOP +26 26
#note best to sacrifice a point to keep things more closed here, especially after a short play. 
>Ted_Blevins: ENRT 9H TERN +12 22
>Joshua_Sokol: AAHLOSV K2 HALVAS +39 65
#note It was an interesting choice between this and 8K OVALS. He still seemed like he was trying to bingo (he might have kept REN or something like that), so giving him a huge bingo spot at O1 seemed unattractive. I had unfortunately missed (TERN)E for some reason, so this was less defensive than I thought. Still seems better than OVALS, though.
>Ted_Blevins: IX L1 XI +22 44
#note interesting to have sacrificed 9 points here over L3 XI. A very fishy play, but a sensible sacrifice for some. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHIORY 4H HOY.E +30 95
#note I think this was my leave. But if it was I had 4F HOARI(L)Y, and I don't think I would have missed that. 
>Ted_Blevins: ?AEFNRT 5C FAiNTER +75 119
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIOORZ 4D ZOO +49 144
#note still not sure of my leave, but confident I made the right play here.
>Ted_Blevins: EWY L8 YEW +18 137
#note felt stupid to have missed TERNE at this point.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIIRU 10D URAEI +11 155
#note I forgot all of my leaves this game. I knew that it was either between trying to hold on on a closed board with no way to score, or blowing it open with K9 (N)AIRU. I thought I could hold on. Maybe I was wrong. 
>Ted_Blevins: GINTW E9 W.ING +18 155
#note first laid down 6A TWIG, realized FI*, and then played this. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEIIRT D1 BAI.. +19 174
>Ted_Blevins: AIQTU 12A QUAI.T +50 205
>Joshua_Sokol: EFIRSST 14E SIFTERS +74 248
#note Unbelievable miss of FIBSTERS, which I even looked for, or maybe I just looked at the A in BAIZE. This is a huge blunder.
>Ted_Blevins: BNOR B10 BO.RN +26 231
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIIORU 1A ORI.I +21 269
#note Same type of decision now with URAEI earlier. Do I open the board fearlessly here with 15K OURIE or try to outplay Ted on a closed board with a close score? I think this time I made the wrong choice, since ORI(B)I loses most of the time when Ted has a blank, as there will be multiple spots to bingo no matter what. Hmm...
>Ted_Blevins: DNOPU 13I POUND +33 264
#note not good
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGLTU 15J TEGULA +33 302
#note Incredibly, Ted challenged this word, which allowed me to take a sizable lead. With the rack he had, he probably would have been able to outrun me.
>Ted_Blevins: ?ACK -  +0 264
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEEELS 15A DEED +32 334
#note I think this is correct. Other plays have more defensive merits, but with Ted's challenge, he isn't really going anywhere it seems.
>Ted_Blevins: ACK 8L .ACK +39 303
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGILST 6A GEES +29 363
#note I can do this first, or I can do LIT(HE) H1 first, or LET(HE)+ GIES. Makes no difference. Spent some time trying to figure out a good endgame that included blocking Ted's huge play next turn, but nothing came close. M2 TES is the best play that blocks 2J, but it's 9 points worse than just taking the points.
>Ted_Blevins: ?CDEMV 2J C..MED +40 343
#note I also hoped he would try C(HI)VED* for more, which I would have challenged confidently, even though losing a turn would mean losing this game. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ILT H1 LIT.. +24 387
>Joshua_Sokol:  (V?) +8 395
