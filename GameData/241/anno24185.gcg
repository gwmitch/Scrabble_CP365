#note CIRE is better.  For some reason I wasn't sure it was good without the S.  I think I was mixing it up with VIRES.
>Andy_Hoang: ?AACINZ L8 ZIN +25 114
#note G8 CZArINA  I wish he played it since VERISMO would have scored more.  Instead, he blocked my spot for VERISMO.

#note I guess I can see why Quackle prefers 13A FEES, but I'm not sure I understand 13B FESSED.  I guess because it blocks the bingo lane to UNAU.  But any bingo there opens the TWS, and I'd think keeping the S is valuable for the flexibility.

#note F8  F(R)AGGED is much better.  It blocks 5 lanes.

>David_Turissini: EEGSTUX F8 G.UE +7 301
#note Not good.  I was trying to block lanes, but should have scored more points.  I looked at 14G TUXES but was worried about a large score to the TWS.  K4  GUS(T) is nice because it leaves a single lane, making it likely I can outrun him even if he bingos. 
>Andy_Hoang: ?ADEILR 14E REDIALs +65 273
>David_Turissini: AEKSTXY 15D TEXAS +59 360
#note I shouldn't have gone for the points.  K4  XYS(T) ensures he can't bingo out, and doesn't empty the bag.  B11 AX(E)S and H12 EX(I)T also score, and give me a high chance of winning even after a bingo.
