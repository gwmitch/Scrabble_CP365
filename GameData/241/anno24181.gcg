#note I forgot FOXING took an S.  The -INGS list is hard to keep straight.  14B iNSECTS is best.

#note Quackle prefers a host of LZ plays.  It's top choice B12 ZEAL scores, but seems too volatile for me.  I think I should have sacrificed a few points and gone with B12 LEZ or 11I ZEAL(S).  Maybe I overvalued keeping a vowel and discounted the disadvantage of double Ls.

#note Phony.  Ugh.  This didn't look good, but I'm really bad at keeping the -ER words straight.  I should have challenged.

#note Phony.  Not good.  I known the -EE bingos and for some reason, this wasn't even a blip on my phony radar.  I'm not even sure what an ARRIVEE would be, someone that another person arrives at?.

#note Really, really bad.  Besides missing E1 TEGUMIn(A), this doesn't score nearly enough to justify using the blank and losing my flexibility for the rest of the endgame, which he quickly exploits.  Even with missing the bingo, E4 TEGU(A) is the best alternative.  I also blanked on NEEM, and O7 MIG or MEG are also better alternatives.
>Alan_Stern: ACDELPR 10B L.. +12 354
#note This is why I should have kept the blank.
>David_Turissini: DEMT H1 EM +19 406
#note I got the order wrong.  I should make the blockable play first and save the more flexible one for last.  E7 T(A)D.  Oh, and 9G  ME is 5 more points.
