>David_Gibson: AHI 8F AHI +12 12
>JD: AADEIKS 7F KA +19 19
#note KEA sims ahead for its excellent defensive value (EH is basically impossible to overlap), but against Gibson I would rather play a more open board
>David_Gibson: IT 9F TI +17 29
>JD: ADEEILS E1 AEDILES +73 92
>David_Gibson: CEEHNSU 5D E.ENCHUS +76 105
>JD: ABEIINQ 4J NIQAB +36 128
#note a terrible mistake - I saw NIQAAB but placed it mentally at 1B and didn't realize it slotted at 1A for 54!!! This is a whopping 26 point error.
>David_Gibson: CDDER 1D C.RDED +39 144
>JD: EIINNOS O1 INOSINE +92 220
>David_Gibson: LNRT M3 L.RNT +12 156
#note david had 3 more consonants here, he told me later.
>JD: ?BGLTTW 4C TW.T +26 246
>David_Gibson: ELOV 2H LEVO +20 176
>JD: ?BEEFGL 3B FEE. +26 272
#note very vowel-heavy bag, much better off playing ELF says Quackle. However, I figured that David would want to open the board rather than play at 2B, so I think quackle probably underestimates my chances of scoring at 2B myself next turn.
>David_Gibson: ARY 10D RYA +18 194
>JD: ?BGILOR 2A GOB +27 299
#note easy decision to pass up the bingo, I don't care if quackle doesn't agree. no need to open up a colossal lane on an otherwise dead board.

>David_Gibson: EOPRRSV 14C PROVERS +76 338
>JD: ?DIOTTU 15A DUO +16 427
#note at this point I want to maximize spread since I've got the game under control. I chose this DUO instead of DUO at 13B because it will be more costly for him to block (unless he has XU)
>David_Gibson: JMNOUXY 13B NU +14 352
>JD: ?AEITTU 6M .U. +5 432
#note no real point in doing this since david will just block and I don't have any particularly good fish. just ETUI at N7 is Q's choice.
>David_Gibson: EIJMMOY 1K JOY +23 375
>JD: ?AEITTX 12A XI +19 451
#note should block MIME and save a nice out. terrible play on my part under severe time pressure.
#note disappointing end to this game with Gibson - I probably hemorrhaged at least 50 spread points with my choice of pre-endgame and endgame.
