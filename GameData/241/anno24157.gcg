>Joshua_Sokol: ADINSTU -DU +0 0
#note Thought a long while about this play! This seems correct, and after 34000 iterations on a simulation, it leads the pack, 1 point in front of DUI and two points in front of the other option I considered, exchanging just the U. What would you play?
>Morris_Greenberg: FFHU 8G HUFF +26 26
>Joshua_Sokol: ACINNST K8 STANNIC +82 82
#note Between STANNIC and INCANTS, it seemed like STANNIC was better for two reasons. Firstly, because it gave back fewer points to Morris next turn, which is always a huge plus when you are playing a bingo; and secondly, because it shaped the board in such a way that would make it difficult for Morris to open the top right. With INCANTS it seemed slightly easier to open the bottom right, especially with the flow of most words going downwards (H, F, C(HUFF) and U words). But alas, upon further analysis, INCANTS does well for me long-term on an open board, if I wish to take that route. Plays after INCANTS will open up many scoring spots, which in turn allow me to maintain my lead. STANNIC might prompt a phony S-hook, as well, though I doubt Morris would do that unless he is desperate. All in all, I still like my choice, but it isn't so clear-cut.

>Joshua_Sokol: EHLOORS 14H RES.HOOL +80 162
#note With my initial play of J10 HOO blocked, I must now find this bingo. Boy how things are tough on me!
>Morris_Greenberg: ACEEIRT -  +0 41
#note If Morris plays his bingo now, he is winning fewer than one in 6 games
>Joshua_Sokol: ADKNRTV H12 KA.T +39 201
>Morris_Greenberg: ACEEIRT J7 E. +5 46
#note T, P, S and U give Morris a 3x3, which combine to form 12 tiles in the pool. Not too shabby a diversion.
>Joshua_Sokol: DDGINRV O12 GI.D +24 225
#note After that fish though, I am definitely smelling his trap and blocking the 3x3.
>Morris_Greenberg: ACEIRTT F2 ATRETIC +80 126
#note TRACTI(L)E would have hurt bigtime
>Joshua_Sokol: DEINRTV 5C INV.RTED +74 299
>Morris_Greenberg: EGG M7 EGG +14 140
>Joshua_Sokol: BDILOPR 4I BIPOD +27 326
#note Was all set to play BIPOL(A)R and shrink the board long-term, but his play made me want to go for short-term defense. This blocks a lot of stuff, unfortunately not enough. Probably should just play BIPOLAR anyway, there are so many lanes! DROP(T) and DRIP(T) I saw too, but those are unreasonable in this context, in which Morris can only win if he bingos 3 times
>Morris_Greenberg: ?DEIISU D5 .UDItIES +68 208
#note I think Morris said he chose this over U(N)tIDIES because he wanted to keep the top right available for later? I think. That makes sense, but UNTIDIES sets up a T hook that he might be able to hit if he draws the last T, and he is quite desperate for something around that unlikely to happen. But better even than those two plays is 15A DISqUIE(T), which I assume Morris missed. That's a good play!

>Morris_Greenberg: OX 8M .OX +33 241
>Joshua_Sokol: AELNOOR C10 LOANER +18 378
#note This doesn't appear on the list of choices, but it must be correct to block the whole bottom of the board here like this.
>Morris_Greenberg: OTY 15A TO.Y +33 274
>Joshua_Sokol: JORUVWY 14B Y.OW +35 413
#note Once again, preventing Morris from getting multiple bingos is my game-plan here, so blocking that T is perfectly sensible, even though it doesn't leave me with anything useful. I also have a shot at JAIL(S) next turn at J10 in the next couple of turns, so keeping the J wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the URV it goes with
>Morris_Greenberg: EP G14 PE +22 296
#note Yuss, I have now played on a preschool board!
>Joshua_Sokol: IJLRUVZ M11 VIZ.R +40 453
#note That was a timely draw! Jeez
>Morris_Greenberg: LOU 7A LOU. +6 302
>Joshua_Sokol: AAIJLNU A5 JI.L +33 486
#note 3x3s are available, but I can actually outrun them. I simply calculated the worst case 3x3 would outrun me, but nothing that he can have (ENFEEBLE, SERENELY, ENSEMBLE and RESEMBLE) double a high-scoring tile, so I'm safe if I empty the bag with, say, 3L JAIL. Unfortunately, as my first real mistake of the game, I grab the points, instead of playing B6 J(O)IN for less to keep the L for more options through the Q next turn. Keeping the L here is much stronger than the N, which was definitely not something I considered in this position. Also, I must note that J(O)IN blocks more of Morris' bingo options, since that LI at C10 actually turn out to be a decent combination for what remains in the pool. JOIN blocks BE(LI)EVERS, UN(LI)MBERS and RE(LI)CENSE, which make up a decent chunk of his possible racks.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?BEEMNR 2A mEMBR.NE +72 374
#note S in the bag! I had to note here that Morris is a luckbox.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEMNU 1G EMU +29 515
#note And while distracted by Morris' luck, I didn't take the time to properly assess my options here. I only looked for plays above MEMBRANE, not underneath. Had I looked for even 5 seconds, I would have seen that not only is MEE(T) one point better than EMU (I also missed MAE at 1A for 30), but that the sick UNMEE(T) fit as well! And perhaps Morris would have challenged that, but he said he had thought it was good. -12 for the guy that won with a 515. Tsktsk
