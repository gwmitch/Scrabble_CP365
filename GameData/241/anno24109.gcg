#note I did not think DEMENTIA took an L. Goddangit! Studying pays off... not!
>Joey: BEEEPTT 15D PETTE. +36 125
#note Didn't know BETTED for sure.  Pretty minor error, but still.
>Joshua: AANNRTU 14B ANURA +24 200

>Joshua: ACEHNRT 6D .ATCH +23 223
#note This was so freaking paranoid. I instantly regretted this. Thought I could control this board, when obviously I could not. So many ways to score on it too. I need to score myself. J12 NAH or L12 TACH are much better
>Joey: ABDERSW L12 BAWD +34 188
>Joshua: EMNNRRT E5 M.N.R +24 247
#note 11E RE(M)N(A)NT. These mistakes are piling up very high. I even block the X spot.
>Joey: ?ACERSX F8 .AX +57 245
>Joshua: EEIKLNR C3 KEN +24 271
#note Felt hopeless here. I could have won this game like 5 times already.
>Joey: ?CEORSS N4 CROSsES +72 317
#note Those were two pretty good draws.
>Joshua: AEFIJLR J13 EF +28 299
#note no idea. Probably just AJI this turn.
>Joey: ?DDEOOV 15L .OVE +24 341
>Joshua: AIIJLRT 11I .JI +20 319
#note hoping to bingo out with a setup and/or outscore with Joey drawing horrible stuff.
>Joey: ?ADDIOQ 13F QI +24 365
#note Maybe I should play DEF, just to prevent him from playing REF to open something up that I'd have to block weirdly.
>Joshua: AEGILRT 4B R.. +6 325
#note hope the blank is out there and he doesn't have an A. A better version of this is probably M3 TA to go for the blank.
>Joey: ?ADDLOZ 3A DA. +10 375
>Joshua: AEGILTY 11E GY. +35 360
#note hoping he misses EST and I outrun somehow
>Joey: ?DLNOUZ A1 Ze. +36 411
#note LURED 9K is best, threatening OZONE and ZONA.
>Joshua: AEILT B1 AL.. +21 381
#note same as last turn.
>Joey: DLNOU 15A UN +11 422
#note LURED is best again.
>Joshua: EIT O8 TIE +21 402
#note Because I forgot EST was good now.  Yikes, threes.
>Joshua:  (DLO) +8 410
