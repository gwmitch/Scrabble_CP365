#note Almost did HEDGY fishing for GIVEBACK for a million points but when I don't hit it I have so much clunk...Quackle likes it a smidge over KEG anyway.
>Alec: IRRTTU K7 RUTTI.R +19 187
>Will: ?ABHMVW 5I V.W +18 195
#note Close between K3 VAW and 5I VAW for 10 less. The scoring spot after K3 VAW is pretty strong, but at least it's likely to set up a new bingo lane...I'm comfortable with my move, with HEDGY and G11 MABES waiting in reserve to keep the scoring up.

#note OK, first of all, H1 EF is much better than FADGE, which stupidly makes a nice new 7s line. But I think QUAFF is just fine too - that's a bingo score and if Alec doesn't hit something next turn, I'll block and that should be it. There's nowhere else for him to even open new lanes.
