#note I wanted the board to be pretty open against John. I'm willing to take the 5 point equity loss to do that here.

>JD: EIORRTY J10 RYOT +20 52
#note again, I felt that john and his old-school style would lead to a really closed board, hence making an effort to open things up here. YOK does bingo quite a bit more (37% versus 27%), so maybe playing short is justified.

#note funny, I thought of COLUMNAL after the game as a possible 8 with this rack, but never even looked for it during the game. too bad.

#note much better defense to play TILTH, but I just wanted to clean up my rack.

>JD: GIJLTTU 9C JIG +24 379
#note I can't really remember why I played this instead of JIG - maybe getting to play LUTZ if he plays the Z? If I just play JIG at I12 then I might get to draw LUETIC.
