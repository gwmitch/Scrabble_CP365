#note Considered most of the top few plays here and given that all of the lesser scoring plays kept a V or a K and that I can't really play anything that blocks the S hook on ENGRAFTS, I might as well score 18 and turn over 4. CP picks VERTU a hair ahead of YEUK. Sim also likes K4 OUTRAVE...no thanks.

#note Sets my K up pretty well, and it might stay with all the RETINULA stuff possible.

#note I found this move to be tough. Unfortunately, my best block of the QIS spot is VINO, which makes another scoring spot for the S. It's still a decent play given that it scores decently and leaves the K, which will help me score with RETINULA hooking plays a lot. However, I whiffed on L3 NOVA, which beautifully sets up my K. My play blocks basically nothing given all the RETINULA hooks still available and leaves the weak NNO.

#note I played this really fast thinking it must be strong, but Quackle isn't a fan compared to the bingos. I figured i was a lock to bingo with a reasonable draw and that I might be a slight favorite to think of some of the extensions.

#note 3I EAU, blocking JELLO (-6). This play yields the massive HALE in response, so even though I get the J, it performs worse overall.
