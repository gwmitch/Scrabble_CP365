>Matt_Canik: ACIIIOT H4 COATI +20 20
#note Points or exchange? Q prefers exchange. by about 2 points. 
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AELVY G6 LEAVY +23 23
>Matt_Canik: AIINORR 4H .ARRION +18 38
#note IRONI(C) is a slightly better equity play but I think I prefer opening up variance against the 2015 North American Scrabble Champion
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IIUUU -IIUUU +0 23
>Matt_Canik: ?INRRST L2 ST.RRINg +58 96
#note Hell of a draw. Wasn't totally sure of R(ET)IRaNTS =\
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEEGU 8J DE.GUE +24 47
>Matt_Canik: ABEIKLN K7 B.ANLIKE +83 179
#note I'm glad I didn't have to decide if BLANKIES+ was good (but I think I would have played it if I had to). Also BEA(T)NIK is a siiiick play
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEILOPR 2F POLARI.E +68 115
>Matt_Canik: AEHMPST 1G HAME +44 223
#note Was so caught up on deciding if HAMPIEST* was good that I missed the valid bingos SHIPMATE and MATESHIP in that rack because I suck
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADIMOT 3B DIATOM +39 154
>Matt_Canik: ?EEOPST 12G POET.zES +70 293
#note Scrabble is easy when you draw like this but I amazingly miss PETIOLES and can't find a defensive bingo....
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEIOSTZ 13C COZIEST +100 254
#note ...so I completely deserve this
>Matt_Canik: EFGILUU E11 FU.IL +34 327
#note I've got a bingo lead and the best play requires that I open a 3x3.... what's the worst that could happen?
#note (Maybe I should play FU(S)IL for 32 instead?)
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: GNOSUW 15A SUNG.OW +39 293
>Matt_Canik: AEGHNNU 4A HANG +35 362
#note Holding the U for the unseen Q and scoring enough to outrun threats with the J or X
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: FOX 1M FOX +44 337
>Matt_Canik: DEEJNRU 14J J.ERED +60 422
#note This over JEREED because of the chances I draw QE and can threaten QU(E)E(R). I'm going to win, I have too many Q spots otherwise with QU(AI), QU(IN), and threats of QUEER. 
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEIQTVY N10 QI. +32 369
>Matt_Canik: BDNUW 6F B..WN +18 440
#note Who needs optimal endgames?
