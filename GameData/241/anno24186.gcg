>Ruchi_Gupta: EEGO H6 OGEE +10 10
>David_Turissini: DKMRRTY 6G D.RKY +23 23
#note Quackle likes just DORK keeping the Y for the YOGEE and DORKY hooks.  Wish I had thought of this.
>Ruchi_Gupta: ERV K3 VER. +20 30
>David_Turissini: EMRTUWZ 4J M.ZE +30 53
#note Dumb. I saw G9 WUZ, but didn't like dangling the Z near the DWS.  I didn't add up the score, and thought it scored less.  It's clearly the best play.
>Ruchi_Gupta: ?ABEEFL 5A BEEFALo +74 104
>David_Turissini: CILRTUW B1 CURL.W +38 91
#note Quackle slightly prefers A3 LU(B)RIC which I didn't know.  I prefer the IT leave to TW, but I guess the C in the TWS is more volatile.
>Ruchi_Gupta: AA A4 A.A +14 118
>David_Turissini: ?CIIOTV 1A I.TIC +30 121
#note I really should have seen EVICTION and MOTIVIC which play in multiple places.
>Ruchi_Gupta: ANQT E4 Q.NAT +14 132
>David_Turissini: ?LNOOVW M1 VOW.L +22 143
#note M1 WOV(E)N is slightly better.  I guess because the W is more defensive near the TWS?
>Ruchi_Gupta: AENO 1K NO.AE +27 159
>David_Turissini: ?BGNOOP G9 BONG +17 160
#note Quackle prefers a lot of options over BONG with  N1 (A)PO best followed by 3A B(R)OO.
>Ruchi_Gupta: ADIOPRT D7 PAROTID +79 238
>David_Turissini: ?DOPRSX 2L P.X +46 206
>Ruchi_Gupta: EINOORU 11F U. +2 240
>David_Turissini: ?ADIORS 13G SADIROn +79 285
#note 13B SI(D)eROAD is best and a cool play, as is C8  RADIOeS.
>Ruchi_Gupta: EINOORT A4 ...TE +21 261
>David_Turissini: IIIMTUU -IIMUU +0 285
#note Quackle wants to keep MT here.  I really need to figure out how to assess leaves.
>Ruchi_Gupta: ES N1 ..ES +32 293
>David_Turissini: AAHHITT 12J HAHA +38 323
#note 12L HATH is best.  I think I undervalue how bad doubled letters are.
>Ruchi_Gupta: FIO F2 FOI. +26 319
>David_Turissini: EIIJTTU C10 JUTE +41 364
>Ruchi_Gupta: IILMNSU J6 .ILIM +17 336
>David_Turissini: GIINSTY 10J .INGY +19 383
#note This and 10J (M)ITY are the two guaranteed wins.  I had to block plays like ENDUROS with the HAHAS hook.
