>David_Turissini: ABGNTTT 8G BATT +12 12
>Howard_Pistol: ADIK 9F KADI +22 22
>David_Turissini: GIILLNT 10I LILTING +65 77
#note Glad to see Quackle likes LILTING over TILLING.  I liked the E and L hooks over I and wanted to try to keep things open.
>Howard_Pistol: ABDEO O6 BODE.A +30 52
>David_Turissini: AAEEFNU 10B FAUNA +26 103
#note Quackle slightly prefers 11D FAUNAE for 4 less points and a better leave.
>Howard_Pistol: AX 9L AX +36 88
>David_Turissini: EEEEOPY 11C EPEE +29 132
>Howard_Pistol: IJNNS 12K JINNS +38 126
>David_Turissini: AEGORSY K5 ORGY +26 158
#note 13H GYROSE for 43.
>Howard_Pistol: OTW 9A TOW +25 151
>David_Turissini: AEEMNOS N5 MANO +19 177
#note 13K ONE is definitely better.
>Howard_Pistol: DLOU M3 LOUD +20 171
>David_Turissini: DEEENSZ L1 ZEES +52 229
>Howard_Pistol: EOR 1L .ERO +39 210
>David_Turissini: ?DEMNTY J2 EMYD +15 244
#note J12 DEMY is apparently best followed by A6  YET(T).  I think I was focusing too much on a bingo friendly leave and creating a new lane.
>Howard_Pistol: ?EGIOTV 7A VErTIGO +67 277
>David_Turissini: ?HINRTU D4 TRU.H +24 268
#note D5  RU(T)H is really nice since I have the last T.
>Howard_Pistol: AQ 4B QA. +12 289
>David_Turissini: ?HIINPR 5A HI +16 284
>Howard_Pistol: EIORSUV A7 .E. +18 307
>David_Turissini: ?INPRUW 4G WIR. +11 295
#note I didn't like this play at the time.  xch IPRUW, F3  WRUN(G), E10 (NE)W, and xch UW are all much better.
>Howard_Pistol: EFSS 12A FESS +39 346
>David_Turissini: ?CINPRU M12 .U +4 299
#note This play was best and gave me a 25% chance of winning.
>Howard_Pistol: CELORV 13F VELCRO +24 370
#note This scores just enough since I have two places to bingo out.
>David_Turissini: ?ACINPR 2C PRoCAIN. +67 366
