#note Thought between 3K OKA, 9E KAOLIN, and my play of OINK. Didn't consider 11C KORAI. I'm stunned to see that OKA leads to bingos a smidge more than OINK does for me - I figured OINK would outperform OKA solidly in that department. The extra points of OKA and blocking a pretty nice scoring spot for some heavy tiles are nice. I also thought OINK would block more bingos but apparently that's wrong as well. The board must be sufficiently open that anything he has is likely to go down somewhere else.

#note Hard to pick between 11C and K10 (not feeling N9). I suppose both plays offer some pretty nice scoring opportunities to Chuck with XI or XU plays, but my choice offers an extra floating A and an S hook to bingo, whereas 11C doesn't...

#note Thinking I should be able to outrun with this, but CP thinks blocking with C5 TEASE or playing more tiles with 14E THANES are much better.

#note Correctly blocking ANCONES, but doing so in an extremely inefficient way - D3 ETUIS is far better.
