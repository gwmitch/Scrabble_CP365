#note i honestly was not 100% sure on JANGLERS, it looks pretty dumb, and once i saw JAGER i decided to play it safe. of course i had at some point an anamonic for ANGLERS that i can't remember. i'm going to bring back the anamonics. (-18.5)

#note unfortunately, my chances of winning after this play stand at a meager 99.13%, but 3A GREW has a 99.14% chance of winning. i need every single fraction of a percent if i am to stand a chance of winning nationals. this was my worst mistake of the tournament.

#note my win % has somehow gone up to 99.75%, but i stupidly missed the winninger EXARCH at 99.81%. i cannot win with mistakes like these.

#note this is somewhat significant; 7H MORA keeps a much better leave. i wanted to block easy -ED/-ER bingos. -7 by not playing MORA, i lose 13 out of 10000 games, unfortunately.

#note So I lose now I guess
>Seed_1,000,000: AADERST G8 .ADASTRE +63 463
#note Canik: This play wins 99.24% of the time. Cesar: I don't really have a great reason for not having played CADASTER instead of CADASTRE. i even thought that his last play indicated consonant heaviness, which makes CADASTRE even worse. The main thing that I remember thinking is that there's no D out and ERS bingoes seemed easier to me than -ER or -ES. but an E in 7th position is much more hittable than an R in 7th position regardless.
in any case, the right play here is clearly to just play off the A at AY or something like that. he is likely close to a bingo so even if he doesn't 3-3, CADASTER or CADASTRE are likely to result in worse spread for me. YA wins a staggering 99.98% of the time. there's absolutely no way i'm going to lose after YA. 
>Matt_Canik: AEHKRST 15A HEKTAR.S +194 481
#note Canik: Except it wins ZERO PERCENT when you're playing matt canik
Cesar: one of the worst things is that this is close to worst case scenario - many triple triples still lose the game for him. he could even draw QE or something.  i do suppose he could have had TORQUIER or something like that though.
