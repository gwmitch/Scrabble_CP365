#note I made two mistakes this game. Some would say both of them were simple: missing FUJI twice in a row. I disagree. You will witness why in a second.

#note I'm down 80 points here. I sort of have a bad feeling about what's about to happen. So I look up at Tom's scoresheet, and what I see completely blows my mind. He has written: GELATIS - 64; GESTICAL - 74 right at the top of the sheet in marker! 

So, easy conclusion: he has two spots for his bingo. What do I do? I'm already down more than a bingo, and I have no bingo. So I look for plausible phoneys. In conclusion, I think I should have played OUTF(L)IPS*, which blocks GESTICAL, and forces Tom to play his lesser bingo. He probably would not challenge unless he was fairly sure, at the risk that I block his other bingo spot next turn. Instead, I decided to score as much as possible here, leave most of the board open for a comeback, block GESTICAL and force him to decided between 64 or a bit more while opening a big scoring spot or two. I assumed he would take the latter.
>Tom_Bond: AEGILST B4 GELATIS +71 244
#note LIGATES is 73, and TI(L)LAGES is 72. But Tom was happy to play the first thing he saw. I definitely expected this to come down.

#note Opening an easy-access lane down column D is what I need to do this turn.
>Tom_Bond: EEGIR M4 REGIE +16 260
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAIPTU A1 PITA +25 185
#note or PAUA. Missed PAUA, but sim prefers PITA because of the board and the vowel/consonant ratio.

#note I would not have challenged LEVATION*. THAT ISN'T A WORD!

Tom first laid down 1F OVATE, and then was obviously thinking about the X-bomb he was opening up. I then arranged my tiles in a 5/2 pattern, so he would think I had the X. I did what I could to win!
