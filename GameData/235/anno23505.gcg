#note This message is brought to you by the sponsors of Joshua Sokol's series entitled: "How to win the unwinnable game".

This is part 4, I believe.

Michael starts off strong, deciding not to expose a vowel for 2 fewer points. This is an incorrect decision, but an enlightened one nonetheless.
>Joshua_Sokol: DDELQTW D7 W.LDED +22 22
#note I begin by choosing to sacrifice short-term benefits by keeping as much of the board open as possible. Stylistically preferable to WELD(E)D, but much less beneficial for my Q, as QAT has nowhere to go next turn after my WELDED, whereas the other WELDED gives me an overlap, even if Michael plays on column E, which is probably the most likely spot for him to hit.

I could also allot to get rid of my Q right here right now with an exchange. 
>Michael_Fagen: ?DFIMNO F2 INFOrM.D +65 133
#note Michael proceeds to find his only bingo. Looks like I needed to keep the board super open...
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDGQTT 11C B.GAD +18 40
#note Large preference given here to 11C B(E)GAT instead. I thought this was a smart play, setting a trap if Michael didn't know BEGAD yet, as he might try to pluralize, and might not challenge if I pluralized.

>Joshua_Sokol: ANOQTTY 4K ATONY +26 66
>Michael_Fagen: ALP O1 PLA. +27 196
#note I make a fatal mistake of overdrawing, and Michael turns over MLY, leaving me with LY.
>Joshua_Sokol: EELQTYZ 3K LEY +27 93
#note ZL(O)TY was the other option. I preferred keeping the Z up my sleeve and finally setting up QAT, to get rid of my Q more often next turn. A bit too late, you say?
>Michael_Fagen: AACC 2H CACA +18 214
#note I briefly held CACA! Only cause it blocked my best play though...
>Joshua_Sokol: EJOQSTZ -JOQZ +0 93
#note Decided it was time to give up. Apparently I should still play off JETO or even JETOS at 3B, or keep the Z. I wanted to bingo immediately after this.
>Michael_Fagen: AEO H1 O.EA. +24 238
>Joshua_Sokol: EEMRSTW H11 SWEET +46 139
#note Gotta use my secret hook now
>Michael_Fagen: IQ E2 QI +24 262
#note He drew the Q, how unfortunate. He did have an I though. I forgot that I could have drawn an I after not drawing one for 5 turns.
>Joshua_Sokol: IMRRUUU -RUUU +0 139
#note Oops, I mixed the bag wrong. Held on to my I here, when I shouldn't have, because I was experiencing withdrawal.
>Michael_Fagen: ?AEIILR 15A LAIRIEs. +74 336
#note highest scoring bingo! Best!
>Joshua_Sokol: IJMNORT 3A INJO.. +26 165
#note The phony king returns. Held and released
>Michael_Fagen: FITU B2 U.FIT +20 356
#note Bad post-bingo draw for Michael
>Joshua_Sokol: EMORTUV N4 .OVERTUM +73 238
#note There's an old saying in Tennessee... I know it's in Texas probably in Tennessee that says "fool me once... shame on... shame on you. If you fool me can't get fooled again!"
