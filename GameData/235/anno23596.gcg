>Joshua_Sokol: ADEELNN 9G NE +7 7
#note This was a horrible position. I think I really should have looked for LEANED at 7B. Dunno.

#note Didn't know MUMPER. That's the play for 52 at 11H. :(
>Lloyd_Mills: ENTX 10H NEXT +29 203
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMMORT F1 MORTIME. +70 186
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMMORT --  -70 116
#note I was certain that this was a word. It's someone's name, and I have yet to figure out why I was so certain it was valid. Is it on a business somewhere, or a sign?
>Lloyd_Mills: IWZ 11K WIZ +47 250
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMMORT G7 M.. +8 124
#note I lost all will to find the right play here, and started screwing around. I don't like losing challenges.
>Lloyd_Mills: GOTU 6F GOUT +15 265
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIMORT 14D .MOG +23 147
#note This was obvious, but it's a good play
>Lloyd_Mills: UW 7B WU. +16 281
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIQRT B10 IDE.T +25 172
#note not sure what my last tile was
>Lloyd_Mills: AG 15E AG +12 293
>Joshua_Sokol: QR 10A Q. +11 183
#note My leave was something that could hit a bingo once in a while, but wasn't great, mostly just balanced. Didn't record it 
>Lloyd_Mills: ANV 5E VAN +22 315
>Joshua_Sokol: PRT 11B .R.PT +16 199
#note no idea about my leave. I was not focused.
>Lloyd_Mills: I I6 .I +3 318
>Joshua_Sokol: EJ H4 JE. +25 224
>Lloyd_Mills: CT I9 T.C. +14 332
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CRS J12 .RC +11 235
#note Still in the dark about my leave. I wondered if it made more sense to play F3 CR(AG) given the prevalence of A's in the pool, but after TECH Lloyd doesn't seem to have an A all that often, so I decided to go for it. 
>Lloyd_Mills: EHRT M7 HERT. +22 354
#note Whoa!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DLSVY 8L Y.LD +36 271
#note Last tile was a consonant. I wondered if it made sense to keep the Y instead of the V. The V seemed like a better bingo tile than the Y, but the Y scores with (GOUT)Y if I don't hit a bingo. Decided that I needed to hit a bingo, so I played YELD.
>Lloyd_Mills: AAILN 15H LIANA +24 378
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFILSV 13L FIVE +29 300
#note Wow, I might win this one! How is that possible? I've been messing around all game pissed at myself for thinking MORTIMER was valid. In any case, I did some estimative math and it looked like I had to score nearly 30 to be able to outrun Lloyd with an out-bingo, most of the time. So anything else was off the table. Champ player suggests M13 IFS but that doesn't score enough. I also had to hope the K or the R was in the pool, so that Lloyd couldn't score with K(E)IR after FIVE. But it looked plausible that I could win!
>Lloyd_Mills: EOO N7 O.EO +17 395
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIIKLS M3 KILo..... +48 348
#note Damn, was close too! I'm surprised I could have won this one. I definitely did not deserve to have a chance. I went overtime here looking for a bingo, but I was just too focused on this to look for a better endgame play. Spoilers, there isn't a better endgame play. O12 K(E)pI or K(E)Ir end up banking the same as this! My coolest play of the tournament :)
>Lloyd_Mills: AAIRU O11 UR.AI +18 413
>Lloyd_Mills: AAIRU --  -18 395
#note Unfortunately Lloyd really needed to excuse himself from the playing room here, and made a silly play as a result. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AIS N2 AIS +14 362
