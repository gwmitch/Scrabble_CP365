#note Ugh, 6J VEINY is the same score and obviously keeps the board a little more open. Not sure why I made this mistake
>Josh_Sokol: AEIORUZ 10F URAEI +16 183
#note This move was a very eye-opening one for me. L4 ZA for 55 was staring me in the face, but I didn't want to leave the board vulnerable for Matthew to control. OURIE was going to lead me nowhere, and although ZA probably allows me to score more on average in the next few moves than anything else, I didn't really care. I had just taken a 2-bingo lead, and I wanted to make the board very tough for Matthew to deal with. So I saw this play. It doesn't take everything out, but comes pretty close. The only thing left after this is a difficult underlap starting in ST under URAEI, a play through the E in FEEDERS, or a 9. And keeping the Z was strong not only for the spot that I left alone, but for the other hotspot on the board at 10B. I knew Matthew as a scoring-heavy player, and so allowing him to hit hotspots before me wasn't a good thing, but with my 120-point lead, he could score 30-40 and I would survive. After VINY, his tiles didn't seem very conducive to playing in the L4 spot that I was eying, but if they were, it wasn't the end of the world, as I could play elsewhere for 40, not open anything up, and stay ahead by almost two bingos. After ZA, I'm ahead more than two bingos already, but I was most likely going to lose that 2-bingo lead within two turns with what I was holding, and maintain maybe an 100-point cushion with multiple ways to lose it within one turn. So as normally URAEI would be ridiculous and paranoid, its benefits were just too massive to be left jailed in "just score and worry later" prison.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEIIRST 10B BI +16 72
#note Not sure what to do here. I also considered KIBEI, but I think I need to ensure I bingo next turn. Also this opens a diversion from the lines I am more likely to bingo on
>Josh_Sokol: ACFORXZ L4 ZAX +80 263
#note Normally I wouldn't be happy allowing Matt's setup to be left alone, but I had a feeling he either didn't have an O, or did have one but not amazing tiles to go along with it. I didn't take the bait, although no one in their right mind would have with 80 points and a completely closed top of the board and a 200-point lead.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AEIRST H1 SExTARI. +74 146
>Josh_Sokol: ?CFOORR A8 FRO +23 286
#note Closing in on Matt, leaving no easy way to access the bottom, and leaving a leave that will bingo more than anything else at my disposal. Also, taking away the huge hook that he can probably hit this time.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEHNOOR J6 HO. +37 183
#note ANCHOR/ARCHON is avaiilable but I need to bingo to that S next turn.
>Josh_Sokol: ?CENORU 1A bOUNCER. +80 366
#note Didn't know MUCRONES, which should be the best option here, leaving the least amount of 8s from B1 available for the rest of the game.

#note challenged

Josh: I always mess up on these 5-to-make-ES words. AMBONE* ANCONE CAJONE* COLONE EIKONE* PINONE* UMBONE* and there must be more similar ones. AMBOS ANCONS* CAJONS* EIKONS PINONS UMBOS

If I lost the game because of this I would have been content.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DINRSTT 15C STRID.NT +60 276
>Josh_Sokol: AABDGGT 11A GAD +25 391
#note Just keep scoring. But if you're going to do that, don't miss (KI)TBAG(S) after seeing KITBAG last turn and don't miss 13C AGGAD(O)T to further close off lanes.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EJLMOQV F14 Q. +31 307
>Josh_Sokol: ABEGMNT 13G M.NTAGE +28 419

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EELMOUV 12D OM +30 365
#note Maybe 11I MOUE to maximize my bingo potential? The sim thinks that gives me a 1% chance to win. I can't really see how Josh would mess this up, though.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEELLUV 13B UVEA +29 394
#note I should block DAUTIE...
>Josh_Sokol: ADEITU O7 DIET +34 557
#note didn't actually see that DAUTIE played, it's one point better, and I would have been able to figure that out. Worked out better for me though. 
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ELL 14J EL +14 408
#note I had him tracked for IU and thought he couldn't go out.
