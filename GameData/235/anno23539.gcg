#note I'm blowing up the rack and giving back easy underlaps. Not a good idea. I'm better off playing ELD or MEWED. Mistake

#note I considered just grabbing points with 12K HAIK, but with 2 blanks unseen it seemed like I needed to limit bingo lines.
>Jason_Li: ?BEINST L7 B.lT.INES +72 276
#note Yikes, he gets his bingo, opens new lines, leaves row 1 open, and draws 7 tiles towards to blank. This just got ugly

#note Misplayed this one. I was going to do BICE, but the N seemed like it yielded more bingos than the top two lines. But a lot of the racks that bingo through the N bingo in the other spots too. Looks like there are two more unique racks that bingo up top. So I lose a bit of win% botching this position. Part of the problem is for some reason is I somehow counted the 1D TRANQ threat as scoring 61 instead of 52, so I thought BICE ran the risk of being outrun. Dumb.
