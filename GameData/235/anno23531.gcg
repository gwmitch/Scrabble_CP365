#note Lots of close options here. G6 AGIO 7F AGAVE G5 VAGI and others all sim close. Not sure why I went with FOVEA but I know I spent a bunch of time on this turn. I did not see 7F AGAVE, which scores well and doesn't keep too bad a leave. And opening the TWS is actually not even as bad as opening all the easy plays with FOVEA. I think if I'm going to miss AGAVE, I should just come down with FOVEAE so he can't hook it. Mistake.

#note Brain fart here. Several bingos play for 74. I think I miscounted the number of squares I needed to hit the DWS, so I thought my 7th letter had to hook WIG.

#note The board is bad for bingos, so I should just play DIAPIR for the extra couple points, I think. All these mistakes are small, but they're adding up.

#note I had no idea what to do here. Of not is the UUUUQ unseen. I should maybe be avoiding so much turnover. I just took as many points as I could, hoping to outrun whatever big play he managed. I was planning to play BITABLE before Lloyd played since it blocked column N nicely, but PAH obviously changes things and makes BITABLE pretty pointless. This is not simming well at all. 9M OBI is ~9 pts better. Oh no

#note Uh oh. Big Q spot and I don't have one of the three leftover U's. I just need to hope my CH can outrun whatever he gets there.
