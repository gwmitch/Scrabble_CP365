>Seth_Lipkin: EPTW 8G WEPT +18 18
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAAGOR 9E AGORA +21 21
#note It took me 4 minutes of agonizing to see this play!
>Seth_Lipkin: BEOTU 10B BUTEO +22 40
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAFGPS 8C FAG +12 33
#note Thought this was good defense, but it isn't. Whoops. Still might be the correct play though, but it's not defensive, it's aggressive :P
>Seth_Lipkin: DFIRT 11E DRIFT +34 74
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AINOPS J2 APpOIN.S +70 103
>Seth_Lipkin: BEHIORS 5I B.HO +18 92
#note IIRC this was Seth's rack. This play was strong, and we agreed on it postgame, after comparing it with (F)IBRE or (F)IBER, but upon further analysis, seeing what the score was, I think FIBER/FIBRE make more sense, as they basically tie the game. Seth doesn't need to play from behind here.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILSUY 4J .AY +25 128
#note I knew I was going to PAY for making this play, but the upside of it seemed so good. Blocking the board as best I could (I inferred Seth had an S at least) and leaving EILSU, which sucks if I don't draw into a bingo, but less so on this board, as there are places to score and dump crappy tiles. Well, one place.
>Seth_Lipkin: EEIMRSS M2 MESSIER +86 178
#note couldn't stop him
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIILSU D10 .AU +16 144
#note and just like that I was in terrible shape. No way to score unless I burn my S and keep AEI, and 50 points down. 
>Seth_Lipkin: CKM 6L M.CK +26 204
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILNOS 12I ELISION +68 212
#note Played this because he had consonants. I should have just played 13C ISOLINE. I actually had forgotten about that word. ELISION and LIONISE come up much more often!
>Seth_Lipkin: EGY 8L G.EY +30 234
>Joshua_Sokol: AAHORVW 13G VAW +27 239
#note Going to have to be careful from now on. AVOW didn't seem to make sense since he could be holding the X this whole time, and still probably has consonants. Maybe the upsides are too much to sacrifice though; the better leave, one more point, setup potential. I don't know that I looked at the pool before playing this. Perhaps enough to glance and grimace at the unseen X.

>Seth_Lipkin: IQ 11K QI +46 329
>Joshua_Sokol: AIILRTU 14L LUT. +26 341
#note still not in good shape. At least I held 3/4 of the remaining tiles that could underlap an L. Hopefully I can draw something next turn, but that X is a looming threat soon to become an imminent one, as much as the blank that's still out there!
>Seth_Lipkin: DELN 10L LEND +10 339
#note Spoilers: For the rest of the game, Seth had absolute crap
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIORTU 15H TORII +21 362
#note Wow, I should have given this position more thought! Firstly I had RATIO that is just better than TORII when paired with the unseen pool, and second, I just lose if he has an X play, it seems, so best I leave the spot alone perhaps and play N1 OUR to block his spot?! I don't know. (A)XE just kills me, every time he can play it at H13...
>Seth_Lipkin: ?EEENNX 2I N.N +3 342
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACDEUV 1C CoUVADE +88 450
#note This game was much closer than it looked. Too bad the X was in the bag...
