#note TAMARIS is 81. And maybe I shouldn't be playing here anyways, since the Z spot is going to hurt later on. Definitely failed to properly capitalize on my early lucky draws.

#note I had the scores misadded by 10 pts here, so I thought I had to get super desperate and set up an S hook. I think my best chance is to play B5 GYNO or something and hope to draw JS and outrun his bad endgame rack.
