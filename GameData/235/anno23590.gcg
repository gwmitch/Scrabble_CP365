>Joshua_Sokol: GILMNUY H8 LUNGYI +28 28
>Seth_Lipkin: IOP I9 POI +20 20
#note I thought POI was a fish, not a dish, so I said "fishy-fishy". Seth knew that POI was a dish, and thought I was actually telling him that he was fishing, which he obviously wasn't. But, this interaction set the tone for the rest of the game. Obviously I intimidated the fellow, or put him on tilt early, or something

>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEKNZ 10A AZAN +39 242
#note Still can't see ZAKAT! I also chickened out of a nother new word, 13F KA(I)ZEN. This play is third best! Yay!
>Seth_Lipkin: III -III +0 92
#note here is where Seth starts to get frustrated

>Joshua_Sokol: ?AACEEK K7 CArE.AKE +63 322
#note Only bingo! A(R)AK was my first consideration but I had to play CARETAKE when I saw it, even though it is clearly wrong to play it.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?DDEJTW 14J J.WED +64 386
#note Not sure what Seth was so frustrated about here
>Seth_Lipkin: IQ E5 QI +24 139
#note At some point in this game, I got really pissed at myself after a EUREKA moment in which I realized this: the Steakhouse in Niagara Falls next to the convention center is called MILESTONES. I asked someone, I think Jeremy Hildebrand, if MILESTONE was a word. I remembered this in this game and I started getting angry. Of course MILESTONE is a word, it's a normal word! Ugh!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DIIOTV 8K .VOID +39 425
#note HE BLOCKED VIDIOTS! What a jerk!
>Seth_Lipkin: DEEIRST N3 SIDER.TE +63 202
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEILNT 3G ENTItLE. +68 493
#note This rack was too good, so I took 5 minutes trying to figure out which bingo to play. Played this since it opened the most scoring spots possible, when I couldn't avoid opening up scoring spots.
>Seth_Lipkin: ILNPRU 2B PURLIN +22 224

#note AX is preferred by Champ player, just by a bit. Trust.
>Seth_Lipkin: CFORTUW 15M TOW +23 247
#note Seth had given up on this game a long time ago. Don't blame him.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDNRS L12 DA.S +38 582
#note -11 to (K)AB first. Ack!
>Seth_Lipkin: CFRU C1 C.RF +18 265
#note -13 to just KAF. I guess I knew he wasn't going to play KAF and try to block, allowing me to milk him...
