>Doug_Lundquist: OQTU 4I QUOT. +28 96
>Charles_Reinke: EEOOPSY 6J POO.Y +27 55
#note K7 P(T)OOEY is a nice option which I missed.
>Doug_Lundquist: ACDILRT 7B TRICLAD +68 164

>Doug_Lundquist: BEET 8A BEET +28 192
>Charles_Reinke: ?EEPSTT 10H SEPTaTE +77 168
#note After E4 SPECTaTE got blocked I spent quite a while trying for nines. EEPSTT? makes a lot of sevens but I missed several of them, including TyPESET, which plays for 80 at 10F.
>Doug_Lundquist: AINR 5H AIRN +30 222
>Charles_Reinke: EEJOOUU N1 JOE +25 193
#note Bad post-bingo draw, and I was hesitant to make this play, but it actually has an okay chance of working out if Doug doesn't have an O.
>Doug_Lundquist: ADEO O1 ODEA +54 276
>Charles_Reinke: AEFLOUU 9A OAF +27 220

>Doug_Lundquist: GNOS 11B SONG +19 313
#note This got scored as 25?
>Charles_Reinke: ?AAELRU D10 U.REAL +14 242
#note Quackle prefers conventional fishes like 7M (E)AU. I wanted to open up more lanes. With this, even after Doug's next play I'll usually have an E or L to play through.
>Doug_Lundquist: IRV 15A VIR. +21 334
>Charles_Reinke: ?AAEIIV F5 AI. +5 247
#note I just drew four of the remaining nine vowels.
>Doug_Lundquist: BCHN 13C B.NCH +32 366
>Charles_Reinke: ?AEIVWZ E3 WIZ +52 299
#note Now AI(L) looks like a setup. I had to tell Doug after the game that it had been no such thing. This is exaclty what I needed to have a chance in this game, though.
>Doug_Lundquist: ARX D2 RAX +43 409
#note Just like that, winning chances back to nil.
>Charles_Reinke: ?AENOSV 12H EVASiON +75 374
>Doug_Lundquist: DGILNNY N9 Y.N.ING +22 431
>Charles_Reinke: GILM 15L MI.G +33 407
