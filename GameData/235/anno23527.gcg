>Jason_Li: ADEEMO 8H OEDEMA +24 24
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AKOOSVZ 7L AZO +47 47
#note I also considered 7M ZOO and M7 KAZOO. Those two, along with AZO and J6 VODKA, all sim within a point or so. I decided to just gamble that I'd get an N before Jason.
>Jason_Li: AIQ J6 QA.I +34 58
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IKORSTV I7 K.TO +28 75
#note I also considered STORK. I can see why KETO isn't so hot. It gives up a bunch of points to keep the S... but blocks all the S hooks. Quackle sim prefers STORK by 1 pt in the sim. Shrug.
>Jason_Li: BENOR O4 BORNE +43 101
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: INPRSVY K8 .NVY +23 98
#note VINOS sims about even with this. It's possible I'm overvaluing an S that has no hooks on this board, but I don't think so. I think ENVY is good.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AGIIOSS 14B AGIO +13 201
#note I was a bit lost on this turn, because it seems like there are no great plays available. All I considered were plays that hit the bottom right TWS or saved the S's to try and hit it later. But I should have spent more time thinking about O10 AGIOS. It's only 18 pts and blocks the spot I'm hoping to hit next turn, but at least it doesn't risk giving back a huge spot with 14B AGIO. I guess my plan was to open this TWS so that I could guarantee getting to hit one of them next turn.

#note The bag is super vowel-lite so this didn't feel too bad.
>Jason_Li: III -III +0 326
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AGIIISU -GIIU +0 315
#note With only 2 vowels and a blank left in 17 unseen tiles, it was  so tempting to try and play through this and hoard the vowels. But there's just nothing worth playing.
>Jason_Li: IIIU -IIIU +0 326
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEILNSU 3L U.. +5 320
#note It's between this and L12 LUSH. LUSH scored a bit of points to help me catch up even if I miss a bingo. But it blocks the spot I'm hoping to score well on with my case A. (Though it's entirely possible he burns the blank with HaW or something.)
>Jason_Li: IIIU -IIIU +0 326
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEILNSY 13M NAY +21 341
#note Now it feels like my best chance is to score some points and block the hot spot. Otherwise I can fish again with 5K BY? But I think NAY is good.
>Jason_Li: J 4J J. +9 335
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EILSTVW 2B SWIVEL +34 375
#note I'm going to draw whatever he's been exchanging. I'm just gambling he doesn't have enough to beat me in the endgame. Because O10 TIVY was the other play I considered and it felt like he'd be able to outrun that a lot of the time.

#note Moment of doubt on DUNITIC. Taking the sure win...
