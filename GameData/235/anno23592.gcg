>Jason_Li: BEEFY 8H BEEFY +34 34
#note Personally thought that doubling the B was probably better. I mentioned to Jason that this was aggressive of him after he hit his clock. 
>Joshua_Sokol: CEMNORR 9G ROM +20 20
#note 9G CORM looks good from a short-term standpoint. None of the plays I considered really left me with anything to do next turn to get ahead, but K8 (F)ORM works if I would like to try and aggro my way out of this one. This play seemed like a good medium between aggressivity and defense. Leaving my options open for next turn. I was not happy with my play, though, and I think I should have gone with something that painted a clearer path. If he overlaps for 30 next turn I am in bad shape.
>Jason_Li: AGJ 7G JAG +34 68
#note and he did :/
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEENNR L2 CANNER. +24 44
#note CA(Y)ENNE looks to be a good alternative play here. CARNE(Y) works as well. This is fine. I considered EN(F)ACE and (F)ENCE as well, but neither of those options seemed to end well for me. I didn't consider CARNE(Y), forgetting that spelling of the word. That accomplishes the same thing as CANNER(Y) minus the ability to fork the board through the C, but that doesn't happen nearly often enough for it to be a factor worth sacrificing for.
>Jason_Li: FOU K3 FOU +23 91
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEIPQS -Q +0 44
#note M3 DE is easily winning a simulation. I could not be bothered to keep the Q here, but I think I needed to suck it up and focus on the board. It even sets up QIS. This was silly.
>Jason_Li: X 3K ..X +26 117
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEIPSZ 2L .EP +23 67
#note exch Q, draw Z. I liked this play, as most of his range consists of balanced bingo leaves, and those don't seem to be able to hit CEPE all that often without sacrificing a lot. Unfortunately he had a different kind of leave, but I think at the speed FAX was played I was right to make the inference.
>Jason_Li: BEHT O1 BETH +47 164
#note but now I am down more than a bingo for giving Jason unnecessary wiggle room for 4 straight turns.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIIRSZ 7K I.ID +11 78
#note This was what I wrote down as my leave. I find it hard to believe that I didn't see FRIZ, but it's possible I just missed it. Maybe I kept ZEDS, but my memory tells me no. Scored as 10
>Jason_Li: ??AANOT O7 sONATAs +73 237
#note Jason has a cool 9 here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADERRSZ N10 ZEDAS +107 185

#note nooooo, he blocked PERKIER! I spent most of the rest of this game trying to talk myself into KERRI* being valid. It's KARRI. The final decision this turn was deciding whether or not I could win the game without a bingo. It seemed extremely difficult to do, since although I retain the last E's for the 15A triple, Jason can block pretty well if he has one of the last A's, or he can just play underneath without hitting the R. Was hoping he would have a hard time blocking this opening, which was also a lot to bank on. Hmm. J4 IRK is cool, hoping for a (ION) 10 later on, or using column I later to open another lane. I longly considered 13F PERK. It's true that can win with a good draw, if Jason's rack is garbage. I think that might be better than ELOPER. Either way I need a small miracle to win, and with PERK, my intentions are a bit less obvious. I can also still hit the 4D lane with INSERTI(ON) or something.
>Jason_Li: AIV B8 VIA +12 344
#note I have a chance. Jason's rack was definitely bad! But he had to have at least one more vowel here... So I needed to look out for that.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGIKRS 10A G..D +13 316
#note I can't play any vowel off here, unless I try KE(R)RIS*. I unfortunately decided to try it, but at the speed Jason picked up his pen to write down my play, I knew it was going to be challenged off. IRK looks good here again, if it weren't for there probably being only 2 vowels out of all of the unseen pool.
>Jason_Li: ANW 13G AWN +18 362
#note yup, vowels
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIKRST 4H EIK.. +10 326
#note IK(ON) seemed far too easy to block with the V, G, C, out there, so I opted for this, which made it maybe 1% tougher... Stupid play, when I could have considered some great options, like 8A K(V)AS, or even 8B (V)AS, setting up a K hook, which he can just block with (V)AST. Perhaps this allows me to win without a bingo? Doubtful. K(V)AS looks like the way to go, although the setup is endearing. I need the C to be able to win after just (V)AS, and he needs to miss KVAS. Not happening. 
>Jason_Li: CL H3 C.L +5 367
>Joshua_Sokol: AHIRSTT 3G I.H +22 348
#note I can fish for two things here, INTHRA(L)S or TRISTI(C)H. Knowing TRISTICH would have been great, as if I hit it, Jason has to know and see it, and be able to block it. There is only one play that can block the C. Jason was running low-ish on time, which explains his lapse of giving me a way to win the game. But I was even lower on time than he was, so I just threw this down.
>Jason_Li: GINTUVY 2E VUG +12 379
#note S in the bag! 2C VYING is better, but this gets the job done.
>Joshua_Sokol: ARSSTT 12A S....ST +17 365
#note LOWEST is better. I had 3 seconds on my clock
>Jason_Li: INTY 8A I.Y +27 406
#note -4 to K13 N(U)T, blocking my out and retaining IVY which I would have to see and block. And I would go over.
>Joshua_Sokol: ART 12I ART +5 370
#note -10 to slowplay, too slow for having 1 second left. And 7C ART is 10
>Joshua_Sokol:  (NT) +4 374
