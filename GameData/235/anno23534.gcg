#note KEA/KAE at B13 looked good, but I was so worried about the potentially huge overlaps there. Though RAKE sets up some big scoring spots too. It was the last game of the day and I knew I was making a lazy play.

#note So I need to not empty the bag and I need to not give him a 100+ pt bingo. This leaves POETIZED as a possibility, but I outrun that. I took this over the other WEEL because I thought this was harder to underlap. Also, I was paranoid and wanted to block huge row 13 Z bingos that aren't actually there. Also, I figured there's a chance he tried to hook WEELS*.
