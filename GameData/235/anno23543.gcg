>Michael_Fagen: AGRUU 8D AUGUR +14 14
#note So far so good, he hasn't gotten a bingo yet and only scored 14
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINOOR E7 O.RIE +10 10
#note Chose this to keep things more closed, keeping a worse leave, but not giving Michael much to work with. This isn't my usual style, but my usual style doesn't work against Michael apparently, unless I phony him. I saw all of the other options, and since I didn't pin him on having a good rack I had a clear mind when playing this. Needless to say, had I played OO(R)IE like a paranoid maniac, or even NOO(G)IE, which is Quackle's choice, I would have been in much better shape.
>Michael_Fagen: ADEELMO H8 .EMOLADE +86 100
>Joshua_Sokol: BCENNOT I11 NOB +19 29
#note Again, normally would play D10 BONCE, but this time I opted for the more fishy play to keep the board more open. Needless to say, this didn't work out either. BONNET I didn't consider, also at D10. 
>Michael_Fagen: ?AGINST 15H .ASTINGs +77 177
#note Quite aggressive compared to ESTATING. I guess IN(G) bingos are still a paranoia at his stage of the game?
>Joshua_Sokol: CEGNRST 10B GEN.C +18 47
#note Fishing is valuable enough here, but I felt my chances were better with scoring 18. Also, thought that I could create a fake A hook that he might bite on, or not challenge. Needless to say, that plan did not work out. 
>Michael_Fagen: MV G7 V.M +22 199
>Joshua_Sokol: ANORSTZ 6F ZONA +42 89
#note I didn't like it, but it was the best I could do in the interest of keeping the board open. Hoping he had clunk based on his last play and couldn't capitalize.
>Michael_Fagen: AEFK J3 FAKE +29 228
#note I guess ZONA sort of worked out OK in terms of not giving him a huge play.
>Joshua_Sokol: NRSSTVY C9 V.STRY +32 121
#note But it definitely didn't work out for my sake.
>Michael_Fagen: ?EIOPST O8 dEPOSIT. +77 305
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEINSX K4 XI +39 160
#note Now I just have to go for pure points vs leave and hope he has the crappiest rack ever. There wasn't even a way to open the board more that it already was
>Michael_Fagen: EITU L4 ETUI +35 340
#note instead gave him the perfect dump. Gosh
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDDENS M2 ADDENDS +101 261
#note At least this still played. There is hope for humanity. Wasn't 100% but I had to go for it. It's good, and Michael knew it. :/
>Michael_Fagen: HIJ 2L H.JI +28 368
#note Even Michael asked himself what he was doing with this play.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIILWW A8 CLAW +36 297
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIILWW --  -36 261
#note It's OK though, nothing for him to worry about. I was trying to decide which phony to try, WILWI(N)* H1 or A(GENIC). I should have gone with WILWIN, I guess? Or do I actually have a chance to win with J12 WAW(S)? I guess I should have just played WAWS this turn. Can't do CILIA 1H, can? I don't know about blocking any of my lanes doing anything that will lead me to winning. I hesitated too much though, and he didn't buy it. 
>Michael_Fagen: BHRT O1 B.RTH +33 401
#note :/
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIILWW 1H CILIA +30 291
>Michael_Fagen: EF I3 EF +28 429
>Joshua_Sokol: AAETUWW J12 WAW. +29 320
#note just protecting spread now, perhaps I can draw a miracle out of the bag with the Q though
>Michael_Fagen: R J3 ....R +12 441
>Joshua_Sokol: AELLRTU 9A LA. +9 329
#note Trying to avoid the Q? Thanks for the rack knowledge while I go ahead and protect even more spread.
>Michael_Fagen: EENOOQY 8A OY +28 469
>Michael_Fagen: EENOOQY --  -28 441
#note Michael actually played this on purpose to avoid getting Q stuck. Was a smart move, but it actually burned a bit more spread.
>Joshua_Sokol: ELOQRTU 14B O. +10 339
#note Not sure why I did this. Was sort of silly. Hoping for the other O, the most likely tile in the pool after him having played FAKER
>Michael_Fagen: EINOORY N9 YONI +24 465
#note We were discussing the fact that he should block QUELL. This is actually 8 points off 8A ER, which milks me well after I'm forced to play QUEE(N) M11.
>Joshua_Sokol: EELPQTU A5 QUEL. +42 381
>Michael_Fagen: EOR K10 ORE +13 478
#note So, moral of the story? Fish more against Michael Fagen? Phony more? What am I supposed to do? 
>Michael_Fagen:  (EPT) +10 488
