#note I held this, it looked terrible. Both IMBOWER and EMBOWER are good, and they are verbs that mean the same thing. EMBOW is something different, and IMBOW* is phony. Good to know.

#note nice find
>Joshua_Sokol: CEHLLRT 12F CH.LLER +24 134
#note I was confused here, didn't quiet know what to do, and lost my focus. I made a good play for the board's sake, at least. Was going to need to keep all quadrants open for this one, it seemed, but maybe this was overkill. 10F CL(O)TH is bad for me in the long-term, but in the short term Jason can't do much to stop me. K2 ECHT is a lot of points, but doesn't help me at all. I think it is short-sighter for me to block myself with CL(O)TH if I am down by more than 78, but I am only down by 78. This was held and released.

#note A great draw puts me in even better shape. I unfortunately missed F8 (V)AW, which seems better. I was too focused on whether or not I was forgoing a valid bingo, but SEWANTS* is invalid.

#note Easily the best rack I've ever had in a tournament! Jeez. Correctly decided not to play TRAYERS*, which would have been better, had it score 85 and not 0. I may have played E7 S(E)TAE had I seen it, and it's probably correct to score 33 and not open any new hotspots with a leave such as R??. Lucky Jason could not respond.

#note Since I deserved to lose this game through my mistakes aplenty, it is no surprise that Jason missed IGUANIA(N) here to spell victory for him. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFINOT 11K .EIN +15 377
#note Based on the time it took Jason to play AGU(E), I know he isn't holding amazingly well (especially given the tile pool). I also know pretty certainly that he is retaining IN for the G at O15. In that sense I thought it was best to go for the win here and block the biggest bingo threat. At first I saw 13K (D)EFI, but I was paranoid of him fishing/scoring next turn and threatening to both beat me with and without hitting a bingo. Many (I)O(N) words were available to fish for after DEFI. So Then I considered (D)EFT, but that ends up having the same problem as DEFI. Jason can bingo to the T as well and I am leaving myself more vulnerable to scoring plays by him in the endgame. So in the end I allotted to both block the most bingos possible and keep my F. NOTIONAL and NATIONAL are still available, but keeping the F means I am unlikely to lose in a close endgame. I probably should have given up on preventing unlikely bingo scenarios and just played for spread here with N2 EI(K)ON. 
>Jason_Li: AL H1 AL +16 359
>Joshua_Sokol: EFFOOTT L7 FOOT.. +15 392
#note I knew I had won after AL. Jason was apparently going for INTIFAD(A)! (A)FOOT in the same spot is many more points. I was running out of time here and made a silly paranoid play. I also missed Jason's next move, so I should have gone with my earlier idea of playing TOO(K) N1 to set up EFF maybe. Champ likes TOOT(ER) over FOO(T)ER. Unsure why, doesn't look like I go out much either way though.
