#note I often have trouble with racks like this, where all the choices suck and the assignment is to identify the play that sucks the least. I wanted to lean toward closing here, and OUTDO seems best for that, though Quackle likes 2E LOU up top. Definitely not what I did - I just didn't go through nearly enough candidates.

#note 2K HAUL at the top surprises me - 31 points, but IOOR looks pretty bad. I9 OLIO I think would be my pick if I had to do it again. My play is kind of cute and leaves well; thought it would sim better than 7 points back. More investigation needed.
>Eric: EOW 1F WOE +34 199
>Geoff: CLLMOST 5K M.LT +20 274
#note 10F CLEM, maybe? Scores 6 less but I like that defense here. Too focused on the 5K spot, though MILT is the equity choice and I do have an S (my opponent might also, though).

>Geoff: CILOSTV 8J V..IC +10 284
#note This is why we can't have nice things. Oh hey, I'm uglying the board! How about COVET E7, which also uglies the board some, rids you of the stupid V, and blocks the glaring X spot at F6 you weren't thinking about, while not weakening the value of your S and scoring 11 more points?
>Eric: ESX 6D SEX +60 272
>Geoff: GILOOST N8 .OGITOS +28 312
#note Let's turn over six tiles to chase the blank and score some points. Well, no. 2K G(A)OL is fine. Don't be so impatient. Lots of plays are better than this.

>Geoff: FLLNSTU E9 N.TFUL +18 330
#note Not the right idea. Sets up an S hook I might be able to use, but that won't be enough unless my opponent drew really badly after the bingo. Considered FIL H13, which would have been better, but the damage has most likely already been done.

#note Endgame's fine, but no way to win now. Not an auspicious start.
