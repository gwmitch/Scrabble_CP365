>Joshua_Sokol: AEFINOW H5 WIFE +20 20
#note Now he has to beat me by 123 or something. I therefore should have played WAIF despite it giving back more, since I should favor a closed board this game and overlaps are what form closed boards.
>Jason_Li: MUY 9H YUM +23 23
>Joshua_Sokol: AAFLNOU 5G A.FUL +22 42
#note I opted to play fast this game, and since everything seemed crappy, I went with the most crappy play.
>Jason_Li: AAW 4K AWA +14 37
>Joshua_Sokol: AINNOOR 10I NORIA +15 57
#note more crap, just run his clock down and make a decent enough play.
>Jason_Li: ?DEINPS 11G dISPEND +87 124
#note Jason preferred this to DIsPENS(E) because it looks like it keeps more of the board open. I think I agree.
>Joshua_Sokol: BINOORT 12B BIOTRON +74 131
#note I'm not taking 2 points and opening a triple-triple lane. Especially not this game.
>Jason_Li: EGHX L7 HEX..G +36 160
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIORTV B8 OVER.ITE +80 211
#note Now, do I open it or not? I'll leave this up for debate.
>Jason_Li: ?AARSTU A2 dATURAS +77 237
#note whew, he did have S? but no 3x3. Dodged a bullet. E5 SATURAn(T) is one more, but it gives back too much points, I'd say. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHRTVZ 15A H.AVER +48 259
#note perhaps HEAVE to set up more scoring options for myself like HEAVENLY? unsure
>Jason_Li: AQ E10 QA. +24 261
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMOSTZ 14E MESTIZO +98 357
#note gg...
>Jason_Li: EKY N2 KEY +30 291
#note not sure why not 3M
>Joshua_Sokol: CELSTTU F2 CUTLETS +79 436
#note insult to injury now
>Jason_Li: IJN O1 JIN +38 329
#note perhaps KEY was a JIN setup.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEELNNO 8L .NOL +12 448
#note dunno, I wanted to bingo again
