#note : ( I missed a really cool bingo on this play after spending 8 minutes on it! especially pertinent because mine is coming up soon
>Doug_Brockmeier: AINQT M3 QINTA. +32 58
>JD: ?ABIMUV K4 BUM..IA +29 114
#note for some odd reason I played this play very fast, even thought it is potentially quite dangerous! actually I can play a beautiful play here of BARIUM (/IT/UH/MY) to avoid setting up such a volatile spot

#note scrabble is easier when you draw all the blanks
>Doug_Brockmeier: EGNNOOS 6B NONEGOS +71 211
>JD: ADEOSTU 5C DUO +17 274
#note both blanks unseen and an ugly pool to come, figured I would save a better leave (than OUTED) while also blocking
>Doug_Brockmeier: DEIV N2 VIDE +32 243
>JD: AEEISTW O4 SWEET +38 312
#note I spent a really long time on this move, but I think I got it right. 4 Es left and only one A, and basically making the whole bottom-right quadrant unthreatening.
>Doug_Brockmeier: CRSU 4A CRUS +28 271
#note interesting! I read this as doug having 3 more consonats
>JD: AHIIOST 14J HOSTA +41 353
#note I didn't even consder AITCH at A1. pretty even on the sim. maybe AITCH gives me a better shot at responding if he does manage to bingo on this increasingly cruddy board.
>Doug_Brockmeier: EL C13 EL. +6 277
>JD: BEEIILR 12A LIBER +22 375
#note best to block even though he doesn't seem like he'll be able to catch me no matter what, since he presumably has bingo tiles leftover. BELIE or BELIER at D8 are suggested to avoid giving back cheap points if he has the Z
>Doug_Brockmeier: FO 11G OF.. +10 287
#note he was really low on time and trying to open
>JD: ACEIOYZ A8 COZI.Y +60 435
>Doug_Brockmeier: DEGGIN 10A .IGGED +24 311
>JD: AE 13L .EA +26 461
#note doug went over by a minute. I give myself 10 points here to get the spread right
