>Peter_Armstrong: GP G7 G.P +11 11
>JD: BEIILRR 10D LIBER +20 90
#note I thought LIBER had the chance of taking the board in a good defensive direction long run by blocking a bunch of lanes, although for now he can blow it up by playing from the R. I think I saw GIBER at G7 but passed it up because it seemed to do less to block. I like this in retrospect.
>Peter_Armstrong: EEQRU I5 QUE.R +16 27
>JD: DEEIINR 11B REINED +33 123
#note hmm, part of me did think I might be missing a 9! but I guess I couldn't come up with RIDGELINE on this particular day. EIDER is the same play but without opening a lane and keeping better layers. should probably play that if I don't see my bingo
>Peter_Armstrong: AGU 5I .UAG +28 55
>JD: AAIIKOU -AAIIKOU +0 123
#note ideal time to exchange without much going on on the board. I could maybe keep the K as a nice scoring tile, or AK.
>Peter_Armstrong: CNT 6H C.NT +14 69
>JD: ACNOOWY 4K WANY +32 155
#note I put down CROWN at B10 but picked it up, the leave was unpromising. the COO leave seems to offer a nice chance to make a defensive play at B10 next turn. quackle's fave is actually CROON at B10, I thought it gave back points too cheaply but maybe I score well enough to make it wortwhile

#note hmm, I missed LAWINES here. that was not so good.
