>Zev_Kaufman: ANNOY 8H ANNOY +24 24
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEIMOU 9F MIAOU +16 16
#note better than the MIAOU two spots up because of the J6 hotspot compared to the J10 hotspot. Perhaps 9G MEOU is somehow the best play here, but I don't like it at all, since it creates only one relatively hot hotspot and doesn't really leave me much room to respond. 9H MOUE though seems good as well. I went with standard and safe.

>Joshua_Sokol: CCEEINT M2 CITE +16 32
#note Well at least he gave me ELENCTIC. Not that I saw it or knew it... This play strived to keep the largest amount of board open for a comeback. CETE may be better cause of the E's I can play through, and CINE is about the same.

>Joshua_Sokol: DEFFNWX C3 W.FF +26 112
#note doesn't seem like he'll block the X spot next turn so I think it's best to leave it open and dump WFF
>Zev_Kaufman: GR 6C .R.G +12 170
#note of course by sheer chance he makes a play that blocks the spot.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEENTUX 2J DUN.E +24 136
#note I guess I should just play 15B DEX. Don't think I considered it.

#note 33 7s with BIV in them and 1/3 of those unplayable if drawn into. Can't believe my leave became this.

>Joshua_Sokol: ADEHLLS N10 LASHED +38 322
#note I don't know what I was thinking when I made this play. HALED at 11J is so much better, perhaps I chickened out of it, in which case 11K HAED is fine too. This gives Zev spots for around 15% more bingos. This obviously wins if he doesn't have an immediate bingo, but I need to play something more defensive. I knew I would lose anyway because of CEMENTIC*.
