#note Not sure why I valued the DRT? leave so highly. DARK for 19 keeping EGT? is totally fine.

#note He gets a triple, I get a triple? Should be fine...
>John_O'Laughlin: DLW H12 W.LD +36 151
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEGIOU O11 OG.ED +27 190
#note I decided pretty quickly that I had to block the DLS-TWS combo, but I missed a more creative way that retains a consonant - EUGE# 12K. This sims second-best, 1-2 points behind.

>Evans_Clinchy: AFISTTX I9 F.X +17 231
#note I thought a fishier play might make it easier to bingo ASAP, but that might be silly. Sim suggests FIXT 7C, which scores 3 extra points and starts to pry things open a little bit. AST is also a very nice leave when you've got a pool loaded with E's, I's, N's and other bingo-prone stuff.

>Evans_Clinchy: ABEEJNU A8 J.BE +39 338
#note Chickened out on BUNJIE#. It's good with the -Y or the -IE ending, wasn't sure.
>John_O'Laughlin: AGHNU D4 NAUGH. +28 345
>Evans_Clinchy: AENNNTU E3 NUN +12 350
#note Eh. Should probably take the 6 extra points with NAUNT.
>John_O'Laughlin: AAIII -AAIII +0 345
>Evans_Clinchy: AEENNTT F3 ANTE +14 364
#note Again, missing opportunities to score more in a close game - ANENT B8 looks best here. Really no reason not to dig deeper into the bag, there's nothing scary in there unless I draw something stupid like all four I's.
>John_O'Laughlin: AI B8 A.I +20 365
>Evans_Clinchy: EINORTW 12A REWON +33 397
#note Glad to see the many-ply sim approve of this. The goal is to maximize score and at least threaten an out next turn.
