#note I didn't actually have this many I's. This is my first annotated game and I didn't record many of my racks.
>Andrew_Gartner: INOY 9F YONI +26 26
>JonathanLindh: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 24
>Andrew_Gartner: EIV J6 VIE +27 53
>JonathanLindh: AE 10F AE +21 45
#note Setting myself up for a bingo and clearing off the excess vowels.
>Andrew_Gartner: DDEOZ K8 DOZED +47 100
>JonathanLindh: AAEIRST 10K .A +11 56
#note This is a screwup. Had Satire + A and did not see AIRDATES through the D in the 12 row. Oh well. Picked the second best play according to Quackle. Fished off the excess A and created a lane for myself.
>Andrew_Gartner: CHITY 11C ITCHY +49 149
#note Another one from Andrew! This was a very well played game on both sides.
>JonathanLindh: AEIORST D7 TOAS.IER +68 124
#note I was intially very annoyed when I drew an O because SATIRE + O does not form any sevens, but he opened up a T so I could do TOASTIER. TRAVOISE was the other option for 63 in the 6 row.
>Andrew_Gartner: AGQU M7 QUAG +38 187
#note Another high scoring play by Andrew with the JQXZ power tiles. However, he will set me up quite nicely...
>JonathanLindh: ?GILNRS N4 RuLINGS +93 217
#note Bang!!! Bingos beget more bingos. By far the best move. Strangely enough, the second and third best moves are passing on a bingo. Wacky Quackle. Next options are bingos through R, E, and D down in rows 12-14.
>Andrew_Gartner: AFKNR C5 FRANK +34 221
#note Can't stop won't stop. This isn't Puff Daddy in the 90's. Stop your scoring!
>JonathanLindh: HOR 8A HO..R +24 241
#note I once again neglected to write my rack, so there may have been better options at C13.
>Andrew_Gartner: BIMR B11 BRIM +32 253
#note I told you Andrew! Stop it!
>JonathanLindh: ALOP A12 OPAL +32 273
#note Almost did A13 PAL instead. This is better and those few points would come in handy.
>Andrew_Gartner: EEMT O1 METE +24 277
>JonathanLindh: AACFI D1 FACIA +33 306
#note J2 FACIAE gets me 38 and Quackle recommends this over D1 Facia for 33 which I played. I saw FACIAE but I passed because I thought it would open the triple too easily and I thought Andrew had the last blank. He didn't but this play proved to be pivotal.
>Andrew_Gartner: DEX L10 .XED +39 316
#note I wonder if he could have hit the triple with the X had I played FACIAE.
>JonathanLindh: NOTU 1D .OUNT +24 330
#note Now I get the triple! Yay!
>Andrew_Gartner: EOV J11 VOE +23 339

>JonathanLindh: DENO M1 DONE +25 379
>Andrew_Gartner: ETW L4 WET +26 390
#note The exciting part is coming. I promise!
>JonathanLindh: ?ELNRTU E4 TRUE. +27 406
#note I thought about this play for so freaking long. There should be a playable bingo in these letters on the board but there isn't. Not enough space for LUT(H)ERNS in column A. Originally planned on doing RUNTLES in row 14, but no hope of winning there. This play sims the best in Quackle. Andrew has outplays of either ILEUS or LIEUS along row 14 hooking off of VOE for 18 points. Can he find them?
>Andrew_Gartner: EILSU C13 LIE +24 414
#note This mistake will haunt him for a long time as he finished 11th out of 164th and one spot out of the money. All he got was a crappy copy of Word Freak. Once again, LIEUS or ILEUS for 18 points and the win and he whiffed. Yay for me!
>JonathanLindh: ?LN I13 NiL +6 412
#note And the outplay! Quackle equally recommends L(ODE)NS which I did not know or see. You better believe this game was subjected to a long recount. Fortunately for me, the score was correct!
