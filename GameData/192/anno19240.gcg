>Chris_Tallman: ADGGIUU -GGIUU +0 0
#note Can't really read my scoresheet fully here, but I exchanged 5.
>Joe_Edley: IKLT 8G KILT +16 16
>Chris_Tallman: ADDEMRU J6 DA.UM +18 18
>Joe_Edley: GLORTY H6 TR.LOGY +15 31
#note GLORY K4 is 35, and has to be much better.
>Chris_Tallman: ACDERTU K1 CURATED +76 94
#note Woulda blocked this too hehe :)
>Joe_Edley: LNOW 1K .LOWN +33 64
>Chris_Tallman: AFILNOR 12C FAIRL. +24 118
#note Spent a while here - nothig really stands out. Thought about WOLF N1, which the sim likes. It's hard for me to differentiate the options here.
>Joe_Edley: ABEPR C9 PRE.AB +32 96
#note Knew this took an S, so I felt pressure on these upcoming turns.
>Chris_Tallman: EEGNNOV 4H VEG.N +26 144
#note Missed NOVEN(A)E, which looks best. VEGAN is alright other than that, though.
>Joe_Edley: DFT 11B D.FT +25 121
>Chris_Tallman: AAENOOX 2M NOO +20 164
#note Wanted to keep things constricted and save my X. Quackle wants me to play AXONE K10, but I'm really not sure I want to.
>Joe_Edley: EHINNST 6A THINNES. +71 192
#note He said something like 'Here's your chance' upon playing this haha.
>Chris_Tallman: AACEIJX A6 .AJ +30 194
#note Chance not taken! ATAXIC is +9% win...
>Joe_Edley: BMOZ C2 ZOMB. +36 228
>Chris_Tallman: ACEISUX D2 AXE +48 242
#note I didn't see EAUX C7! That's 45? Pretty sick play. D1 CASEIN is 47 and saves the X, but the S is more important for PREFABS. I was hoping to cash AXE and then hit PREFABS the next turn, but...
>Joe_Edley: ?AEEGRS 15A REStAGE +85 313
#note SERfAGE is 88, but yeah. This wasn't the turn of events I was looking for, clearly.
>Chris_Tallman: CIIRSSU 2B C..RS +36 278
#note Forgot about RESTAGED and thought I could wait on playing IS/RESTAGES. Even without that though, it keeps a much better leave and must be better than my play.
>Joe_Edley: DI H14 ID +36 349
#note Aah!
>Chris_Tallman: EHIISUV K9 HIVE +29 307
>Joe_Edley: IOW E4 WI.O +22 371
>Chris_Tallman: ?EIOPSU M4 SOUPIEr +72 379
#note Back in the game at last?
>Joe_Edley: AEEINOT 14B O.IA +19 390
#note He had 6 winning plays here - he picked the best one though.
>Chris_Tallman: AEIQUY I2 QU.Y +17 396
#note Best play, tied with QI D8
>Joe_Edley: EENT L12 TEEN +14 404
#note I had a glimmer of hope after SOUPIEr, but it was not to be. Still cool to get to play another legend of the game!
>Joe_Edley:  (AEI) +6 410
