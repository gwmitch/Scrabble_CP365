>Evans_Clinchy: AABDDEU 9H BADE +21 21
#note I really liked the defensive value of this over a stronger equity play like AUBADE or DAUBED. Sim vehemently disagrees, since ADU is a far, far worse leave than just D. AUBADE is 7 (?!) points better.
>Austin_Shin: EEGK 10F GEEK +26 36
>Evans_Clinchy: ADINTUY J7 T..Y +37 58
#note This time the more defensive play is definitely right.
>Austin_Shin: AGM 7F GAM +15 51
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ADFINU 11E FUD +20 78
#note Pretty clearly best. Sims way better than a weaker defensive play like AUF#.
>Austin_Shin: EOZ K5 ZOE.. +30 81
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AAINRV L1 VARIANt +91 169
>Austin_Shin: ?AHIISS 12D SASHImI +86 167
>Evans_Clinchy: DEIOQRW 8A WEIRDO +36 205
#note Apparently just QI is better, at 13C. Stronger defensive value, and the DEORW leave actually does pretty well on this board.
>Austin_Shin: EGO 1L .EGO +24 191
>Evans_Clinchy: AEILQRR C7 Q. +21 226
#note Definitely best - there are quite a few bingos I can hit by playing off one tile here.

>Austin_Shin: AEILRRT O7 RETRIAL +82 287
>Evans_Clinchy: EJNPPXY N12 YEX +33 331
#note Sim prefers plays that keep the X, like NY# 6E. Interesting - the pool includes IIOOOO, so I could hit PIX or POX at 13C for 39.

>Evans_Clinchy: FNNNPPS H12 .NNS +12 371
#note I figured it was better to turn over tiles and race to the end of the game rather than trade and give him more chances to fish. I also thought bingos were only slightly scarier into the S as the T that was already there in line 15 - Quackle says he's still only 6.5 percent to bingo after INNS, so that's encouraging. Really I think this play is fine as long as I draw at least one vowel, and fortunately there are 8 of them in the bag.

#note That... is crafty. Now I need to respond to his threat.
>Evans_Clinchy: AHNOPUV 14L V.. +13 414
#note THIS PLAY IS SO BAD. I know there's a 2/3 chance at this point he has a bingo - he either has TUMBLES or UMWELTS#, or he whiffed with BELSTUW. ALL I NEED TO DO IS PLAY (TOC)O AND EVERYTHING IS BLOCKED. Somehow I managed to miss that and leave the bingo line just sitting there, wide open. I had no time left, but that is no excuse. I suck.
>Austin_Shin: ELMSTUW 4D UMWELTS +82 421
>Evans_Clinchy: AHINOPU 1G PHO. +27 441
#note I also proceed to miss the spot for the (TET)H(ER) insertion, where there are numerous plays that win me the game. With about 3 seconds on my clock, I just slapped down PHOT instead.
>Austin_Shin: B C13 ..B +12 433
#note ...and then he goes out to force the tie. Except wait, no! I also challenged SASHIMI earlier in the game, because for some reason I thought that might be one of those Japanese words that didn't make it in yet. So that's an extra nickel... causing me to lose by exactly 5. What a terrible, terrible, terrible loss.
