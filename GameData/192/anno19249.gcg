#note The day before this game, I told Troy that closed boards weren't really my thing. Then the game proceeded to turn into a closed-board dink fest.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEIIVW 7C WIVE +16 16
#note WEEVI(L) should have been obvious. Did I know BELIVE was a word?  I'm leaning towards "no" on that one.
>Troy_Millington: AL E5 LA. +12 18
>Matthew_Larocque: BEFILOR 8A LIEF +47 63
>Troy_Millington: AIN 7H AIN +6 24
>Matthew_Larocque: AABOOOR 6A ABO +17 80
#note Kinda wanted to exchange since Troy must be really close to something here. Not sure.
>Troy_Millington: AET 6H TAE +14 38
#note That's a lot of one point letters, Troy. 
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAOORZ D4 AA +6 86
#note Just play ZOA? Troy has kind of made a mess and that's okay with me, having a nearly 50 point lead.
>Troy_Millington: G 6E .G +15 53
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOORZ A4 ZO. +22 108
#note Still no good reason to hang any floaters.
>Troy_Millington: EO 4A .OE. +13 66
>Matthew_Larocque: AENNORV I5 V..N +11 119
#note Troy, I forgot to mention that closed boards aren't so bad if I'm WINNING! Sorry.
>Troy_Millington: ET A8 .ET +3 69
>Matthew_Larocque: AEMNORR C2 RO. +6 125
#note Wish I had seen (O)R(B), instead I cave in and give him this R. 
>Troy_Millington: EEORSTU 2A RE.OUTES +70 139
#note A gift to you, Troy. You're welcome.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEMNR 1E MENACER +97 222
#note Oh wait, but I drew this. All part of the plan obviously!
>Troy_Millington: GO J1 .GO +8 147
#note Okay Troy, just let me float another R for you.
>Matthew_Larocque: GINTTUY 3I G.UTY +22 244

>Troy_Millington: DIN 5K D.IN +24 191
>Matthew_Larocque: EIINTTU O4 INTUIT +34 304
#note Learned a pair of new sixes - TENUTO/TENUTI.
>Troy_Millington: ?ADEKRU N9 UnRAKED +74 265
#note Okay I actually wasn't sure in the slighest if this was valid. But it seemed like a lost challenge would spell big trouble.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFNOPS O14 FE +29 333
#note I took kind of a long time to play this. Stupid blank racks.
>Troy_Millington: CPR 12L CR.P +22 287
>Matthew_Larocque: ?HNOPSS K10 POSH +27 360
#note SONSHIP!!!??? Nobody else gets a ship suffix. Oh wait, cousins do too. That is weird.
>Troy_Millington: IQ L9 QI +15 302
>Matthew_Larocque: ?MNRSSW 3E MaW +30 390
#note This only wins 99.27% of the time. Way to go Matt, you almost blew it. But yeah, SWaRM 11A allows me to go out next turn and catch him with some high point letters. Instead, I play the least optimal endgame of all time.
>Troy_Millington: BDI 2M BID +19 321
>Matthew_Larocque: NRSS 1E .......S +13 403
#note (PI)R(N)S or (E)NS.

#note That's for your H, Troy.
>Troy_Millington: DHL 4G .H +9 339

#note This is for your D.
>Troy_Millington: DL C6 ...D +16 355
>Matthew_Larocque: R 14M R.. +6 420
#note I also went over by 1 second, just to cement this wretched finish.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (L) +2 422
#note YAY! WINNAR!
