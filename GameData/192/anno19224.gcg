#note F6 CEE -- wtf, did i actually miss EMU... (-4).. but, i really thought for some reason that underlapping it made the board more closed; it doesn't, CEE is a bit better for that.
>frentz: EU G7 E..U +7 15
#note i hate this game
>cesar: CDDEIIO F3 IODIDE +18 32
#note HERE, BINGO PLEASE. yes quackle likes this best, but what should i actually play? the game is basically over after this play because i don't know the word EMU.

#note ghast does give up too much but i felt like i needed to take a chance. missed 4A GHETTO which is clear though. (-6) or GHAT at 11J which i'm not sure why I passed up. i also wanted to possibly bait GHASTS*
>frentz: AEILSST 11A SALTIES +71 249
#note that is not frustrating at all. actually, there is one aspect of my game that i am happy about and i think my sportsmanship has gotten a lot better. i still sulk too much when i lose though. i want to be like, shake your hand and say great game, and move on.
