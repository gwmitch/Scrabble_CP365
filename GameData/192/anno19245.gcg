#note Time to end my losing streak
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: CEI 10G E.IC +12 12
>Joshua_Sokol: DEHRSTX 15D HERDS +60 124
#note I should have played G9 H(E)X but I was scared he had a blank or an S or an Y. haha. Amnuay held this
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: EIMNORW 13H .IRWOMEN +76 88
#note 8H (T)IMEWORN
>Joshua_Sokol: ACFNOTX 14L FOX +53 177
#note F(I)X has its merits, but it seems FOX is a bit better long-term, since I'm much more worried about Amnuay scoring and staying within striking distance, as opposed to him bingoing again, and FOX protects against that very well, reducing his score as opposed to his bingo %. Perhaps I'm wrong. This was underscored by 2 to be worth just as much as F(I)X, making it even worse by every standard!

>Joshua_Sokol: ACHINOT --  -73 177
#note The choking is real, folks. I was thinking of CATHODIC. I did not see anything else that played.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: IOY A12 YO.I +36 158
>Joshua_Sokol: ACHINOT O8 CHITO. +36 213
#note still plays. Jackson is disappointed.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: AGGLLOP -  +0 158
#note at least this was challenged.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFINNR I9 F.N +21 234
#note 15L FA scores, this defends better against scoring and bingos while retaining more flexibility. Seems like this is better for those reasons. 
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: PU N9 UP +25 183
#note I was obviously worried about the Q, happy to see this come down instead.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINPRV C12 VA. +18 252
#note PREINVA(DE)* was not seen, but I don't think I would have tried it. PERVA(DE) is there though, and I like it a lot. Perhaps I should play VA(W) also, instead of defending, to make sure there are multiple places to bingo? Nah...
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: OOTT 15J OTTO +17 200
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINPRS G9 R.P +18 270
#note This time I probably shouldn't play defense and fish at the same time. I should leave multiple options open since if he bingos, I'm very likely to strike back, and in this case if he bingos, I'm not as likely to be able to maintain my lead and control of the game. so K11 PA(W) for me upon further analysis.

#note well, it appears I have to exchange. AES looks a bit better than ES here cause of the prevalance of consonants in the pool, but ES is also fine. I think it's close, and I still slightly prefer this choice.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: EKN L6 KEN +13 270
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIOOSZ 6J ZE. +36 354
#note This or L4 OA(KEN)? I really don't know. They both have a lot of benefits and few bad qualities. I think I'll take this.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: BDEM K3 EMB.D +24 294

#note nice for me!
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: ?BEISTU N1 SUBTIlE +71 365
#note many options score 75. I presume Amnuay just didn't see them. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIORRS 1G ROSARIE. +77 461
#note whew, this doesn't always win but it's my best shot by far.
