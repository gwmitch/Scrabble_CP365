#note I was expecting his bingo to hook ZING, allowing me to play KRAALING. But at least now I don't have to waste energy thinking of front extensions for ZING.

#note G11 WADE has no hooks left in the bag and blocks more nines (this is important).
>Adam_Ginzbert: AC 12H CA. +8 354
#note Actual rack, I think. This is a calculated fish on his part, hoping to draw AE for G2 ANTIELITE! YOGIC does a little better, than only need one of three E's left from his perspective.
>Thomas_Reinke: EEJNNUW 4H JEWE. +23 421
#note I saw he had an unplayable LINEATE, but didn't see ANTIELITE, which is out of my range of studied nines (those things are useless). Of course, being paranoid old me I blocked everything I could at once because I can't track. Adam was pretty bummed when I played this, he was thinking 15C JEW was gonna be my play and he'd win with a fished-for semi-obscure nine.

Sorry for the bummage, Adam.
