>Kristiina_Overton: AEEMTX 8E TAXEME +30 30
#note I'm guessing she just missed the higher scoring placements of this word. Good way to start things off!
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEJPRS J6 JE.P +29 29
#note If this was my leave I have no idea why I played this. A mistake for a mistake I suppose?
>Kristiina_Overton: BCIU E4 CUBI. +18 48
>Joshua_Sokol: AAERRSU 6J .URA +11 40
#note I never knew AERRS was so good. I should play A(M)U here. No need to open things up like this
>Kristiina_Overton: DIKNS 10F KINDS +38 86
>Joshua_Sokol: AEERSSS K6 .RSA +26 66
#note I didn't know REPASSES was a word. I missed that. But wait, there's more.
>Kristiina_Overton: DINQR M2 QIND.R +34 120
#note I also missed CARESSES...
>Joshua_Sokol: EELNSSV N3 SEEL +27 93
#note This wasn't a good play, but at least I got a challenge.
>Kristiina_Overton: DFI -  +0 120
>Joshua_Sokol: ABHNOSV 11E VAN +20 113
#note I felt like I should keep things relatively closed here and save BO(DE) for next turn. I don't think that was a good feeling.
>Kristiina_Overton: DFI 4K FI..D +22 142
#note I should play HOWE here instead, but I as in a defensive mood I think.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEHNOSW L9 HEWN +28 141
#note I wanted to start playing a more defensive game here since both blanks were still out and I wasn't that close to a bingo. I felt like I could outplay Kristiina fairly well if she could no longer bingo. That is the reason for this play.
>Kristiina_Overton: EMOU M10 MEOU +23 165
#note although this kind of sucked for that reason.
>Joshua_Sokol: BIIOSWY 4D I.Y +16 157
#note I was now in a pretty bad position after my draw, but I still felt confident, which is why I made this play. It looks like YOWI(E) is mucg better than this at H4. I missed it. Pretty sizeable mistake.
>Kristiina_Overton: CDET 7D C.TED +24 189
>Joshua_Sokol: BIOPSUW 3B WOP +20 177
#note I'm digging my hole deeper now, but at least I set up my case S and hope she cannot respond.
>Kristiina_Overton: ALY 2A LAY +27 216
>Joshua_Sokol: BGIISTV 14I VIBIST +33 210
>Kristiina_Overton: NO 15N ON +8 224
#note good, this means she doesn't have both blanks yet!
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEGIIT N8 GIE +13 223
#note I'm clueless here. I think I should have played GEE one spot down
>Kristiina_Overton: FO O8 OF +29 253
#note although this was the worst case scenario except ZONULEs or something
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIRTT 1A AT +18 241
#note this was probably my rack. Maybe I had a G instead of the R. I've got to take this spot though. And this was overscored by 3...
>Kristiina_Overton: OOOO -OOOO +0 253
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGIRRT 9C REI +14 255
#note She's running out of time, so I decide I can probably win by scoring. The Z is key though. I need to draw it to win. There's also a key scoring spot at 6E that I can't hit, so creating a new scoring spot seemed necessary anyway. Too bad I couldn't hit (TA)N(KA). RE(CITED) keeps a better leave for me, but it allows more bingos for my opponent and more scoring options when I am blankless and she very likely has at least one at this point. I need to play this.
>Kristiina_Overton: O 11K O.. +12 265
#note interesting play. I forgot to ask why she played it.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGORTTZ 10B GET +12 267
#note She's low on time still. I liked this play cause I saw that I could draw ZOO or ZOA for a lot and score in lots of places, as well as prevent her from bingoing. I don't think there's a better play here.
>Kristiina_Overton: AOR 8A ORA +12 277
>Joshua_Sokol: AOORTUZ 6E .UR +22 289
#note The other play that makes sense here is TZA(R). If there is something else, I'd like to know. TZA(R) seems to make it easier for Kristiina to win cause there aren't many Z spots for her to worry about and she can just go ahead and score well and quickly. A lot of the time she wins after making some sort of setup, which is difficult to do in the time she had remaining, but if I play BUR, I prevent her from scoring so easily and threaten many many Z plays that she may or may not see. If she sees them, she'll likely try to make a setup without giving me a better spot, and if she doesn't see them, she might try to block a spot and forget about another. 

In conclusion, I'm not going to go through a ton of endgames manually, but even if TZA(R) wins more endgames with perfect play on both sides, BUR seems quite likely better because it's extremely difficult for Kristiina to play a perfect, or even near-perfect endgame with two blanks, let alone with very little time left to spare. A lot of her wins after BUR are 9s ending in (DE) such as ALdEHy(DE), which I highly doubt she can find in time. In other words, I want suggestions here but before then BUR seems like the best play to me despite TZA(R) perhaps winning a few more endgames. 
>Kristiina_Overton: ??AEHLN K3 E. +5 282
#note So yeah, H1 ALdEHy(DE) is her best win. He(Y) or HE(Y) or Ha(Y) or HA(Y) win too, which I saw and hoped she didn't see, and LEmoNA(DE) wins too! Like I said she didn't have time to solve this complicated/difficult endgame, and went over this turn, trying to block ZOO and outscore after (G)AZOO.
>Joshua_Sokol: AGLOOTZ J1 AZO +34 323
#note I took all the time I had to make sure this won. I missed TZA(R), again. The best plasy looks like 3G ZLOT(E) here, which goes out in two.
>Kristiina_Overton: ??AHLN 1H fL.sH +30 312
#note she has outs but obviously can't find them. She wrote down both blanks on the same set of the alphabet on the slip, and I called the director to make sure that was OK. Greedy me.
>Joshua_Sokol: GLOT I8 .O. +17 340
>Kristiina_Overton: AN 15K AN +10 322
>Kristiina_Overton:  (GLT) +8 330
#note Final scores end up 343-330 for me and -20 for Kristiina, who ended up with -1:06.

I played crappily, missed stuff like I do, but this time I have the excuse of it being game 1 of the day.
