#note This is the only bingo from the E, nothing through the Y. 12A SALIENTS is a cool fit but way worse of a play.

#note N2 NOON scores a bit more and isn't as blatantly defensive.

#note Nice play, opens some lines and scores, something I have not been doing.

#note Spent a long time here. 4A INRUN is Quackle's fave, which is weird.

#note A8 LURID is the clear winner with 68% winning chances, with this at 14%, assuming he has the blank. SINKHOLE, KINESICS and KINETICS are still possible after this, but I'm in trouble here no matter what.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ?CEHIKN 5A CH.NE +32 312
#note Gabriel was super low on time here. Quackle suggests three outright winning plays, J9 RHEbOK, which scores 47 and is also impossible to see, B2 EaCH setting up high scoring outs in two spots, and B2 HaCK, scoring 42 and leaving an out or a 28 point 5B KINE, which he mentioned after the day's games had ended.

This also wins, after I play N6 SIX, if he doesn't go out and instead plays K11 KeG for 27, I can't score enough after A5 CURL and his out of 3C BI/ION wins by 1 point. Tough to come up with under serious time pressure.
