>David_Pearl: EGY 8G GEY +14 14
>Chris_Tallman: APRSUVY 7H YAUP +21 21
#note I should destroy the board with G8 GUV or G6 VUG and make him deal with it. I also missed H4 PURVEY.
>David_Pearl: AEINOSS K3 SENO.IAS +70 84
#note Immediate punishment.  Actually held it for a bit, mostly out of tilt lol.
>Chris_Tallman: LOORSSV 4G SOLV.R +20 41
#note Umm, VOLES? Really melting down here...
>David_Pearl: OU 3K .OU +8 92
#note Fish more
>Chris_Tallman: DJLNORS H1 DOJ. +36 77
>David_Pearl: AEIINRU 1E URE.INIA +60 152
#note Oops, slotted the D lol
>Chris_Tallman: ?CLNSTT 9J C.NT +7 84
#note 9J TALC seems better, 2 more points and does the same thing.
>David_Pearl: EGGIU 6D GIGUE +17 169
>Chris_Tallman: ?ABELST E5 L.BrATES +86 170
#note A bunch of 2x2's play here - this seems fine.
>David_Pearl: ?DIQ 12A QuID. +48 217
#note I was surprised that he'd do this and not QIS or something else. Doesn't seem worth it...
>Chris_Tallman: DFIILT B10 FL.ID +32 202
#note Only have 6 tiles from my rack here. Couldn't hit the Q, so I blocked it in case he was setting up qaid or something (plus this was the highest scoring play too)
>David_Pearl: EOTV 8A VOTE. +24 241
#note Plays for 2 more and gives up less at A7.
>Chris_Tallman: ACIRTXZ N3 RITZ +37 239
#note 10B (F)RI(T)Z, which I didn't see, scores the same and doesn't open the huge FRITZ spot for a cheap 44. Maybe I should open it given my deficit, though, idk.
>David_Pearl: DEH 8M EDH +23 264
#note Blocking O line from plays with ZA.
>Chris_Tallman: ACEEOWX F9 WAX +33 272
#note Underscored by 2. I saw DEWAX, but didn't want to open the 15 line - thereare only 2 I's left to go under DEWAX though, so maybe it's worth consideration. N8 (D)OW keeps the X and possibly sets it up along O10-O15, which I didn't consider, and I actually kinda like that. 
>David_Pearl: ABEIN M7 B..AINE +24 288
>Chris_Tallman: CEEFLMO 2N FE +44 316
#note Skillz
>David_Pearl: HOW L11 HOW +32 320
#note I wonder if he missed DOW/CANTO for 35 - I was missing that spot earlier too, as you saw. The H would be a useful tile to hold onto here to score with next turn.
>Chris_Tallman: CEELMOT N10 MEET +37 353
#note Saw N10 EMOTE first, but the EMOTER hook would be a killer. I was pretty happy with MEET, but N8 DOME and N8 DOLCE (CANTO hook again!) keep leaves that are less likely to go horribly wrong and hence are better plays going into this preendgame with my moderate advantage.
>David_Pearl: AN D4 NA. +10 330
#note Fishing, which seems alright given the deficit looks too difficult to overcome without a bingo for him and/or a lot of luck.
>Chris_Tallman: CELMORR 14I CORE +18 371
#note 14G CORMEL looks good too, but I wanted to block all the lanes at the bottom while retaining my M for J6 to make sure I outran.
>David_Pearl: AKNP 2B KNAP +24 354
>Chris_Tallman: LMORR 6J M.R +21 392
>David_Pearl: AIT B1 I.AT +8 362
#note C1 ANTI is 2 more
>David_Pearl:  (ORL) +6 368
#note Final score 389-368. I played pretty badly on the first few turn but made solid plays throughout and lucked out with the F draw, and it was enough to win.
