>Conrad: AEGIKVX 8G KEX +28 28
#note cBB: Quackle likes KIVA at 8F or 8G better. I would rather make this play, as I don't feel like GX is going to get me anywhere fast, but it's also possible that GX isn't as bad as I think - interesting opening rack.
>Mack: CEGILNZ H6 GE.Z +14 14
#note Mack: I really had no clue what to do here, and I think I probably misevaluated the position. I figured that I'd sometimes pick up an -ING bingo on row 6 and worst case have ZINC next turn, but Conrad is very likely to have an I and play on row 9. Unless I draw a bingo, which isn't too likely, a simple play like ZIG for Conrad makes it very difficult for me to do anything. I considered ZIN at 9F, but that retains a very mediocre leave and also gives back easy underlaps. There is no perfect solution here -- Quackle likes ZEK by about 3%, which severely limits Conrad's scoring options. Certainly not a huge error, but I'd probably choose ZEK if I had to do it over. cBB: I was really surprised to see this play, as it's no surprise that I favor a closed board against Mack, and he favors an open board against me.
>Conrad: AGILNSV 9F LA.ING +35 63
>Mack: CEHILNP K3 PECHIN. +30 44
#note Mack: There are no good fishing options, so I may as well score and dig for the blanks.
>Conrad: CDEISTV 4H VIC.D +30 93
>Mack: AHILORU J6 UH +19 63
#note Mack: At this point I should probably be more proactive about opening the board. I like 10B HOURI or 8L NAIRU a lot better in hindsight. 
>Conrad: DEFJLST I3 F.D +11 104
#note cBB: I thought about (KA)F because the expected value is so high just from drawing OU every now and then, but I have such an advantage on this board now, it seemed pointless to play that or (P)ELF. (P)ELF could be good, but there's also a halfway decent chance Mack has an S at this point. I just see no reason to give him any opportunities here, and if I draw any of AIO, J_(G) for 27 continues to improve my rack, and force him to open more.
>Mack: AAILMOR J2 MO. +21 84
#note Mack: For the same reasons as the last play, I think MOIRA or NORIA would have been much better options.
>Conrad: BEJLOST E8 OBJET +47 151
#note cBB: Just JOB would be pretty funny, but now seems like a good time to go on the offensive. Just JO(G) is also interesting, but both plays do sacrifice a fair bit now.
>Mack: AAEILPR D11 PILEA +24 108
#note Mack: At this point I wanted to score a bit, open the board as much as possible, and go for the blanks. This play seems to satisfy all those qualities pretty well.
>Conrad: ILMNRSS 15C M.RLINS +27 178
>Mack: AEFIRR C12 FAR. +30 138
#note Mack: Not sure of my 7th tile here.
>Conrad: ADEOSTT D2 TOASTED +75 253
>Mack: EEIORRU 2B OU.ER +14 152
#note At this point I need to take some risks, hence this over OUTRE to bring hooks into play.
>Conrad: NQRUUVY 4B QU.Y +16 269
#note cBB: I dont see any reason to leave the hooks open here.
>Mack: EEINORS 10E .OE +23 175
>Conrad: NORSUVY F4 SOY +31 300
#note cBB: I remember making this play very quickly, as Mack's time was starting to dwindle. Bad decision, though, as 1E YOURN is a pretty stupid miss.
>Mack: ?EINORS 11G SNOwIER +70 245
#note Mack:I realized after I played this I probably should have played SORdINE to create an S hook incase I get the other blank. Not a big mistake, but every bit is crucial at this point. cBB: I was really happy he played something without an S hook. I feel like this is maybe a bigger mistake than Mack does, but I have the additional knowledge of my own rack, so, I'll just consider myself fortunate here.
>Conrad: NNRTUVW L10 V.RTU +16 316
>Mack: AAAEEGI 14B A..AE +20 265
#note Mack: This looks best by far -- I need to score and dump vowels, both of which this play accomplishes.
>Conrad: ?ILNNRW 13I WIL. +11 327
#note cBB: 5A WIN(S) is probably a better play here, but I opted to play it safe.
>Mack: AABEEGI 12L .EI +5 270
#note Mack: At this point I really have no other hope, so I played this hoping for N? for BEANbAG.
>Conrad: ?ANNORT O7 NATRONs +76 403
>Mack: AABDEGT 1E BADGE +33 303
>Conrad: IW 6B WI. +14 417
