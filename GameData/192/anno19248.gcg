>Matthew_Larocque: ACEILOR H4 CALORIE +74 74
#note Played this too fast - COALIER (or LORICAE which I forgot) don't offer S-hooks.
>Rod_Weis: EFNTT 5G F.TTEN +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: AAENNPT G7 NAP +21 95
#note NAPA? Didn't want to open that kind of hotspot for 3 extra points.
>Rod_Weis: EORV 4K ROVE +20 38
#note That's pretty ballsy, Rod. The chances of me not having any hooks for ROVE are extremely low.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEINOT O1 ATONIA +30 125
>Rod_Weis: AF N6 FA +26 64
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIJMM N1 MIM. +28 153
#note Can't take advantage of his setup. It also didn't seem worth it to sacrifice points to play vertical at M7 since it doesn't really block it anyways. I did spend a lot of time here, many plays score similarly. I didn't know MAMIE which Q likes at I8. However AJE(E) 10E for 33 does muck up the S hook, and the Ms seem like they're decent enough letters to score with on this board.
>Rod_Weis: EGIILRS 11B GIRLIES +76 140
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIJQU D8 QUA.E +48 201
#note I think I played this over QUI(R)E because *QUARES? Q says I made a mistake and QUIRE is clearly better.
>Rod_Weis: AHKR 8L HARK +51 191
#note That sucks.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGGIJNO F6 JOG +34 235
#note I kind of stopped looking when I saw this - B8 JOG(G)ING scores 42 and clears the rack. The A12 hotspot isn't that likely to get used.
>Rod_Weis: DIORV F10 V.ROID +20 211
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGINU 15A GUANI.Es +140 375
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGINU --  -140 235
#note I'm pretty sure I've tried this before, and it didn't work before either. I basically just whiffed all the bingos here, sadly. However, Rod has never challenged me before. If I believed *GUANIDES was a word maybe he would too? Naw, terrible play.
>Rod_Weis: DEORSTU 14B OUTR.DES +68 279
#note It's always a bad feeling when you get your bingo challenged off and your opponent slaps theirs down.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGINU 13I UNItAGE +69 304
#note LINGUAE, seventy nine! This does fork some TWS hotspots though.
>Rod_Weis: BEIN N10 BIN.E +28 307
>Matthew_Larocque: CDHLNOX 15K CLOD +18 322
#note Drawing an E was kind of important to be able to play at 15H - I did draw the X though, so I decided to gamble on (D)EX for 63 while semi-blocking the other TWS. To my surprise, Quackle likes it too. I figured it might be too big a sacrifice to score only 18 in hopes of scoring 63 when I can just score like 40 this turn.
>Rod_Weis: EWY 9K YEW +27 334
>Matthew_Larocque: EHLNTXZ 15F .EX +63 385
#note It worked, but I really need to draw a vowel.
>Rod_Weis: EPW 10J PEW +28 362
>Matthew_Larocque: DHILNTZ 15A ZIT +40 425
#note I actually apologized to Rod here - Scrabble just isn't fair sometimes. Guess I should play ZIN instead since the T pairs better with the H. I don't think it makes a big difference on this board though.
>Rod_Weis: AT 11J AT +20 382
>Matthew_Larocque: DHLNOSY O11 NO.LS +49 474
#note lol
>Rod_Weis: ?BESU C13 B.. +10 392
>Matthew_Larocque: DHY 7M Y. +22 496
#note (T)HY is better obviously, I just went into greedy mode to get a higer score. :/
>Rod_Weis: ?ESU 3I UsES +10 402
>Rod_Weis:  (DH) +12 414
#note I know it's a cliche thing to say, but it really IS better to be lucky than to be good. Because I can only play decently for like 5 turns then I have no time left and rely on power tiles to coast through ;).
