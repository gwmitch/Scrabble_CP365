#note this sims very close to H7 QAT but in the end i think i might as well take the points?

>Cesar: ??ADIRT 10H sATyRID +80 92
#note ok, i may be taking this aggressive thing too far. i saw sTAIDeR but just wanted the extra points. i guess if i'm gonna try playing like quackle i should try to make all the top moves it suggests, huh? satyrid sims higher by about 1.2 pts, i'm still doubtful that it's better though :)

#note or winier, but IN is apparently better than AN.

#note ok, here is where i start doing silly things. i realy wanted to try to find the best play here, i spent a long time, and i did FIND the best play, it's simply N13 OF, but just felt like i needed to get rid of more stuff. then i laid down COOF, thought whatever, hit the clock, and thought bah, OF has to be better than that. so i still gotta make my candidate plays lists and try to rank them before i play anything. (-9) NOO G2 is the defensive play here, too.
>Ira: MOP E11 MOP +27 257
>Cesar: CEJLNOT 14B JOLE +30 299
#note JOLT N2 is ok too.
>Ira: IPRT N2 TRIP +16 273
>Cesar: ACDFNTU K1 FAD +21 320
#note ok -- this is CLEARLY the wrong play. completely forgot about ATRIP -- ugh! i wonder if i'm ever gonna get my hooks down. 1K DUCAT is much better. or FAD/ATRIP or even 15C FAD which i considered sims better. the interesting thing is, i thought of FUNDI 4D but thought it was just unnecessarily aggressive, and it turns out it sims second. so i'm still not being aggressive enough. (-14.5)
>Ira: INOR 15A NORI +29 302
>Cesar: CDENNTU 2F CU. +11 331
#note and another very poor move. i was starting to run out of time here and trying as hard as i could to find something decent. still, quackle is a little absurd to suggest 2D ENDUE, i'll be damned if thats not just ridiculously aggressive. 2D DUNCE is what i wanted to play instead of my move, but for some reason the tile pool looked fruitful (not so much right now). (-16)
>Ira: EIRS 1K .RISE +34 336
#note now i'm in big trouble. anyway, here's my endgame play. this endgame is technically unwinnable, but look for a couple minutes to see what's the best way you could try to steal a win here...

#note ira was nice, he called BRR one of the best plays he'd ever seen and was showing it to people at club. my only hope was that he'd just take the points and not see my out. the out is not that tricky, but psychologically i don't think ira thought i was trying to win after BRR. he later told me that he should have considered that i was "up to something". he was also very strongly debating 6I HE but decided he'd just take the points since i'm not going out anyway...
