>Jason: AFMOPRZ 8F ZARF +32 32
#note OK, where to put it? Speedy and Championship Player like the standard 8G placement. Championship Player even likes 8H over this, which I think is nuts.
>Danny_Kidd: INORSTU G7 R.INOUTS +61 61
#note See, Ducky? If he knew the sevens here, I'm in deep soup if I put this at 8G or 8H! As it was, he shorted himself 17 by not knowing the sevens, and another one when he scored it as 60.
>Jason: AGIMOPR H12 PAIR +38 70
>Danny_Kidd: IPTY 12G ..PITY +26 87
#note I teased Danny by saying something like "that's way over your head!"
>Jason: BEGHMOR 11J HEM +32 102
>Danny_Kidd: EFI I6 FI.E +12 99
>Jason: BDEGORU H1 BROGUE +38 140
#note Correctly passing on BROGUED* at J1.
>Danny_Kidd: IJN 3G J.IN +20 119
>Jason: DEILNOU 1C UNILO.ED +62 202
#note Yay! One of the racks I've studied (and constantly flub)! Picked this since I always miss it and I figured it was more likely to be challenged. Unheld, though.
>Danny_Kidd: CLL J10 C..LL +18 137
>Jason: DEGQTVW K3 TEW +24 226
#note Well, I'd only lost 1.8 points in five turns ... the mistakes had to come eventually. Not exchanging's only a slight hit, though.
>Danny_Kidd: EHM L4 HEM +31 168
#note Ha! I got one more for my HEM play!
>Jason: AADGIQV 11E AV. +12 238
#note Speedy's clear favorite of DIVA at M5 is insane with only two I's and one U out. I liked this setup.
>Danny_Kidd: DEEIRR D1 .ERDIER +16 184
#note Hmm ... I see ??SSS are still in the bag. Thought for sure NERDIEST was going down.
>Jason: AADEGIQ 12B QAID +31 269
#note Works perfectly, now I score and block.
>Danny_Kidd: AUY B12 .UAY +32 216
#note Wanted to keep the Y for a CHILL-Y play, but correctly jettisons it.
>Jason: ACDEGST 15A C.ST +30 299
#note Eight-point equity hit, but pleased this is Championship Player's second pick, behind STAGED at 15J, which I considered.
>Danny_Kidd: BE 6B BE. +11 227
>Jason: AADEGIN C1 .NAI +17 316
#note Even if I'd seen A(P)E at I11, don't know if I'd have played it. Maybe got too carried away with blocking.
>Danny_Kidd: OW B2 OW +22 249
#note Danny made a comment about me sitting on both blanks, to which I said I didn't have any. "Don't lie to me, kid!" he said.
>Jason: ADEGKTX 13A T.X +38 354
>Danny_Kidd: ?AEENTV M5 NAiVETE +79 328
#note Uh, now I'm only up 27 with two in the bag and ?SS unseen? (gulp)
>Jason: ADEGKLO F8 .A +13 367
#note Still don't know if this is the right play. Couldn't bring myself to play LO(V)ED or GA(V)EL. Didn't think he had it, but didn't want to risk it.
>Danny_Kidd: ?GNOOOS B6 .ONGO +10 338
>Jason: ADEGKLO 8K LO.ED +30 397
#note Danny pulled the last tile out and I asked what it was. "Another S!" he grumbled. "Oh, poor baby!" I said. Matt Robin chimed in, too. Then he pointed out the three better plays: LAKED at N1 (7 better, but wasn't sure), GLADE at N2 (6 better, just whiffed), and GOAD at A7 (6 better, I saw LOAD in the same spot).
>Danny_Kidd: ?OSS 15J SOnS +14 352
#note Danny's honest about his place in the Scrabble pecking order, but despite our difference in rating, he always seems to give me fits whenever we play, and this was no exception.
