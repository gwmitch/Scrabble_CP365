>rrobinsky: EIKOTUZ 8F ZOUK +34 34
#note Quackle's least preferred placement, losing out to 8H by about 2.4 points.  Bah, I say.
>dewk: ENOORSS J2 SOONERS +79 79
#note Quackle slightly favors NOOSERS J5, opening the two 2x2 lines.  -1.6
>rrobinsky: AEIITTU 5H UI.TAITE +66 100
#note Thanks for the N, Dave!
>dewk: ?BEEELS F6 jE.EBELS +74 153
#note Well, it's good to know that despite its preference to open multiple 2x2 lanes and maximize the volatility of the Z, Quackle still respects the hanging E in the triple lane.  BEE(T)LErS N2 is favored by a bit here.
>rrobinsky: ADGIIMN 4L MAID +35 135
#note Quackle agrees.
>dewk: ENORRTW O1 WON..RER +108 261
#note Dave: "I was thinking damn, he blocked my bingo...wait a minute"
>rrobinsky: GIINNOR 13A NIGRO.IN +70 205
#note I'm supposed to win 12.73% of the time now!
>dewk: DGHPQTW M3 Q..D +28 289
#note The duck likes I3 WH(I)P for 34, saving Q(AI)D for a likely worst-case 28 next turn.
>rrobinsky: ?AAEITT A8 ATTAI.Ed +122 327
#note If you've never seen someone's winning chances go up 50% in one turn before, you have now.
>dewk: EGHIPTW H10 WHI.GE +42 331
#note Best by far.
>rrobinsky: ADDEGMY H1 DADG.M +39 366
#note Example #53442 of why when you see a decent play (E9 MAY 34), keep looking for a better option.  I'm pretty proud of myself for this one.
>dewk: AFILOPT D12 P.OF +26 357
#note I'm not sure if B13 (I)F is as strong as Quackle thinks it is, or if it's overvaluing the fish.  IF may well be right, but I don't think it's as clear-cut as the duck is making it out to be.
>rrobinsky: EEHNOPY 1A PHONEYE. +104 470
#note Dave: "I thought *I* was gonna run away with this one."...Rob: "Hehe, so did I."
>dewk: AAILRTU 11H .ULA +14 371
#note Quackle likes B7 URIAL, but there are about 5 plays equal to it in equity and another two comparable in winning chances, including HULA.
>rrobinsky: FIJLSXY B12 F.X +49 519
#note My play has by far the highest equity...and requires the least amount of thought...but Quackle says I cannot lose if I make any reasonable play blocking columns C and D.  I don't get it.
>dewk: ACILRRT C1 .RC +10 381
#note Somehow 9C CRI(E)R is supposed to win 3 of 1000 games.  Okay.
>rrobinsky: IJLNSTY B6 JIN +28 547
#note I knew JITN(E)Y was the better play, but I'll admit it...I was being greedy, and didn't want both V's out of the bag.
>dewk: AILRTUV 4A VIAL +28 409
#note Quackle's valuation makes no sense to me here.  4B VAULT is 20.4 points better than the next best option?  Really?
>rrobinsky: ACELSTY N8 ACETYLS +80 627
#note If I could get rewarded for "mistakes" like this every time I played...
>dewk: ABERTUV 12K BEV. +28 437
