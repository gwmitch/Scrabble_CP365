#note Neither George nor I recorded racks, so I don't have the racks for this game except for the last two turns.  But, this game turned on the final play for each of us, so it is an interesting endgame position.

#note This was miscounted as 31 in the game, so it made the endgame look even more razor thin than it was.

#note I saw AUGURER relatively quickly, but wasn't sure of it.  At first, I missed the place to play it, because I thought it would but up against another word.  I only saw that the spot was open later.
>George_Viebranz: ACEEHOS 14B CEASE +26 409
#note George has but one play that is a guaranteed win (by 1 point).  CASH at M10 for 34.  Although he has 2 other plays that probably give him the game ([R]HEAS at M8 and O[D]AHS at c3, both for 37 points), as I would not find the star play to win against those.
>Dallas_Johnson: ?AEY O8 .EArY +16 404
#note The star play is EAsY at M10 for 27, which I missed.  I saw EYrA at 03 for 21, but wasn't 100% on it.  I was just about to play it and gamble, when I saw (W)EArY at O8 for 16, which I had already calculated would give me what I thought was a 1 point win.  I should have recounted the game then, but I didn't, which was a gamble in itself, but I picked up 4 extra points when we found the EME scoring error, and I won by 5.
