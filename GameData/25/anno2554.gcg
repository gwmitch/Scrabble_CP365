>David: AEIRSVW 8D WAIVERS +84 84
#note A rather unsettling start to the contest.
>Steve_: AEEIKLR 9C KEA +19 19
#note In five games I've had four playable bingos on my opening rack. This is the second miss. I was tempted to try and get away with EARLIKE*, as LEAKIER was a non-go. 
>David: IP 10B PI +16 100
>Steve_: EIILOPR 11A LIRIOPE +79 98
#note How I find this bingo and miss WEAKLIER shows the vagaries of the game, and our love-hate relationship with it.
>David: AEINOSS I7 E.ASIONS +61 161
>Steve_: ?ADEQST 14I .QuADS +70 168
#note Although it's close, Q championship player actually likes keeping the blank and playing QAT(S) for 33. That can't be right for this human player.
>David: OUZ 12I .UZO +26 187
>Steve_: DEEORTT N7 TETRODE. +61 229
>David: IT O8 TI +14 201
>Steve_: BILMUVW M6 VUM +17 246
#note I was so hoping to be able to play VI(E)W at 8L, I didn't see the chance to play it at 13L. Major error.
>David: DEN 12B END +27 228
>Steve_: BEHILOW 5J BEHOWL +37 283
#note Better to play WHIZ and keep the O hook and a nice leave.
>David: GILR O1 GRIL. +21 249
>Steve_: ?EITUXY N2 EX +31 314
#note I'm a YUTZ for missing this best play. A nine point equity error.
>David: GIN L2 NIG. +16 265
>Steve_: ?FITTUY K10 FI. +30 344
#note Again, why not FUTZ or YUTZ? Jeez Louise.
