>whatnoloan: ADHHLMN 8G HM +14 14
#note Quackle prefers HM at 8H because of the H set up. DHAL and HALM are both better as well, although I don't think I knew HALM. The differences between all of these plays and HM 8G are all less than 1 though.
>dacrON: ABCFNSZ G5 BAC. +14 14
#note Exchange BFZ looks best here.
>whatnoloan: AADEHLN F4 DAH +32 46
#note Simply AH is better. NAH is also good here. I should listen to what my opponent always says. LN sucks! No natural logarithms for Conrad.

>whatnoloan: GOPSUVX 3E GOX +27 147
#note Somhow I didn't play VOX. I don't know why. VUGS 13A is best, keeping POX for next turn.
>dacrON: DEJNSTU 13B JUSTED +44 104
>whatnoloan: PRSTUUV C7 PUR +21 168
#note I didn't like VAU or VUG, but I guesthe TUV has terrible synergy. TUP is better than this, a VAU sims best of all. But I like anoher play that sims worse than this-CUTUP 7G. This rids me of both Us and keeps me with a leave that I honestly don't hate. Then again, the PRSTU leave has good synergy-PU is not so bad. 
>dacrON: AAENORS 14A EON +26 130
#note Best is the awesome ZINGANO 11C.
>whatnoloan: ASTUVWY 8A VA..T +24 192
#note I thought about TAV, which sims best. But, with the inference of the S on his rack (I thought he might be fishing, and I remember him saying something about bingoing) this is best.
>dacrON: AAEGPRS 11A GA.... +17 147
>whatnoloan: IMSTUWY 9H MY +17 209
#note AUGH! I rarely, almost never make such an awful play. MY 15A plays for bundles of points. YUM here and pretty much anything else is better! This is the most horrid play I've made in a long time.
>dacrON: AAEPRSS H4 ASP +24 171
#note Here, the bingo SARAPES plays.
>whatnoloan: DIISTUW -IITUW +0 209

>whatnoloan: ACDEIRS 14F RADICES +78 287
>dacrON: EIIIKQW L12 QI. +24 300
#note KIWIS looks to be the star play here.
>whatnoloan: ?AEFTTU 2B TUFA +17 304
#note This is an important problem with my game-knowing when to play defense and when not to. Many plays sim better tha thi, the top 7 all keep the U! And TUFA I1 even sims better than this!!! FIT seems best. I don't agree with lots of Quackle's plays, but this play could put me down the hole really fast.
>dacrON: EIIKNRW 1E WINK +40 340
>whatnoloan: ?ENOOTT 3A NOT +12 316
#note OOT is clearly better!!!
>dacrON: EIIOORU -IIOOU +0 340
>whatnoloan: ?ENOOTV 10I OVEN +20 336
>dacrON: EEEILLR J12 LI.E +6 346
#note ETOILE B1 or LIEVE is best.
>whatnoloan: ?EIOOOT A3 .OO +4 340
#note OI or numerous exchanges are apparently better. I love OI.
>dacrON: EELRRUY 9K RULY +12 358
#note QUEY sims very high here. He knew I had a blank though, and was pretty sure I had both. I kind of like QUEY though. If I bingo, he might be able to get a good play there. On the other and, it doesn't deserve to be supposedly so much better than this. I like Conrad's play a lot,actually.
>whatnoloan: ?EIIOTT M11 TIT +21 361
#note Champ player somehow thinks that fishing off the I is best. However, I am sure Conrad is going to be able to block the middle right hand side of the board, and I don't have any possible bingos at 2H, and I know he will block probably by hooking or extending IRE. I know he has the second blank because he said "I wasn't expecting to get that." IRE seems to me like a bad play.
>dacrON: ?EEIIOR 10N OI +11 369
#note Better up on top because I get no out. OE also wins, and is better by one point.
>whatnoloan: ?BEIO I2 OBI +10 371
#note 8K OBE, 8J rOBE and lOBE all tie.  rEBOIL wins. Somehow I didn't see it, even though I had 1:52 left. I knew my play was awful, but I was caught up in a dangerous haze.
>dacrON: ?EEIR J2 EyRIE +18 387
#note REtIREE is best.
>dacrON:  (E?) +2 389
