#note This is close with GITE and exch. GIIOT. It is only about .5 behind GITE. I really wanted to keep an E, but GITE looks best.

>whatnoloan: ?BEIOOT 11D EOBIO.Ts +86 94
#note Although this is by far the best, note a cool bingo here: B(R)OOkITE.

#note Many better plays gthan this. Quackle likes HI L8 and HUB H$ better. This game was tough for the rest of the time because of the way the board was and how hard it was to score. HUB gives me chances to draw great stuff like K(ART)ING at 12H.
