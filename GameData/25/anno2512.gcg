>Pete: ADGIRST K5 DITA +19 19
#note A whole bunch of better plays here.  I got obsessed with the A hook, because I'm a mediocre scrabble player.  GAD is probably the best, but there is no truly great play in this position. 
>Jeff_Clark: DJN 6I DJ.N +28 44
#note Jeff is my second most frequent opponent lifetime.  During most of our games, I've been between 100 and 500 points behind him in rating, so entering this game with a 6-10-1 lifetime record didn't bother me too much.  Without Bill Menor, I felt like the challenges would be adjudicated accurately... and since there's always a challenge (or two) when I play Jeff, that's a good thing.

>Pete: GHHRSSV M6 SH +22 41
#note who woulda thought drawing at three consonants would lead to this?  I decided to get a bit too cute and set up the second H for a play to the triple word.  Duck likes playing SHH in the same place.  Excahnging never crossed my mind, and all exchanges finished well behind.  
>Jeff_Clark: AFR 8M ARF +24 68
#note Jeff obviously had no idea I was planning on using that spot.
>Pete: BGHIRSW -BGHIW +0 41
#note Duck likes a bunch of plays that don't score, don't leave well and open the board for my opponent.  When faced with a situation like this, I think to something Hector told me... A play should have a purpose, either offense or defense... sometimes the worst thing to do is make a purposeless play.  Duck likes ex BGW best of the exchanges, but I stand by mine...
>Jeff_Clark: ABCEESU 5C BECAUSE +75 143
>Pete: CDIIMRS H1 IMID. +30 71
#note best.  Very glad I threw back the I last turn.  Glad I didn't know DIMERIC, because I probably would have tried to add the S and get it challenged off.
>Jeff_Clark: AAH 4B AAH +26 169
>Pete: CEELORS 9B CREOLES +69 140
#note best. Eventually drawing into three consonants had to work.
>Jeff_Clark: EIRX 2F RE.IX +32 201
>Pete: DELNOQT F4 Q.T +14 154
#note best.  Gotta love the easy ones.
>Jeff_Clark: AEUV 3J UVEA +23 224
>Pete: DEELNOO B9 .ONDOLE +24 178
#note I missed NOODLE.  I felt like getting aggressive after his last play and with score considerations in miind, and CONDOLE felt right. It sims only slightly behind NOODLE, and opens things up for a shootout, if Jeff can't nail me right away.  With 2 blanks unseen, I decided to go for turnover.
>Jeff_Clark: AELV 15A L.AVE +36 260
>Pete: ?EEKPTZ 2M ZEK +43 221
#note best. When I saw my draw, I felt good... score notwithstanding, I felt like I would find a way to win from here.  ZEK was an easy play with a kickass leave... I'll take it.
>Jeff_Clark: ABINOT A4 BIOTA +42 302
>Jeff_Clark: ABINOT --  -42 260
#note   Always have to be on the lookout against Mr. Lucky.  
>Pete: ?EGPSTU O1 S.EG +33 254
#note My first miss of the tourney... I saw the bingo, but missed the hooks.  Duck notwithstanding, I like my play.  I was more concerned about burning the E than the S, actually.  I sacrificed the points SKEP would get for the better UP vs. GU synergy.
>Jeff_Clark: ABINOT 1A BONITA +29 289
>Pete: ?PPRTTU 2B PUT +22 276
#note best.  Hoping for a couple vowels next turn.
>Jeff_Clark: INW 10E WIN +23 312
>Pete: ?IOPRTU 14E POUTIeR +64 340
#note PROTIUM scores 2 more, but I didn't know it.  with the last blank unseen, it's not over...
>Jeff_Clark: OR 6C OR +13 325
>Pete: ?EGIOOY H12 YE.I +33 373
#note and I miss IDEOLOGY.  I was so hung up hoping for a T for ETIOLOGY, I missed the far easier one.  YETI is second best, ties u a couple of the best lines, and scores.
>Jeff_Clark: EILMNRT 15J REMINT +36 361
#note best. 
>Pete: ?GOOWY 9L WYe +27 400
#note best.  and I can exhale. 1-0 for the day.
