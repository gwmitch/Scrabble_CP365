>Jeremy: AKNOPRT 8H PRANK +32 32
#note best, but vulnerable to extensions.  Way back when with Maven, I simmed out enitire games that could with five letter opening moves that could be extended with only -ING to find out at what value does the opening play drop your win percentage below 50%.  The answer was if the tile values before doubling or bonusing in any way added up to 13 or less, the play had a win percentage over 50%.  RETAX would be risky but okay.  BANJAX you'd reposition.  In the event you are carrying two of I,N,G ... make the risky play anyway. 
>Vera: BGR J6 BR.G +13 13
>Jeremy: EGLMNOT L8 .ETOL +18 50
#note I talk myself out of L8  (K)LONG so I can keep NG for PRANK-ING if I draw an I.  -4.7 equity mistake.
>Vera: TW 11J TW. +12 25
>Jeremy: CEGMNNO 6G COM. +10 60
#note For a move that didn't make the initial top 15, COM(B) does pretty well. -7.3 equity to K2 CONGE.  Again I'm in the pit trap of keeping -NG.

#note best.  Hit my I finally.

>Jeremy: EINQRTW 3I WITEN +30 188
#note best... WITEN* is phony as I suspected when I played it.  Confused over a conversation about WITAN extending to something, it's actually *WITEN than extends to WITENAGEMOT.  A stupidly brilliant extension for GEMOT.  *WITEN wins the sim for setting up my Q, especially if I pick up another I (but only if it stays on).
>Vera: ACNRRTU -ACNRR +0 146
>Jeremy: EELMQRY J2 Q. +31 219
#note best.  Vera asks with a grin, "what - no I?"  Nope.  I was hoping for one though.
>Vera: ADDENTU 2J .AT +17 163
>Jeremy: EEHLMRY 4F HEME +17 236
#note K5 HEME/(COMB)E wins the sim.  Three blanks and an S unseen, I want to be the first to them to stack on a bingo to improve my lead. -2.4 equity.
>Vera: DEGLNU 3B LUNGED +30 193
>Jeremy: AFJLRRY C2 J.RY +14 250
#note taking a turn to dump some junk, and I preserve the 2F F hotspot.  Quack likes taking points at E3 with GREY/R(HEME) which I confess I was not creative enough to spot. -3.6 equity.
>Vera: EE D3 .EE +15 208
>Jeremy: AAFFLOR 2F FOR +35 285
#note E5 ALFA. -2.5 equity.
>Vera: IT E5 TI +16 224
>Jeremy: AADFLOU 1H OF +21 306
#note I6 (M)O(R)A keeping ADFLU wins the sim.  Ugly.  Not like my leave is pretty or anything. -0.6 equity.

>Jeremy: ?AAHOOS E11 AHA +39 387
#note best on Many ply sims.  There are 2 moves with 100% win percentages after 500 iterations.  This is one of them.  11D (Z)OOS is the other, but the valuation isn't as good.
>Vera: ADO 13C OD. +23 317
>Jeremy: ?ABLOOS B10 BOOSt +29 416
#note (P)OBLAnOS at H8 is the bingo.  If you found it... you win a gold star and a happy face sticker.  What I found is good enough to win, but is only -74 points below optimal.
