#note The sim, for whatever that's worth, values a lot of non-trading plays about equally -- ABA 9G, ATE I7, AIN G6, IF 7G, etc. My thinking was that I'd let her open the board for me, scoring virtually nothing in the process, and then I'd keep a strong leave to bingo through her play. Perhaps that's not foolproof, but it still seems like a viable option. Or does it? I'm really not sure. Quackle says -6.

#note Pretty awful play. NEB 12K scores 20 keeping a nice balanced CEIL -- that looks best. But there are like 10 other plays better than mine -- BEANIE and BALE are better in the same spot, for example. A static -5, a simmed -13.

#note Oooh, STROKE and KETOSE at O1 score a bunch. I was focusing a little too much on leave here. -3

#note SOX 10H is best, I suppose... I was just afraid of what that would do to the board. Down 100, I'd rather swing the board wide open. Probably not wise. -13

#note Plays like this are a good indicator that I should get off my ass and actually study Superleaves. Guessing this stuff based on intuition can only get you so far. Superleaves has SS at 11.319941773107 and DS at 9.18118650749678; SOLVED is definitely better than SOLVES here. -4

>Evans: DEHIORS 15A HODS +35 247
#note OSES 14B is really cool --  scores 23, keeps DEHIR, and opens a hook into a TWS lane for a huge play making DOSES/HOSES/ROSES. I wish I'd thought of that. -9
