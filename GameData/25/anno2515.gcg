>Matthew: BEILNRU 8D BLUER +20 20
#note Middle of the pack amongst a bunch of alright plays. Best is BURIN, proving once again my fives knowlege is shaky.
>Max_Panitch: AFG 7G FAG +24 24
>Matthew: EGIJNOS J1 JINGOES +77 97
>Max_Panitch: ADEEIOP 3C OEDIPEA. +80 104
>Matthew: ACHIIMN 1H HA.I +42 139
#note Best.
>Max_Panitch: ACDR 4A CARD +28 132
>Matthew: CIKMNOY 9F MYC +36 175
#note Gigantic fuckup here. The obvious, obvious, obvious play is (C)OCKY, but instead I spend a minute talking myself out of CONKY (which is valid!). And, as with all my mistakes, the punishment is severe.
>Max_Panitch: ?AENSTU A1 NUT.ASEs +131 263
>Matthew: BEIKNOO 2F KOI +43 218
#note Best. Closes the gap a bit.
>Max_Panitch: ILP 10D LIP +24 287
>Matthew: BEEEMNO C10 BEEN +20 238
#note A close second to a nice play I missed: J4 GENOME for a balanced leave and an open board.
>Max_Panitch: DEW 12B D.W +14 301
>Matthew: AEMNORT 5E ANTER.OM +90 328
#note Look who's back in the lead!
>Max_Panitch: AIORSTU 11F SAUTOIR +72 373
#note D-:
>Matthew: GIILLQU J9 QU.LL +16 344
#note Q does not like my leave here at all. All of the best plays score 8-14 points and KEEP the Q. I was too desperate to unload it and draw into a miracle bingo.
>Max_Panitch: EFT M11 EFT +20 393
>Matthew: EEGIIOR L9 GI.O +20 364
#note Right idea. Best is GORIER, same spot.
>Max_Panitch: ANT N12 TAN +14 407
>Matthew: AEEIRVX O13 VEX +47 411
#note Holy cow. In the lead again.
>Max_Panitch: EHNR 4L HERN +30 437
>Matthew: AEIORSW O3 S.OWIER +30 441
#note Best by far according to Q is OW 3L. It blocks what Max is about to do to me, but it still leaves the N open and keeps too many tiles. How is it 92% win?! With SNOWIER, I have a 43% win... which means I need Max to not have the Z, Y, and blank unseen.
>Max_Panitch: ?DIOTYZ M3 Z.sTY +50 487
#note My heart sinks drawing the V out of the bag. Damnit.
>Matthew: AV -  +0 441
#note I can play VAR and go out, losing 487-473, but I have to play for the win. And that means challenging the hook on ANTEROOMs for the 0.00001% chance it doesn't take an S. VAR is a 0% win.
