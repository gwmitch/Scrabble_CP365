#note best.  However some of the moves in 2nd to 5th place are interesting. 2nd place)  14C OF for 24, 3rd) A12 M(H)OS for 36, 4th) 14B MOtIF for 57, 5th) E10 FO(Y)S for 35... then FErMIO(N)S, sEMISOF(T), SEMIsOF(T), E(N)SIFOrm, and FOaMIES(T) all 64-66 pointers.

#note best. slam dunk.
>Lou: CEUV N10 CUV.E +32 125
>Jeremy: AILOPRT E5 POLARIT. +102 265
#note best.  If you miss this it's about 74 points down to the next best play 12J LOP.
>Lou: EILNO F2 OLEIN +17 142
>Jeremy: AACELTT I3 LACTATE +67 332
#note best.  I was pleased that I knew LACTATE+Y even though the Y's were covered.

#note Quackle says I'm playing for spread now.  All top choices are 100% to win.  Top equity goes to K5 D(I)NG.  My play suffers -9.8 equity points. I'm alert to there being lots of A's unseen, and a very hot Z spot on the board, but keeping a chance of 8A MATZ(A) alive (keeping M) was an even better idea.
>Lou: LO 10D O.L +5 190
>Jeremy: ADGOSTZ D8 ZO. +45 436
#note best. Lucky me, I can still tag that spot. J10 DOG(ES) is a very close 2nd.
>Lou: AENW 8K .AWEN +30 220
>Jeremy: AADGNST 15L GAST +32 468
#note best.  I spent a lot of time quibbling over 15F TAD or 15L GAST.  I had a lot of time left over, so I decided to use it.
>Lou: EGGRSU L1 GURGES +28 248
>Jeremy: ABDENOR 6C BO.. +6 474
#note Even though Lou could be holding the blank, it doesn't look like he has very many bingo options.  All I can see is VARIOUs with the tile pool.  I open the board getting greedy for more spread if I can bingo out setting up the A(BOON) hook.  Best was 8A BRA(ZA) for 48 which leaves one in the bag.  Oops.  That will cost me -37.0 equity.  Fortunately I am ahead far enough I can do whatever I want short of opening a 3x3x lane and still win the game at this point.  I draw two D's after this, so I won't be bingoing out.
>Lou: ?AORUV B5 fAVOUR +21 269

#note Championship Player says 15G DAN. -2 equity.
>Lou: IIR B12 R.I. +8 277
>Jeremy: DENR 2C RED.N. +7 509
#note 2K N(U)DER. -5 points.  And I still had two minutes to squeeze out those 5 points.  Shucks.  -42.3 equity lost this game, most of it for that foolish BOON play.
