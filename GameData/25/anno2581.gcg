#note: I7 OXO.  -7.1 equity.  I nearly played it, but I know the perils of keeping a U, and went for turnover instead.

#note best.  This leave is actually somewhat bingo prone with an open U on the board.  There are also two places I can ditch the Q if I draw poorly.

#note I start plunking down E9 MANAGER, but pick it up when I notice NI*.  I am leary of the H1 plays RAGMAN, GERMAN, MANAGE (and I didn't know MEGARA).  It just seems like Jason has had enough turns to build himself a bingo rack by now.  I go with my gut and play a bit more defensively.  H1 RAGMAN is best. -10.2
>JasonB: HIIL D12 HILI +26 143
>Jeremy: EFINNRZ 15C F.NNIER +30 192
#note I'm fairly certain such a brazen board opening play with both blanks unseen is a sign that Jason is holding a blank tile.  I feel like blocking again and I go with my gut.  Best is 10K FRIZ.  -3.7
>JasonB: ABP C11 BAP +28 171
>Jeremy: ?DERRUZ H12 DUR. +7 199
#note 10L DURR gives me access to a 6-letter Z word to a TWS. -9.0 equity.  
>JasonB: CDT 13G D.CT +12 183
>Jeremy: ?EIORRZ O6 cR.ZEIRO +67 266
#note O5 fRO(U)ZIER doesn't allow an S hook.  I'm still happy to have found this bingo. -1.1 equity.
>JasonB: ACELNRT 6E L.. +6 189
>Jeremy: AEEIOTU 6B OUT... +11 277
#note I will infer from his play that Jason has an S for this sim.  If you are paying attention, you will notice the vowel consonant distribution is very consonant heavy right about now.  I can turn this into my favor by covering up vowels making it hard for Jason to get points.  Best is 14F EU(R)O. -17.2 equity points.
>JasonB: ?AEGNST B1 nEGAT.NS +66 255
>Jeremy: AEEEINY N10 YA +28 305
#note 14A J plays are about my only worry now.  Just one A unseen.  Jason doesn't know I hold the rest of the vowels.  Quack likes A3 AYE for that reason.  I figure I'm knocking down his score in future plays by taking this spot.  As it turns out, my play has a higher valuation but just a 96.42 win percent.  A3 AYE is best with a 99.81% win taking out the J threat.
>JasonB: BJS 4A J.BS +42 297
>Jeremy: ACEEEIN A8 ICE +21 326
#note N1 (K)E(A). -22.3 equity.  Might as well go for one of those consonants for a bingo says Quackle. Jason can block the A column so might as well chance it.
