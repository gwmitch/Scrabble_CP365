#note Why does this sim so well? UREA or UREIC look far better in retrospect. I mostly played URETIC because that was what I was going to play last turn before my brain shut off.

#note RAYED is clearly better. I'm surprised that YEAR is only 3.7 points below it.

#note Unfortunate, really, that my opponent should get one of a few words that I hadn't studied in 6+ months. From my panicky perspective, my opponent no longer has any respect for me, and is playing a phony to mock me.

#note I guess I can take solace in knowing that I made only two real mistakes this game; all the other plays were right or about right. That's akin to asserting that the captain of the Titanic made only two mistakes on her maiden voyage. Optimism.
