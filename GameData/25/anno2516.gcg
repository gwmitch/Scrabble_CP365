>Evan_Berofsky: BENOT 8D BENTO +20 20
#note This is my first ever game against Evan, and actually, I was probably more intimidated for this one than against Wapnick or Boys... I've seen Evan's bingo lists and read his analyses, and frankly... he's just so much better than me, that I set my goal as not embarrasing myself.
>Pete: ABILOQU E8 .QUAL +28 28
#note So naturally, I miss a real cool play to start the game and lose 15 pts of equity.  Totally did not see OBLIQUE.  Just happy to dump the Q for decent points.
>Evan_Berofsky: TX 10D T.X +26 46
#note Woo... dodged a huge bullet there.  thanks for not having an I.
>Pete: ABDEIMO 7G AMEBOID +73 101
#note Best.  I saw AMOEBOID, but couldn't justify turning down the 7 points just to show off.  I figured I needed every point I could get, and maybe Evan to fall asleep for a half hour or so.
>Evan_Berofsky: EGHIINS M7 .INGHIES +78 124
#note SHEILING is two better, but opens the triple line unneccesarily.  
>Pete: ?EEIKOP 12A POEm.IKE +84 185
#note I chickened out on POPELIKE, thinking that there's no way that could be good.  Evan saw POETLIKE, and after a long hold, he let my phoney bingo slide.
>Evan_Berofsky: ACNORRS 6A RANCORS +66 190
#note Only bingo, only spot.  down again...
>Pete: ACLMNTT H11 M.TAL +21 206
#note Just a bad miss here.  I got leave obsessed and left way too many points on the table.  CLAMP and MATCH would be better, as would a bunch of others I missed.  -5 in equity, but it feels worse than that. 
>Evan_Berofsky: ADEVV A4 VA.VED +51 241
>Pete: ACENRTT 14C REACT.NT +68 274
#note Only bingo.  Took a while to find, then a while longer looking in vain for something through the O in AMEBOID.
>Evan_Berofsky: AFR 8L F.AR +42 283
>Pete: DINOOUW C3 WOU.D +22 296
#note and now, I get my OOUW rack.  Things had been breaking too well to this point... INWOUND, which I didn't know, at C1 is best.  INDOW N11 is cute, but finishes behind my unstylish, pedantic play.
>Evan_Berofsky: OZ B10 ZO. +32 315
>Pete: GIJNNOY 12J JOY.NG +38 334
#note I was torn between the two more obvious plays JOY and JO, and JOYING.  with ?SS unseen, I figured I'd try to race for some goodies. I missed the also cool JIGGY, which is especially cool if I'm paying attention and see the possibility of NONEQUAL. JOY wins sim, most likely because of the ossibility of NONEQUAL.
>Evan_Berofsky: ?EEIIRS 3C .InERIES +62 377
>Pete: ADILNRT H1 TR.AD +21 355
#note It's turn 8 for me, and there's 10 in the bag.  damn, it's too early for an endgame.  I've still got lines, and there are three E's unseen, so if I can score a bit and keep the board open, maybe I have a shot  TRIAD was the wrong way to go about it, though. LAID makes more sense, and duck likes GILD much better than everything else.  
>Evan_Berofsky: AEPW 2D PAWE. +38 415
>Pete: IIILNSU A12 .IU +5 360
#note Had I drawn reasonably well, I had a shot... instead, I drew IISU.  Now I had to try for a miracle.  I chose PIU to block big plays in the corner, but DUI 5H wins sim handily at 14%.  PIU was second at 5%, with nothing else above 1.7%.  I'm not sure why... I thought it was better to keep the line on row 5 open.
>Evan_Berofsky: EEFLUY 2J EYEFUL +32 447
#note Oof.
>Pete: GHIILNS 1L HIN +26 386
#note I used most of my time trying to find a miracle disconnected ING bingo... nothing there.  I missed DISHING, HOGS, and HEILS.  HIN was my attempt to beat the clock.
>Evan_Berofsky: O J12 .O. +10 457
#note And down I go.  I got ten turns, averaged over 38 points each, and still lose by a bingo.  Yeah, that Berofsky guy is good.  I enjoyed the game immensely, and I am still pleased, overall, with my play this game.
