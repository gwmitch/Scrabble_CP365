>Steve_: DGIOORV 8H OVOID +22 22
#note This ekes out the higher scoring VIGOR, but that's just fortunate. I played this quickly enough to overlook that option.
>Berfosky: AQU K5 QUA. +26 26
>Steve_: AAEGRRX 9F RAX +20 42
#note And this play is eked out by the pedestrian XU.
>Berfosky: ?ABEENO F5 aNAE.OBE +63 89
>Steve_: AAEEGRW 11F .REWAGE +26 68
#note I've liked this word ever since I saw Weigand open with it on a board next to me many years ago. He won a challenge with it, but Sneaky is too good not to know it.
>Berfosky: IJLL E2 JILL +24 113
>Steve_: AEEILRU L1 URAEI +23 91
>Berfosky: G H7 G.. +11 124
#note ruh roh. Big fish.
>Steve_: CDELLNO 3I CEL.DON +26 117
#note Not the sharpest move, given the huge fish on the last play, but it was the best I could find. LOC(U)LED is much better; DOL 12J is the duck's sauce.
>Berfosky: EIPRSSS 13C PISSERS +82 206
#note It's easy to surmise Evan's last tile pick, but that doesn't get me any points. Note, a real man would have played this at M9 to open a third 3x3 line and score six more points.
>Steve_: AEILNST N2 T.ENAILS +70 187
#note My excuse for not opening another 3x3 line is simply that I didn't see the bingos in the D column.
>Berfosky: EFW 12L FEW +28 234
>Steve_: AFKNOPY 10J YAK +44 231
>Berfosky: MNTUY 3B MUT.NY +30 264
>Steve_: FINOPRT O7 FOIN +34 265
#note Q rates the top four plays pretty much equal. The other three are PI(N)TO, FOP, and POINT(E).
>Berfosky: CEMTT 1H TECT.M +30 294
#note Gotta give it up here. Very nice. 
>Steve_: BEEPRTU 12B PUB +26 291
>Berfosky: ?GHIOTV 14H eIGHTVO +87 381
#note Another sexy play from the boy.
>Steve_: EEINORT C12 ..O +5 296
#note I took a lot of time with this play, and came up with something that supposedly wins about 14 times out of a 100. Duck says playing (S)O a couple spots over wins almost 34 times, however!
>Berfosky: AADHRZ B1 HA.ZA +38 419
>Steve_: DEEINRT 15B INTERED +92 388
>Steve_: DEEINRT --  -92 296
#note I thought I'd get to play the bingo, but am denied. So, in desperation and in time trouble I lay down a phony. 39 points is the most available.
