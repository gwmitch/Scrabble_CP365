#note Missing the beautiful FAJITA 5B.
>Joel: DGRU 2F GU.RD +15 135
>Dave: AAEFIRW 3K WAIF +27 106
#note There's a good case to be made for AWA 5E, which scores the same and keeps a more balanced rack.  Although I don't usually want to keep an F, it has good synergy with the rest of the rack.  At the same time, I was happy to set up the blank S hook on column O, since I was trailing.

#note Joel mentioned after the game that he could have played REARGUARD here.

>Joel: OORT F10 ROTO +19 195
>Dave: EEFIRTU 4A FEET +28 194
#note This is a dreadful play.  I knew I was breaking up the rack and giving a lot back to him, but I just couldn't find one of the several better plays.  Well, I did see FEIRIE C8, but I convinced myself it was phony.  However, TUFTIER, FEUAR, and FIREGUARD all would have been better choices.  I didn't think Joel would buy SHRIFTIER*.

>Dave: AEIIORU 15A OURIE +22 216
>Joel: CEIKNTZ 8A ZET. +39 306
#note Joel took a long time on this play and showed me the rack afterward.  He wanted to make a play to block the L column, which was the most likely spot for me to bingo, but he couldn't find a way to do it without leaving himself awkward tiles.  I liked his play, because if he plays off vowels and keeps the Z, he could come to regret it.  On the other hand, he is likely to score well with the CK.  For instance, KNIFE A1, KAMI H12, and ICK J1.
>Dave: AILLLNO 13I LINALOL +73 289
#note So much for rack management.
>Joel: BCCIKNT N10 BIN.C +30 336
#note Phony.  BINOCS is a sticky S word.  I had seen the bingo I played before he made his move, and I was so happy that he had given me a high scoring spot for it that I didn't want to challenge, even though I thought his word was questionable.  A better player would have challenged off his word and played the triple-triple that I did not see.  I vaguely remember that word from high school science classes, but I doubt I would have found it.
>Dave: ?AEHNPY O4 HYPoNEA +108 397
#note One interesting point here is that I have the super high scoring HYP 15G keeping the blank.  If he had made a play blocking the N and O columns I would have played it, but it's not feasible here, because the chance of him hitting a bingo or other big play on column O is too high.
>Joel: ?CDEIKT 12L KE. +28 364
#note Just when it looked like I would come back and win, Joel Q stuck me.  The high scoring play InKED 15H loses to AE B3, when he is stuck with the C and can't stop me from playing the Q!  (TI allows QAT.)
>Dave: AAOQ H14 .A +12 409
#note It's important to take this spot out first, to take away some of his high scoring plays.
>Joel: ?CDIT 15L CIsT +33 397
#note This gets him just enough to win, but he had several better ways to execute this ending.  DIsC in the same spot is better, because it scores the same, but he goes out for four more with the T.  However, the best way is to slow play me with CEL, WET, ID/AXED, and WETs.  The best I can do is JO and ZA, and he wins 449-431.
>Dave: AOQ I1 O.A. +18 427
#note Endgame timing lesson:  If he's going to go out in more than one turn, it's better to play the O and A separately, but since I know he only has one turn left I dump them both at once.
