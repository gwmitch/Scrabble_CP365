#note 7H FEN. -6.4 equity for playing the D for 2 more points.  ?DEN must be way better than ?EN

#note Phony, but better than all legal plays if I get away with it.  I knew it was phony as we discussed this plausible non-word over lunch.  Best legal play is L1 FELiNES.

#note  best is 15N YE in win percentage, but my play leads in equity.  Drawing one less tile avoids the Q better.  I keep the U for Q insurance, but I may not have time to play off both Q and Z if I draw the Q.  I don't think playing off the an extra E is a big deal because there are 3 more unseen.

#note drat. I drew the Q.  Of all the 100% win plays on Many Simulations, Quack likes H7 (FE)Z best. -11 equity
>steveO: ?EOSSTT 5D SiTE +15 267
#note Steve misses some bingos here, and in an attempt to block my Z, enables it for more points.
