>Jeremy: DEIMTUW 8G WUD +14 14
#note best.  TEDIUM lets Tony bingo through too many good tiles.
>Tony: ADIOZ 9C AZIDO +23 23
>Jeremy: EEHIIMT D9 .ITI +26 40
#note missed D4 ITEMI(Z)E.  Sitting back in my chair drinking a beer it seems easy to find now.  I should relax more at tourneys.  -14.4 equity

#note best
>Tony: ACEKNRS 10G SNACKER +75 109
#note this used to be just CANKERS.  SNACKER is new and I know it.
>Jeremy: AEEILMV K10 .EVIL +24 96
#note the best play was disconnected nine through D-A.  Can you find it?  If you missed that, C12 (J)IVE is best despite stringing and E in the triple lane.  -39.7 equity
>Tony: ?ACEELT 15G CELEsTA +89 198
>Jeremy: AEEFMNY 14J F.AMEN +57 153
#note I balked on the best play FLAMY.  I wasn't 100% so I picked it up and put down something I was sure of.  It was put on hold for a bit. -9.9 equity.
>Tony: GGIO O11 GOI.G +24 222
>Jeremy: BEEENOY 13B YO +28 181
#note C12 JOEY.  -3.0 points.  This play is sorely lacking in defense.  Look what happens.
>Tony: EOTV 14A VOTE +34 256
>Jeremy: BEEENOR 12H BRE.E +26 207
#note happy to sort out this mess by dumping BEE on a closed board.  best.

>Jeremy: ADDIRRU 2K RUDD. +20 340
#note best.  I need scoring lane, and dump that U not to mention break up those D's.
>Tony: ?ANORTU 5G OUTRANc. +64 424
#note well, double blanked by Tony, I expect to lose.
>Jeremy: AIIOPRS F6 OI +15 355
#note I feel this is best.  Try to draw a set that will bingo in 2 places.  Trouble is, Tony will know my final rack with perfect knowledge, but I don't think he can block 2 bingos.  Quackle says 15B (MAX)I has a 30% win, but Quackle doesn't play defense when it sims.  I may not be able to play my bingo if Tony can block it. -4.4 equity.
>Tony: ABENOST 1H BETON +29 453
#note Tony doesn't see my out, and this will cost him unfortunately.
>Jeremy: AAIPPRS B1 APPRAIS. +78 433
#note best. -74.4 equity on the game.  Most coming from a disco'ed nine.
>Jeremy:  (AS) +4 437
