>Jason_Broersma: BFO 8G FOB +16 16
>Pete: AGHOORS 9H HOG +18 18
#note Duck likes OOH by a point.  
>Jason_Broersma: ?AEIINT 7A IsATINE +64 80
#note passing up the points to put the less dangerous I in the triple line.
>Pete: ADDORSS 8A DADOS +42 60
>Pete: ADDORSS --  -42 18
#note I of course, am stupid, and play a phoney two.  Jason catches it before I do, and off it does. I even passed on SODA there thinking that DADOS was a kickass play.  it would have been, but sA is not.  Fatigue set in... I said, "I'm tired and cranky and I want to go home."

>Jason_Broersma: GILV A4 VIG.L +39 119
>Pete: ADDORSS 6E SODA +20 38
#note So now I'm down 100.  DADOS finishes 1st, but I wanted to save the S hook on HOG, figuring I'd really need it in this one.
>Jason_Broersma: COOT 10F COOT +23 142
>Pete: ABDILRS K3 BRIDALS +78 116
#note Put down RIBALDS first, then decided not to set up a giant ZA spot.  Both are best.
>Jason_Broersma: AITY 8K .AITY +27 169
>Pete: EEEEFOU 9M FOE +26 142
#note and I get this crap.  I play off FEE, which just beats the exchanges.  FEE values at 3.0, which is best.  that's getting bent over by the bag right there.
>Jason_Broersma: IMRT 11I TRIM +18 187
>Pete: EEEGRUW 12L EWER +24 166
#note Oh bother.  finding the good play would have required me to know a rather elementary 5 (WEBER), so that wasn't happening.  Duck likes EWE better than EWER, but I wanted the points, and was afraid he'd burn the spot.
>Jason_Broersma: CINORT C1 CORTIN. +18 205
#note This play gave me hope... with him not shutting down, and leaving the good scoring spots available... I felt like I was in the game again.  This play sychologically got me back to full attention.
>Pete: EGNNRTU 13J TUNER +27 193
#note So I miss the two best plays, and settle on TUNER. GURNET and GUNNER kill this play.
>Jason_Broersma: ADEEINS 3B A.SENIDE +61 266
#note The anagram plays elsewhere for more... a big break for me.  I hold, just because I had a very temporary brainlock on this pair...  fortunately, I remember it soon enough.  On seeing the minimum bingo, I gained hope... I was still in this one.
>Pete: DGKLMNO 1A MO.K +51 244
#note and an easy best play to score big in response.  With a good draw, I can win this one.
>Jason_Broersma: NUY H1 UN.Y +36 302
>Pete: GILNSUZ 4K .UING +16 260
#note Missed RITZ.  passed on BIZ... hoped to draw into a big Z play.
>Jason_Broersma: AEP O1 PEA. +21 323
>Pete: ADJLLPZ M1 LAP.Z +32 292
#note And now... I play what is, very rare for me, an intentional phoney.  I needed reasonable scores with both the Z and the J, but my good Z plays took the easy sot for JATO.  But the cute phoney LAPIZ outscores any real plays, and leaves the JATO spot if I draw another A.  Sim likes duming the J first and hoping to get lucky with the Z.  
>Jason_Broersma: Q 5J Q. +11 334
>Pete: AADEHJL N6 JA.. +27 319
#note Caught my A, so JATO is there.  I figured I needed some luck, but if I caught the X, or the blank, or caught a bingo...  I wanted to save the X spot at N2.  Sim likes blocking it there.  I knew I had to keep one in the bag... AL N1 wins almost 20%, JATO just over 10. 
>Jason_Broersma: ?EEEVWX 12E VEXEs +21 355
#note This play broke my heart.  Only TWELVE D7 beats it in sim.  VEXES kills the board. Jason hated pulling the trigger on it, but it did the job quite well.
>Pete: ADEHLRS H12 .EL +3 322
#note Well, the game is lost, but I find a cool way to score, in case Jason misses something.  Duck likes DEAL or DEAR 14L, which I do not see how that beats my essentially unblockable setup.  Chamionship player finds DE 14L, but by my math DE+ HARLS finishes 2 points behind EEL + HARDS.Quackle is weird sometimes.  Anything better I could have done?
>Jason_Broersma: EUW N2 WE. +29 384
>Pete: ADHRS 15D HARDS +51 373
#note And i lose, thus falling out of class prize contention.  Jason is a fun opponent, as most Jasons tend to be, and this is another close and fun game.  My stupid early mistake, and a couple small blunders, cost me the game... but I'm not too upset.  I found a fun endgame, and had a good time in general.  
>Pete:  (U) +2 375
