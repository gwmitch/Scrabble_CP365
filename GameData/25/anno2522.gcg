>Matthew: EOQSUVZ 8G SUQ +24 24
#note This is a deceiving rack. At first it looks balanced with a lot of goodies: Z, S, and the QU combo. But then you realise you have NOTHING to play. SUQ burns up two of my goodies for only 24 points... and it sims best! VOE is a close second and ex. OVZ and ex OV are suggested as well.
>Pete_Zeigler: ILO G8 .OLI +5 5
>Matthew: EFIOUVZ I8 .UIZ +23 47
#note QUIZ is best with O(L)IVE, F(L)U, VIO(L), and FI(Q)UE all being low-scoring alternatives.
>Pete_Zeigler: AO 11I .OA +24 29
>Matthew: ?AEEFOV J10 F.VEA +34 81
#note Silly of me not to give this more thought. FOVEAE is obviously better. It's a more balanced leave and it's also better defensively. Odds are Pete will have a letter for the hook and easy TWS, so I might as well open the line up for him.
>Pete_Zeigler: AHIL 15G HAIL +33 62
>Matthew: ?DEMOSU 13G EUD.MOnS +76 157
#note The best bingos go for more points pluralising SUQ. I sacrificed for a slightly more closed board.
>Pete_Zeigler: AEG 12L GAE +17 79
>Matthew: EORTTTY 14E YETT +18 175
#note Look, ma! I drew a bingo! One of those bingos that's actually a pretty useless rack if the word doesn't play. And TOTTERY doesn't. Too bad I don't know TROTYL and TETRYL. And too bad I missed the obviously better placement for YETT at F9. Dur.
>Pete_Zeigler: ?AEGITU O6 AUGITEs +75 154
>Matthew: AENORTX 15A EXTRA +44 219
#note I hate giving up some lovely bingo tiles, but Q agrees with my play here.
>Pete_Zeigler: EM 14A ME +30 184
>Matthew: EGNOORT 13A ERGO +25 244
#note Close second to N1 TROGON. I know TROGON, but I just didn't spot it. Would have turned down that play anyway, I bet.
>Pete_Zeigler: CIKLN N2 CLINK +58 242
#note Ugh. Hate losing my lead to a non-bingo like that.
>Matthew: NNORTTW 4L TW.N +16 260
#note Q wants me to cash in the W at 12D with WON or WOT. I elect to keep the vowel.
>Pete_Zeigler: ABY 12C ABY +27 269
>Matthew: EJNORTV E10 JO. +26 286
#note Best.
>Pete_Zeigler: COO 5K COO. +19 288
>Matthew: EINRRTV 2H VENTRI. +14 300
>Matthew: EINRRTV --  -14 286
#note One of the things I do with a difficult rack is try to fix my problem by inventing a word. And this is a tough rack. H4 VIRT(U) sims best and N9 TIR(ES) is second. ex. RV comes in third. Playing a phony? Nowhere on Q's list.
>Pete_Zeigler: EFH 11A FEH +16 304
>Matthew: EINRRTV A8 TRE. +21 307
#note RIV(E) one column over sims better. I can't justify that risk, but bingo tiles are unseen, I guess. So ENRT leave is strong.
>Pete_Zeigler: AEEILNR 2H RELIAN.E +62 366
>Matthew: DINPRSV H1 D.IP +30 337
#note Best with a 6.50 win%.
