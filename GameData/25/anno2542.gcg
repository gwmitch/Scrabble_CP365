#note $1 prize for this turn was high opening play, but I was ineligible since I'd already won. So I annoyingly kept reminding Carol that I had 40, somebody needed to beat 40. "Who won?" I asked later. "Mike Garner, with 25," she said. "25 doesn't beat 40!" I argued. Janet said I was like a pull toy, pull the string and all I said was "I got 40! I got 40!"
>Janet_Gray: GOT 9C GOT +17 17
#note Put down JOTAL* before something triggered that it wasn't a word. My sudden freeze/arched eyebrow didn't help matters.
>Jason: DDEFFOP H4 DOFF. +14 54
>Janet_Gray: RY 6H .RY +17 34
>Jason: ?DEELOP 4A DEPLOyE. +76 130
#note Hey! Something low-prob that I actually anagrammed! Although I kind of wanted to play PLE(AT)ED for 40, keeping the blank.
>Janet_Gray: AQU A1 QUA. +42 76
#note The only reason I know that I got no N's in this game is because Janet pointed it out. I was wondering why I couldn't even get close to (QUAD)RANT. So, later I looked up all the four-tile-plus extensions: -DING, -PLEX, -RANS, -RATE, -RICS (missed QUADRICS for 130 vs. McKenzie in Elyria), and -RIGA are the more "common" ones.

#note OK, so my equity loss is 0.3, I've played ?SJX with an S on my rack ... why am I behind?

#note "OK, Igor," Carol said after seeing this draw. Har har.
>Janet_Gray: ENS L7 NES +18 214
#note Yeah, this is kinda phony, but it gave me a spot for my bingo.
>Jason: ?BDIRTU M2 BRUITeD +72 306
#note TURBID(NES)s would've been nice. However, I'm slacking on my "10s through phony threes" study.
>Janet_Gray: AN 11C NA +13 227
#note Nice setup.
>Jason: AGILMMW L4 MM +24 330
#note AMMI(NES) would've been cool.
>Janet_Gray: NOS 12D SON +30 257
#note Relieved to get off cheaply here.

#note She was definitely getting displeased with her draws in general right around here.
