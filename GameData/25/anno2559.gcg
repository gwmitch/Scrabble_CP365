>Steve_: ABILNST 8G LIB +10 10
#note BINAL deemed best, but this, and several other plays, is less than two points of equity behind.
>Winter: CEGINOY 9F CONY +30 30
>Steve_: AAEGNST J2 AGNATES +68 78
#note And I even was aware of the M-hook possibility.
>Winter: EEEGIOT 10I EGO +16 46
>Steve_: ANSSTUY 11K YUAN +24 102
#note Best, altho putting an S on now is less than a point back.
>Winter: EEHIORT 4E HEREI.TO +74 120
>Steve_: AGLOSST D1 GOAT +38 140
#note Missed bingo, and a beauty! But I'm good with this.
>Winter: DILOQTW M10 Q.ID +28 148
>Steve_: DDEILSS 5D SIDED +38 178
#note Best. Ekes out (G)LIDED.
>Winter: ?ELOTTW H1 TOW.. +27 175
>Steve_: EELMOSU 14J MOUSE +41 219
#note Best.
>Winter: ?AELNTV 15D VoLANTE +93 268
#note Ouch.
>Steve_: AEFJLRU O12 JURA +65 284
#note Best.
>Winter: EIIRTXZ H12 ZEI. +23 291
#note Winter at first played (A)XITE 2J, but picked it up and then played this.
>Steve_: ACEEFLO 13C FLEEC. +28 312
#note This is the play that cost me 10 points in valuation, and perhaps the game. I was set to play AL(O)OF in row 2, but felt I had to block a big AX play at i12, since he showed me he had the X. I also thought he had an A, but that was a misstep - the A in his play of AXILE was already on the board. Doh!
>Winter: FHIRTUX 2B FR.TH +38 329
>Steve_: ABOPRRW I12 AR +27 339
#note Wasted a lot of time on this turn; BROW 3L is a couple of points better.
>Winter: AILNOUX 1A XI +32 361
#note I'm paying interest on my mistake of not playing ALOOF earlier.
>Steve_: BIOPPRW D9 PROW. +20 359
#note BOW(L) in same spot is said to be better in win percentage, 27-20.
>Winter: ?AILONU K2 LO.I +17 378
>Steve_: BEIIPRS N9 BI. +20 379
#note It's getting late enuf to warrant taking chances like this in an attempt to win. Q likes this and PIN in the same spot.
>Winter: ?AMNNUV O8 VAs +30 408
#note To see Winter burn a blank for 30 points here was a bit surprising, but he makes it difficult to catch him now.
>Steve_: DEIKPRS 11C P.RE +12 391
#note Leaving two spots for DISK, but it doesn't do enuf to win. The duck finds a way to wrangle a win, but it's tricky. Leave a note in my lj comments if you want me to reveal it to you.
>Winter: AEMNNU 10B MU.E +18 426
#note Best.
>Steve_: DIKS 7L DISK +20 411
#note I can get four points closer with the optimum play here - (O)D(AL)ISK!
>Steve_:  (ANN) +6 417
