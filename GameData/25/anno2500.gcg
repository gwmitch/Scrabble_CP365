>Verbie: ?AEEIJL H6 JAIL +22 22

>M_Schellenberg: ?EGHNRT 8H .NGaTHER +86 86
>Verbie: ?BDEEIU O8 .EBUrIED +80 102

#note I'm not going away.  Trust me.
>M_Schellenberg: ACIMOVY L1 CAVY +44 220
>Verbie: BEGIOSU 14J BOUGI. +30 204
#note Had the full 7 with no spot, so why not keep ES ?
>M_Schellenberg: DIIMOPR 1H DOMI. +30 250
#note 15G IDIOM scores 2 more but equity calcs put it up only 1.
>Verbie: DEORSUW I5 DOW. +30 234
#note Is it actually 3 better to keep the D?
>M_Schellenberg: AEEIPQR F10 Q. +31 281
>Verbie: EFIRSTU 15E FUSTIER +86 320
#note SURFEIT in the same lane scores 6 more.
>M_Schellenberg: AEEIIPR 2F PIE +14 295

>Verbie: FHORSTT 10J H.FT +31 351
>M_Schellenberg: AEIILRW 1H .....ILE +39 334
#note Cute.  I mentioned how Jesse Matthews blew a challenge on this-- after playing the E-less version and almost getting challenged on that!!
>Verbie: CNORSTX 14D COX +58 409
#note Bam.
>M_Schellenberg: AEIOORW 12B WOO +16 350
#note Better to cash the 30 for WOOER in this slot (12A).  But only by 8.
>Verbie: KNNRRST -NNRR +0 409
#note I have a weakness for keeping top items on punts.  The proper change was -KNNR by 9.  But with NNRR still out to be drawn...
>M_Schellenberg: AAEINRZ M12 ZA. +26 376
#note Missing the cooler ZA(G)/(COX)A G13 35.  -9.
>Verbie: KLNOSST 12B ...LS +22 431
#note I considered PLONK F2, and it turns out PLONKS is tops here, by 3 over this.  I also looked at KOS 13A which as it happens would have been a killer.
>M_Schellenberg: AAEINNR 2J AN. +13 389
#note In a near tie with IZAr 12L 24.  ANE 9M has the same effect.
>Verbie: DEKNOST 3C TOKED +33 464
>M_Schellenberg: AEINRRT B7 INTER.AR +76 465
#note GAAH!  At this point I have 13 minutes on my clock...
>Verbie: AANRRSY 4B RAYAS +39 503
#note Almost conceded with YAR in this lane, nearly blew it completely with YARS*, then found myself staring at this beauty of a play.  Wowsers.
>M_Schellenberg: AENP A5 NAPE +28 493
#note PEAN A7 but that just makes it a double-500 (503-501).  It's still a thousand point game...
>M_Schellenberg:  (NR) +4 497
