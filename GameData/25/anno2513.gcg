>Pete: DDEINOO 8G NODI +10 10
#note Missing countless better plays. DIODE is the clear best... I got lazy here.  Having just survived the Wapnick game with my spread still respectable, I was still kinda on adrenaline as this game started.
>Roger_Cullman: ?AEGNRR J4 EARR.NGs +64 64
#note ORANGIER or ORANGERY was best.
>Pete: DEFOOTW 9C WOOFED +24 34
#note I took forever on this play.  I didn't know FATWOOD, so WOOFED was the play, and I took 2 minutes to decide whether to play it above or below the NO in NODI.  Sim seems to think I chose wrong.
>Roger_Cullman: ABDE 8A BEAD +37 101
>Pete: CEEOTUW K4 TWEE +30 64
#note about equal in equity with WEE... I decided I wanted the points, down by 70 this early.  Plus TWEE is a cool word.  I was held for a while on this one.
>Roger_Cullman: ALOP 7B OPAL +26 127
>Pete: CINOQTU E2 QUINO. +30 94
#note duck likes CO(RE) to set up a Q-bingo rack... I decided to score and start over with CT.  Held for a while on this one too.
>Roger_Cullman: FNU F4 FUN +19 146
>Pete: CEIKSTV 11E SICKE.T +48 142
#note Best.  although V(OE) only finishes 1.2 behind in equity.
>Roger_Cullman: AAH L4 HA +28 174
>Pete: BCEIMOV I2 VIM +18 160
#note I saw, but passed up REMOVE.  VOE finishes high again in the same spot.  I stand by VIM.
>Roger_Cullman: RSUU H11 .URUS +30 204
>Pete: ABCEILO 13B ALBICO.E +78 238
#note Missed SOCIABLE, and passed up the 4 extra points for BRACIOLE. Held long enuf on my lay that I drew the courtesy tiles, but couldn't get the challenge.
>Roger_Cullman: AELZ 15D ZEAL. +24 228
>Pete: AAHIJOV B12 J.VA +28 266
#note made sense to me, and I still don't like duck's better choices (AJIVA 12K, OH 6A, JAVA B10) for strategic reasons.  AJIVA is too aggressive with the ?SS unseen, OH's leave seems too precarious, and B10 sets up too many easy points with an S.
>Roger_Cullman: INY M5 YIN +17 245
>Pete: AGHIIOR 14B .AIR +26 292
#note Missed VIRAGO, but I liked this play... I always like the neat fits, because I usually miss them.
>Roger_Cullman: RT 4D R..T +14 259
>Pete: EGGHIOS C3 IGG +19 311
#note I passed on HOGG, because I wanted to hold the H for the spot on B6.  The H is the last tile left that can use it for real points.  I may need the points, especially since I expect to get bingoed on soon, what with all the fishing and all.
>Roger_Cullman: M 15A M. +12 271
>Pete: EHORSTY 6A OH +27 338
#note Tooke the oints here... missed YO(RE) where I missed CO(RE) earlier.
>Roger_Cullman: P 3B P. +4 275
>Pete: DERSTXY 9J .ERDY +11 349
#note I liked getting the X here.  I figured he was bingoing, so the X gave a good chance at a response enough to win.  NERDY was chosen to make the job of bingoing as difficult as possible.  Sim says SEX 8M is best, and considering three unseen E's, duck may have a point... but against non-experts, usually making the bingo as tough as possible is a good strategy.
>Roger_Cullman: ?EILNST 14H .NITLESs +70 345
#note hold.  I do the math, and figure out that with my X, I can only lose it I challenge wrongly.  PAWN c7 actually wins slightly more than half the time, in sim. Chamionship player likes PAWL in the same place. NOVELIST was the best bingo, but it doesn't win either.  I let the honey go, even though I'm 98% sure its bad... I just wanted to take the win. He went over time here, complicating matters further.
>Pete: EEOSTTX 8N OX +32 381
#note Missing the supercool DETOXES M9 and SEXT 3L.  Just happy to take the win.
>Roger_Cullman: A L3 A.. +6 351
>Roger_Cullman:  (EESTT) +10 361
