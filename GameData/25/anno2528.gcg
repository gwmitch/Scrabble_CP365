>Matthew: AAERTTU 8D TUATERA +66 66
#note Matthew sez:Hey neato! A bingo! I have a good feeling about this game...
>Jeremy: EEIOORV I6 VI.EO +10 10
#note Jeremy sez:I got the highest valuation play... but 7H OE leads a little in win percent.
>Matthew: AAGHILO J10 HALO +28 94
#note Matthew sez:Dur. HAO is the play. Better leave and a little better defensively.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?BEEORT D1 BEETRoO. +74 84
#note Jeremy sez:Best.  13F REBO(O)TED scores more, but D in a triple lane is more dangerous for -ED endings.
>Matthew: AEGIPUW K11 WAP +32 126
#note Matthew sez:Baaah... I couldn't spot the play from the B. It's BEWIG and that's going to cost me.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: BELNORS 1A NOB.LERS +158 242
#note Jeremy sez:Im guessing this is best.
>Matthew: EGIKLNU -  +0 126
#note Matthew sez:Challenged. If I didn't lose my turn here, I would have lost it with *GUNLIKE.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EFIINNR L6 FINNIER +84 326
#note Jeremy sez:Only bingo.  Best.
>Matthew: EGIKLNU M2 KLUGE +25 151
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AEIOORT 2J IRO.O +22 348
#note Jeremy sez:I have the best equity play again, but Quack says 2I TROI(K)A edges this out on win percent by 0.02% probably for turning over one more tile.
>Matthew: EGHINYZ N6 ZINGY +81 232
#note Matthew sez:Best with a generous 0.60 win%.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ADEGMTT C3 MEAT +25 373
#note Jeremy sez:The right play here is turnover.  Get the end of the game closer, and give Matthew less chances to land bingos.  E7 M(U)TATED is best.  -4.6 equity, my first equity mistake of the game.  I thought it was high time to start covering some bingo lanes... and that explains my play.
>Matthew: CEFHRUU 6F CUR.E +18 250
#note Matthew sez:Not a great play. CH(A)FEUR was the move.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ADDGNTT E3 TAT +20 393
#note Jeremy sez:-0.2 equity.  Quackle likes 4L D(U)NG.  I thought the DDGN leave wasn't so bad with 4 unseen I's.
>Matthew: AAEFHUY G8 .HUYA +15 265
#note Matthew sez:Believe it or not I'm still playing for win% here. And THUYA is tops in that.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: DDGLNPS 4L D.NG +16 409
#note Jeremy sez:I have the equity play here, but Quackle suggests E7 D(U)NGS for a small advantage in win percentage.  Win percent is 99.55% to 99.62%.
>Matthew: ADEFJMN H11 AMEND +45 310
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: DIILOPS 15H .IPLOIDS +89 498
#note Matthew sez:Ok, fine, fine. Uncle. Let's end it there, okay?
#note Jeremy sez:Best.
>Matthew: ACFIJQS N12 QAI. +28 338
#note Matthew sez:QI obviously better.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?DEEISW 13A EDgEWIS. +87 585
#note Matthew sez:.................
#note Jeremy sez:Best.

#note Matthew sez:........................................................................
#note Jeremy sez: Equity mistakes total: -4.8 points.  Sweet.
