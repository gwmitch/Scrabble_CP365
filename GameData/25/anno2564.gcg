#note best.  Kenji was right.  Trade the X on the opening rack.
>Linda: IKLNPSU H7 UPLINKS +86 86
>Jeremy: AEEORTY 12F YO.E +11 11
#note 12F YO(K) leads in win percent by 0.10% My play leads in valuation.  Whatever.  It's close.
>Linda: ADEHZ J8 HAZED +51 137
>Jeremy: ACERRTU K9 RAT +23 34
#note 8J (H)URTER -8 equity.  I'm paying too much attention to the score and trying to bingo.
>Linda: EGV L8 VEG +27 164
>Jeremy: ?CEGORU 8F CU. +7 41
#note Missed 13A COUGhER(S). -37.1 equity.  Ugh.  Terrible play.
>Linda: BLO F8 .OLB. +14 178
>Jeremy: ?EGMORT -  +0 41
#note #challenged COLBY.  Whoops.  Best play is I1 GROmMET (not challenging).  -22.1 equity.
>Linda: DFI 9C FID. +12 190
>Jeremy: ?EGMORT I1 GROmMET +64 105
#note Missed D4 ERGOT(I)SM, played too quickly.  I'm not sure my play is that bad though.  I do open another triple lane and I am way down. -11.8 equity.

#note Quack says J5 EF.  I don't consider HLTW? to be a fishing rack.  I need points AND bingos.  I should be perhaps simming this on Many ply because I am so far down. -11.4 equity.
>Linda: EGIORSX 5E ROUT.AN +36 269

#note Sacrifice six points and keep that E.  L2 F(E)M -2.1 equity.
>Linda: EINR O1 REIN +24 267
>Jeremy: ?CORSSU N4 UnCROSS +68 296
#note I miss the 2x2x nine letter plays. COnSU(ME)RS CUStO(ME)RS and COStU(ME)RS. -30.1 equity.  Ouch.
>Linda: AAEE A11 A.EAE +15 282
>Jeremy: AABDIIW 4K AW +30 326
#note best despite keeping II
>Linda: EGO 2E EGO +17 299
>Jeremy: ABDIIII 5G AI..D +24 350
#note With a 2 ply sim, my play is the top valuation play, but EXCH. ABIII wins on win% by 5%.  Gotta sim this one on many plies.  I am keeping BIII with two more I's unseen.  Kerr-azy!  Exch ABIIII for win% again, but the valuation play is exch. AIII.  My play is -16.5 equity points worse than that.  I'm not taking a points loss for this because my rule is to use many sims when 14 or less are left.
>Linda: IILOQRV 6F OI +6 305
>Jeremy: BIIILQT 3C BIT +12 362
#note -24.4 equity on many ply.  E1 L(E)I is the best play.  My play is still not bad in the win percent category.  That's the important part.  Still 73.1% to win
>Linda: P 8N .P +12 317
