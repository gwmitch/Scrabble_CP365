#note "Are you?" Alex asked. I didn't get it at first until he pointed to the board. "I've never seen it that way," I said, "and now I will never not see it that way!" That story's almost worth missing MINIBAR.
>Alex_Fiszbein: ?EENNPS 10C PENNiES +69 87
#note It's 10 more played two spots over. For 11 more, find the double-double through IT.
>Jason: EGHNRST M7 H. +11 49
#note Missing GREENTHS. Wait, these aren't the worst of my mistakes!

#note My coolest play of the night, earning a "nice" from Alex.
>Alex_Fiszbein: ?AABIRT M3 BAT +30 163
#note Ha! I'm not the only one who misses bingos! Other than another nine through IT, there's BARIsTA and a couple eights ending in L. This is only 8.2 behind the nine and 6.2 behind BARIsTA, though.

>Jason: ACEGIWY 6I WAY +24 242
#note C(H)EWY's a bad whiff. Didn't look hard enough; felt obligated to play up here.

>Jason: CEEEGIN 13B EC.E +18 260
>Alex_Fiszbein: ?LORRUV A13 LUV +28 227
#note Missing OVeRRUL(E). And LECHE's no good. He deliberately phoneyed me! Grob got it past him once, and he figured I'd accept for the same reasons he accepted against Grob.

#note Very nice. Just when I thought I had the bottom of the board almost all tied up.
>Jason: DEIJORR O1 JO +31 348

>Jason: DDEIRRY 14E RYE +31 379
>Alex_Fiszbein: EILNOST G7 E. +3 342
#note Beautiful. Only OL(E) at 2J wins more often, 27.78% to this 19.44%.
>Jason: DDEIKRU 6C DUKED +17 396
#note I'm assuming from the last play that he didn't have the A. I figure he's got either LOTIONS/OILSTON(E) or LATINOS/INSOLAT(E). And, not seeing a way to block both, I blocked the easier one and took points. Yeah, same word at F3 kills both lines. That and DRUID are the guaranteed wins. Stupid, stupid, stupid.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AILNOST 2E INSOLAT. +62 404
#note At least Alex admitted he got very lucky. :) What's that the Mets used to say: The game is never over until the final error? Well, in a comedy of errors, I made the final error.
>Alex_Fiszbein:  (IOR) +6 410
