#note I GOT THE MIRACLE DRAW AND HE BLOCKED CANZONET, BUT I STILL HAVE AZOTE FOR 84 POINTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i may be slightly exaggerating though. i was incredibly upset after i played entozoan because i realized i could have gotten more for azote, but it's actually not an enormous mistake. if i can cash that spot next turn, i might actually end up ahead. -10
