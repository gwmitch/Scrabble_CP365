#note it's hard to anticipate, but in terms of blocking bingo lanes in the longer term I wanted to be able to make plays to block the I and the B. Most likely I will block the B with a play at I3, and either play through the I or play across hooking CIVILISE. Neither bingo helps that much, but at least I get a lead!
>David_Gibson: APY 14D YAP +31 353
>JD: DEQRSUY C1 QUEY +47 426
#note keeping the S gives me some shot of being able to play SUQ for points also (although not if it opens a new lane)

>JD: ADHRSUW J10 H.W +34 460
#note unfortunately now I'm not up enough points to sacrifice to block the B.
>David_Gibson: N 12J ..N +12 403
>JD: AADORSU N2 DOURA +20 480
#note to go for the block, or play BA and hope that SUQ is enough to seal the win? I decided that I was just about guaranteed to lose if david was able to fish again, but I had underscored myself by 10 points which may have significantly changed my decision-making!
>David_Gibson: ?ADENRT M7 D.cENTRA +77 480
#note as it turns out I was 1/3 to win given my play, whereas BA had a great chance of winning. Too bad! Quite likely if I play BA and he plays DICENTRA I just play SUQ, and then the game would've ended in a 500-500 tie.
