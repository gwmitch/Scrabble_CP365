#note whoa, some weird sim results. Q's favorite by a little bit is ROO for 11 keeping DEELR, not normally a powerhouse leave. I guess the board is so open for 8s that it's worth being fishy (bingo percentage after HOLDER is 30% versus 57% after ROO)

#note having to rely on luck to complete the bingo instead of a stronger leave.

#note this play puts him in all kinds of trouble, and saves both the S for column O and the T for TREF. the only problem is that he risks hitting me with QI for 64, but I'm ok with leaving that spot open to make a setup that he will have to waste points to block.

#note what's horrifying about this pre-endgame is that I had spotted VENDU, but didn't think of him being able to start bingos with a U! That said, if I realized that I can outrun UNAIRED I can play solely for spread, in which case the best move seems to be cashing AJI for 40. I thought that I was blocking INDURATE, but that rack is unblockable.
