#note game 31 of nationals. 17-13 record after losing the last two, sadly, so i'm out of the cash.

#note quackle likes E9 FICE keeping CRY by a lot, which i don't quite understand. i see that CEFI is not a great leave, and 3C FIN seems ok, but i'm confused. -7

>cesar: DIMOPUY 3I YOM +24 358
#note there is nothing worse in the world than missing a star play. my lack of anagramming practice shows as i'm sure i shuffled this rack and could not come up with podium or dipody. i did consider SWAMPY but i didn't want him to score a ton on row 3. MU 2J is also way better than my move. -11

>cesar: DGHIIPU M10 DUPI.G +20 378
#note totally did not see PUGH even though i kept the P for YOMP.  -9 HOG G7 is probably ok too.  maybe some other stuff. duping scores too little and is not promising enough. it is not that good of a blocking play if it blocks at all.

#note i always love quackle with its creative moves. 14A VAW where he'll obviously play but if he doesn't i get a big score back. it does seem kind of risky. -1

#note i need to get better. i lost 3 games directly on a single poor defense play (maybe even 4 games), and i'm sure i screwed up in other places. 4 more wins is like 3rd place.
