#note ugghhhhh. I had a suspicion that Mike might now know that COUDE now takes an S, so I should;ve been eager just to play DYELESS. Instead I looked for like 8 minutes for bingos (missing PHYLESES somehow), then finally put down ?YELESS and made the blank a D to maximize the chance of Mike challenging...KEYLESS would also have worked.

#note if only I had played this the first time! Mike challenged again.

#note I played the rest of the game under time pressure and also a bit incensed at the DYELESS gaffe. FAZED is better here

>JD: ADILNPT B6 PLAID +32 203
#note I actually saw PIEPLANT here, which sims better than PLAID even though opens the triple because there are 5 Ns and 4 Ts left.

#note this lame play lost me the game. I didn't have the time to find anything better. Star play is the awesome COITION at E7 but just CLIT at 11C is not far off.
>Mike_Frentz: EFNOT K10 OF.EN +32 365
>JD: ACIIORT 7I .TOAI +19 329
#note probably time to start fishing - with two Ns out, BORNITIC looks like a fair try (and it scores 89 which could be enough). instead, I was super-low on time and just kind of played randomly. too bad.
