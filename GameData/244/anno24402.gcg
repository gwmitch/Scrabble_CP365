>JD: BEEHLOS 8G HOB +16 16
#note a very curious sim - HE at 8G comes out even with HOB, and distinctly better than EH! I don't believe in a difference between HE and EH, but I suppose HOB makes it easier to make the board defensive by playing parallel.

>JD: AEGGIOP H1 AGOG +31 317
#note debated between AGGIE or AGOG for what kept the board more open. I liked opening the G to bingo to, and the E is valuable. probably need to draw the S if I'm going to win.
>Joe_Edley: NTW 3G W.NT +21 351
>JD: EIINPTU 7F UP +19 336
#note my position at this point is terrible. I tried this play because I thought that EIINT combined decently with the V on row 14, but really all I saw was drawing VEINIEST or VITRINES to win. I will also take the time to point the existence of UNISEPTATE# as a potential CSW fish.
>Joe_Edley: IPQU E4 QUIP +37 388
#note QUIP sucks even more than it could because Joe played it super fast, signaling that he very likely has the S
>JD: EFIIINT 8L ..T. +8 344
#note I fished for VINIFIED/VINIFIES at the bottom, theoretically 2/8 - but a play across at row 8 is enough to outrun VINIFIED. if the S is somehow in the bag then Joe would have to go out of his way to block VINIFIES to win. Quackle also suggests just fishing an I, but Joe is not going to open the board for me in that case.
