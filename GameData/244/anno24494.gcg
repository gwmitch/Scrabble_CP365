#note Huge miss, CADEAU. The possibility of a big J play distracted me, although I don't know that I could have found CADEAU on a clean board anyway.

#note Wasn't sure of PURDA (PURDAH, yes), and I figured that playing it would just give Evans a shot at hitting me hard with the ess or blank, so I played it safe and hoped to draw a safer play next turn. The F is the only tile that hurts me there, so I'm willing to risk it.

#note Nothing I can do about this setup.

#note FAURD was the play, but even if I had seen it, I would not have known that it doesn't take the ess.

#note And I'm fucked once again thanks to the blanks. I don't think Evans has a win if I had drawn the blank.

Of course, if I had known FAURD, and known that it doesn't take an ess, and ended up with a rack of EEIOPYU at the end, I would have had a win, but drawing the blanks is much easier than knowing all the words and their hooks.
