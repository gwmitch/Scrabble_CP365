Of course, getting the +5 makes CAURI Quackle's new best.

CAURI challenged.

#note Ross's move was a simple choice. Neil probably not happy Ross got those power tiles for a big score because he's even further behind now.

#note Ross just needs to keep scoring to cover the lead as there are a lack of bonus opportunities on this board.

#note Quackle's Best.

Neil's only choice might be to make openings and try for a bonus. I doubt he can outscore Ross without them.
>Ross_MacKenzie: ADINSVW 15D WAIV.S +28 342
#note Neil's half-a-bonus play makes the endgame a bit more interesting now.

That play creates a Q hotspot. could be a game-swinger.

Quackle's Best: 2B VAW 23
>Neil_Rowley: DDEILNU 2B DUD +13 301
#note Ross's play takes out one of the last possible floaters that Neil could use. Another being the first E of RETIRE, which isn't really a floater because it's limited by what's either side of it. There's also enough space around the A of ALOWE (the S going before S-OHO) but it's tricky too.

Ross replies to this play with a big YES. He knew the fish was coming.
