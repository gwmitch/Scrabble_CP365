#note I think i can explain Phil's choice of ON instead of OR..
Basically, OR is way too easy to block (hook B for ORB) which kills any bonus lane, whereas ON can only be blocked with the E and Phil is holding the last Rs for ONER making the lane technically unblockable. (i.e. closing column M opens N then for Phil.)

Quackle Championship Player's Best: 13J ENUF 16 but this play still gets 100% victory.
