>JD: DEEPRRU 11E UPRE.RED +94 386
#note a great draw - I almost chickened out of UPREARED for some reason to play PRECURED, but thankfully didn't
>Orry_Swift: EEFHOST -  +0 313
#note Orry challenged because he was in trouble
>JD: AEFKRST 13G FR.SKET +36 422
#note nothing feels better than finding a play that doesn't show up on static, but that jumps to the top of the sim. no need to open with KRAFT

>JD: AAFLOTU 13A OAF +24 446
#note probably must spend one more turn next turn making sure he can't triple-triple here.
>Orry_Swift: DNO D3 NOD +12 335
>JD: AHLOOTU 14A HOT +29 475
#note still saw the possibility of HANDSOME, so had to block. one possible bingo remains after HOT - DIOSg(E)N(I)N at 9B, which would be a million style points but enough to win the game. I emptied the bag to prevent him from fishing again.
