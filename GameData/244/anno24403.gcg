#note no GENERANT# for me. I felt compelled to open the board even if it led to a lot of points for Chris - hence my placement of EN. I don't mind  Q wants me to place NE at L12 which feels counterproductive playing against a human. I don't mind GEN at J8.
>Chris_Cree: DFNO O7 FOND +28 116
>JD: AELNRTY 11J LAY.. +16 40
#note ugh, all of the blocking plays on column L made me sad. the play looks like either YE or LYE at 12L, ENRT much weaker than AENRT.
>Chris_Cree: DEEGIST 14G SEDGIE.T +78 194
>JD: BENRTUZ H13 R.Z +36 76
#note hoping to slow the game down.
>Chris_Cree: HIK 9G KHI +25 219
>JD: BEENNTU 13C BUNTE. +21 97
#note Q has me at about 1.8% win chance
>Chris_Cree: ABDO L3 ADBO. +25 244
#note he could just slot ADORED at 10J
>JD: CCEILNS 3F SCENIC.L +82 179
#note well, that helps
>Chris_Cree: FLW H1 FL.W +42 286
>JD: AEIINRS 10A SENARII +67 246
#note definitely SENARII over SIRENIAN to open more lanes.
>Chris_Cree: ADW A7 WAD. +24 310
#note he took his time on this play...
>JD: AEIMQRU C3 RAMEQUI. +110 356
#note I had spotted MARQUISE and was praying he wouldn't block - fortunately, when he did I saw my backup play!
>Chris_Cree: AENOPTV -  +0 310
#note Chris challenged
>JD: EMNOPRV B2 VENOM +50 406
>Chris_Cree: LOOP 12H POOL +31 341
>JD: IIOPRTX 2H .OX +53 459
#note wow
>Chris_Cree: AAH D3 AHA +32 373
>JD: AEIPRTT D7 IT +17 476
#note Chris's rack is so terrible that I can stick him with a U even though he has a blank! I should therefore slowplay instead of going out in two, starting with ZA/DA.
>Chris_Cree: ?IOOUUV 14B VInO +19 392
#note he himself should save an O to prevent the stick from being extra-painful
>JD: AEPRT F1 PA.TER +12 488
#note again, I gain more by slowplaying with PARED/PAL followed by REFT, since he has to play a U for 2!
>JD:  (OUU) +6 494
#note when this game happened, I thought that this huge comeback would be the moment that jump-started the tournament for me. Little did I know.
