>Sid: DEFFMOO 8H FEOFDOM +86 86
#note Round 33 of the 2019 NSC this time. Commentary relatively shorter, and by me (Sid)

I played FEOFDOM here, assuming it was good. I figured Mack was not unsure enough to challenge, but not sure enough to S hook it-- Giving me the edge.
>Mack: AILLNQU M2 QUINAL.L +88 88
#note Mack had quin(e)lla here, but insta-played this because he knew I would not blink at this. He was right. I didn't even hold.
>Sid: AEEISSZ O7 ASSEIZE +179 265
#note Kudos to me on finding this ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE POINT play. Mack suspected that this may not be a valid play, but he didn't want to risk challenging because he knew I wouldn't phony in round 33, and he could easily outplay me to make up for this deficit.
>Mack: ACIMNTX I7 M.XICANT +81 169
#note Mack smartly knew that since he told me that someone successfully played this at a tournament for roughly ~230 points, I would most definitely not challenge for a measly 81.
>Sid: AELNNOS 15F NONSALE +94 359
>Sid: AELNNOS --  -94 265
#note This time Mack challenged without a doubt, because he cannot win if this is good. Will he block alen(c)ons?
>Mack: EINOPUU 12E EUPN.OI +10 179
#note Wisely blocking the high scoring ALENCONS. And there's no way I would challenge since it was only TEN poins. Ingenious move by Mack.
>Sid: AELNNOS F10 NO.E +6 271
#note But I miss SOLANINE because I have not been studying my high prob 8's lately. I played this as a way to block the x4 lane. Mack is certainly not going to challenge, because he knew that I would not challenge his 10 point play earlier.
>Mack: ?ELOTTU E4 mULETTO +64 243
#note Nice draw by Mack. And nice find.
>Sid: AAALNST K7 A.TA +7 278
#note This keeps a fantastic leave, so I autoplayed this. I saw the valid bingo, but thought it gave up way too many cheap points. At least I'm lowering volatility here.
>Mack: ? 4M .r +1 244
#note I don't have Mack's full rack here. He knew he could get me on tilt by playing this, since I previously let this go against a world class player. That's his best shot at coming back.
>Sid: ALNRRRS K12 .R +2 280
#note And I return the favor. Hiya! This greatly helps clean up my rack.
>Mack: AHOW 8B WHA.O +12 256
#note Since Nigel took THIRTY seconds to challenge in COLLINS, how on earth is SID going to challenge in TWL?

Nice.
>Sid: ALNRRRS -R +0 280
#note After drawing yet another R, I decide to exchange the R.
>Mack: AEINRST C8 .IARNETS +74 330
#note Mack's secret plan; play WHATO, float the H, make me exchange, draw STAINER, and phony. Worked to perfection.
>Sid: ALNRRRS -RRRLANS +0 280
#note Exchanging 1 didn't work last turn, so let's exchange 7.
>Mack: ABBEHOT 15F BOBETAH +124 454
>Mack: ABBEHOT --  -124 330
#note Mack knew that he had nowhere to play this beautiful word, so he tried this. I challenged this time, hoping for red. Phew.
>Sid: ACELORU 2H LAROC.UE +92 372
#note YES! What a PULL!
>Mack: ABBEHOT 1E BOBETAH +107 437
#note Mack didn't dare challenge, because larocque* is his favorite word, and also gave him a spot for this.
>Sid: DI 15C .ID +5 377
#note Forgot to write down my rack here. I decided this was the best play, to go for INSIDIOUS.
>Mack: EGINRVY 2B VERY +27 464
#note Mack could have played RESIDING here, but he told me after the gme that he didn't think INSIDIOUS was a word.
>Sid: ??GIINS 15A IN...IouS +92 469
#note With the help of Suhas, I got to play this magnificent word.
>Mack: ?DEEGIW A1 Wa +22 486
#note Suhas had already been caught at this point. So Mack decided to use Avery's blank powerup from round 32 to make this magnificent play. VERY was a VERY nice play to set this up.
>Sid: GJKPRVY O1 J.RKY +83 552
#note Mack and I now decided to try and tie the game using valid words, because of the high quality of play all game.
