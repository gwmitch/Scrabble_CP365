#note (Anno reedit- 6/13/2015). A lot of my racks are missing this game. 
>Siddharth_Murali: ADINORW 9H DOWN +20 20
#note On this turn, ADOWN is clear. I asked David about this turn after the game and he liked just DOW also. Back then, I wasn't very good with leaves.
>David_Gibson: EEILPRS L3 REPLIES +79 91
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ADGIOR G1 IDeOGRA. +62 82
#note This took me a while to find (I didn't even know GORDITA at the time)

>Siddharth_Murali: X 4G .X +34 191
>David_Gibson: AAQ K1 AQ.A +15 234
#note He was torn between QUA and AQUA for a while, and decided to go for this.
>Siddharth_Murali: BEEINPT 2M BEN +14 205
#note Horrible play- but I wasn't very good back then.

>Siddharth_Murali: IZ D8 ZI. +22 322
#note He said I blocked his bingo on this play.
>David_Gibson: AV E5 ..VA +21 325
>Siddharth_Murali: ELNS 11A LENS +23 345
#note I was really, really low on time ~2:30 left, so I really had to think fast. 
>David_Gibson: S 6D ....S +18 343
#note Strategic, insightful play by David that would leave 2 in the bag, maximizing his chance to go out first.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?CERUW 1J C.W +12 357
#note This is my partial rack. I made a bad play here, but since I don't know my last letter, I have no idea what the right play could be.
>David_Gibson: AILNOTY A11 .AYIN +27 370
#note David made this play that gave me no bingo, but neither of us saw mIR(ZA)! not even postgame! So this play loses but it didn't matter. David does have one tie! It's complicated- see if you can find it :) Answer is on David's next turn.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EIRRTU 13A .URT +14 371
#note I had 30 seconds left here, so I missed mIR(ZA) for the win!
>David_Gibson: LOT 9A LOT. +14 384
#note The optimal endgame is (K)Y(E) i3 ---> cRETIN 15h to block ANTLION ---> (L)LANO a11 ---> j13 RU(E), which ties it at 384-384. Hard to see over the board!
>David_Gibson:  (?EIR) +6 390
#note So close, yet so far :D
