#note Talked about this position after the game and Adam preferred NUN. I thought NA was better over the board, but Quackle is giving a ~3 point edge to NUN. I thought the leaves were close, and therefore favoured the extra line with NA. But it's a mistake.

#note Risky, but what can I do? PAWING is absolutely not an option. He just blocks the quadrant. WEB leaves two lanes, and my leave is particular decent in the lane that he is least likely to block (D column).

#note My heart raced when my hail mary hit two massive bingos in both spots. So GAROTED stung when it came down.
