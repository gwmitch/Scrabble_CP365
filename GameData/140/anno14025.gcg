#note Final game of the club season. I trail Adam in the trophy race by less than a game. If I win this game, and Adam loses to Sue at the board next to me, I win the club season.

#note Uhhh... this play is really awful. For some reason I couldn't find the good ones. M11 KAPUT or VAUNT is fine. I was way too paranouid about preserving my lead.

#note 10H MAUD. This play is awful. But I'm pretty distracted by the game going on next to me, with this win all but assured.

#note It was surreal drawing like I did this game, while watching the Adam/Sue game next to me where Adam got drek every rack and never got a bingo down. Crazy luck.
