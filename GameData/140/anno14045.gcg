>John_Merlau: DEN G5 DEN. +13 25
>Matt_Canik: ELLOSSU H1 LOUSE +21 34
#note I couldn't decide what to do between LOUSE and SOUL here. I figured LOUSE would be slightly higher equity, but SOUL really sets up a board that's better for my S. 2-ply has them flipflopping even at 9000 iterations, so I guess it's that close. 
>John_Merlau: IQZ 3G Q.IZ +33 58
#note lol of course
>Matt_Canik: AEILSTW 4J AWL +23 57
#note WIZ holds a little better, but this opens up extra lines. 
>John_Merlau: AEFRY K4 .EARY +22 80
#note Told me after the game he chickened out on WAFERY here. 
>Matt_Canik: DEIOPST M2 POSITED +79 136
>John_Merlau: FR J3 ..RF +39 119
#note Well I guess it's a good thing he chickened out...
>Matt_Canik: CEEORWY E5 YOW +29 165
#note Against a weaker player, is it right to give spots that can easily score 30+ on an otherwise hard-to-score board? If so, YEW might be better. 
>John_Merlau: GO 8M .OG +15 134
>Matt_Canik: AACEERV 9H AVE +15 180
#note This was a tough turn. Champ player suggests I play N1 VEE. I didn't mind AVE that much. 
>John_Merlau: AOTU D2 AUTO +13 147
>Matt_Canik: ACEEKLR 2B CL.RK +42 222
>Matt_Canik: ACEEKLR --  -42 180
#note Yikes. Really bad whiff of ALACK here. I was only about 50% sure this was good, but I didn't really like any other options on this board.

>Matt_Canik: ACEEKLR E9 ACKEE +25 205
#note Aaaaand Matt goes on ragetilt. 
>John_Merlau: BDEIMNR C5 BIRDMEN +74 304
#note sigh...
>Matt_Canik: AEELRSV 14E SEVERAL +76 281
#note ...says matt as he bingos after holding LR.
>John_Merlau: CNTUU B11 UNCUT +16 320
>Matt_Canik: AAEGMNX 15K AXMEN +68 349
#note Played AXMEN here instead of AXMAN because A is a better tile for scoring. Maybe I should have played AXM(E)N? I dunno. 
>John_Merlau: ?EJLORS A5 JOStLER +92 412
#note 'course.
