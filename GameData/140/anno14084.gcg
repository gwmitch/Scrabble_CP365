#note Probably shouldn't mess with 4 consonants, also DELF maybe instead of CLEF.

#note I was pretty well aware of this play's bad effect on the board but E9 HAND/HAD didn't occur to me for some reason.
>Marc: DIY 11J YID +21 103
>Will: DDEFHRS 12L EDH +20 56
#note Maybe slightly too early to get so aggressive. Almost played C9 FENDS to get some action going towards the top left quadrant. Also considered SHERDS, probably would have done it with something a bit better than DF in reserve.

#note Now pinning all my hopes on a heavy P/REGNANT play, the sooner the better.

>Will: AGINOPY D11 .YING +34 209
#note I would do PYA or YAPON a lot here, but in this particular situation I wanted to keep waiting to use those tiles/that spot.
>Marc: ORT 6F TOR. +8 296
>Will: ABEMOPR 14K AMBO +40 249
#note I think at this point my hopes were highest, scoring a ton and leaving a strong P leave.
>Marc: BNO 15A BON. +21 317
>Will: AAEOPRR A10 OAR +10 259
#note Still hoping. This play actually sims pretty well.
>Marc: ARV 3B VA. +12 329
#note I am getting the impression at this point that Marc may not be thinking about the P hook.
>Will: AEIPRUW 14A AW +24 283
#note I didn't stop to think about playing at H1 here. Too many points to pass up.
>Marc: DE 15N DE +12 341
>Will: EEIKPRU 10N U. +4 287
#note Trying to conserve ammo here and induce low scoring blocks, if I can keep the deficit at around 60 I have a shot.
>Marc: X 9N X. +18 359
>Will: EEIKPQR N5 QI +16 303
#note Argh, now I have to screw the board up to stay alive!
>Marc: T 6M T.. +2 361
>Will: AEEKOPR 7I .O +2 305
#note Going for PEAKIER. The cool thing about that is if I hit it he has GREISEN and this lane won't work for him, but if he is not thinking about PREGNANT I might surprise out-bingo him (he is super low on time).
