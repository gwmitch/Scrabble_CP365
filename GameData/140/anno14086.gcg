#note Damn, AMADOU is cool and I totally whiffed on it. OX is still fine though.

>Will: ABNNRRU 10B BURA +28 255
#note Very close to playing 5C URBAN, hoping Joe didn't think of RURBAN (or have a T), but BURA was a little too strong.
>Joe: WY G13 WY. +27 259
>Will: CHKNNOR L2 KRON.N +20 275
#note Guess I way overestimated CH here. Thought I would be able to at least get a decent play hooking HM. Sim prefers the normal L2 HONKER.
>Joe: GHOY 5C YOGH +29 288
>Will: ACEHNTV D2 HAV.C +26 301
#note Considered 13A VAN, 4A CHAT - missed B12 VENT. HAVOC keeps a nice bingo leave but also totally blocks up the only area of the board where bingos might go down and spends all my scoring ammo on one turn. I really like B12 VENT, but whiffed on it. It does keep an A with a bunch left to come, but I could probably unload two A's while also scoring decently next turn.
>Joe: AAEEI -AAEEI +0 288
>Will: DDENOST M8 ODDEST +41 342
#note It seemed that Joe was likely to have just dumped vowels, as opposed to a power tile or multiple power tiles. So I liked this play to score, leave a consonant (and hook for UDO, I guess), and hopefully draw some combo of vowels and power tiles.
>Joe: DEJU 2J JU.ED +66 354
#note Yikes
>Will: AIINOOS C1 ION +15 357
#note This seemed best, setting up the last O and creating a spot that will be impossible for Joe to use with the Q or Z. Doesn't sim too well, but Championship Player likes it a lot, along with E2 OI.
>Joe: AQ B13 QA. +24 378
>Will: AAFIOST B2 OAF +27 384
#note After screwing up my endgames all day I finally get one right (admittedly not a very difficult one).
