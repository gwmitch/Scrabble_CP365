>Mariah_Smith: EILOO 8D LOOIE +12 12
#note Context: I'm sitting in 3rd, if Charlie wins I can leapfrog into 1st if I can win by 53 points more than he wins by. So with that in mind, I'm playing to maximize my spread here. 
>Matt_Canik: AILNOPW 7G POW +24 24
>Mariah_Smith: EKNOT 6H TOKEN +27 39
>Matt_Canik: AADILNQ 9C QAID +31 55
#note Even though I have the L, I think this is more prone to bingos down the line. Playing for spread, that's a good thing, right?
>Mariah_Smith: ACL 10E LAC +16 55
>Matt_Canik: AALNSTU M6 SULTANA +69 124
#note I didn't like this placement, but 9H scored less, still gave up big plays with an S, and also gave up big plays without it. 2-ply puts this way up. 
>Mariah_Smith: GINRS 13I GRINS +32 87
>Matt_Canik: AAEGLSV 11K VA.G +16 140
#note Meep. I got so enamored with setting up this S hook that I miss S(E)LVAGE 2x2 44.

>Mariah_Smith: IR J4 IR. +7 118
>Matt_Canik: AADEOSZ 3I ADOZE +41 209
#note She is under 6 minutes on time now because she's been shuffling her tiles chronically the last two turns. Seems pretty apparent she's got at least one blank, so I'm not playing anything like ZOEA B11 or ADOZE D11. 
>Mariah_Smith: EI L3 .EI. +26 144
>Matt_Canik: AEMRRSY E7 R...Y +16 225
#note (PI)S(C)ARY is a neat play. I didn't want to open things, but I wanted to play for spread... I dunno, maybe I should have taken the points with MY or MASER B10?
>Mariah_Smith: OUY H10 YOU +16 160
>Matt_Canik: ABEFMRS D12 FARM +36 261
#note Simulating this with a blank as partial opponent rack, MABES and FAB are coming out a lot higher. I didn't think she was at all likely to 3x3 with the M, wasn't concerned about that. This scored enough to outrun bingoes down to the D at O8 and held the S to score at O11 in the future. Q still likes MABES B10 for 48, despite the EMU line it opens. I guess with one TWS open, a 2nd one being open really isn't bad.

#note She sighed after I played this, dunno what I blocked but glad I blocked it. 
>Mariah_Smith: EHJNOPV O5 VEN. +8 257
>Matt_Canik: EFHJOUX 1L FOX +31 337
#note This scores so well that I don't really need to outrun bingos at 2C if she has them, and shutting down now and outrunning seems to give me 50-70 point wins, which are fairly useless. 
>Mariah_Smith: CHOW 2F CHOW +24 281
>Matt_Canik: AEEHJNU 1G EH +35 372
#note Aaaand John Merlau beat Charlie, so I'm getting 2nd regardless. Damn.
