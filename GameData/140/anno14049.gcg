#note At this point, I'm terrified of JEUX, just in case he confused them. He muttered "god DAMNit" like 8 times. I'm really afraid of that, and can't figure out what to do.

#note There's not a single play that scores over 17 this turn, and in a game like this I think points are crucially important. I got really fixated on holding my A since it was the last one, which is sort of stupid of me. DIDIE here sets up potential stuff with my S, and I'll almost certainly draw into one of those high-scoring tiles left in the bag... I completely whiffed ADIEU(X), which seems fine in this situation. I'm also low on time, something I practically never have to deal with... but the reality is I messed this turn up and shouldn't make excuses. 
>Charlie_Southwell: DFO 4C OF..D +27 265
#note Almost certain he's setting up JO/JO.
>Matt_Canik: AEPSUVY 4L Y.UP +42 308
#note again, pretty certain of the JO setup, but can I really pass this play up? I don't think PYE 3B is worth it, and simming with JO as a partial opponent rack still has this far ahead. 
>Charlie_Southwell: JO 3C JO +41 306
>Matt_Canik: AEEHLSV 14B LEASH +40 348
#note A tough play for me to make, but it was far too many points not to take in a game like this. 
>Charlie_Southwell: EOZ N8 .OZE +33 339
>Matt_Canik: EEKNNSV O11 SEVEN +29 377
#note I didn't know SKEEN or SKENE, which obviously are the best play. I really didn't like how these plays emptied the bag... up 38 in an endgame where you both have racks of 7 and it's his turn still seems like a fine position, though, and if I can dodge a play like CORD I'll win this game- the K will net me a lot. I was under 2:00 and didn't really have time to look for bingos through row 6.

#note Desperation challenge... when you haven't actively played tourneys in 20 years, you've got an excuse to be rusty.
