#note While waiting for Carl's opening play, I found all 3 8s that my rack makes. He did not give me the right letter.  Sim likes taking a few extra pts with LUMA 7G or ALUM 7F

#note This is so many pts, but it closes the board so much, I'm not sure I can win.  Need a big miracle.  7J THICK maximizes win% accord to duck.  (I)NK 10D is another option that keeps the board open.  Hard not to take 48 pts, but I'm already 1-7: should go for the miracle win with THICK.
