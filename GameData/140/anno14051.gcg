>E_Tran: AAEELRS 10E AE +11 28
#note 12C AE wins the sim.  I like it: makes it hard to block the B and E lines; sets up my L; sets up bingoes on 13.  Lots of good things

#note Board is already very closed; need to open it.  The sim likes a bunch of wussy plays like LAV or SALIVA.  Seems to me a good leave doesn't do very much for me on this board, unless I open it up

#note keeping the O, to maximize the chances I hit a J play at 1D.  Sim agrees.

#note Takes a small lead, on a really dead board.  would do again.

>E_Tran: ?EGIINO 1N OI +8 316
#note 4J INTI wins the sim.  It scores better, and there are a lot of I's left in the bag.  After DIF, it looks like Nigel was consonant heavy, meaning even more vowels in the pool.
>Nigel_P: AQRSTTV -QV +0 322
#note Nigel's actual rack
>E_Tran: ?EGINRY B4 sYNERGI. +66 382
#note Game losing play here.  His last play signals a good rack, and likely just threw the Q in the bag.  Should definitely play SYRINGED here, to set up the likely case of drawing QI.  I thought of this sequence right after hitting my clock, dangit.
>Nigel_P: ?AIRSTT 4L .I +5 327
#note He is 89% to win after this play.  If I make SYRINGED, only 20%.
>E_Tran: CILNOQV A3 QI +14 396
#note Best is NICOL N4 or IN(TI) to reduce his bingo options.
