>Ross_Brown: ?AAAEIN 13I AA +11 174
#note Too concentrated on the bottom TWS to look for the bingo spot.
>Carl_Johnson: DEEMNPR 7G ..MPERED +19 224
#note The way I saw it, I needed to get at those blanks in order to win. I also liked that this made the board less bingo-friendly. However, I failed to spot DEPERM I2, which similarly closes the board and scores more. (-10)

>Carl_Johnson: DDEENSY 1A EDDY +49 273
>Ross_Brown: ACEEGNO 1K AGONE +25 279
#note Quackle prefers 1K OCEAN, but I'm mindful there is a K out there that Carl may have held back, hoping to play it at H1.
>Carl_Johnson: DEEIINS 1F DIS +27 300
#note This sims a lot higher than you might think. S's are cheap, but vowels are not. There are simply too many ways Ross can hit H1 to unclutter his probably consonant-heavy rack. NISEI 14K and SEEDING 15A both sim higher, but I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be better long-term. (-5?)

>Ross_Brown: ?AEILNT A1 .NTAILEd +74 370
#note There are more points to be had on Column D, but this seems more sterilizing, and those bingos on Column D don't do anything to reduce the prospect of a big F play.
>Carl_Johnson: ABFSSSV B10 FABS +30 401
#note Best. My rack is an embarassment of riches:  none of my plays scores enough or stops him from playing out.
>Ross_Brown: LRUY 12B .URLY +20 390
#note And this is what you call a fortuitous final rack.
