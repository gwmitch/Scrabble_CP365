>Dad: EEEGMNR H4 MERGE +22 22
#note This is just one of those game I played horribly and still won. Worst thing is, I end up blowing him out too. 
>Sid: AIOPT G8 PATIO +12 12
>Dad: ADEINNT 8G ..N +5 27
#note Yes, I actually missed anointed/antinode, which I realized after I fished off the N. *facepalm*
>Sid: DEIRSTW 5G W.IRDEST +74 86
#note Nice.
>Dad: ADEINTU 9I AUDIENT +63 90
#note Missed the emerge hook, which I will all game long. :/
>Sid: EJ O7 JE. +30 116
>Dad: ADLMNPT H12 PALM +40 130
#note Best.
>Sid: NRTWY L8 W.NTRY +32 148

#note Missed emerge again... 
>Sid: BU E10 .UB +12 160
>Dad: ADEINOT N8 A.OINTED +74 210
#note Made sure not to miss ANOINTED a second time :)
>Sid: AEX O13 AXE +50 210
>Dad: EGKLORS M1 GROK. +20 230
#note Not best, not bad.
>Sid: HI 1M .HI +21 231
>Dad: ?ABEHLS 10J HE. +30 260
#note Saw SHAMABLE for 65, but not SHAMBLE for 83. I like this over shamable but if I saw shamble, I would have probably opted for that.
>Sid: CNO 6F CO.N +19 250
>Dad: ?ABILSZ 14F ZI.L +33 293
#note Felt this was better than SIZABLE, close though. SIZABLE sims better.
>Sid: GI 12K G.I. +5 255
>Dad: ?AABLRS 12B BLA. +16 309
#note Didn't know BHARALS, SUBALAR, or RAMBLAS, chickened out on BASILAR, and missed ARABLES. I can live with that though. BLAB actually isn't bad at all.
>Sid: EEEE -EEEE +0 255
>Dad: ?AALORS D4 SOLARiA +69 378
#note Second best to AILOBARS, which I didn't know.
>Sid: ACES 2K CA.ES +26 281
>Dad: EEEFNVY J3 VE.Y +36 414
#note 2nd best to EVE(R)Y or VEE(R)Y, but I like this much better.
>Sid: UV C12 .UV +12 293
>Dad: EEFINQR E2 REIF +26 440
#note Sims badly with quick player obviously, but I wanted to fish for an unblockable outplay. And it worked out well :)))
>Sid: FOO 2E .OOF +9 302
>Dad: ENQU 8A QUE.N +42 482
#note :)
>Dad:  (?OST) +6 488
#note This is the kind of game that I hate winning because I made so many mistakes, but it's a learning experience. Hopefully I'll get better and better as time goes on :)
