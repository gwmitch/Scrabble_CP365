>Winter: ADLLOTV 8D VOLTA +24 24
#note Play this with .1% trepidation, because I'm only 99.9% sure it doesn't take an ess.
>Steve_Glass: HOTY E7 H.OTY +22 22
>Winter: ?BEEFLP F6 PE.F +25 49
#note Didn't spent much time looking, because I've had this problem of burning too much time.
>Steve_Glass: IRY H8 .IRY +7 29
>Winter: ?ADELMR G5 MAR. +18 67
#note Spent a little more time here, but gave up quickly. Damn, I saw the F and H hooks to AIRY, but forgot the D, which would have been superior.

#note Wow, I thought it was good!!!

>Winter: BFGNOTZ J6 FOB +32 275
#note Hmm... Quackle really likes FOG over FOB.
>Steve_Glass: IJL 10B JIL. +27 225
>Winter: GIMNTTZ K4 MITT +22 297
#note Considered leaving GIMNT to bingo off that E, but I favoured turnover.
>Steve_Glass: ERU L1 .RUE +16 241
#note Glad to see him fizzling. I figure he'll bingo eventually and want a cushion.
>Winter: GIINTVZ C2 .ITING +22 319
#note This seemed questionable, but since I had the Z for 23 regardless, again I favoured turnover.
>Steve_Glass: AES I9 SAE +18 259
#note Smelling his bingo coming.

>Winter: NNORVWZ C9 Z.N +22 341
#note Didn't see (GO)NZO, but I might have opted to keep the O anyway. Did not conider worn to muck up the easier bingo line, but I should have.
>Steve_Glass: ?CEERSU L6 SECUREs +84 343
#note Figured, but I think I can pull it out. Wish he hadn't score so much.
>Winter: AINORVW 15D NAIV. +19 360
#note Can't play (C)ROW or leave the E, because I'm not 100% certain that there isn't a bingo I'm missing. This seems like the absolute safest play to guarantee the win.
>Steve_Glass: AAGILPS 8L .LIP +24 367
>Winter: ORW K11 ROW +17 377
#note And I pull it off, 15-0.
