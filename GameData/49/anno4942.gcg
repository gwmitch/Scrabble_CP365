>Joe_B.: EIPRSTZ 8G SPRITZ +54 54
#note This was an interesting opening rack for Joe... the classic short vs. long, score vs. leave play. Quackle eventually likes ZIP best, although not by much. Joe cited the dangerous extensions of SPRITZ as reasons for not wanting to make the play, but SPRITZ actually sims neck and neck with SPITZ, which avoids the extensions and keeps ER.
>Matthew: EHHKOTY 9C KHETH +33 33
#note Finally a chance for some of those once in a lifetime fives. My play wasn't best, though. I missed 9D KYTHE.
>Joe_B.: AACEI 10F AECIA +21 75
>Matthew: ELMOQVY D9 .OMELY +28 61
#note Terrible, atrocious, embarrassing, inexcusable, COMELY. I don't know how I made such a stupid error.
>Joe_B.: ABEU C12 BEAU +25 100
>Matthew: EEINNQV 7J QI +24 85
>Joe_B.: AEIR L8 .AIRE +28 128
#note Joe is able to score points through his vowelitis.
>Matthew: AEEENNV 13C ..EVEN +10 95
#note I couldn't bring myself to play NERVE, but it seems to sim a little better than ELEVEN. I played some paranoid Scrabble this weekend and often found myself playing scared like this. E5 VENA(E) is the play I probably would have selected if I'd seen it.
>Joe_B.: ADEEORR -AEEODR +0 128
>Matthew: ?ADEGLN 14H ANGELeD +76 171
#note Ooh, SPRITZING and my play are neck and neck. I thought about it. I really did.
>Joe_B.: ETY 15G TYE +38 166
>Matthew: DEFNOUV 15M FOU +25 196
>Joe_B.: IX 11D .IX +34 200
>Matthew: DEIINSV 9L .I +3 199
#note This fish wasn't as strong as I thought. I mostly wanted to pull the O, but also saw good times with A, E, I or R. Those letters weren't plentiful enough to make this play worth it. 12J VIED sims best. (-15.2) urgh.
>Joe_B.: ADELSTW N5 DAWTLES +68 268
#note Sigh. I was making bad decisions on challenges and phonies all weekend. And that's one of the reasons I couldn't bring myself to challenge. This was a really bad time for me to lose a turn (-68.0)
>Matthew: DEINOSV E2 NOSEDIV. +74 273
#note Lucky to hit this.
>Joe_B.: EORTW O1 WROTE +30 298
>Matthew: ABCDGLM 3C CL.MB +28 301
>Joe_B.: ORU O11 OUR +6 304
#note Uh oh.
>Matthew: ADFGGIP 5A FIGG.D +12 313
#note Time for some defense. This play does the trick, but GIDDAP does it better. I need to learn words like that. I missed the scoring play D1 PILAF.
>Joe_B.: ?ANOOST A5 .ANO +21 325
#note Quackle seems to want Joe to leave open as many lines as possible, including the F. F5 DON sims best with an 89.5% win. FANO is tops for valuation, as it has a decent chance of winning without bingoing. This will make the J a key tile. Anyways, pause for a sec and consider the position I now face.
>Matthew: AINOPRU 4G INPOUR +22 335
#note This is a tricky position. It's deceiving because I'm assuming Joe has the J. So I'm looking for the best ways I can outscore a JS? play while at the same time obscuring the bingo lanes just in case. INPOUR was meant to give me the best chance to go out in two and race his J play. I hadn't actually taking into serious consideration the possibility of the J being in the bag. Frankly, I just considered that a loss because NRST?AO would surely bingo in several places. INPOUR is the best play by a mile.
>Joe_B.: ?ANORST 1H fRONTSA. +83 408
>Joe_B.: ?ANORST --  -83 325
#note My heart sank when I pulled the J. But believe it or not, Joe has no playable bingo here. The best he can do is lose by 5 with M2 ARSON. I was lucky to win this one.
>Matthew: AJ F1 JA. +18 353
#note Durr JAR. I thought it was blocked for some reason.
>Matthew:  (AONRST?) +12 365
#note Some interesting notes on the score. -80 to Joe for eight minutes overtime. And... somehow... we totally forgot to give me +12 for Joe's leftover tiles. Haha. (-12.0)
