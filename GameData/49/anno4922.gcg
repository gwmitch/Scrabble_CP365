>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: OY 8G YO +10 10
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: AINPQTW 9F PAWN +22 22
#note: Though Quackle values both placements (7F and 9F) equally, Bob points out in the endgame that 7F puts an S-hook in a place where, if a bingo is played with S as the last letter, the first letter would be in the  triple lane. I probably should have seen that.
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: AAEIRST E5 ATRESIA +88 98
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: EIINPQT F4 QI +13 35
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: ?AEEERY 10I EYEwEAR +71 169
#note: Great find, and a quick one too.  I played QI in about 5 seconds, and he played this in about 10 seconds.
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: AEINNPT 7H PINNATE +69 104
#note: I usually missed this when I used to study.
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: JW N6 J.W +29 198
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: EHILLMO 8L HO.L +53 157
#note: I became so fixated on finding a play down the O column, I nearly missed this.  If you haven't read Howl by Allen Ginsberg, you should.
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: GOTU 8A TOGU. +21 219
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: BEEIILM G3 BILE +23 180
#note: Second to ELEMI 11J, which I am not surprised I didn't find.
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: IIRS H1 IRIS +32 251
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: ?DEILMO A1 MOLDIEs. +86 266
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: OUZ B8 .UZO +33 284
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: ADEFIMN B2 FIEND +50 316
#note: I got so hung up on the idea of an A11 play, then so excited about finding this that I missed DEFAMIN(G).  That would be a "fail," as the kids say these days.
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: EGK D11 KEG +22 306
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: AAMORTT 11J AROMA +30 346
#note: Would have played TAROT A11 if I had found it before finding this.
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: CHLO D2 LOCH +25 331
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: ACNTTTU F11 TUT +10 356
#note: Only for the leave could this play be 3rd choice.  Missed the crucial TAUNT A11.
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: EGORV A11 GROVE +33 364
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: AACFNST 14A .ACS +27 383
#note: Big whiff, not even on the list.  FACT C12.
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: UX 2D .UX +26 390
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: ADEFNNT C12 FA.T +29 412
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: BDEIRSV I1 DIB +24 414
#note: Bob took about 10 minutes on this play, and in the end he just grabbed the wrong tile off of his rack.  I had about 30 seconds left and was so focused on making my play that I almost didn't notice.  Spoiler alert: there's no win to be had for Gerrard.  His big misses are VIRES and BIRSE, both at 12H, but neither of those win according to Quackle.  Of course, Quackle assumes that I know BINNED and/or INNED.  Even if he gets DEB down for realsies, a sequence of NE 12L and D(U)N E1 wins it for me.  A sequence of NE 1E and N(ER)D K9 also wins it.  
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: BDEIRSV --  -24 390
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: DENN I1 DEN +16 428
#note: Wasn't sure of WONNED, but I would have tried it if it became the only win.  Didn't think INNED was good, and I thought I had played BINNED before and gotten it challenged off.  
>Bob_"Jungle_Death"_Gerrard: BDEIRSV 2H ..VERBS +40 430
#note: OH COME ON NOW.  
>Mark_"Cutback"_Davis: N 3A ..N. +8 436
