>Jim_Burlant: BCEISTY 8H ICY +16 16
#note Took a whlie to decide what to do here.  I thought BY was too easily back-hookable, though BEST is not as good of a leave as CITES, which was the source of my dilemma.  Turns out that my play of ICY blocked the opening rack bingo Laurie had drawn.
>Laurie_Cohen: EEELSTU I7 E.U +7 7
>Jim_Burlant: BEKLSTT 7H B. +8 24
#note Figured I would force Laurie to open the position up.  Didn't like burning the S  so early for only 23 pts w/o another one in my rack and thought that an I, E, or blank wouldn't be a bad fish.
>Laurie_Cohen: AEEELST -AE +0 7
>Jim_Burlant: EJKLSTT -JKLT +0 24
#note Certainly wish I hadn't gotten obsessed with drawing the bingo.  JETS for 33, or even JETTY for 23 would have been much better than this!
>Laurie_Cohen: AEELSST 10F TEASELS +67 74
>Jim_Burlant: EOOSTUY 6E TOYO +14 38
#note Yuck.  If I'd have known how the exchange would go I'd have looked harder to find some plays on the previous turn. :-)  Joking aside,   I felt the NW quadrant had to be opened up.
>Laurie_Cohen: ACELNRT L3 CENTRAL. +72 146
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIRSU E1 DEtRI.US +66 104
#note Was just glad I found this, period.  Had looked through the C and didn't see the 8 I was looking for.
>Laurie_Cohen: AENOPR 1C PA.RONE +33 179
>Jim_Burlant: DFFKORW H10 .FFORD +51 155
#note Felt it imperative to open up the bottom half of the board - something I think this does better than WORKS or DOFFS at 8A.  Only drawback to this that I can tell is that it burns the R...and an unseen X could cause me problems at 13I.
>Laurie_Cohen: ?ADILRU D8 UReDIAL +69 248
>Jim_Burlant: HKOOPSW C10 HOOP +35 190
#note Ouch.  WORKSHOP 4C (or even 14F)  is obviously much, much, better than this.  Seeing this rack it just didn't occur to me that there was anything resembling a bingo in there.  Don't know why I missed HOOK and only saw HOOP...but this turned out to be a fortuitous miss.
>Laurie_Cohen: EX I12 EX +39 287
>Jim_Burlant: GJKNSUW 5J JU.K +30 220
#note Missed the 8-A play, but felt that I needed to open a line as well.  The points are bad but this, again, turned out to be a not-so-bad miss.
>Laurie_Cohen: IQ 2B QI +26 313
>Jim_Burlant: AEGNNSW E13 WAN +16 236
#note Saw the S back-hooks in column N and didn't think the time was right to cash the S, especially given that it was the case S.  Obviously a bit of rack manicuring going on but this play doesn't do too badly in the sim.
>Laurie_Cohen: EW F14 WE +29 342
>Jim_Burlant: EGINSTV N3 VESTING +79 315
#note Woo hoo.  Back up to 11% winning chances from single digits.
>Laurie_Cohen: GIT 3A GIT +29 371
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIMOR J12 MO +22 337
#note Don't agree with the sim here.  Quackle's choice is MOD J12 also playing the D.  While I don't argue that there were better plays available than my choice, I felt that I had to leave row 15 open, which neither MODI nor MOD did.  
>Laurie_Cohen: AELNT A3 .ELANT +24 395
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEIRZ 14J BRAZED +61 398
#note Incredibly lucky draw which makes clear why Quackle didn't like my play of MO on the previous turn.  I have good...no, make that INCREDIBLE luck here...and I misplay it.  I couldn't decide which option was right - I felt that if I played BRAZE, I'd have been vulnerable to potential back-hooks down column O with the unseen N.  Of course, if I'd paid more attention to the tile pool, I'd have seen that BRAZED was just as vulnerable to something like VIDE O12.   I should have realized that I needed a miracle to win this game, meaning that I had to play BRAZE and take the chance that the N was still in the bag so I could guarantee myself a high scoring sequence and give myself a fighting chance. 
>Laurie_Cohen: AAGHIMV M11 HAM.A +38 433
>Jim_Burlant: EIINO 15M .NE +20 418
#note At this point I've conceded the game and didn't bother to think things through, so I just put tiles down.  Best end sequence, minimizing spread is NI(D)I O12.  This forces her to play V(A)I(N) for 14, denying her an out, which in turn lets me go out with COVE L3 18.  This would have lost 438 - 447.
