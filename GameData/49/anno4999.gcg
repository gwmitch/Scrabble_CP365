#note his hot start has me rattled here. FARER is a much better play.

#note how did i not see (BOGEY)MEN? ack
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEKRT 11B TRACKEd +79 264
#note sigh. at this point the thought "this is ABQ all over again" first enters my mind.
>xp: AEGGINV C8 AVE.GING +84 266
#note a lame phony that stayed on the board. i thought of just playing (BOGEY)ING before he bingoed, but this game was going so badly at this point that i decided to try and make something happen with a bingo that my 1300-level word knowledge rendered me unsure about.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEILNR 15A EN.RAILs +131 395
#note well, i sure did make something happen alright.
>xp: DDHHILL 8A DH.L +27 293
#note OK, so the key at this point was getting out of the "this is ABQ all over again" mode of thinking and decide i was going to make him work for it. lots of good stuff unseen, so i wiped the negative thinking out. HIGH scores more here but DHL cleaned up this mess while giving me some more bingo lane options.
>Jim_Burlant: IOOOO -  +0 395
#note i typed this in wrong. Jim exchanged 5 here. come to think of it, there are a lot of unseen O's in this pool ...
>xp: DEHIILT 14A HI. +21 314
#note i forgo HILTED N9 because i want to keep that L hook open.
>Jim_Burlant: AEL 14F LEA +12 407
>xp: DEILNTW 13B W.ND +14 328
#note i forgo WILTED N9 because i want to keep that L hook open.
>Jim_Burlant: IO 12E OI +14 421
#note he's swimming in vowels at this point.
>xp: EIILRST N9 SILTIER +77 405
#note i forgo SILTIER N9 because i want to ... no, wait, never mind ...
>Jim_Burlant: FIS 15L FI.S +33 454
#note damn he's got that S
>xp: AEPRUUX J12 .UP +14 419
#note i have no idea why i made this play.
>Jim_Burlant: IOOOOST O8 OOTS +26 480
#note i wonder if keeping the S is a better idea here for him, since the pool is very vowel heavy and he's got 4 O's to begin with. i think he was a little shocked to find YET ANOTHER O awaiting him in the bag.
>xp: ADEIRUX A7 I. +3 422
#note so here we are at the end, i can set the X with EAU 7D to cut the spread. but i don't give a shit about spread. i care about winning. i would rather take the low pct. play than the no pct. play. obviously his out is OOH and POI, so ID blocks that and sets up an interesting end. in fact, i might just pull this off. so i put the onus on my opponent to make the right play ...
>Jim_Burlant: IOOO 14J .OI +10 490
#note ... and Jim makes the wrong play. 
>xp: ADERUX A6 A.. +4 426
#note when Jim played POI instead of POO, my eyes got the size of beach balls.
>Jim_Burlant: OO L8 .O +5 495
#note Jim said afterwards he thought i was just setting up AX/AID with ID, and it didnt occur to him to keep the OI. part of why i didnt play AID straight out was that i wanted to disguise it. if he plays POO it doesnt matter, of course. but now he's got no out play and cant block my out play.
>xp: DERUX B2 REDUX +83 509
#note kapow!
>xp:  (O) +2 511
#note i did feel bad for Jim, since he drew great early and played a very good game. he took the loss well, rebounded and had an excellent tourney of his own. but this really set the tone of the tournament for me. as Jerry Lerman has said to me before, never believe in the no-win situation.
