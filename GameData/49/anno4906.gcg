#note Missed CUSPIDOR.
>Dan_Stock: ?AEEIRU -  +0 40
#note Dan challenges.
>Pete: ACNPRUY E5 YUP.N +20 68
#note Whole bunch of words I didn't know or see are at the top.  SPRUCY is best.  SYNCARP would have been fun too.  COYPU I should have seen.
>Dan_Stock: ?AEEIRU H5 cAU.ERIE +58 98
#note UNEASIER scores best, CAUSERIE through the other E for one more point sims best.
>Pete: ABCLRTW C3 BRAWL. +24 92
#note BECRAWL, which I didn't know, wins sim.  BRAWLS is second.  
>Dan_Stock: HO F5 OH +31 129
>Pete: ACOOTTV 12C OCTAV. +22 114
#note best.
>Dan_Stock: GH C11 H.G +14 143
>Pete: AAGLOOT B2 GAOL +18 132
#note I hated all my plays here... everything was dangerous.  This and the somewhat strange GOA B! win sim.
>Dan_Stock: R 6H .R +2 145
>Pete: AGINOTT 10H .OTATING +63 195
#note I really didn't want to do this.  But nothing else made sense.  And chances are, if/when he bingoes, I'll have a play back possibility.
>Dan_Stock: AEKLRST J2 STALKER +90 235
#note Interesting.  LARKIEST, which scores 4 less, wins significantly (5%) more.  probably for leaving a less friendly board.  
>Pete: CEMPQTU M9 P.QUE +38 233
#note I chickened on PIQCUET.  PIQUE is third behind PIQUET.   This mistake ends up winning me the game.  Also considered QUA, which Duck really hates.
>Dan_Stock: AEIRW O5 EARWI. +30 265
>Pete: ACDFMST A1 FACT +44 277
#note best, saving the DS for the juicy PIQUE hooks.  
>Dan_Stock: BFI N3 FIB +12 277
>Pete: DEILMOS 14H MELOIDS +92 369
#note I made to effort to hide the fact I had a bingo, and Dan saw my tell.  I didn't mind.  I was bingoing no matter what he did, and if he was blocking, chances are it was a suboptimal play.  
>Dan_Stock: INX 15G NIX +51 328
>Pete: DEMNOUV 2F VENU. +16 385
#note I knew my play was not gonna be "duck approved" but I like it.  Kills the bingo lines up top, dumps UV, sets up a spot for DOM next turn, and I  generally like what it does to the board.  DEMON M2 wins sim, but I wasn't leaving UV.
>Dan_Stock: OY K3 OY +12 340
>Pete: ADEEMOT L1 OEDEMA +36 421
#note Dan's play was nice.  Four plays tie for best win %, and mine is one of them.  DEMOTE m2 is the best valuationwise.  Mine is the worst of the 4, behind better placements of DEMOTE and OEDEMA, but I'm pleased I saw the word and thought through the position correctly.  I figured the Z was the only threat I could effectively deal with, and my play outruns the worst case of ZONED everytime.  He'll bingo from the D sometimes and I'll lose.  But not much I can do about that...
