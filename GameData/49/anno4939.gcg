>Instep: LNNOPSU 8C NONPLUS +70 70
>Jim_Burlant: ADDEIOR E3 ORDAI.ED +70 70
#note Felt that the marginally safer play at E3 was better; Quackle says I should have taken the extra four points.
>Instep: DGGILOV C3 GLOVI.G +30 100
>Jim_Burlant: IINNNRS D10 INN +9 79
#note Couldn't do much here except balance the rack.  
>Instep: DEEEIRT I2 REEDIE.T +62 162
>Jim_Burlant: HINRSTZ 4H H.RTZ +42 121
#note Bad miss here.  Quackle prefers ZENITH 4H 56.  This costs me roughly 5% winning chances and 12 points of valuation.
>Instep: EMOORST F5 OM +23 185
#note Opponent is human after all. :-)  Quackle's preference here is MO(N)TEROS 12B 61.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEINS 2F INC.EASE +64 185
#note Was nervous about the potential S hook here, but I really didn't have much choice in this position. 
>Instep: AENORST N2 SENATOR +90 275
>Jim_Burlant: DGMOUUW 8L WO.M +39 224
#note Thought the leave was wretched, but felt I had to take the points.  Quackle is on the fence about this; GURU 8L 21 sims virtually identical to this play.  I might be more willing to consider sacrificing 18 points for a leave of REST, AENR, etc....but for DMOW...I don't think so.
>Instep: ACEJKPS M7 J.CK +45 320
>Jim_Burlant: DEGOQUU 11K QUOD +46 270
#note Clearly best, but this game is rapdily getting out of reach despite my making the number 1 or 2 choice on almost every turn.  This play sims at just shy of 6.5% winning chances.
>Instep: AEFOPSX 12M SEX +40 360
#note Quackle disagrees with this choice, preferring  FAX O3 31.  
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEGITU G5 GIB.ET +23 293
#note Initially saw DEBUG N11 but felt it would be too easy for my opponent to shut down.   Since I really couldn't find a place I was hapyy with to  just play off BUG, I just felt I should try to clear as much of the rack as I could and try again.
>Instep: AAFFOPV M2 .F +20 380
#note Quackle's preferences here could be considered a bit reckless - first choice  is C12 AFF, second is B9 AVA, 3rd is 4A VOLAR.  Considering that both blanks are unseen to this player, those plays would seem foolish.  
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAETUW O4 AWA +17 310
#note Took a while to decide what to do here.  This position, for me, was a tossup between  WAE O3 21 and this choice.  Given that there were only 2 E's in the tile pool at this point, I felt it would be a little too dicey to give up the E for 4 extra points.  Also - normally, I'd want to keep an A, but with 4 unseen A's in the pool it's probably a good idea not to keep any. Quackle agrees, this is the number one choice.
>Instep: AAFOPRV D1 PROA +28 408
>Jim_Burlant: ??EERTU 13B aUsTERE +65 375
#note Wouldn't have thought that the best play was to pass up the bingo this late, but Quackle's first choice is to play ERU(P)T 1A 21 and draw 4 to E??.  Maybe for a computer, but with 2 blanks in the rack that may not work out so well.
