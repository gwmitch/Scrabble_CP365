>Toh_Weibin: ?FOTUUX 8G XU +18 18
#note I keep the T because of the OUT- prefix (and general TOFU synergy)

#note urp
>Toh_Weibin: ?EFOSTU 6C FEaT.OUS +64 82
>Toh_Weibin: AAANQRU (challenge) +5 87
#note Playing the bingo might not have been the best here.. but I get the nickel anyway.

>Toh_Weibin: AAANQRU 5J AQUA +28 115
>hkm47: EEHILRR N2 HIRE +28 87
#note HIRER preferred here, keeping EL to take the spot the next move, and preventing the S hook of HIRE.
>Toh_Weibin: AEGINPR J4 P..EARING +64 179
#note I pick this because it doesn't open the TWS and also because it might get me 5 points. It doesn't, though. On simulation this seems to lose out by about 0.4 (maybe because it opens a double-double line).

#note OOZED obviously better...
>hkm47: ABEFINV 13G F.B +22 232
>Toh_Weibin: AILLNOO 3E LOON +17 373
#note LOIN and LOON simulate rather closely on this move, probably because of the bag's composition. I prefer LOON myself though..
>hkm47: AEGIMNV L4 V.M +16 248
>Toh_Weibin: ACDILNP 8J .PICAL +33 406
#note Honestly, I didn't know JALAPIC or JALAPIN.
>hkm47: AEGIKNT 3M K. +12 260
#note Could have been better for him for the past 2 turns if he didn't cling on to the E..
>Toh_Weibin: ?DEIINR A1 .IElDRIN +77 483
#note Neither did I see DERIDINg - in fact I did play the first bingo that I saw that hit a TWS (apparently only 2)
>hkm47: AEGINTW E5 ..W +12 272
>Toh_Weibin: DGORSST M12 SOG +18 501
#note A little greedy here, but I think it's warranted. Nothing to lose anyway, and a possible bingo draw.. This simulates around 3rd out of the top 15 Speedy picks.
>hkm47: AEGINTT 7I T. +6 278
#note Way too much fishing going on for him...
>Toh_Weibin: DEIRSTT 10F DIRT.EST +63 564
#note TRITIDES is better here, blocking some possible bingos (and the one my opponent played!).
>hkm47: AEEGINT O6 GA.ENITE +60 338
#note LEGATINE is better.
