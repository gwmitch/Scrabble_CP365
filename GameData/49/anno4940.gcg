>quinquennia: EIOORRT 8G ROOTIER +66 66
#note -2.3 the 8D position is the leader.  This was the second worst positioning.
>j_scalzo: EHX 7I HEX +37 37
>quinquennia: CGILMNR 6F GLIM +19 85
#note -1.6 K5 MI(XI)NG, even though it's 13 more points.  My play has defence.
>j_scalzo: AEFIILN -IIAEF +0 37
>quinquennia: ABCDENR M7 B.ANDER +28 113
#note -1.6 H5 B(I).  I like taking a bigger lead and picking up 6 new tiles over fishing for just 4 points.
>j_scalzo: EELNTTU 11F UNLETTE. +68 105
#note I held this, let it go on the fact I knew UNLET was good.
>quinquennia: ACDIMTV 10D VIM +24 137
#note I took over five minutes here, but made the right move.
>j_scalzo: ADOORSY 12D YOD +20 125
>quinquennia: AACDPST 13C CAPS +32 169
#note Exactly tied with just CAP for 9 pts. less for best play.
>j_scalzo: ?AFIORS -IAFOR +0 125
#note trade tiles much?
>quinquennia: ADEEOPT N1 ADOPTEE +78 247
>j_scalzo: ?AEEINS O7 EtESIAN +76 201
>quinquennia: ABEGINU H10 B.UNGE +30 277
#note Didn't like the look of BLUING when I wrote it down so I switched to BLUNGE knowing it'd be worse.  Totally bonked on the star play 1L BE(A)U.  -15 equity.  Bad slip up.
>j_scalzo: FRT 1L FR.T +33 234
#note yeah, Quack was right.
>quinquennia: AEEIIOV 14G O.IVE +17 294
#note -3.4 L1 (F)OVEAE.  Quackle likes the II leave better.
>j_scalzo: JO M3 JO +40 274
#note ouch
>quinquennia: AEIILNU 15K LIANE +20 314
#note -4.8 K5 AU(X)IN.  This play isn't really strong at all, but it takes out a TWS, scores okay, at the expense of a bad leave.
>j_scalzo: AK L4 KA +30 304
#note ouch, another 2 letter killer
>quinquennia: AFIOTUW K5 FI..T +40 354
#note yay
>j_scalzo: AQU 2J QUA +37 341
#note boo
>quinquennia: ADLOUWW 15E WOW.D +20 374
#note I'd like to know what top players would do here.  Many Play likes I1 WAUL by 5.2 equity points over my play.
>j_scalzo: GHI O3 GHI +41 382
#note stop that!
>quinquennia: ALNSUYZ I1 LAZY +39 413
#note -14.3 5E ZA.  5E ZA, I1 LAZY, N9 NU, all win 26.59% of the time.
>j_scalzo: ?ACORRS 1D CORRA. +33 415
#note This endgame is wacky.  This is the right play.
>quinquennia: INSU 3I .IN +25 438
#note I rule out F1 RUSING* thank goodness, and find a way to win
>j_scalzo: ?S 4H a.S +17 432
#note Had this tile not been a blank, Scalzo would have scored enough to tie or win.  This is the one time getting double blanked was a blessing in disguise.
>j_scalzo:  (SU) +4 436
