>Ryan_Fischer: EFLMPRT 8E PELF +18 18
>Joe_Seeyah: ?ADEFIR I5 FARsIDE +71 71
#note PANFRIED or FIREDAMP.  If Q had its way, he'd've 2x2ed off PELF for 99!  Feh.  And so it begins (I've always had trouble versus him).
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DLLMRT 11H M.LD +14 32
>Joe_Seeyah: OXY E8 .OXY +32 103
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DHLRRT 6H R.H +14 46
#note TAHR is a bit better.
>Joe_Seeyah: ACEGI H1 CAGIE. +35 138
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DILRTW F2 TWIdDL.R +69 115
#note 2G T(A)WDRILy 80.
>Joe_Seeyah: ABEM D9 MABE +37 175
>Ryan_Fischer: CEIIKOY H11 .ICKY +51 166
#note Desperation, and a well-timed phony.  It's MICKEY.
>Joe_Seeyah: ADPRT C10 PART +34 209
#note He flashed a D then kept it for reasons I'm not clear on.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIIORR -OIER +0 166
#note Was considering (C)ORRIE or (G)ORIER but couldn't in good conscience break up that rack and only score that little.  ORIE(L) or RIE(L) on row 7 is good.  I'd get there next turn.
>Joe_Seeyah: DI 15H .ID +7 216
#note I catch a BIG break as he gets defensive.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEINNOR 7C NOE. +22 188
#note I finally get hip to that spot.  Best.
>Joe_Seeyah: BJO 6B JOB +34 250
>Ryan_Fischer: EINORST 1H .ORNIEST +83 271
>Joe_Seeyah: GOTU B11 GOUT +25 275
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEUUW 8A AWE +21 292
#note This post-bingo draw would have... let us say... more FLAMBOYANT people storm out of the room shouting obscenities.  :)  Me, I decided to keep scoring and pray for the Q.  :D
>Joe_Seeyah: NNO 13H .ONN +7 282
#note I benefit from more defensive dumping.  Of note: (PART)ON (patron/tarpon).
>Ryan_Fischer: AEELQUU E1 QUALE +39 331
#note SEQUELA is a reality TV star of a play: pretty but dumb.  :)  Of note is (L)EU, which with its leave could luck into some pretty awesome damage.  Why tempt fate though?
>Joe_Seeyah: NOO 2M NOO +14 296
#note Just happy he closed those lanes for me.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEHIUUV 12K UH +14 345
#note Interesting what static says.  HUE is what I saw first.  Almost did it, then wised up. He's been fishing, gotta be close.  And yeah, that's how I can lose.  Here's another situationwhere Quackle doesn't get it.  Champ even 2-play doesn't find UH, but it shoots up to 45% win% when everything else is 25% or less.
>Joe_Seeyah: AEERSST A12 STAR +25 321
#note He told me his rack here, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIUVZ 14F ZE. +36 381
#note 13H (CONN)IVE is another reality TV move.  EVZ(ONE) is cool and better for timing.
>Joe_Seeyah: EGV 3K VEG +22 343
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEISUV 15C UVEA +22 403
#note Now (CONN)IVES might be okay.
>Joe_Seeyah: EIINST J5 T.E +14 357
>Ryan_Fischer: AIS K3 .IS +26 429
#note He blocked my out at least.  SHE may have done it better.
>Joe_Seeyah: IINS 11H ....S +13 370
>Ryan_Fischer: A G8 .A +10 439
>Ryan_Fischer:  (IIN) +6 445
