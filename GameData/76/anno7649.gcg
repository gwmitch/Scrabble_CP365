#note DOG, still leaving two Rs?  I wanna move on.

#note 6J (KA)URY 20?
>Ryan_Fischer: BDEORSS H10 SORBED +35 118
#note It took me forever to convince myself this was good.  Pretty much cost me the game in a roundabout way, too.  (Oops, spoilers.)
>Liz_Gottlin: ?AHIOTU 12C THIOU.eA +70 120
#note Of note: 13D HAUT(B)OIs 64.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADFIRSX 11J FIX +31 149
#note If I'd've played FAX I'd bingo.  I tend to value Is more at times, and I know that's wrong, but it's hard to break away from that.

#note Keep the D too, really?

#note DELUDING/INCLUDED/INDULGED.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEORSVY A12 YO.R +33 206
#note I kept having OVERBY* stuck in my head so it's amazing I couldn't see/think of OVERB(U)Y.  VOYE(U)R, which I've played before, would've been nice, too.  Thisz way down, understandably.
>Liz_Gottlin: LMOT M8 MOLT +23 224
>Ryan_Fischer: BEIRSSV 13J BI.ER +24 230
#note I was feeling desperate here, though I shouldn't have. VERB N7 32 is interesting.  I wanted to try to set up my eses (the last ones).
>Liz_Gottlin: OW 8M .OW +24 248
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEGSSV C5 SAVAGES. +68 298
#note Well, it worked.  It really shouldn't have.  Those are the SAVAGES(T) AVGASES I've ever seen!
>Liz_Gottlin: OV 8A OV. +18 266
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIJNNW D3 DJIN +28 326
#note Saw JAWED, didn't want to give a lane.  Contemplating this, or keeping the D for next turn.
>Liz_Gottlin: ACM E5 CAM +27 293
>Ryan_Fischer: EEILNOW B10 WE +28 354
#note Incredibly low on time now.

#note I was totally blind to the D down below.  The D upstairs means nothing.  Ow.   (I really wanted to play TUNNEL, just 'cause.  But why, when I could blow the game without opening the 3x3? :))  At least my play was festive!  :)
