#note I always tell myself to give more thought to keeping H's on opening trades. Then the time comes, and I forget. Oh well.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEETTWY N2 YEW +24 91
#note Not really a great board to be fishing for bingos. I should probably keep a scoring tile for next turn -- maybe TWEE 7H, which sets up the Y.
>Merrill_Kaitz: EEINRRS 10A RERISEN +66 145
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEKTTU K5 TAKE.UT +44 135
#note If I were ahead, I might consider taking out the TWS with EUREKA. But this is a much better equity play, and it leaves stuff open for now. Works for me.
>Merrill_Kaitz: IPTW A7 TWI.P +30 175
>Evans_Clinchy: AABEFOY L2 FOY +38 173
#note This sims best, although I gave serious thought to taking out the TWS in the top-right corner with FAY. I'm still not sure which is right.
>Merrill_Kaitz: EFHORST C4 FROTHE.S +66 241
>Evans_Clinchy: AABEGOU B5 ABO +26 199
#note This sims best. I'm hoping I can hit that TWS in the corner next turn, since I've got a couple tiles to hook AR.

>Evans_Clinchy: ACEGHRU A1 REACH +46 245
#note The other option is to pass up the A1 spot and play HUG 11E. Decided against that for two reasons -- one, I don't want Merrill to claim this spot, and two, this is still a bad board to be fishing. At this deficit, I think it's time to start desperately grasping at points.

#note Quackle suggests SURA E10, setting up a bingo lane to hook my L. Good idea, didn't think of it.

#note VINAL 13C is better, followed by REIN B9 next turn.
