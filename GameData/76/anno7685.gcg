#note Q hates this. I don't see why it's that bad.

>Brian_Bowman: EGI 9F GIE +20 66
>Winter: ?AEMNTT K9 ETNA +11 60
#note I hate this, but I hate Q(AT) more b/c of the easy counterplay and the chances that Bowman will just score 30, got up by a lot, and the board will close up.

#note And Mr. Luckbag makes me pay for my folly.

#note Weak. I should have noticed that Brian wasn't likely to score there and kept my vowel.

>Winter: AFGHJRU M2 HA +19 310
#note I know giving up the vowel is dangerous, but if I take out those two lines, it will be very hard for Brian to bingo, and after he played the Y it is obvious he has a good rack. I stand by this play. FRUG is insane, b/c it opens yet another line, and Brian will bingo for sure.
>Brian_Bowman: EINRT 15A INERT +21 292
#note See what tiles he had!
>Winter: FGJLRRU C12 GLU. +10 320
#note This might be where I lost it. Could have exchanged, but then again Brian could have bingoed to the E.
