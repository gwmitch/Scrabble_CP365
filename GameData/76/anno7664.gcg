#note Oh boy--I need to beat Ce by about 90 more pts than Evans beats Richard, and this is not a good sign.
>Winter: AFHILOO 9C FOH +27 27
#note Hate the 3-vowel leave, but to win 3rd place I need to max out on scoring and luck into a bingo.
>Cecilia_Le: MTTUY H8 .MUTTY +12 52
>Winter: AACIILO 11E COI.AL +16 43
#note DONE THE 5-V 8s HALF A DOZEN TIMES AND TOTALLY WHIFFED ON THIS ONE!!!

#note AARRGHH!!! Meanwhile, Evans finds the 3x3 against Buck!!!
>Cecilia_Le: IIII -IIII +0 126
>Winter: AIIORSW 14M OI +12 196
#note Didn't like this play, but not seeing anything good I figured I'd take out two lines and go for a decent leave for a play at 13M.
>Cecilia_Le: GIPR L11 GRIP. +19 145
>Winter: AHIRSTW O8 WRAITHS +98 294
#note Ordinarily I would have been thrilled by this, but Evans is now waling on Buck by about 300 points, and I figure my chance of cashing for an 11th consecutive time is gone.

#note OH MY GOD!!! QUETZAl is a dream play for me (especially on the 3x3), and I so wished I had been able to play it.

>Winter: ?EEELTZ D13 .EZ +22 424
#note Really wanted TELEv(I)ZED*, but Cecilia would have to challenge. Finally decided to let her have PRE(Z) if I could get the bingo.
>Cecilia_Le: INOV L1 VINO +28 330
#note Yeah, she has to go for the 3x3.
>Winter: ?DEELOT 1J DE. +7 431
#note I'm pretty sure I can't lose, and I can't place 3rd either, so now I just want to bingo, for no particular reason.
