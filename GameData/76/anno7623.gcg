#note Chickened out on ALLAY(E)RS.  Blah.  I don't like making plays like LAY 'cause they give easy counters.  LA(X)LY might too.

#note So this'll be one of those uphill battles!  I'm game.  :)  Let's see how I do at catch-up...
>Ryan_Fischer: AIOORRS 5E ORRA +20 57
#note No W open. :(
>Dave_Rauppius: AEFFG 4H GAFFE +38 205
>Ryan_Fischer: IKORSTU 8A OUT..... +54 111
#note Ouch.  OUTRISK* is really TURKOIS!  I've seen that before, too (seen the K 7s, but it just didn't register like it should have).

>Dave_Rauppius: AGU F11 .UAG +18 268
>Ryan_Fischer: AEELRSU 14C LEA.UERS +61 274
#note Serendipity~!  I wonder if I'd remember to look for AURE(O)LES if this didn't go down.  Sure hope so.  I still need volatility, though, so it's not as if it'd help me otherwise.

>Ryan_Fischer: EHIIMNT 10J HI +29 417
#note I really thought in this position, with 3 left, I'd be in excellent shape to win.
>Dave_Rauppius: ACW B4 CAW +33 444
#note But I could not have foreseen, nor done much about, that.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIMNNT N8 .MIE +20 437
#note Damn Ns!  Well, Champ says 15J INTEN(T) which I saw, and was reminiscent of a play Cappelletto made through a disconnected I--E to win a game.  AMIE doesn't even rank, presumably because my out of NIT(O)N loses.  My play loses by less, at least.
>Dave_Rauppius: DEIMP L12 P.IE +14 458
#note He couldn't convince himself of PLED.  Boy, have I been there.
