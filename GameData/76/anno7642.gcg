#note Against a 1-tile exchange with this rack I'm giong to take a very defensive posture since 14 points for NIELLO or 8 for LILO aren't really enough IMO to justify all the easy lines it gives him.  I'd rather force him to either find an 8 or, if he has a playable 7, it'll be an airball that has to give me something back at one of the triples.
>Matt_Hodge: EO 9G OE +8 8
>Jim_Burlant: AEILNRU -U +0 4
#note Best.  Really lighting it up here.
>Matt_Hodge: F 9F F.. +6 14
>Jim_Burlant: AEGILNR 7H REGINAL +63 67
#note Sim prefers REALIGN in the same location by 4 points...but I benefitted from this in a way Quackle couldn't have anticipated.
>Matt_Hodge: ADEIRRT -  +0 14
#note Are you kidding me?  When this happened I wondered if Matt was just trying to play head games with me.  Some would say it was a ploy, but I doubt it.  Not just during post-mortem, but even on day 2 Matt was still kicking himself over having challenged this.  Considering that he had a number of solid plays on row 8 (DEAIR for 31 or ARID for 25) I think this was really just an ill-timed case of unrecognizitis on his end.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEIOO 10B COOEE +22 89
#note Best.  L4 AEONIC also worth consideration.  But against Matt's rack, AEONIC would have been much better.
>Matt_Hodge: ADEIRRT C7 ADR.ITER +72 86
#note Matt has 4 bingo choices (this choice, ADROITER D7, TARDIER/TARRIED 11F)  and they all score 72 points.  It takes a couple of hundred 2-ply iterations to sort out, but Q prefers the D7 placement by a hair.  But it's really stylistic preference more than a clear-cut winner; the bottom of the 4 bingos sims within 1 point of the best bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: AEINPRW 8A WA.I +27 116
#note 8M WAP is definitely best here; I keep convincing myself that WAP is phony because I  always confuse it with WAM*, which is phony.  So I put down the safe play, opting to burn the I because I thought the 6 extra points were too much to pass up.
>Matt_Hodge: GNOVW K4 VOW.NG +26 112
>Jim_Burlant: EIMNPRS 7C .MP +11 127
#note If you don't know SPERMINE, the only options that score decently break up too much of this promising rack.  MAP 7B would have scored 15 and been the best non-bingo option, as the EINRS leave is  worth conceding the 9 scoreboard points to MEN 11E.
>Matt_Hodge: CEUY 12A CU.EY +26 138
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRRS 11F SIERRAN +70 197
#note 3F placement scores 73.  I'm still winning 73%.
>Matt_Hodge: ADL A12 .LAD +21 159
>Jim_Burlant: BDEEEMS H11 .MBED +39 236
#note Best, nothing else comes close.  Right now I'm sitting pretty at 90% winning chances.  I'm getting good turnover and there is still a lot of great stuff in the pool.  With only 2 E's unseen I'm not too worried about keeping duplicated E's.
>Matt_Hodge: ?AILNTT 15H .ILATaNT +77 236
#note Beautiful find.  Matt is still winning only 35%.
>Jim_Burlant: EEEOOST 13H .OOTEE +18 254
#note Uh...yuck.    What was that I was saying about not being concerned about keeping dupe E's due to the pool?  This is definitely best; nothing else comes within 6 points. 
>Matt_Hodge: KQRU M5 QU.RK +23 259
>Jim_Burlant: AESUUVY 3I SUAVE +32 286
#note I saw SUAVE and slapped it down once I saw 32 points and 5 chances at the blank.  While both the sim and Championship Player say this choice is best, I don't think I made the right play.  Given the pool (only one E unseen and X still at large) I think VAUS 3J is better as it still scores 28 but more importantly, preserves the E and doesn't give away an X bonanza.
>Matt_Hodge: INX 2H NIX +53 312
#note What was I saying about being burned by the X?
>Jim_Burlant: DEHIOUY 1G DUH +33 319
#note Definite miss here - 1E HYOID is best.  I was too blinded by the U to find it.  This is the bronze medalist in the sim but it gives up way too much to HYOID just for the sake of unloading the U.
>Matt_Hodge: ABT 12K TAB +23 335
>Jim_Burlant: EFIIOYZ 2M FIZ +35 354
#note Quackle says AERIFY 14A is best.  While it scores 40 and does the best job of clearing out this rack, I don't think it's right to empty the bag, especially when I can turn 3, score 35, and take the bag down to 1.  I wasn't alert enough to recognize that there were back hooks to HIS on row 4 I had to defend, and in light of that I ruled out ZIP because it gave up too much relative to this play on the scoreboard and left me addled with the F. When I evaluated this play, I felt that even if he had AN? in his rack, he would have to burn the blank and his A to play through the Z, which could leave him vulnerable to a J stick.  Thus, I opted to take the points with this play and roll the dice.  And it set up a rather improbable finish.   
>Matt_Hodge: ?AGIPST 4C GAPIeST +77 412
>Matt_Hodge: ?AGIPST --  -77 335
#note Are you kidding me?  First REGINAL is challenged and now this?
>Jim_Burlant: EHINOSY 4D HONEYS +39 393
#note Couldn't believe my good fortune that Matt tried the phony, which woke me up and made me realize I had back hooks to HIS available on row 4.  Had I been sufficiently alert to look for those on the previous turn, my probable block of ZIP E5 would have resulted in an end game with him sitting on AGIPST? and me having no chance at overlapping the Z.   But now he's given me the game on a silver platter.
>Matt_Hodge: ?AGIPST 5E PAT +22 357
>Jim_Burlant: IJ 5J J. +9 402
#note So relieved to have won the game that I lose focus and don't see JET G3.
>Matt_Hodge: ?GIS O2 .InGS +14 371
#note And Matt returns the favor - N9 IGgS or F9 (FES)SInG score 20 and 21.
>Matt_Hodge:  (I) +2 373
