#note JIAO maybe.
>Nigel: AHINORW 9H HOW +30 30
#note Nigel and I were playing $3 a game $0.03 a point, and it was currently 2-2 +197 in Nigel's favor. So I had to win by 97 to even the score.

#note Nigel noticed the HEIR possibility right after he made his play, realizing he had the last T. HEIR actually sims best, but it's risky because it a terribly obvious setup. Next best is HIE in the same spot, because it keeps the T for bingo opportunities. I'd probably go with HIE, but HEIR is definitely an interesting idea.

#note Quackle isn't too excited about this play, but I thought it made sense to pass up parallel plays like WAR on column B. My thinking was that Nigel is likely going for a bingo, so I'll have FAS for 41 a decent amount of the time. Also, the only two tiles left to parallel EX are the L and the last S, and any LEX play will give me a 50+ point comeback with my F.
>Nigel: ABEGISU N1 BU.GIE +24 377
#note Surprised to find this is phony. The star play here is an easy-to-spot play with a trickier-to-spot setup: RAGE for 26 setting up SQUIB for 81 with a Q draw.
>Rafi: ?AAFNOS B10 FAS +41 443
>Nigel: AAAEMNS O1 AM +28 405
#note AME(B)A is the winner here.
>Rafi: ?AAFNOY B4 OAF +31 474
#note Quackle is afraid of equably/equable and wants me to burn spread... ummm no. Even if I saw that, Nigel's last play doesn't indicate a Q bingo fish.
