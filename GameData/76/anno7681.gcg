#note Not sure what is the best here - his move appeared to be a fish and it seemed quite obvious that I should take out the scoring spot (and make him open up if he bingoed*), but I'm not sure how. This at the time looked to me like one of the most defensive, while keeping a good leave. In retrospect though, the leave is pretty useless on this board...
>Nathan_Benedict: ELU 7H LEU +8 41
>Toh_Weibin: EHIRRTV 6C THRIVER +72 164
#note Was happy to see ELUTE, which I'm sure he opened up for himself.
>Nathan_Benedict: EEEINRT C2 TEEN.IER +70 111
>Toh_Weibin: ?BEIOTW 8A OW. +18 182
#note Played this to block the TWS and open up another bingo line. Looks okay-ish in retrospect - there aren't many Es left so I might not want to play mine off.
>Nathan_Benedict: DEFIILM K5 MIDLIFE +107 218
>Toh_Weibin: ?BCEHIT A7 B.TCHIEr +65 247
#note Ba(T)HETIC is clearly the best, but I didn't see it. Bi(O)TECHS scores more just one position above, but I think BETH D1 looks like the 2nd best play.

>Nathan_Benedict: AQT L4 QAT +30 314
>Toh_Weibin: AABDINU 7M BUN +24 397
#note This seemed like a decent blocking move to me, but I failed to consider the possibilities on line 1. CP recommends blocking it with BAUD 1D or UNBID 1F (did not see the latter, which I definitely would have played)
>Nathan_Benedict: DRSU O12 SURD +29 343
>Toh_Weibin: AAADEGI N10 AI.GA +23 420
#note This is a tough move and I'm not sure if my move is any good considering the volatile board. What I can tell is that Nathan probably holds low-scoring tiles, and possibly the blank. This gives my move merit because it closes off one of the most dangerous bingo lines, but there are many other possibilities which could render my effort fruitless. CP likes exchanging here, which brings my move to about 3rd-6th.
>Nathan_Benedict: KO 5C ..OK +26 369
>Toh_Weibin: AADEIIL F2 .I +4 424
#note I spent my last 2 minutes figuring out this move, and decided that this was probably the safest, though it allowed him to score and possibly take the endgame. AALII loses to SNOoZED/ SPA.
>Nathan_Benedict: ?ENOSVZ 1D ZO +47 416
#note Nathan told me he was considering playing (C)OVE and following up with Z(O)nES/ MIDLIFERS next move. Pretty interesting, though J1 oVENS seems to be better by 2 points according to CP.
>Toh_Weibin: AADDEIL M2 LAID +27 451
>Nathan_Benedict: ?ENSV 14A .aVENS +18 434
#note I didn't know SLAID is good - Nathan could have played VISNE to tie with me! (and I might have challenged, losing me the game!!)
