#note It does take a D.  From the B, BURETTES.

#note Through a C, ACARIDAN ARCADIAN.  Q wants 12G RADIAN 25.  That's some strong crack, Quack.

>Ryan_Fischer: AACDINR 1A RADICAN. +86 241
#note RADICANT#.  Was thinking RADICAND.

#note It's now my goal to play CORNU every time I play Liz.  :)  This wasn't best.  2F EU(R)O 12 is, oddly.  Feh.  I guess it dumps enough vowels and blocks that hotspot.  Also of note, H10 ROUEN 18.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEGORSU M2 GUERDO.S +74 329
#note Well, I definitely got lucky there.  DROGUES is more.  Forgot it, but not as if I was confident of the D hook then anyway.  She said this blocked either KYANITES or KYANIZES -- I forget which.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEGLORV O3 OVERL. +16 460
#note Well, if I dump the L and draw the blank I get OVERDOG.  That's about it.  This play isn't that great, but it didn't matter.  There might be a bingo through the Y, but I couldn't figure out which letter to fish to get it.  Not good at that type of math just yet.  I just wanted to get rid of some tiles.  Worst case, I guess, the Z is in the bag, she bingos out, I eat it.  At least this takes away YEASTIER.
