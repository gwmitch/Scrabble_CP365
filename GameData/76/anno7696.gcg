>Katya_Lezin: ADIQ 8G QADI +28 28
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEGLOV J6 VO.LE +18 18
#note J6 OGIVE is a bit less clunky, and I hesitated to open, closing things off like this already.
>Katya_Lezin: IKT 9F KIT +22 50
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCDEGZ K9 ADZE +33 51
#note A B C D E G Z...  *cough*  Anyway, I should've kept the E for hooking.  DEBAG keeping CZ is Q's suggestion.
>Katya_Lezin: STY 13K STY +27 77
>Ryan_Fischer: BCGNNRS -BCGN +0 51
#note Keep CRS instead.
>Katya_Lezin: ?ACILPS E6 PLAStIC +78 155
>Ryan_Fischer: AADNORS L11 AN. +21 72
#note I didn't want to take the A(PLASTIC) hook right away, hoping to cash in on it a bit better.  This slowed me down more than it should have.  5B DONA 32.
>Katya_Lezin: BGU M9 BUG +22 177
>Ryan_Fischer: ADHOORS 5C ODAH +38 110
#note N4 DHOORAS 73 -- #9893.  Oh.  :(

>Katya_Lezin: ADR H1 DRA. +21 256
>Ryan_Fischer: CEJPTUV 8B PUJ. +21 311
#note Best.  So very ugly, but best.  CU(R)VET is a good option, though, at this score.  Perhaps, considering what happens...
>Katya_Lezin: AMN 9A NAM +19 275
>Ryan_Fischer: CEERTTV 2F VE.T +15 326
#note Forgot about the E hook on STY, not that it mattered in this position.  VE(R)T blocked, but not enough.  Perhaps I should have opened, forgetting that she STILL had the blank and I might need to counter.  Champ wih two-play says VET is better, I guess because I have more options in response.
>Katya_Lezin: ?EIINOR 1H .ERIsION +76 351
>Ryan_Fischer: CEEORTT E1 TOE +21 347
#note She blocked (D)ETECTOR (mental note: anagram COTTERED).  Aw.  And yeah, TOE is best, oddly (statically, anyway).  If I give my opp EX, champ finds a simple solution: 10A ET 13.  Duh.  Note: I tried to deduce whether she had the X by how her tiles were spaced on her rack.  They were spaced 4 on her right, three on her left, which I thought meant she'd make a 3- or 4-tile play.  Wrong!  Sometimes it works.  Bad time to be wrong.
>Katya_Lezin: EX 10A EX +55 406
>Ryan_Fischer: CEFLMRT 1A CLEF. +42 389
#note Empties the bag, but what else can I do?  Champ agrees.  It's RAGTIME!
>Katya_Lezin: GIINNRU 12C IN.UR +14 420
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGIMRT 6E .ERM +17 406
#note I was playing as if she had GON left; tracked a bit wrongly.  As it is, she has tons of outs.  Best is A9 (NE)GATER 27.
