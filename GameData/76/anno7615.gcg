>Jim_Burlant: ADGMNOS 8D MANGO +22 22
#note Didn't think of DOGMA, which is Quackle's top choice.  This choice is runner up, roughly 2 points down.  I don't feel adamantly about this play vs DOGMA, but Q is right - SN is a hair better than SD.
>Chris_Cree: EINY D8 .EINY +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: ADMNNRS E7 D.MN +13 35
#note Getting cute, trying to set up something with the S on the next turn.  E7 MANNA wins, but this sims as the runner up,  not quite 3 points down.
>Chris_Cree: EFILNSY -EFILN +0 20
>Jim_Burlant: AAENRRS G3 ARRAN.ES +62 97
#note The only bingo, winning 73%.
>Chris_Cree: ?EHIRST 5E TH.IvERS +90 110
#note Best bingo for Chris, winning just under 48%.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEELLW C10 WEAL +27 124
#note The runner up; 4J WEEL is best. This choice sims not quite 2 points down.
>Chris_Cree: HTY H1 THY +32 142
>Jim_Burlant: EEILNUZ L1 ZINE. +48 172
#note Or ZEINS.
>Chris_Cree: DPRT 2J DR.PT +24 166
>Jim_Burlant: EEGLSTU F10 GLUE +22 194
#note My favorite play of this game.  A common word but not the easiest find for this board.  But, as good as this play was, I was about to blunder just as spectacularly on the next turn.
>Chris_Cree: IQ 4D QI +24 190
>Jim_Burlant: EEORSTT M2 .ET +16 210
#note I SUCK!  All I saw was TETRODES and I couldn't find the high prob 7, ROSETTE which is the only playable bingo.  While the ensuing 2-tile draw was actually quite strong, this miss nonetheless turned a game that might have been at worst a coin flip into a sure loss for me.
>Chris_Cree: ?DEEGNV K5 .EVENGeD +74 264
#note Chris told me after the game that he had figured that, since I'd dropped off ET I was close to a bingo.    Quackle prefers the J4 placement by a hair...and my next play probably suggests why.
>Jim_Burlant: EOORSTX 8K .XERT +60 270
#note Interesting - Quackle says L10 OXO wihch "only" scores 37, is the clear winner, with this choice the 4th place finisher 16 points down.   I just saw 60 points, felt it was as good as a bingo, leave be damned, and that was good enough at the time.    A strong case can be made for OXO given that AAAAAIIIII are still unseen.  But is it right to give up 23 points and pin all my hopes on a bingo that might not come when I can score 60 (a baby bingo equivalent) right now?  Whichever choice is right, this play caused me major problems on my next turn.
>Chris_Cree: AIIO 12I OI.IA +12 276
>Jim_Burlant: EIOOOSU N6 OU.IE +9 279
#note I didn't feel strongly about this play and hemmed/hawed for a while about whether to exchange or put this down.  I didn't like the probable outcome of an exchange given the pool (not exactly a bingo prone pool) and felt that, since I'd probably have another crappy rack after an exchange, the least of all evils was to turn 4 tiles, unload the U, hope he landed the O's, and collect a handful of points.  Oh yeah, and hope he didn't have a play at O10.   Not surprisingly, Q says my best play is to exchange IOOOU. 
>Chris_Cree: ACD 14D CAD +21 297
>Jim_Burlant: AOOOPST O10 TOPO +11 290
#note Best is apparently 7J AVO, which wins 38%.  Hmm.  I was still paranoid about something like FEIJOA at O10, and I certainly didn't like any of the B7 plays given the unseen J.  Then again, given Chris's next play, the duck may be onto something.
>Chris_Cree: JW J4 J.W +34 331
#note And if I play OVA/AVO per Quackle on the previous turn, he can't hit me with this.   He'll still get JAWS for 26 or JAWS for 28 at M11 - a 9-point swing.
>Jim_Burlant: AAFKOOS B12 KAF +32 322
#note Best.
>Chris_Cree: BFI G13 FIB +28 359
>Jim_Burlant: ABLOOOS A12 OBOL +43 365
#note Granted, I haven't done the best job balancing my racks since I put down EXERT, but still - couldn't Chris have drawn at least one of these O's these last few racks?  The sim is divided between this play and 15G BOO, the latter of which is presumably a bingo fish.  
>Chris_Cree: AILRSUV B6 VIRUS +30 389
>Jim_Burlant: ACEOSU M11 C.USE +14 379
#note Thought that MANGO needed an ES.  Best play is vACS I5 23.
