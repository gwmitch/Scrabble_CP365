#note Sim prefers HIT. They both felt so lousy, but I guess the E can help salvage the leave.

>Tunnicliffe: EIOTTUU -IOTUU +0 278
#note In hindsight I maybe should have taken 1C TUI. But I hate all the plays parallel to TATTLES, since I will definitely need another bingo in this game. I just didn't want to play through the EOTU leave, but really, it's worth it for 15 points.
>Hildebrand: IQS H1 QIS +50 360
>Tunnicliffe: ADDEOTV 12K VO.ED +22 300
#note I knew (I)V(Y) was going to be the play! I just couldn't talk myself into it. And even after seeing the sim, I don't think I could make that play against a human. Didn't see ODDITY, despite looking at that Y for a long time. I think I still prefer VOTED, to be honest, though.
>Hildebrand: BENTU O7 BUNTE. +27 387
>Tunnicliffe: ADGIORT N1 GORDITA +76 376
#note I concluded Jeremy couldn't have had the blank when he played BUNTED, so GORDITA would give me a decent chance to draw it. I decided to play GORDITA here and leave the L column open, since I may still need another bingo to win. Plus the extra four points is nice! I dunno if this was right, though.

>Tunnicliffe: ACGILNP M5 PIC +26 402
#note I don't agree with the P-fishing plays. Sure, CINGULA and ANGLICE are likely draws, but Jeremy replies with a GAB or FAB play every time. CP's non fish choice is 11A CAGILY. I was wary to turn over four tiles since the bag contained 5 of DW?AEEOOU. And I honestly don't know if much of anything can be inferred from FUGG*, since I have no idea how sure he was of it. I was hoping the sim would shed some light on this position, but I'm still confused. What I do know is that this play somehow cost me the game.
