#note Really don't wanna open any more.  Q suggests 8A ELUD(E) 24.  I forgot ULNAE is a word, too.
>Matt_P_Hopkins: AIKS 15G SAKI +38 244
#note Actually glad 'cause that could be worse.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEFORTU D11 FUD +19 321
#note Either way, he's gonna get down a bingo for a crapload.  Don't know what I could have done except for FOU (which I couldn't have known would stop it.  Contemplated playing at M9 to stop S hook bingos, but figured those wouldn't hurt as much as a ZEBRA hook.
>Matt_P_Hopkins: ?EEIPSV 14A PEnSIVE +98 342
#note OW!  He underscored it by 2, too.

>Matt_P_Hopkins: FGOR 8A FORG. +33 375
#note He had a stranglehold on the game until that, I think.  No reason to open a lane for me.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDINRT 6K ..C +7 349
#note TORNADIC no go (DICENTRA too).  I figure if I fish off the C, there are 5 tiles I can draw to let me bingo: AEUUS.  I guess D(AW) fares even better according to Champ.  Either I still don't trust Cs or was too lazy to really check that out.  I'm sure I had time too.  DAW blocks the R, though, which is why it's weird it does as well.
