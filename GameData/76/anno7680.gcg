#note I thought this was quite a good move, leaving the T for the hook - WET(T)IE 9C looks better. CP suggests playing the T off too, presumably for defensive reasons.

#note Nice find! I probably wouldn't have seen it.

#note This was "a crazy move" (as Vannitha described it). MEO(W)ED and MEO(W) 3B are bad misses, but the rest of the plays are at best on par with my move (with the possible exception of MO(Y)LED G12). I was worried about playing off all my Es, but look what I drew...

#note Probably not the best play, but it looked logical with the number of Is in the bag. CP likes SOU(T) or SUI(T) A10 (I'd much rather play SOUT, thanks). It's pretty close in my opinion, but CP reckons I lost about 3-5% chance of winning here...

#note Missed baCKVELD L1, which is one of the words I studied before Causeway. This move leapt out at me and I played it without giving the other possibilities (e.g. the remote chance that she bingoed*) more consideration.
