#note Damn, I can't believe I found this. I actually have to thank Terry and Stefan--I think this was one of their nicknames. Wasn't sure about the spelling, but I slapped it down with confidence.

#note Weak block? Probably, considring the M, which makes hooking UM and PI a possiblitiy. Q's play would have taken out that line and scored more.

>Winter: AACEGNT O1 ACTA +27 379
#note I don't see the (UM) hook, so all I'm looking for is a block at O1 that doesn't take an extension. Boy am I in for a surprise. Had I seen the hook, I wonder if I would have played off a tile, like the G, hoping for my own bingo.
