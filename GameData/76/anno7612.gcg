#note Nice comeback play.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIISW D11 WIG +19 93
#note When I saw the rack come out, I was feeling good, as I thought this would quickly lead to another  bingo.  As for how this play stacks up:  despite the scoreboard points given up to the sim winners of 12B GAWSIE and K5 GAWSIE, this play sims within 2.5  points of those choices.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AKOY C11 OKAY +40 84
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEIOS 15A BASE +33 126
#note  I just saw the points and turnover and 3-unique-tile leave.  B13 BOA wins; it's just personal preference that I don't like keeping duplicated vowels if I only have one consonant, even if those vowels are E's.  I'll avoid that if I can, especially this early in the game.  Just my own personal preference, not saying that the sim is wrong in its evaluation.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AALRSTV G3 TRAVA.LS +64 148
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIOQU 3C QUOI. +28 154
#note Q prefers D2 QUAI by not quite 1 point.  I prefer to unload the O, especially since there are six O's unseen as opposed to 3 A's.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DIM 4B DIM +31 179
>Jim_Burlant: AEEINUY -EIUY +0 154
#note In retrospect this was probably unnecessary.   I didn't like the ebb/flow of this game, and I was getting a bit frustrated - watching my early lead evaporate, getting rid of QU and drawing UY right back, and the final straw was watching him score 31 while simultaneously taking away my spot for QUEY.   This exchange was a knee-jerk reaction to all of that.   Best plays here are 10E LYSINE and J5 AUNTIE.   The only YU plays available left vowel overloaded leaves of the type I try to avoid.  At any rate - this enabled me to stay in the game.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CIMOU I6 CO.IUM +12 191
>Jim_Burlant: AEELNRT 4G .ELEARNT +68 222
#note The exchange may have been unnecessary, but so what?  This is the only playable bingo and it wins 57%.   And this game is about to get very interesting.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACENRST K6 CASTERN +78 269
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACENRST --  -78 191
#note The only playable bingos are SCANTER at K8 and 12I and TRANSECT at N4.  The sim prefers the 12I placement by quite a bit, but that seems reckless given the pool.  Sam's best play wins 67% here if he doesn't try the phony.
>Jim_Burlant: ?INORRU M2 RU. +6 228
#note Critical moment.  After I couldn't find a bingo (there are no 7's in this rack and the only 8's are RUMORING and URINATOR, and they don't play), the next question was whether to block?    I was sitting on a very good rack except for the UR and I didn't want to break it up.  Anything I considered (OUR 7I, CUR 6I)  still gave him easy hooks that would allow him to double the C, and the bingos that back-hooked those choices would result in a board less lively than if I just let him have SCANTER.  Quackle's preference is MOURN 11I (which I did not consider), but I'm not sure I agree.  While it would have blocked all playable bingos on his end, he then fishes off the C at D2 and probably bingos on row 1 the turn thereafter if I can't draw an S.   And I would have turned enough of this rack that I may not have any bingo to counter his easy row 1 bingo. Anyway, after rejecting CUR and OUR, I opted to concede the bingo, open up row 2 with something he couldn't use while at the same time balancing my rack, all the while hoping to trade bingos on the next turn.    This choice was pivotal in how the game played out.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACENRST K8 SCANTER +78 269
>Jim_Burlant: ?EINORV 14G INVE.tOR +74 302
#note Best bingo and sim winner, with 13H VOMERINE as the only other available bingo.   Interestingly, OVINE H11 is a very strong play, conceding only 3 points to my play and beating VOMERINE by 3 points.  This was held, but he would have been crazy to challenge even if this were bogus given his next rack.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEJ H12 JA.E +57 326
>Jim_Burlant: AEOORWX 13M WAX +38 340
#note Hmm.   Thie sim says it's a close call between this choice and WOO at either L10 or this location.  This choice concedes roughly 2-1/2 points to WOO.  Given the situation, can I really afford to pass up the 14 extra points to unload both O's?   Additionally - with S? unseen I felt the last thing I could afford was to let O14 go undefended.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: FLU O10 FLU. +15 341
>Jim_Burlant: EEOOORT 15L OOT +15 355
#note Blinded by triplicated O's with resulting loss of board vision.  It just didn't occur to me to look for plays that didn't clean out this horrendous rack.  Also - when FLUX came down my mind shut off and didn't think to look for front extensions to FLUX.  This play sims identically to 10A OOT for silver medal honors.   While it has the saving grace of cleaning this rack out to some degree it still doesn't excuse missing REFLUX, which absolutely should have been my choice.  And this SHOULD have cost me the game.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IN O8 IN.... +48 389
#note Sam, otoh, has no such brain fart and makes a terrific play.  But this game wasn't over just yet...
>Jim_Burlant: DEEOORZ B13 ZO. +47 402
#note Terrific draw!   Problem with the B column plays of DOZE and DOZER is that, while they balance the rack better than this, they (a)  give him an all-too easy run on the A column and (b) give up 13 critical scoreboard points I may not be able to recover from on a more open board if he hits mie with something like HYPED.   The sim likes my choice; Championship Player prefers B4 DOZER by 5 points over this.  I just saw 47 points and felt that I'd have to take my chances in the end game.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EHIIPSY 2E SH +28 417
#note Not sure of Sam's rack on this play besides SH, but he seemed upset with himself; I think he said he should have played GYRI to block bingos but I can't remember for sure.  At any rate, his decision to not block had tragic consequences.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DDEEOR 2H bORDE.ED +72 474
#note Another fantastic draw!  I never expected to land the blank on my two-tile fish.  This find was a lesson in sticking with it - took me several minutes to weed through the duplication and I almost threw in the towel with aDORED 1F.  Once I saw ORDERED as one of the 7s in this rack it wasn't long before I found bORDERED. dODDERER is the best bingo and scores 4 more, btw.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EGHIIPY N6 HYPE +26 443
>Jim_Burlant: BD G13 B.D +19 493
#note One amazing game.
