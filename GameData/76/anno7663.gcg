#note Ordinarly might have played the S, but on this board, but I didn't like my chances of drawing a bingo to the ST so I figured I'd try to score with the S and then bingo.

#note Again, could play PSST but want that S for a J play since I'm not going to bingo.

#note HUGE MISS!!! Given that it was a 6-point game, this miss could have cost me the game!!!

#note I smell her bingo coming, so I want the best possible rack for a comeback.
>Gina_Fassio: DENNORS L1 DONNERS +75 317
#note 1st, I got a huge break that she botched what would otherwise have been a CLASSIC luckbagging by missing the real bingo. 2nd, I HATED DONNERS*, was 99% sure it would have been right next to DENNORT. However, once I determined I had the win, I couldn't risk the challenge. Would end up hurting me later for spread tho--I might have ended up higher than Evans.

#note Saw REsEE as a weak out play for here, but hoped she wouldn't know it. Didn't see her really good out play.
