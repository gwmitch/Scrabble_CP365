>Winter: AEELNNR 8H .....ERN +33 261
>Kevin_McCarthy: DN 2L ..ND +14 404
#note Sure, block my line why don't you. @#%^&!!!
>Winter: AACEJLR A8 JE. +30 291
#note Hard to see any hope here, but to win I need the points from JE(U) and then to bingo right away.
>Kevin_McCarthy: DF 6D D.F +15 419
#note Nice. Another block. How creative.
>Winter: AACGLRY 8D C.Y +11 302
#note I don't even see a hope of a win without scoring 20+ and then bingoing out, and I don't see that as a possibility. So what the hell, let's just try to bingo even tho I know he'll block (not to mention have the S and blank). I considered G(E)L, but I didn't see any bingos in AACRY plus the bag.
