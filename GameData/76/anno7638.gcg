>Brad_Whitmarsh: GIW H7 WIG +14 14
#note Brad opens vertically. God kills a kitten.
>Evans_Clinchy: DNOPRWY I8 DOWNY +20 20
#note Bad defensively, WOP sims better. I couldn't stomach that leave, though.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: DEFIO 11F FOI.ED +20 34
>Evans_Clinchy: CEIKPRT 12B PICKER +35 55
#note Gah! I saw PRICKET but didn't think it was a word. It is.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: ADQ C10 QA.D +28 62

>Brad_Whitmarsh: IIII -IIII +0 62
>Evans_Clinchy: DILNNOS 15A ON +14 149
#note Maybe NOD or INDOL in line G, but I figured it couldn't hurt to block this corner.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AEPT 6H TAPE +20 82
>Evans_Clinchy: DEFILNS 5K FIND +26 175
#note Thought I'd get greedy and set myself up with an S-hook lane. Sim prefers taking out line 15 with FELID.

>Brad_Whitmarsh: EMORT 4A METRO +24 218
>Evans_Clinchy: AAILORV A3 A.ORAL +24 398
#note In this situation (big lead, clunky-ish pool, not the most bingo-friendly board), I'm not overly concerned about leave. Just trying to take out the obvious TWS spot and keep scoring. Looks like either this or MOIRA works best.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EX 5D EX +44 262
>Evans_Clinchy: AIIOTUV M1 A.OI. +10 408
#note Missed OVA G7. This is a pretty bad play.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AOV G7 OVA +26 288
>Evans_Clinchy: AEITUUV D7 ETUI +16 424
#note Just TUI is way better, since then I'm threatening UVEA 7K to go out. This VAU setup is easy to block, and his block won't give me any counterplay.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: CGNRTY 7K TRY +16 304
>Evans_Clinchy: AUV 7F V.. +9 433
#note Then I somehow manage to forget that I've set up VAU. Awesome!
