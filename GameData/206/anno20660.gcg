>Evans_Clinchy: ELNPRTY I3 PLY +19 19
#note This sims better than PRY/FIVER despite scoring 7 points less. I'm 55 percent to bingo with ENRT!
>Peter_Armstrong: AOZ H1 AZO +40 60
>Evans_Clinchy: EIINRTU 5E UNI.. +22 41
#note Definitely best. Humorous side note: The sim's second favorite is LI for 2.

>Evans_Clinchy: CEEIIMR F2 IMI.E +30 157
#note Close call between MEINIE for 5 extra or IMINE to keep the E.
>Peter_Armstrong: OOT K3 TOO +16 199
>Evans_Clinchy: CEEORUU H11 .ECUR +24 181
#note I strongly considered CUE M2, which wins the sim, but I think this position requires a little bit more scoring and board-opening. This gives me points, a volatile position and a chance to get lucky and draw a bingo.
>Peter_Armstrong: AHJ M1 HAJ +46 245
>Evans_Clinchy: AENOSUX 1M .OX +39 220
#note This sims best by a fair margin. It's important to play defense in this spot - a play through the H can be a back-breaker here, as can any play in line O if I'm crazy enough to play OX N1.
>Peter_Armstrong: EOWW 12D WOWE. +26 271
#note ...turns out these four tiles make EWHOW# 1K for 54. Good thing I blocked there!
>Evans_Clinchy: AAENSUY 11D AY +25 245
#note Another interesting turn - a lot of things sim close here. A couple of options are UNSAY 11A, opening a triple-triple, and YUAN 12K, opening a triple line for my S that might be huge. Both super volatile, but volatility might be just what I need from down 51. It's a scary situation. The pool is incredibly strong, with both blanks and a great balance of bingo-prone consonants and vowels. I'm not optimistic about surviving a slugfest at this point.
>Peter_Armstrong: ?DEFGST C5 FiDGETS +70 341
#note Welp. I opt to open a less scary bingo line, and Peter takes it immediately.
>Evans_Clinchy: ABENSTU 15G U.BANEST +61 306
>Peter_Armstrong: AEGILNO 14J LO +10 351
>Evans_Clinchy: DDENORT 8L .DDO +18 324
#note A difficult spot. The pool is still great, so turning over lots of tiles is fine, but how to do it in a way that keeps bingo options open? Quackle recommends DRONED B1 for 35, but Quackle doesn't understand that a human opponent can close lines easily after that. Maybe the better option is RODED# 13A, which forces Peter to deal with the triple-triple on the far left. Then again, that might be suicide. I don't know. This is hard.
>Peter_Armstrong: ?AEGIMN 2M .MI +27 378
#note This is Peter's actual rack, and it pretty much guarantees him a win no matter what I do. He has bingos here like MIDRANGE and AMIDOGEN but holds off so he can bingo out instead.
>Evans_Clinchy: AENNRST O7 N.RTENAS +59 383
#note I considered not bingoing, but there isn't really much here in the way of promising fishes. NAG 8A for 12 doesn't look likely to win.
>Peter_Armstrong: ?AEGLNR B1 NARGiLE +78 456
#note My only lead of the game, and it didn't last long. Peter bingos out to win the tournament. Congrats!
