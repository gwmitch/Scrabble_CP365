#note I saw LIROT but wasn't sure it took an S. I don't like setting up hooks I don't know. I decided not to play TROT or TORT here for some reason I just can't remember.

#note I completely spaced on the Y hook this may have taken. After I hit the clock, I was like "oh damn, NOOKY might be a word and I have no idea at all." Q likes he dangerous NNOT leave with KOP 3I.

#note It's just silly to fish here. I need all the points I can get - if he bingos I'm sunk either way. But T(O)RS/(TOR)T(E) is so nice.

#note Quackle is literally the worst scrabble player in the world and suggests I play TR(OP) here. 

I feel I HAVE to block the X play at 12D. I hold AIRS/AIRT and will score enough to win this game next turn. It's so counterintuitive, but I'm pretty sure this is the right thing to do. Thanks for the help, Quackle. 

Thoughts?
