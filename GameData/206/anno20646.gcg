#note TIL that ADEERS is not a great 6-tile leave. In fact, DEERS bingos more often than ADEERS! quackle likes AE at C8, or I can just play DEE at 7H which I considered.

#note my first missed bingo. I saw SATYRIDS, but actually thought that SATYRID didn't pluralize. I considered playing it anyway, but the consequences of losing a challenge were pretty bad and I felt that I was in comfortable position. I probably need to be >70% confident to play it according to win %, whereas I was about 50-50. ALSO I should probably just play DJINN.

>JD: BILLORX N9 .X +50 459
#note i still have a good X play on row 2, so my priority should actually be to block row 14 by playing BRILL at 14D (I can absorb SATIRIC if she just drew it).
