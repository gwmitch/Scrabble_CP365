>Joshua_Sokol: AAGLOWZ 8H AGLOW +26 26
#note I didn't garner enough spread to be able to play Joel, so Emanuel was on the other side of the table from the champion. Didn't seem like I could win, but I had a great chance at 2nd! This word looked familiar. And I opened horizontally without noticing! Michael made note of that and thought that this would be his chance to take advantage of my misstep...
>Michael_Fagen: EENY L8 .EENY +22 22
>Joshua_Sokol: ABHIMOZ K10 HOB +32 58
#note oho! I missed that ZOMBI still played! That's around 10 points down the drain. Maybe I would have seen it if it was horizontal... BIMAH also plays at K10, which I missed, but nah.
>Michael_Fagen: AEOT M10 TOEA +25 47
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AGIIMZ K4 GIZM. +34 92
>Michael_Fagen: AINQTUU J2 QUA +35 82
#note Actual rack. Michael originally laid down 9C QUAINT. I think QUA is better, so did he apparently. But if Michael knew more Q words he would have been able to see that exchanging the U is amazingly strong here! I would do it.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEIOPX L1 EXPO +36 128
#note I looked so long for bingos here and I was convinced I was missing something as I laid this down. Apparently not. It would be cool to 3x3 next turn!
>Michael_Fagen: EIINTTU H4 UINT.ITE +59 141
#note apparently Michael's first time playing this word he loves.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADDINS 12B DANDIeS +78 206
#note cANDIDS looks a bit better. Missed it. Looked a while for nicer plays, and again, there are none.

#note Not playing at N3. That's silly.
>Michael_Fagen: ACILV A1 CAVIL +35 238
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AABEIR 1D AERoBIA +90 388
#note pfft, no style. I should have played 10A A(R)BItRA(T)E.

#note lol
>Michael_Fagen: AKLORRV 15D VALOR +47 395
#note Yeah, this is 11 points off of D1 (A)RVAL. I knew he had to block my outs but I didn't know how the best way was.
>Joshua_Sokol: CIM C3 MIC +19 504
#note I'm lucky, so I won 2nd.
