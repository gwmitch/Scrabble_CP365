>Joshua_Sokol: ADIJLPU H7 PUJA +26 26
#note Game 2 of club tournament. It didn't seem that donating the more fortuitous S lane was more of an issue than both placing the P on the 2x2 lane and the A on the triple lane rather than the U. but the H hook on PUJA is also a factor. Perhaps what makes the difference is all between me and Emanuel. He might think I have an S after this. There also may be something to be said about playing JAUP? I don't think so.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: GLOOST I8 TOG +20 20
#note First putting LOGOS down. I can therefore infer he doesn't have another S in his leave, I think, since LOGOS would appear to be stronger than TOG in that position. Maybe not.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEILOQT J6 DIET +22 48
#note so I inexplicably missed J9 TOILED here. That is an improvement on anything else, although knowing Emanuel has an S makes it a bit worse to give him two spots to use it with. This is because in my experience, Emanuel is more fish-oriented when he has a nice rack leave, and if there is only one good lane for him, I can usually block the other one and leave him clueless. I really simply missed the O hook on AG, so TELOI is certainly right here. It sets up my Q rather nicely, although again, this play is less good given that Emanuel has an S. So I'm really not in good shape no matter what. Anyways, this was not a good play.

>Emanuel_Chicoine: FOX J12 FOX +35 74
>Joshua_Sokol: AILOOQS 11F QIS +26 105
#note This was probably my best draw of the game. I needed this S. But I missed a slick OLIOS play at 11D. Although maybe I really just need to close as much of the board as possible and get rid of my Q here.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: AARV I3 VARA +14 88
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEELOO K3 OLEO +12 117
>Emanuel_Chicoine: EIR 12D REI +17 105
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILOR 5C LEARIE. +14 131
#note I absolutely hated playing short here. My leave is really bad for a fishing-type play and I need to go for turnover after a play like REI. He still has his S and a bingo, which is very likely, will play down column M. In that sense I am shooting in the dark by playing off OE. Unless I go at 13C. Maybe I should play M9 ORE. I felt that leaving O was positive here, and that keeping AEILR was going to lead me nowhere.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: IINSZ D4 S.IZIN +32 137
>Joshua_Sokol: BBDIORR 4H B.I.OR +29 160
>Emanuel_Chicoine: EEE -EEE +0 137
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDEMOR M10 REDO +37 197
#note So given that Emanuel very likely has another S and no blank (because of his muttering and playstyle), how do I modify my next move to better exploit that factor? I felt like starting to run away with the game was a good idea, so I opted to score a bunch. But is that even possible at this point? The pool is very points and consonant-heavy, and there are still two blanks unseen. So it seemed that I could just keep scoring well after my play. I didn't deem it worth the points sacrifice to keep a much better leave ADER, and play I13 MOB. Emanuel may have the Y and would be able to score a bunch with FOXY. I don't think that's a noticeable factor though. It was also in my opinion nice to cut his bingoing chances down a bit and hope that any bingo he may have will give me nice places to score, since I'm taking out column M as a lane. 
>Emanuel_Chicoine: EEEILNS F1 SELE.INE +62 199
>Emanuel_Chicoine: EEEILNS --  -62 137
#note after spending many minutes with this rack and muttering things like "ugh, how do I win this game", Emanuel played this. I had never seen it, so it was an easy enough challenge for me given those other determining factors. Probably confused between PELERINE and SELENITE.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDMMNP I13 BAP +26 223
#note I couldn't really see any other options than MAP, BAM or BAP at I13 this time around. Perhaps there is something to be said about M3 B(R)AND though, as it gives Emanuel a lot more to think about if he intends to win the game. It also sheds more consonants. But perhaps either way, given Emanuel's already apparent time trouble, he will just make the simple play. If I play BRAND, that play is 13I LEE, and if I play BAP, BAM or MAP, that play is NEE(P)/NEE(M). Each of BAP and BAM and MAP keep G10 M(I)ND to block the lane opened by NEEM or NEEP, so those look like the best options. It was very hard to determine which leave was better between MMND and BMND or DMMN, so I opted to keep MM for scoring with MM in some scenarios, and also just for N13 MM if I needed to play that next turn.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: EEEILNS 15F NEE. +18 155
>Joshua_Sokol: CDMMNST G10 M.ND +19 242
#note In great shape despite not drawing a vowel.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: ?EEILST N1 TEnSILE +75 230
#note "Let's go for the most volatile option" 
>Joshua_Sokol: CDFMSTT -CDFMTT +0 242
#note And as we see that I was a 24/25-game favorite last turn with the partial rack inference of EIST, I am now not really a favorite at all, if it wasn't for Emanuel being in time trouble. I waffled between keeping the M and the S or just the S, and despite the M being a great tile to keep here, I decided that the extra throw-in was worth going for some vowels, the other S, and maybe the blank. But maybe an extra tile isn't enough to withhold the benefits of keeping the M.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: KUU F3 KU.U +10 240
#note whew
>Joshua_Sokol: GGHNSUV O7 HUNG +29 271
#note oh boy, I had intense tunnel vision here! 10B VUGG is a much much better play than this!
>Emanuel_Chicoine: CO 7B CO. +15 255
#note running out of time
>Joshua_Sokol: GIMNSTV 2M V.G +7 278
#note This seems like the right play given Emanuel's time trouble. Make it very hard for him to be confident in a play. Leaving the T open is asking for a one-play sweep.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: DRY N13 DRY +21 276
#note although this seems like a very easy play to make in time trouble. Too bad.
>Joshua_Sokol: IMNSTTT 10B MIST +28 306
#note TT really really hurt here. But I had to play fast. Hope I can get a winning draw or make him go over. NITS is probably better though, to set up another spot to score
>Emanuel_Chicoine: ?ACEFHW 15K WHE.s +51 327
#note O12 WHeE for 66! This is -15.
>Joshua_Sokol: ANTT 3M A. +14 320
#note if I play fast here I can put him over and/or get him stuck with the C. But there was nothing to play. Unless I wanted to put my T at 14H and hope he didn't notice... I just gave up. I misscored this as 16, I lost a silly point... I was hoping that he would play FA/FEH and get C stuck but I don't even win if that happens.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: ACF 14H F.. +18 345
>Joshua_Sokol: NTT 8C N.T +5 325
>Emanuel_Chicoine: AC B10 .AC +7 352
#note 9M CA(N). This was an ugly ugly game, but I made some self-destructive misplays here and there and that ultimately cost me.
>Emanuel_Chicoine:  (T) +2 354
