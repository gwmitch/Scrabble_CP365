#note nice play!
>JD: AILNRTW F9 AW +27 439
#note there were enough spots to bingo that it seemed that I should focus on trying to outrun. on the other hand, AW at D4 cuts his bingo percentage from 40% to 20%, so there's clearly a lot of merit to blocking!
>Guzman_de_Guzman_de_Guzman: ?ADEFIR C8 RAmIF.ED +62 438
#note in this scenario, if I had played AW at D4 Ed would've won!! so taking the 27 points for my placement of AW clearly also has some merit. I'm not sure what play he can make here that can win, because bingoing now means that I can outrun him. however, no fishes are sufficiently threatening that I can find.
