>Roy_Kamen: COY 8G COY +16 16
>JD: ADEEMOO 9I OEDEMA +19 19
#note a really bad play - I saw my two best options of MOOED at 7I and just MOO. MOOED in particular sims really well because it restricts roy's comebacks - only 38 average versus 49 average after OEDEMA. MOO is a bit better on defense, but not enough to beat out the points of MOOED.

>JD: EFHLORT 10J FOH +38 57
>Roy_Kamen: ABR N6 BA..R +24 84
>JD: EEHLNRT 11G RENTE +24 81
#note another big mistake. EEHNRT has unusual synergy, and having the C to play through makes it even better. quackle suggests DOL at K9, which leads to me bingoing 52% of the time next turn versus 9% after RENTE!!

>JD: ?AAHLLL 13B HALLALs +83 179
#note another phony, but this one is extremely difficult for roy to respond to since it seems plausible
>Roy_Kamen: INOV M3 VINO +19 120
>JD: CDEINNO 3H CONNI.ED +65 244
#note lucky me
>Roy_Kamen: RVY F12 V.RY +12 132
>JD: EEGLPSW 15E W.LE +30 274
#note with a big lead in hand I chickened out of SWEEPY, since there was no need to risk it.
>Roy_Kamen: DKO H1 DO.K +48 180
>JD: EEFGGPS 14A PEG +25 299
#note with 3 esses unseen it's probably time to cover the DOCKS spot now before he double-doubles for 100 points (hypothetically).

>Roy_Kamen: GI O1 GI. +15 212
>JD: ?EFIRST 1A ReSIFTE. +86 405
#note pretty bad miss - chickened out of FRISKET, then failed to find FIBSTER or PRESIFT even though I basically played the latter word
>Roy_Kamen: EIMORST 5E MOISTER +98 310
>JD: BEESTUU O12 .UTU +12 417
>Roy_Kamen: AEX 6I AXE +55 365
#note he had a better spot at the bottom-left
>JD: ABEEISU 4C EAU +10 427
#note Q wants me to just play PE or PI to take out his best scoring plays.
>Roy_Kamen: AADINTU 15A ANA +31 396
#note best is evidently NADA at 3A leaving TUI/DOEST on row 13
>JD: BEIIS B4 BISE +14 441
#note best is SEI at 2D. this gives him an out.
>Roy_Kamen: DITU A7 DUIT +18 414
#note oops, bad endgame
