>JD: EEJKNSX 11C KEXES +47 344
#note he blocked KEX for a lot of points, but this flips over a lot of tiles
>Saint: ORW 10D WOR. +28 392
#note lucky he doesn't have a stronger response - a play down from D8 and I have a hard time scoring much
>JD: ?ADEIJN 12A JEAN +56 400
#note a sim may not be helpful here, because his last play says a lot about his rack - likely very heavy on consonants, so I should expect vowels, and he may not have a rack that can play from the J after JEAN as a result. I also like that JEAN plays an extra vowel off. sim is close between that, JAWED and KANJI. quackle likes KANJI because I supposedly bingo 80% of the time, but against a blocking opponent I doubt that's true
>Saint: MNORTTV 13A ORT +31 423
#note I believe this was saint's actual rack. quackle thinks he wins 2/8 by playing EVE/VET/IT, in which case he wins by drawing the blank or the E (threating MONTERO to go out).

#note my only win of the day, and it seems as though I easily could've lost!
