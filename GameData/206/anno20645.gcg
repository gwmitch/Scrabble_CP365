>JD: AABDHNS 8G BAH +16 16
#note I saw BANDA, preferred BAH. BANDA wins a sim by 3 points since SH doesn't sim that much worse than ADNS next turn.

#note it's an oboe world
>Roy_Kamen: DEIJV 13I JIVE. +24 104
#note interesting that he didn't want to play at L3 - was he scared of JO?
>JD: ADEKNOW 10F W.KA +27 141
#note awoke would've been nice
>Roy_Kamen: DEELOSS -DEE +0 104
>JD: DEFHNOW L10 F.N.D +27 168
#note oh! I 100% whiffed on H(OBOES)! HOWF at 6G is definitely best if I see it. quackle likes playing WHO at 9I this turn because DEFN bingos much more often than EHOW next turn. this play is not very good because the H and W don't really go anywhere.
>Roy_Kamen: AAELSST F1 ATLASES +63 167
#note he has ELASTASE!
>JD: EHIIOOW 1E W.HOO +33 201
#note no question of playing WOOLIE. I'm in some trouble after ELASTASE at O1 which would also block WOOLIE.
>Roy_Kamen: GNOPSY 2I SPONGY +38 205
>JD: AEIINRT O6 IN.RTIAE +59 260
#note very fortunate draw, although he blocked my best spots
>Roy_Kamen: EIIX L2 .IXIE +26 231
>JD: ?ACEIRZ 4B ARCh.IZE +106 366
#note freak draw
>Roy_Kamen: MM 1N MM +25 256
>JD: EFRTTUV J5 TUFT +18 384
#note ARCHAIZER doesn't look 100% foreign, but I certainly didn't spot it over the board. all of my best plays involve finding that hook. I can cut his bingo percentage to basically 0 by playing TURF at C2, but the pool is rather poor so I don't mind getting rid of some clunkers.
>Roy_Kamen: EQRU B2 QU.RE +32 288
>JD: ELORRUV A6 OVULE +26 410
#note OVULE has the dual benefit of scoring well and also not really giving back any bingo lanes.
>Roy_Kamen: GU I13 .UG +11 299
>JD: EGNRRTY B10 TERRY +24 434
#note nice sequence by roy, although he won't catch me. roy will score a ton of points if I don't block the G, so best play is actually RUT at 14H - but then if I mistracked, an out-bingo on column B would cose me the game.
>Roy_Kamen: CDEIILN 15D CEDIN. +39 338
>JD: GNR 11B .NG +4 438
#note out of time!
>Roy_Kamen: IL C1 LI +13 351
#note given my excellent draw, Roy did a nice job of carving back some spread.
>Roy_Kamen:  (R) +2 353
