>Matthew_Larocque: GINORUY I8 .UY +8 8
#note Akward position. I considered JURYING to clear my rack, but I wasn't even sure if it was a word. Decided on GUY to get rid of the UY combo and limit what he is able to play next turn. A long simulation agrees.
>Chris_Williams: AEGM H10 MAGE +16 38
#note After the game he said he regretted not playing (I)MAGE.
>Matthew_Larocque: GIINORZ 13G Z.ROING +56 64
#note Lucky for me, he played MAGE.
>Chris_Williams: DE 10F DE.. +14 52
#note He also said something about playing EMYD instead, I guess to be more open.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEIILR 14A DELIRIa +78 142
#note A strong start, too bad it won't last.
>Chris_Williams: ?CDEHRT D8 TRaCHE.D +82 134
#note Good play, this is the highest scoring bingo.
>Matthew_Larocque: ANNRTWX 8A WAN. +21 163
#note Few options here, just have to hold my breath for vowels. WANTER or WANNER B10 might be safer and knocks out the A12 hotspot that is easy to use.
>Chris_Williams: UUVV -UUVV +0 134
>Matthew_Larocque: ELNRSTX 14I EX +52 215
#note It's rare that sacrificing so many points on a non-blank rack would be a viable alternative, but I guess  L(O)X for 26 should bingo a heck of a lot next turn.
>Chris_Williams: AEF A12 FA.E +36 170
>Matthew_Larocque: LNRSTUU B6 LU.U +6 221
#note On the other hand, drawing UU makes it hard to bingo with any rack. Sim prefers keeping one of the Us.
>Chris_Williams: IOPTV 15G PIVOT +59 229
#note Awesome play by Chris.
>Matthew_Larocque: BKNRRST -BKNR +0 221
#note Yeah, now I really wish I had a U. Also, should I exchange 5 or 6? I mean, there's still a lot of vowels left.
>Chris_Williams: HLO 11D .HOL. +25 254
>Matthew_Larocque: MQRSTTW -MQTW +0 221
#note I manage to dodge all the vowels yet again! Pretty frustrating. Tempting to chuck everything but the S, but keeping RST should net a bingo if some freaking vowels show up.
>Chris_Williams: EIOU 6B .OUIE +7 261
>Matthew_Larocque: BINNRST E5 N.B +10 231
#note Lol, I still pick up 3 more consonants! That's hilarious.
>Chris_Williams: ACEMR L8 CARME. +26 287
>Matthew_Larocque: INQRSTW 4C QIS +30 261
#note Have to take the points, except I can play this for 44. But I didn't bother to see that.... because I already felt like I lost the game.
>Chris_Williams: OOSTY J4 TOYOS +28 315
>Matthew_Larocque: FKNPRTW 5I W.RK +22 283
#note So, I drew one vowel in 5 turns, from a bag that had more than enough vowels. I don't know why I didn't play WONK/KNOW instead. 
>Chris_Williams: AEL K9 LEA +18 333
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFNOPT M9 PAT +24 307
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFNOPT --  -24 283
#note I think I meant to play TAP/AMP instead but my mind was going crazy. Seemed like it would be easier for him to shut down a play from the C like COFT/CAFE.
>Chris_Williams: AEINSST M1 ENTASIS +78 411
#note Looks like I was screwed though anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFNOPT N6 FOP +31 314
>Chris_Williams: ADEINRV 1F REINVAD. +92 503
#note CRUSHED


>Matthew_Larocque: ABENOTT O7 BATON +38 352
#note BATTEN is the 6 here scoring 44, but I wasn't sure enough.
>Chris_Williams: A E11 .A +10 513
>Chris_Williams:  (ET) +4 517
#note I look back and think maybe I didn't exchange enough letters, but honestly at the time it seemed like it was fine. I don't know.
