#note I considered 11I SEZ for 58 (!), but I was still shaky on my new 3s, and it also actually might not be the right play! If I use all of my cards this turn to pull ahead a bingo, I am giving up a very significant amount of control on this board. Against Jason, that's is a really bad thing! I knew that some of the time, I would draw into a 72-point play at 15L next turn if I played YEN for 26 or Y(O)N for 19. YON seemed worse than YEN firsly since the E isn't actually that good here. It's good to save some draws I could get, but it cuts my chances of getting an A or an I for ZIGS ZAGS. Otherwise I still have SEZ next turn, but I had convinced myself not to play that earlier. I could also draw an L a very small amount of the time for LEZ. In the end I preferred more points, I can always dump a few things next turn if I need to with Z(I)N of (BI)Z. But if I'm confident of SEZ, Y(O)N looks better, although that also gives up a bit of board control.

#note So this is hearsay of Jason's thought process. He thought TERMARY* was valid and that it pluralized. He saw other bingos such as METRIT(I)S, but didn't see AMORTI(Z)E(D) or MOTORI(Z)ED. He also didn't see the star play, F8 (A)nIMaTER. I don't know if he considered MITE or EMIT under QI, which seem to stand out as the nonbingo options. Maybe TRIM works too. In any case, good job stealing the game from me, Jason! Especially since I didn't yet know that he didn't study that far into the new words before the game...
>Joshua_Sokol: AACHMPR D2 PAH +36 385
#note And my thought process was "what the *** is this?". Actually no, it was more along the lines of "well this is very interesting, a definite do-or-die moment. What plays do I see that look good?" I saw CHAP(T), but really wasn't that sure of it. I missed AMAH for 43, and simply saw PAH for 36. It looked like I had a decent chance of winning, more than 50% of the time, since that was the decision to make. Am I a favorite to win without challenging? If not, I challenge. I don't know why I convinced myself I was a favorite. I don't think I was now that I think about it. Too many ways for Jason to score very well, and not enough for me. I think my play is CHAP(T) for sure, and that I'm a favorite after that. I don't think I'm a favorite after AMAH either. I think I forgot there was an A left before I pulled the trigger. I need the X :(

#note too much
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEENRT 11K NE +21 406
#note I had mistracked, of course. I thought he had a P instead of the L. So I hoped he had mistracked or would cave under pressure, since XIS for 43 would give me too many points out and PIX would give me CAR(P)ET, also for too many. But this was a difficult endgame! By chance, mostly, I made one of the best plays. T(APE) for 12 is even cooler! It sets up RECANE/E(TAPE) and if he does make the play he made, he will give me MENACER. I missed MUX, and of course he'll just play MIX if MUX isn't a thing. Damn...
