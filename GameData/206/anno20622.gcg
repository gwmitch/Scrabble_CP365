#note Sitting next to me was Joel Wapnick, 2-0, with big spread, playing Michael. It seemed quite likely he was going to win. I had already lost one, so I needed to go for the most spread to be able to play him and have the best shot at winning next game!
>Jason_Li: AGJNO 14F JA.GON +32 32
>Joshua_Sokol: EHNRSTW G13 H.W +22 96
#note blocked a huge play! Too bad I missed G12 HW(A)N here...
>Jason_Li: FTU 11E TUF. +20 52
>Joshua_Sokol: AENPRST L8 PARENTS +89 185
#note Maybe that was an X setup. But it might not have been, so better not to sacrifice 19 points to play TRAPNES(T) or TRANSEP(T).
>Jason_Li: EIK 8L .IKE +30 82
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEGIL 9D GELA.A +10 195
#note Jason can always tell when I could have done better. He didn't like this play. Neither did I. I missed N5 LEA(K)AGE. I can't control this board anyway and this only blocks 7s that don't end in S.
>Jason_Li: EEE -EEE +0 82
>Joshua_Sokol: BEINRRT M7 R.B +16 211
>Jason_Li: ??AEGHT O1 HEloTAG. +80 162
#note I'm not sure Jason knew GASHEST, but that plays at K3 for 83. I might challenge, but otherwise, I think playing at O1 is strategically sound here. Jason isn't so desperate that he needs to hope for a play there next turn or anything.

>Jason_Li: DOS 15E DO.S +69 231
>Joshua_Sokol: AELOQVX 5E VEX +35 313
#note I kind of just blanked out here. I knew how devastating VEX would be for Jason most of the time, so I played it. VOX would also be just as devastating, and would add many points of equity to my future plays...

>Joshua_Sokol: IILLOTU 3I .UOIT +28 366
#note A10 LI(M)ULI is the play here. I did not see it nor know it for sure! It may have even garnered a challenge. I felt like I needed the cushion of two consonants here instead of two vowels and a consonant, but two L's is really bad. I should probably play QUILT instead. But LIMULI, yeah.
>Jason_Li: ACR F2 CAR. +12 287
>Joshua_Sokol: CILLNOO 13B NOLO +23 389
#note Word security is great. I wasn't 100% on COLIC, I'll admit. That would have been a good play to make as well. I almost played CONIC due to the uncertainty, but that would set up an unblockable I(CONIC)! I did not even see that possibility... A12 (M)OLL is a good play here. Retains a very good leave for the pool, scores and blocks most of that area very nicely, etc. I decided here to just take the points and run, but retain the C if I needed to block something. Overscored by 2.
>Jason_Li: AALV 8A LAVA +28 315
#note but letting this happen was bad. I should have played COLIC...
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIILNP 2A CLINI. +20 409
#note whoops! PICNI(C) is better.
>Jason_Li: ESZ B10 ZE..S +68 383
>Joshua_Sokol: EENOPST K2 T.NE. +10 419
#note botched endgame number 60421. I was trying to be cute?
>Jason_Li: BDIRY C1 B.RDY +22 405
#note A1 I(C)Y should have been obvious to me. Instead Jason wanted to get under my skin. I was 99% sure this was phony...
>Joshua_Sokol: EOPS A1 S.OPE +36 455
>Joshua_Sokol:  (I) +2 457
#note a few mistakes here and there. Not all that impressed by my play here.
