#note I'm opening up another lane because he can't block them both.  I was also hoping he didn't have the last A (unlikely but I can dream) for RAINWASH.  I could outrun him without bingoing with that play.

#note As he laid his tiles down, Paul said something that sounded suspiciously like "Let me shut the board down once and for all."  And I'm thinking, "But you're not shutting the board down,  you're giving me a lane...." (He also played D1 AI at first.)  But then after the game he said he was tired of playing on a closed board so he OPENED it up so maybe I heard him wrong.  Either way, he was kicking himself afterwards.

#note I saw REWASH, but felt like that was the type of word someone would challenge "because it's an outplay" and I just wasn't in the mood.
