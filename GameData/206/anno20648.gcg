#note oh I'm no longer winning!
>JD: DIILNNO C1 LOIN +14 239
#note probably should've just played NIB, I didn't like the ability of DILNO to turn into a bingo, but it's 33% versus 26% after LOIN. I also figured that the volatility of row 1 could also help. but, NIB's the play.

>Guzman_de_Guzman: ?FSUUU 1A gU.F +30 427
#note wow - gutsy move by ed!! I believe he already had UUUS? on his rack, and figured he could use the S to score.
>JD: EEEILPT 14J TEPEE +30 425
#note his rack strongly telegraphs the rest of his tiles - he probably has both Us, and maybe also the S. that being the case, how can I try to steal a win? I was hoping after TEPEE that I could draw an out. an alternative strategy is to play HADE at M3, which looks like a hopeless fish but actually yields INTERLOPE at L7 if I draw the N! I'm ok with TEPEE and hoping that his clunky UU rack prevents an out-in-two.
>Guzman_de_Guzman: INORSUU M7 RUINS +17 444
#note ed misses his bingos but then finds the brilliant block of AEDILE and IDEAL!!
