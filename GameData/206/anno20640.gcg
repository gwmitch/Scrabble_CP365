>Harriette_Lakernick: CEINSTT -T +0 0
#note First Seven Bingo Game! Between the two of us, not just me. Harriet's correct play is to exchange a T. This was the best play and this is her actual rack.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEILRRV 8B REVILER +78 78
#note Best Play! And only bingo!
>Harriette_Lakernick: CEIINST B2 INCITE.S +74 74
#note Best Play! B7 C(R)INITES and C2 NICETI(E)S also work for Harriette for 74 points.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDFIPRY G7 P.RFIDY +24 102
#note 5th best play. I think this is better than 9E DIF and 7A D(E)F but Quackle disagrees. The rockstar play is E5 PYRIDIC for 60 points. I knew this one, but this was hard to see.
>Harriette_Lakernick: BEEEHI D3 BEEHI.E +30 104
#note This is a cool play. BEEHIVED is also good in TWL 15.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACDEILT A9 EDICTAL +91 193
#note I thought I had the best play but 11D CIL(I)ATED for 94 points is 3 points better than mine. I knew CILIATED like PYRIDIC. Two double doubles missed. No problem though...
>Harriette_Lakernick: AAGINNP -AAG +0 104
#note Hariette challenged EDICTAL. And she lost. EDICTAL, CITADEL, DELTAIC, and DIALECT are the sevens in this rack. Surprised this was challenged.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENOQUY 13A .OQUE +28 221
#note 4th best play. Quackle's favorites are B14 YO and B13 OY each for 22 points with a valuation of 32.8. 11E QU(I)NOA is also good for 30 points, but why would I risk an S hook that could get her back into the game? Silly Quackle. Upon further review, I still like my play.
>Harriette_Lakernick: KO 3A K.O. +20 124
>Jonathan_Lindh: ANOOSWY H13 OWN +23 244
#note 10th best play! Tim pointed out A1 WOK, YOK and YAK all of which score 32 points and are the best plays. WOK sims best with a valuation of 36.5, others a little lower. Tim also pointed out the 4th best play I8 SWOONY for 31 points which blocks a bunch of bingo lanes but uses an S. I was just trying to balance my rack and keep an S. Watch what happens next.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AGM I11 GAM +20 144
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENORSY 15G A.NOYERS +62 306
#note Best play! My slightly subpar play of OWN results in a bingo. This was the only bingo playable. I chose G15 instead of F15 in case Harriette had a comeback bingo through the S. I then could cash in on the triple word score more easily.
>Harriette_Lakernick: OTT N12 TOT. +8 152
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?IIRSUX E5 XI +41 347
#note Second best play! Quackle likes 14a (A)XIS for 53 points slightly more by a valuation of 76.5 to 74, but I prefer my play over Quackle. Keeping the S and the blank together maximizes my chances of a bingo.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?ELORTW I2 TROWELs +71 223
#note Harriette got the seventh best play and the worst bingo. H1 TROWeLE(R) is good for 96 points and is the bets play. I might have challenged that one too. Two placements of 10G (F)LOWERET and M8 TROWELE(R) also score 80 and 79 points respectively. FLOWERET I knew cold at least.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?IMORSU O7 MOUSIeR +77 424
#note Best Play, but Quackle doesn't use TWL 15 so it thinks TE is phony. Took me a little bit to see for some reason. L8 MOIStUR(E), 4F tIM(O)ROUS, and L8 MISROUtE for 74 points are the TWL 06 only best plays. 4F IMp(O)ROUS, 3H U(R)SIfORM, and 2F MISTUtOR for 68, 68, and 67 points respectively round out the bingos. Also the unplayable seven TOURISM.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AAFH M10 HAAF +34 257
#note Robert HAAF Accounting placement services. No it's Robert HALF. This is still a cool 4 letter word though.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEGUVZ N4 GAZE +38 462
#note 10th best play. 4H Z(O)UAVE for 56 points clears off all of the junk and blocks Harriette's upcoming bingo. My GAZE for 38 points sets up a dumpoff of VAU and AGAZE for 27 points and blocks one of the bingo lanes but not all I'm afraid...
>Harriette_Lakernick: AAGINST L5 AGAINST +66 323
#note ZOUAVE would have prevented this.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADNNUUV 3M VAU +27 489
#note 2nd best play. Quackle likes E8 INVADE for 22 points over mine by 6.2 to 6. I don't know why. I like my play better.
>Harriette_Lakernick: BDEJLOP K3 JOB +32 355
#note Harriette blundered here. 14J JOB for 62 points was the best play and very obvious. It would have gotten her to 400 points. She played the 6th best play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DNNU E10 NUD. +10 499
#note Best play! UNDE, NUDE, and DUNE all on E10 all score 10 points and are the best plays. NUDING* is not good. I saw it, but I'm not phonying on an outplay and I'm getting my 500 point game.
>Harriette_Lakernick: DELP A5 PED +15 370
#note Best play for Hariette. A1 El(K) scores 23 points but leaves DP instead of L. Come to think of it, these plays result in the same spread. Why aren't these two plays ranked equally on valuation?
>Jonathan_Lindh: N B13 .N +8 507
#note 2nd best play! 7A (DE)N(I) for one point.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (L) +2 509
#note 509-370! Second at Chicago club to my 525 game against Tom K with DELLIES for 105 points. This game wasn't perfect but a very good game on both sides. Seven bingos total!
