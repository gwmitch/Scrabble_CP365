#note 3rd best play! 9C or 7C CONY score 24 points and have higher valuation by 17.8-16.7.

#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?EGINSY 13F EYeINGS +68 235
#note I'm supposed to be the grandmaster of ING plus S words but I let this one go. 15A (D)YSGENIc is best for 92 points. 13D ISoGENY, 13F ESpYING, and 2F GlEYINGS for 74, 68, and 64 points respectively are the valid bingos. GLEYINGS in my defense I knew was good. Letting EYEINGS* go is dumbness.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEINSST 14F BENT +32 362
#note 10th best play. And overscored by 5 points. Should be 32 and not 37.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: HT H12 H..T +30 265
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIOSSU C9 I.O.E +12 374

#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?DEIILR 14L IDLE +12 294
#note Tim missed two out bingos here. 2H pERIDIAL is the easiest to see for 60 points but there is also the split 9 2F (G)RInDELI(A) for 64 points. This play is bad.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AABEESW 15L BAAS +46 469
#note Best play but Quackle doesn't recognize DA.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?IR O1 ReI +11 305
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr:  (EEW) +12 317
#note Final score recorded as 477-306. Correct score is 469-307 with 10 points off Tim's score for going over by less than a minute. Good game, but could have had a third bingo had I done KIEF instead of KEF.
