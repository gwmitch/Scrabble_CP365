>Matthew_Larocque: EGHQRTV 8G VEG +14 14
#note Yuck, but I figured I would at least make it hard on him if I have to exchange.
>Dean_Saldanha: ?AGIMNN H1 NoNIMAG. +83 83
#note He took his time, and found the only word that reaches the TWS. Well done.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGHQRTW 6F WR.TH +27 41
#note Maybe QI won't get blocked.
>Dean_Saldanha: CENW J2 WENC. +21 104
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINOOQ 4G Q. +11 52
#note Exchange QOO? I noticed the 18 point E(G)O, but the Q has to go one way or the other. GONIO(N) sets up the Q, but I don't see that as a wise gamble.
>Dean_Saldanha: AUX 3J .AUX +22 126
#note He would have bombed me for 52 and I'd still have the Q.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINOOP 4L PION +31 83
#note Points - but E(G)O sneakily creates an S hook that is hard to deal with. I don't have an S though, so that makes it less good. However (C)OOP for 16 takes the sim, EGIN must be pretty good.
>Dean_Saldanha: MOU O1 MUO. +18 144
>Matthew_Larocque: EGLO 7C OGLE +11 94
#note Missed this rack, pretty sure I wasn't able to score any points so I just tried to open up a little.
>Dean_Saldanha: KU 5H .U.K +26 170
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEEHP 8A PEH +29 123
#note Well that sucks - I saw the only bingo but I chickened out on it. I did that a lot in these tournaments. I need to be more bold sometimes.
>Dean_Saldanha: AEILNNR A6 NI. +5 175
#note He told me his rack after the game. I didn't know what to make of his play at the time. I did a long simulation, 5300. It suggests a bunch of plays that simply fish off an N. It claims that N(OH) wins 82% of the time compared to 74% for NI(P) and valuates nearly 20 points higher. Pretty extreme difference. If I were in his position though, I think blocking the P in some fashion probably makes sense since that's where I'd score the most if I played a bingo. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADELOT 1A DELATiO. +77 200
#note I would have originally played PETALOID, but this still has the benefit of getting me back in the game and not giving him tons of letters to play through.
>Dean_Saldanha: AEILNRR I8 .NARLIER +61 236
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEERZ 14F BRE.ZED +45 245
#note Forgot my last letter, but it wasn't another E. I wish it had been.
>Dean_Saldanha: AAILOS 11E SOLA.IA +28 264
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEIIOV 10D VIBE +29 274
#note I very nearly played OBIA 15L but realized the J was out, so I wanted to kill any chance of RAJ or TAJ. Sim only estimates that I win this game ~30% of the time.
>Dean_Saldanha: ACE L12 CA.E +16 280
#note Surprised, I expected him to score more points.
>Matthew_Larocque: AIJOOT 13C JOTA +26 300
#note Missing the last letter again. I missed playing this at 5C as well as JIAO. This may have worked out for the better, but can't say for sure.
>Dean_Saldanha: DOY 2D YOD +24 304
>Matthew_Larocque: DIIORST 15A IDIOTS +29 329
#note I must have had 4 or 5 minutes left, and I used almost all of it deciding if I should play IDIOTS and empty the bag, or find another play that doesn't. I saw the chance of him having (O)UTRAISE, there might be other bingos too but I didn't check. Eventually I went for IDIOTS and hoped he couldn't score enough points with whatever was on his rack.
>Dean_Saldanha: AEISSTU 15I .AS. +17 321
#note This leaves him with SUITE to go out, if for whatever reason I don't score enough points. 
>Matthew_Larocque: EFFRRTY 3C FEY +30 359
#note I had planned to play F(E)RRY, but it was blocked, so I went for plan B. I missed (TO)FFY, and I probably would have rejected FRYER out of confusion (*CRYER and *TRYER are the phonies). I'd probably have rejected Y(A)FF too without the 100% certainty. I had like 30 seconds here so yeah....
>Dean_Saldanha: EISTU 6A .U +4 325
#note Dean was pretty low on time, he said he was just trying to dump the U. With my rack of FRRT, I can go out in two. But since I'm also almost out of time, it might take me 3 turns to go out. I think he should just go for points. I actually replayed the game where he just ignores the U - it definitely would have worked out better for him, assuming I still make the same plays.
>Matthew_Larocque: FRRT B8 .FT +8 367
#note I stupidly play (E)FT instead of (A)FT, blocking (E)RR next turn. Or I could just play F(A)RT. There's like 7 plays better than (E)FT. 
>Dean_Saldanha: EIST H13 T.E +26 351
>Matthew_Larocque: RR B1 .R +4 371
#note ERASER
>Dean_Saldanha: IS D1 ...S +14 365
#note Nothing actually wins for him, but I'm about to go over time since I have like 2 seconds left. So he has to score enough points with just his S, and then hope I go overtime and lose. 
>Matthew_Larocque: R 13L .R +4 375
#note I'm unable to play this in time, and go over by one second.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (I) +2 377
#note After we regain our composure and do a recount, I win by 2. Turns out that if he had saw (MUCK)S he would have won by 2 instead. It's a tough endgame when your best play is the highest scoring play that doesn't end the game, and you yourself don't have any time left. This was certainly a memorable game.
