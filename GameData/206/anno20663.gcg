>Andrew_Fisher: AEGHIIS 8H AHI +12 12
#note Never really sure whether to grab points or keep it tight in this sort of position. Similar was my opening AEJRSTT against Alex Tan - JEATS or TAJ? Here GHI actually outperforms both GEISHA and AHI.
>Peter: ?ILLOST 7D TrILLOS +68 68
>Andrew_Fisher: EGIINOS 8A INGO +21 33
#note Failing to realise that I had been phonied (damn), this was another marginal call between fishing one or two tiles, or what I actually played. Very little in it.
>Peter: NZ F6 Z.N +32 100
>Andrew_Fisher: CEEEEIS 9D CEE +23 56
>Peter: ADD 5E DAD +24 124
>Andrew_Fisher: EEEFIIS 4C FIE +15 71
#note Hmm, FENI or FINE in column B, a change, or FIE? I suspect Peter is still consonant-heavy and I also like leaving a floating N here.
>Peter: HM 9H HM +27 151
>Andrew_Fisher: AEEIQSS B6 QI. +32 103
#note So maybe I should also have preserved the N here (QI 3B) - again very close
>Peter: AGOORTU -AGOO +0 151
>Andrew_Fisher: ADEEESS H1 AEDES +27 130
#note Quackle likes EASED 3C (I suppose it does score 5 more)
>Peter: ?DEKRST 2B STREaK.D +74 225
>Andrew_Fisher: ABENNOS 10B EBONS +36 166
#note With nowhere for NANOBES, it seems worthwhile to burn the last S (my comeback chances are minimal anyway). Quackle proposes the ineffective BON 10C
>Peter: EOOPV 6J POOVE +29 254
>Andrew_Fisher: AAEGNTV 1A VAE +22 188
>Peter: BILOPTY -BILOPT +0 254
>Andrew_Fisher: AGNRRTY L1 GYRAT.R +26 214
#note GRAVY is probably the equity play (actually, the amazing ATRAZINES outsims it), but I had a little plan up my sleeve to engineer a 50+ score later
>Peter: ENO 3F NO.E +19 273
>Andrew_Fisher: BFINOTT 1L .IFT +24 238
>Peter: ELT 2K L.TE +26 299
>Andrew_Fisher: BCNOTUW C10 .UNCO +18 256
#note Need another opening...
>Peter: JO B14 JO +36 335
>Andrew_Fisher: AABITWX 3L .AW +27 283
>Peter: EIIRW 12A WI.IER +26 361
>Andrew_Fisher: ABITUXY F12 .AX +26 309
#note So I have my Y, but no 4LW yet. An alternative to the tempting RAX is BI/JOB, perhaps aiming for YUNX
>Peter: MNU G13 MUN +24 385
>Andrew_Fisher: ABGITUY 8L YAGI +55 364
#note I suppose the problem with RAX was the scoring possibilities offered back to Peter. So I get my points but it's all too late
>Peter: ALPRRU H11 URP +13 398
>Andrew_Fisher: BTU 9M BUT +20 384
#note Peter could have blocked this if he'd felt like it, so just an 8-point margin in the end
>Andrew_Fisher:  (ALR) +6 390
