#note Wow, I REALLY wish I'd had seen GONOF.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?CDENSY E5 SEC.NDlY +102 126
#note Juraj, you challenged ABODED with 102 points ready to go? That's something I would do, man! And you don't want to do the things I do in Scrabble.
>Matthew_Larocque: EHLNOTV D1 VOLTE +26 84
#note Hemmed and hawed for a bit, then decided to get the board wide open. Plus I didn't want the V.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AILO 1D .OILA +24 150
>Matthew_Larocque: AGHINRT 12A HAIR. +30 114
#note I saw the bingo after I hit the clock. And then I was sad. RATING is a good rack to fish with too. It bingos with like 52/66 unseen letters... damn. I usually don't argue with 30 points, but now it just looks like a really bad play.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IMRT A8 MIRT. +30 180
>Matthew_Larocque: GGNNOTU 10H TONG +14 128
#note I don't even know..... what to do with this. Things got really HAIRY, obviously. I don't even want to analyze this because it should have never happened in the first place.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?AEORSZ 2H bEZOARS +121 301
#note It sounds funny when I pronounce it BE-ZORES in my head.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGHINVX A8 .....ING +42 170
#note HA! This is completely not a word. How does that make you feel, Juraj?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEEW 3J AWEE +36 337
>Matthew_Larocque: AHKUVX L9 HAKU +28 198
#note Juraj, you shouldn't have held this. You're the person who taught me HAKU in the first place! You shall not forget your fours. Or was it TONGA?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEOT 1L TOEA +24 361
>Matthew_Larocque: IIMRSVX M7 VIM +25 223
#note I wanted to fish for AXEL which would score 55 under ZA. Wait, I don't have an A or an E or an L. Fishing implies there's a chance greater than 0 that I'd get the intended draw. 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: FU 3C F.U +12 373
>Matthew_Larocque: AIJLRSX 6E .X +25 248
#note Hoping for JAILERS next turn.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIPR 4H RIPE +27 400
>Matthew_Larocque: AIJLRSY 13I JAYS +34 282
#note Not going to fish again, just want to cut the spread now.

>Juraj_Pivovarov: CEIPRST 10A .ES +18 478
>Matthew_Larocque: EILNNU 8M .N +2 321
#note Trying to get silly here, but it is probably better to play out in two.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CIPRT 11L .IP +9 487
>Matthew_Larocque: EILNU O6 LINE +21 342
#note The I plays for 7, so LUNE is better.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CRT I4 .C. +5 492
>Matthew_Larocque: U 14A .U +4 346
#note It's right there, right next to where I just played LINE. Matt. No need to scan the board for two less points.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (RT) +4 350
#note I was currently somewhere around third place, or maybe even second, I can't remember. I only needed to win maybe 2 more games out of the 7 remaining to break even and have a decent tournament. I didn't expect to go on such an awful streak after this. I just completely ran out of steam.
