#note radiomen is his best bingo

#note quite relieved that he did not block this!
>Gary_Smart: JW B8 J.W +21 85
#note sacrificing 4 points to not play JEW at M7 - I think that could be a worthwhile move to keep things maximally open

#note my phonying ways return (PURDY*). especially egregious since I can play PURVEY. intriguingly, keeping SUV sims not that much worse than SU, probably a function of the extremely vowel-heavy bag and lack of clunky tiles

#note good thing I got out to the lead I did, because 20 of my last 25 tiles have been consonants, and 3 of the vowels were Us. REVS looks wrong on a sim - quackle prefers CURRS which blocks more bingo lanes, or exchanging for a better chance at the blank. playing REVS also may be ill-advised since I have the last S, so if he bingoes with a blank I may leave myself a better chance of responding by not blocking NITERIES.

#note thank goodness he didn't come up with RAdICEs at N2 or I have no chance at this gamec

#note fortunate to have a response
>Gary_Smart: EEGINY N1 EYEING +50 377
#note this looks like a devastating move at first, but from my perspective, my anomalously consonant-heavy draw means he only has an L on his rack and 6 vowels. perhaps a play like GYRE at O12 gives him a better chance of winning?
>JD: EHLMTTX O11 THE.M +42 387
#note I was initially focused on playing MIXT, but EHLT doesn't leave me another play. I also saw HELMET at N10 but then realized to my horror that LAARI at O11 would still fit!!
>Gary_Smart: AAEIIIL 1M ..I +9 386
#note he should just go ahead and play AALII, or LIFE at 11B which scores the same.
>JD: LTX L13 T.X +18 405
#note huge error, I'm supposed to play JOWL first to keep him from playing LIFE and to cash my L now, since TAX plays in two spots.
>Gary_Smart: AAEIIL K10 ILIA. +18 404
#note best play that doesn't use JOWL
