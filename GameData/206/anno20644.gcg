#note non-intuitive play! I figured I would block the cheap spot and that the Z would easily score in future turns.
>Mark_Milan: EH B14 HE +25 97
>JD: AENORWZ 6F ZA. +33 219
#note thankfully I overcame the urge to try WARZONES#. it might be worth me blocking the S with GAZER even though the resulting leave is much worse
>Mark_Milan: ABQU M10 .QUAB +32 129
>JD: EENORSW 15H RENEWS +56 275
#note RENEWS>OWSEN because turns over 1 more tile, doesn't create lane on column O

#note Q says ECOTOUR, which I agree with. putting the V at B3 creates a good bingo lane and also leads the board to be easily forked. but, not v. important
>Mark_Milan: IX 6J XI +52 216
>JD: ADEEOUY 14E ADO +24 393
#note believe this was my rack. maybe not exactly. both ADOBE and YOU tempting, but not worth allowing for a 100+ point bingo and potential miracle comeback

#note rack is approximate

#note since I'm not necessarily going to bingo but the pool looks good, quackle likes RULE at 4D to block row 4.

>JD: ?EELOSU 3I dELOUSE +67 502
#note in collins, I'd have to worry about 3x3 responses like TREDILLE, but I couldn't see much that he would end up with so I took the bingo. quackle recognized that BO at 13M gives nowhere for him to bingo (not even TRINDLE/TENDRIL) in which case I'm definitely better off passing up the bingo. but over the board I got lazy.
