>Matthew_Larocque: EILNTUV 8G LUV +12 12
#note Prepare yourself for an exhilarating, high-scoring, epic Scrabble showdown. Also, I folded on UNLIVE thinking it was only UNLIVED.
>Noella_Ward: ABM 7F BAM +15 15
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEINTT 6H ET +7 19
#note I figured this would be more annoying for her to deal with than the other placements.
>Noella_Ward: OW I8 .OW +10 25
>Matthew_Larocque: CEINOTY 10G CO.Y +20 39
#note Right on, that C should be annoying too.
>Noella_Ward: RY G10 .RY +8 33
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIINT 11E TI.E +10 49
#note E(LUV)IATE is too tricky a play for me to see. I opted to keep playing closed until I had a good reason not to.
>Noella_Ward: IJ F5 JI. +14 47
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEFIIN 10C FIE +8 57
#note Should be interesting to see who breaks 150 first. E(LUV)IA, which only takes an L hook, would have been cool.

>Noella_Ward: DOU G3 DUO +15 62
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEINNU 5I ENNUI +12 69
#note  SPOILERS: I score over 300 this game.
>Noella_Ward: OX 4K OX +38 100
#note NOW IT'S ON. LIKE DONKEY KONG.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEFGR C8 GA.FED +30 99
#note GAD(JO) is a cool play.
>Noella_Ward: EEPS H1 SEEP +37 137
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENORW 8A WA.ON +30 129
>Noella_Ward: BOT B6 BO.T +14 151

>Noella_Ward: INN I1 INN +13 164
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EELNOR M2 ELO.NERs +76 216
#note I almost missed the OXO spot, which is good because I didn't know OLEORESIN. ELOIGNER scores 78.
>Noella_Ward: HT 12C .TH +18 182
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGILVZ 2K GE.Z +28 244
>Noella_Ward: V -V +0 182
#note That's not good.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILV 8K VI.AL +27 271
#note Another missed rack, I decided to take a chance here since I didn't have any good plays (I don't think). Hopefully she's forced to play a mini-bingo.
>Noella_Ward: KP 7L K.P +19 201
#note Did she draw the K on her exchange 1?
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIIOT O6 AI.OI +15 286
#note OH MY GOD I EVEN TOOK A PICTURE OF THE BOARD AND I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE *AILOI UNTIL I QUACKLED THIS. That is shocking. And also bad. 
>Noella_Ward: ADLRS N10 LARD +11 212
#note She held momentarily. I had assumed she knew AIOLI since vowel dump words are known by most people. Man, what happened to me. Also, she played LARDS first, than took back the S. Way to kill the suspense, Noella! 
>Matthew_Larocque: AACEIMT 13L CA.I +14 300
#note Not sure what Quackle is getting at. Even with the S specified, it wants to get greedy for points. She physically showed me an S, Quackle. I'm not leaving that wide open. The amount of cockiness it would take to do that is far beyond me.
>Noella_Ward: ERSTU L10 TRU.E +14 226
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEGHMT 15H HATED +44 344
#note I was only like 75% sure TRUCED was valid, and she's going to challenge this, so it took a bit of courage to go with my gut here. I didn't even see the bingo she would have won the game with if TRUCED gets kicked off the board. A close call hinged on a single decision - the type of games I generally never win, but won this time due to a rare exception where I played a valid word.
>Noella_Ward: ?ARRSSS -  +0 226
>Matthew_Larocque: GM 14K M.G +13 357
>Matthew_Larocque:  (?ARRSSS) +12 369
#note Noella was overscored by 2 points. NO, NOT MY PRECIOUS SPREAD! IT WAS AFFECTED BY THIS!
