#note he didn't find POUTINE the first time around, so I figured I would maximize my chance of bingoing next turn and give him a chance to miss it again. I can also play CAB, which leaves him with some difficult bingos to find (EUPHONIC and UNPOETIC), or BI which only leaves POUTINE for fewer points. I am pretty happy with minimizing variance.

#note the idea was to save the H for row 14 where it can score me a lot of points. this was probably one of my better plays of the weekend although I immediately botched it next turn

>JD: AHIRRRT M7 TAHR +29 294
#note maybe I was rattled by brian's last play, or pressured by my extreme slowness, but I only saw AIRTH after hitting my clock. my win percentage drops from 27% to 17% as a result.
>Brian_Nelson: NTW D10 T.WN +14 325
>JD: DFIIRRU 13B FU.DI +18 312
#note should've found airth! instead I have a really challenging play on my hands. the only other play that doesn't suck is FUCI at G2, which isn't too different

>JD: EIIORRX 2E IXI. +27 339
#note however I interpret brian's last play, it doesn't seem to bode very well for my winning chances. I think he is more likely than random to have the blank already - playing one tile with a blank unseen seems like an invitation to your opponent to draw it. given the circumstances, I don't love quackle's suggestion of REFIX at B11, since it seems dependent on drawing a bingo. I was just trying to keep the score close and see if brian would make a mistake.

>JD: EEJORRV E1 J.VER +30 369
#note JIVER gave me some hope, but I can also play OVERCOOKED at 4C for 10 more points! however, I'm then stuck with the J, which is unlikely to score very well. a many-ply sim prefers JIVER.
>Brian_Nelson: CELT B10 CLE.T +32 402
>JD: EHOORSW 6B WHOSO +37 406
#note CLEFT was a huge blow, since I had WOOFER for 40 saving SH for 29. I'm now screwed if he spots GAGER, and he has a lot of time. I found the best spot but not the best play of WOOSH! however, the question is, would Brian try GAGER if it were the only way he could win? he can also potentially play RAGIS/SWOOSH or ARIGHT or GARISH through WHOSO, but it was a pretty high-pressure endgame.
>Brian_Nelson: ?AGIR 1B RIo.A +20 422
#note BRAVI can now still win him the game without him having to try GAGER, but he didn't spot it...
>JD: ER 3C RE. +12 418
#note I think I should be pretty grateful for obtaining a tie, all things considered!
