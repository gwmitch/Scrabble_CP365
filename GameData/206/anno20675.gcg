>George_Macaulay: AGZ 8G ZAG +26 26
>Matthew_Larocque: HISTUWW J6 WIST +29 29
#note I was iffy on WHIST being valid, and I forgot about the T hook on WIST when I played it. No, really. Since I'm forced to keep a W, I figured the H would help.
>George_Macaulay: AEINOSV 10G EVASION +72 98
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEHMUW 9B HEAUME +26 55
#note The other HEAUME fares better as well as U(N)MEW and the WHEEs. I guess I got a little excited about turnover with a rack like this.
>George_Macaulay: BDLN L8 BL.ND +22 120
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AGIISW 11D IWIS +27 82
#note VIGIAS, 9 extra points. 
>George_Macaulay: BEMR 8A BERM +47 167
#note I kind of regretted playing that HEAUME when he got 47 points out of it.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGIOQ M7 QI +25 107
>George_Macaulay: DELY 12A YELD +30 197
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGOOU 12L .UO +4 111
#note Really bad call. Despite the blank, AEGO? isn't worth a 4 point fish. I'm pretty sure I didn't notice (Y)OGA/(Y)UGA though, which is kind of a problem. I'm 90 points behind so if I fish for 4 points and fail, that's going to be the end for me.
>George_Macaulay: EINRU N5 URINE +23 220
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEGIO A12 .AGI +24 135
#note I temporarily forget that YOGI is a word. Or YOGA for that matter. 
>George_Macaulay: IKLTY 5G KILTY +33 253
#note With the other blank still unseen, this is either going to get really ugly or I might get really lucky.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEEEOR 4K OE +9 144
#note When you are desperate, you make bad plays. And I must have totally forgot about O8 because DREE scores freakin 38 points.
>George_Macaulay: AENOPST 13F TEOPANS +72 325
#note CRUSHED
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEEFR 3I DEFAmER +85 229
#note Okay, maybe only "crushed", in lower case.
>George_Macaulay: CFU O1 CU.F +39 364
>Matthew_Larocque: AILNORX 14I AX +54 283
#note Comeback engaged.
