#note This is pretty solid, sim marginally liking OM(O)V and possibly the immediate VOMITO. Also worth considering is MOTIVIC to clear things out.
>Naween: ?EEFOPT 10B PE.FEcTO +70 108
>Andrew_Fisher: CCHOOPR H1 CHOCO +56 146
#note Keeping the O pays off quickly (and unexpectedly), nothing else even breaking 30
>Naween: OT 6D .OT +13 121
>Andrew_Fisher: AEINPRR 2H .EPARIN +36 182
#note Seems bingo-like but nothing to be found. Quackle is torn between my choice and just dumping an R onto PERFECTO, though also suggests the wonderful (VOMITO)RIA
>Naween: AATU 1L ATUA +22 143
>Andrew_Fisher: DLMNRRY 9C M.RD +27 209
#note First thought was SYN/FY but the leave is terrible. MARD is better than YARD because of the rack insurance

#note The only bingo available, though the C at H1 looks highly plausible

#note Apparently some other routes offer more spread but this does the out-in-two job
