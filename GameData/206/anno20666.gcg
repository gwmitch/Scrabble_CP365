#note I had no idea what to do here. But Marj just drew into a bag with ?JZSS, so I don't think I can leave this spot open. I should have played OURALIS# though, since it turns out he would have accepted it.

#note Marj burned up most of his clock on ZIT, so it seemed pretty clear he had the blank. I decided AZO could wait since I had the last two A's. I can't really block everything while also keeping AO. 12F ODA takes out both S hooks, but leaves open row 14 (with an N-ending bingo friendly pool unseen) and also throws away my AZO insurance. I had to put in S? inferrence to get VAGI to sim even with AZO. But maybe that assumption is off-base. I would expect Marj to use lots of time on that turn even if he didn't have the blank. The top-simming play is a bizarre one. 10I AVAILED. I can see why it would be good with no inferrence: big turnover to grab the S? plus leaving the AZO assurance to outrace in the endgame. But it leaves 1 in the bag and gives him another chance to hit his bingo. That can't be right. I really think I need to do some blocking here. I dunno.
