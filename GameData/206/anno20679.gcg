>Jonathan_Lindh: AGINNOR 8G NO +4 4
#note 2nd best play! 8H ON is preferred better by 22.8 equity points to 22.4 but this is the right idea.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: IJOST I7 JOIST +24 24
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEGINR 9A REGINAE +64 68
#note 4th best play. 11G INTERAGE? 11F GRATINEE? 10B ANERGIES? Are we back to missing common 7s and 8s Jonathan? This play strangely worked out.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AEKLS A5 LAKE.S +30 54
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEHILP 11D HAPLI.Es +98 166
#note Best play. Tied with E4 PHELONIA which I only vaguely knew and most certainly did not see. I like this play best because it completely kills the board.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AEFILNX -  +0 54
#note Challenge. Tim knew HOPLITES but not HAPLITES.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AERUUWY 12A WARE +32 198
#note 10th best play. 10I SWAYER simmed the best, but all of the top 10-15 plays keep both U's! Strange rack indeed.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ADEINOS K4 ANODISE. +66 120
#note Best play for Tim. ADONISES and ADENOSIS are this word's anagrams. ANODISES is new so Quackle does not recognize it.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EOUUXYZ J2 YUZU +37 235
#note 2nd best play! I think this is the best because it gets rid of both U's and keeps EOX, but Quackle prefers B5 OX for 52 points by 36.8 to 36.6 equity points. I like my play better.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ACLW B3 CLAW +32 152
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEOSTUX L1 DOUX +66 301
#note Apparently I missed 13D TUXEDOS for 73 points. Strangely enough, my play sims the best because of the EST leave 80.6 equity points to 73.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: DD B12 .DD +10 162
>Jonathan_Lindh: EFNOSTY F11 .ONY +17 318
#note This was horrible. I did not see 4A plays with FLAKERS. FLEY or FLAKERS go for 46 and 48 points. This is horrible.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: Q D8 Q. +21 183
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEFNOST A12 .EAN +27 345
#note Still missing FLAKERS and 40+ points!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?EGLNRT 2C uRGENTL. +63 246
#note A nice bingo by Tim! He is good with bingos that end in Y. Only bingo available too.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEFOSTU 1F FOU +31 376
#note You're missing FLAKERS and 40+ points you dumb dumb! Although this play was the 7th best play.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: BIR 1L .RIB +21 267
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEEGST D1 G.EET +16 392
#note 3rd best play! D1 GREE and C5 GEE sim slightly better although they are all about the same.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: BOR E4 ROB +16 283
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEHIMS M1 .EM +20 412
#note 4th best play! How did I miss J10 HEMIC for 40? Bad miss.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AAIR F4 ARIA +18 301
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEFHIMS B8 F.H +35 447
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: IOPTTTV G5 IT +11 312
#note I think Tim misadded his score here. G5 IT is 11 G6 TINE is 13 points. Whatever this play was, it was recorded as 12 points. 
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEIOPSV N3 SPIV +22 469
#note H11 IVIES for 36 points is the best. I did not see this for some reason.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: IMTTV 5M V.M +8 320
#note Tim did the 2nd best play. 13D MINT blocks my ONCE for the out.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEO 13E O.CE +9 478
#note Best play! And only out!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (ITT) +6 484
