>Jim_Burlant: CEGLMOU 8G GUM +12 12
#note Not good.  This rack looked like Greek to me and after a couple of minutes this was all I could come up with.  MOGUL 8D is clearly best.
>Kevin_Schutz: CNOY 9F CONY +31 31
>Jim_Burlant: CDEILOS -  +0 12
#note Whoops!  For some reason I only remembered this as a 5 requiring an E, so I challenged. UNDOCILE H8 is much better than this, with the simple fish of MYC simming second.  
>Kevin_Schutz: ADR 7F RAD +14 45
>Jim_Burlant: CDEILOS 10I COL +17 29
#note Quackle prefers the simple fish of I8 MYC; I didn't like my bingo chances with SOILED. Short term, this did work out.  
>Kevin_Schutz: AINORT L8 RATION +20 65
>Jim_Burlant: DEEGIST E1 EDGIEST +73 102
#note Good thing I didn't try STEEDING*.  This is best, with the 14G placement simming 8  points down.
>Kevin_Schutz: FLLRU 1A FULL.R +30 95
>Jim_Burlant: AADEHII K5 IDEA +12 114
#note Was too blinded by all the vowels vis-a-vis the unseen pool to look for scoring plays.  2A AHI wins the sim with this choice getting justifiably slammed.
>Kevin_Schutz: ANSW 11I SWA.N +36 131
>Jim_Burlant: AFHINOO L2 HOOF +25 139
#note 2B HOOD wins the sim at 48% with HOOF J4 finishing 3rd.  I didn't think Kevin knew the W front-hook, and that never came to pass in this game.  C1 LOOFAH is the runner up, but I didn't see it.  Against Kevin, that probably would have been the best choice.
>Kevin_Schutz: BOP M1 BOP +27 158
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGILN N1 AGE +31 170
#note 1A FULLERING and N2 GENIE are the sim winners here; the sim doesn't like this a whole lot, probably due to the I's that aren't coming out.  I'm still around 45% here.
>Kevin_Schutz: ?AAATTV -?AAA +0 158
>Jim_Burlant: AEIILNP 2B PI +18 188
#note PAID 2B wins the sim, with this choice a ways down.  Too fishy.  As it turns out, any play I put down here was helpful; Kevin told me after the game he was going to put down REfUGEES on row 3, but this play blocked it.  I'm back over 56%.
>Kevin_Schutz: ?EEERSU C1 ..EU +8 166
#note Kevin told me after the game that his was his rack.  13H REVENUES was the only playable bingo for him.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILNQ 4B Q.A.L +28 216
#note Sime still likes FULLERENE 1A, but you gotta know it to play it.  Surprisingly, the sim agrees with my choice as the best available play that's not on row 1.  Llooking at it now, I'm not so sure I should have unloaded the L.  I'm at 68% now.
>Kevin_Schutz: EX M8 EX +37 203
>Jim_Burlant: EEEINRS M11 .EE +12 228
#note What do you do here if you don't know FULLERENE?  Turns out this is the best choice if you don't know the row 1 play.  I'm still at 70%...but my chances are about to plummet.
>Kevin_Schutz: ?EKRSTU 14F TURKEyS +71 274
#note Now it's Kevin over 70% winning chances.  And my next rack leaves me in another "now-what?" situation.
>Jim_Burlant: DEIINRS F13 I. +2 230
#note Now it's my turn to whiff.  I saw INSIDER...and entering this rack into Quackle, I didn't have to click "generate choices" to notice the line starting at J1.  Too bad I didn't see that line during the game.  In the absence of that and in the absence of seeing a good scoring play at H15, I felt I needed to open a line.  If I get the bingo down here, it sims around 55%.  This choice?   I've thrown the game away - a horrible loss of board vision at the worst possible time.  
>Kevin_Schutz: AWY H12 WA.Y +42 316
>Jim_Burlant: DEEINRS O3 DENIERS +84 314
#note Better late than never, I'm back at 27%.  But this is too little, too late.
>Kevin_Schutz: JOT 12D JOT +23 339
>Jim_Burlant: BIMNNOV 7M VI. +27 341
#note Trying to save my O so I can back-hook the J, I'm also trying to extend the game if I can by playing short.  This choice wins the sim and nothing else comes close.
>Kevin_Schutz: ITZ 6B ZIT. +33 372
>Jim_Burlant: BHIMNNO 6N H. +26 367
#note 13C NOMINA wins but I didn't know that; this play sims equally.
>Kevin_Schutz: AARV J3 VARA +20 392
>Jim_Burlant: BIMNNO E11 M.B +18 385
#note A few points of spread in a blown game.  13 C NOMINA and E10 BOOM sim ahead of this.
>Kevin_Schutz: ?ET B6 .EsT +12 404
>Kevin_Schutz:  (INNO) +8 412
