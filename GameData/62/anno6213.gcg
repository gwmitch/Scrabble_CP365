>Jim_Burlant: AEGILUZ 8D GAUZE +34 34
#note Best.
>Paula_Catanese: ENOO G7 O.ONE +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: FILLSTX H11 FILLS +32 66
#note Terrible play.  This justifiably gets slammed in the sim. 11E FLEX is obviously best and I don't know what I was thinking when I put this down.  Or was I even thinking at all?
>Paula_Catanese: NWY E8 .WNY +20 36
>Jim_Burlant: EISTTVX 14E IXT.E +28 94
#note Quackle prefers 14D VEXIL; I wasn't thrilled about keeping the V but I'd rather keep that than the duplicated T's.  Second choice is I5 VETS.
>Paula_Catanese: MOOPR 13B PROMO +31 67
>Jim_Burlant: EEIISTV 14A VIE +22 116
#note Best, winning 75%.
>Paula_Catanese: ABT 15C TAB +16 83
>Jim_Burlant: AEGINST J8 INGATES +79 195
#note Best bingo, winning 93%.
>Paula_Catanese: AEENOPR -AEEN +0 83
>Jim_Burlant: ADDQRTT K5 TRAD +13 208
#note Blind to the left side of the board.   Compltely whiffed on everything here.  This is very weak - but at least the tiles are turning, right?  No matter - punishment was swift.
>Paula_Catanese: ?AEELTV 5E LEViTA.E +70 153
>Jim_Burlant: DEEHNQT 4L HENT +26 234
#note M2 HEED is better; this play is stupid.  Even Q(i) (which I didn't notice until after I hit my clock) would have been much better than foolishly opening the board.
>Paula_Catanese: AFHI O1 FAI.H +33 186
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEQSY H4 Q. +20 254
#note Yeah, the leave isn't great but I figured I could resume playing after dumping the Q.
>Paula_Catanese: JKU F2 JUK. +31 217
>Jim_Burlant: ADEESUY 6J D.Y +27 281
#note Cute play but 6I AE(R)Y is much better than leaving myself this unbalanced mess.
>Paula_Catanese: ANO N2 NO.A +19 236
>Jim_Burlant: AEERSUU -EUU +0 281
#note Whoops, missed 6B UREAS.  Even with this nonsense I'm still at 80% winning chances.
>Paula_Catanese: CR 11J .RC +10 246
>Jim_Burlant: AERRSSW M9 RESAW +24 305
#note I'd rather be lucky than good.  L11 CRAW wins the sim - I'd rather take away all the lines and force her to find something - and on this board that'll be awfully tough.
>Paula_Catanese: CDLO 3C CLO.D +20 266
>Jim_Burlant: EEGIIRS 6C EGIS +27 332
#note So right after I kill the board, like a complete idiot, I open a line I can't block.  Right after I hit the clock, I had an OMG moment:  "OMG, does that take a front A?"  It does.  Fortunately for me, Paula didn't know that hook and burned her A to open a new line.
>Paula_Catanese: AP M2 AP. +23 289
>Jim_Burlant: BEIMORU 2F .ORUM +23 355
#note Well, now that the A's are out I don't have to worry about the  EGIS hook.  None of the bingos in her rack would fit there.  As for this play - this isn't even one of the original quackle choices, but it wins the sim.  At least I made one good play when it counted.  
>Paula_Catanese: ?EINORU 1H ONUs +21 310
>Jim_Burlant: BDEII N12 BED +21 376
#note Didn't see BIDI.
>Paula_Catanese: EIR 10B REI. +6 316
>Paula_Catanese:  (II) +4 320
#note Paula went over on time by roughly 1-1/2 minutes. Final score 376 - 300.
