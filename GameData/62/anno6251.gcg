#note Or 8G WATERY or 8G TAWNEY.
>Nathan_Benedict: BPU 7G PUB +22 22
>Jim_Burlant: EEEORST J8 .OE +8 38
#note I felt that if I was sitting on the S, I should set it up.  Quackle prefers 6I OE, docking me roughly 4 points for this choice.
>Nathan_Benedict: AEFINRT -AE +0 22
>Jim_Burlant: EEFKRST L4 REKE. +24 62
#note Didn't like this a lot, and neither does Quackle, preferring 9G KETO and L7 FYKE.  But felt I should take the points rather than try and fish - perhaps gunshy about fishing department because of the trouble I had fishing in my previous game against Laurie.
>Nathan_Benedict: IIT 6J TI.I +10 32
>Jim_Burlant: FGHIPST 5K H.P +30 92
#note K10 FIGHT wins the sim with this choice 4th.  I considered it, but figured he was sitting on a good combo and didn't want him zinging me on the triple. I would have liked to clear more of the rack but figured I could wait.
>Nathan_Benedict: GNU 6F GUN +15 47
>Jim_Burlant: ?FGIJST K10 FIG +19 111
#note Best.
>Nathan_Benedict: X 7L .X +37 84
>Jim_Burlant: ?IJOSTT 12I JI.S +24 135
#note Didn't know that JOTTING took an S.  Not sure why I played JIGS instead of JOGS.  But this actually sims as the best non-bingo option.
>Nathan_Benedict: ATV 5E VAT +20 104
>Jim_Burlant: ?EOORTT 9B TOOTERs +61 196
#note Hmmm...the best play per the sim is to pass up the bingo in favor of 13G ROOT.  This is the only playable bingo, but what is significant is that I spent several minutes on this turn trying in vain to find something that could back-hook the J in JIGS before throwing my hands up and putting this down.
>Nathan_Benedict: DEIINRS C3 DERISI.N +70 174
#note Quackle says Nathan should have put down IRONSIDE instead; given my next rack, Nathan was much better off having put this down.
>Jim_Burlant: ACFILNS D8 F.ALS +35 231
#note Sim prefers 8A FAIL, which I seriously considered; I felt that on this board, the S was pretty much useless and I was willing to burn it for 35.  I also wanted the extra turnover.  Quackle disagrees, docking me 4 points.
>Nathan_Benedict: DD 6B D.D +9 183
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEIMN B2 MIB +21 252
#note Quackle doesn't like this; I preferred the extra turnover once again.  With this lead and Nathan struggling to score I'd rather take away easy bingo lines and turn 3 tiles rather than 2.
>Nathan_Benedict: EGY A1 GEY +32 215
>Jim_Burlant: AACCELN 8A NA.. +23 275
#note Best, despite the leave.
>Nathan_Benedict: DNOU 13F UNDO +17 232
>Jim_Burlant: ACCELOZ F8 L.Z +32 307
#note I felt there were too many points to pas up here; 4H CLEAR wins with this choice a close second. 
>Nathan_Benedict: HNORT 14B NORTH +45 277
>Jim_Burlant: ACCEIOO H13 .OC +18 325
#note G9 RACON, which I didn't know, wins.  No really great options in this position.
>Nathan_Benedict: AEEEILR -AEEE +0 277
>Jim_Burlant: AACEIOW 15A CAW +31 356
#note Hated the leave but felt there were too many points to pass up.
>Nathan_Benedict: ERSU D1 RUSE +28 305
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIOOV 1D .EAVE +24 380
#note Quackle says I should block line 15 with COOEE, and prior to his opening up row 1, that was going to be my play.  I saw this and felt I should take the points.  And despite what the sim says I put myself in position to win the game...only to completely blow it.

#note My tracking was a mess and courtesy of all the earlier positions where there were no easy choices and lots of points available with bad leaves, I was under 3 minutes on my clock.   Sitting on the blank with a 72-point lead, I should have realized that I had enough cushion to take a 2 or even 3-minute time penalty.  Instead, I panicked.  I assumed that he had fished the Q and that my 88-point lead would be enough to withstand whatever he put down.  Of course, with accurate tracking, MEALIER + Q would have jumped out at me, and LOOIE 2H would have been the play.  With this inexcusable choice, punishment was swift.
