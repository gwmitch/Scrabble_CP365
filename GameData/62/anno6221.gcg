>Jim_Burlant: BEEIKOY 8G YOKE +22 22
#note 8E placement wins the sim with this choice second by just shy of 2 points.  
>PK_Gott: ADIIN K4 NIAID +25 25
>PK_Gott: ADIIN --  -25 0
>Jim_Burlant: BCEFIOS 7E FOB +21 43
#note Quackle says I should burn the S with K4 COIFS (the sim winner), but it's actually a pretty close call.  This choice, which sims second, sims within 1/2 point of COIFS.
>PK_Gott: DNOP K5 POND +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: CCEIOSU E4 CUI. +18 61
#note Whiffed on OCCUPIES.   This is clearly the best of the non-bingo options; I was thrown off by the CCU combo.
>PK_Gott: AEIINRR 9B RAINIER +70 97
>Jim_Burlant: ACELNOS 10G SECONAL +73 134
#note Missed 4B CONCEALS, but this worked out quite well.  Safe to say that neither OCCUPIES nor CONCEALS would have drawn a challenge, so I benefitted from my miss on the previous turn.
>PK_Gott: BNSTUVY -  +0 97
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: DIINTUV M10 .IVID +18 152
#note Only saw INDUCT or LIVID in this position; couldn't think of VINIC 4A, which is clearly the best play.  
>PK_Gott: EG J6 GE. +17 114
>Jim_Burlant: DHNRTUZ 4B DUT.H +22 174
#note Arrrgh.  Couldn't think of NUDZH and this was all I saw.
>PK_Gott: EGI 12K GI.E +16 130
>Jim_Burlant: EENRTTZ O10 NERTZ +25 199
#note Quackle doesn't like this but it snuffed out whatever she was trying to set up.  And I wasn't particularly concerned about trying to set up a 48-point Z bomb at D8.  O10 TENTER wins the sim btw.
>PK_Gott: IS I10 .IS +5 135
>Jim_Burlant: ABEFMQT A7 FAB +34 233
#note I don't agree with Quackle here.  QAT 8A wins the sim.  Yes, I saw it.  But, if her fish goes awry and she takes the U in DUTCH away, what am I going to do with BMF on my next turn?  This play still scores well, unloads 2 of my 3 clunkiest tiles, takes out the most dangerous hook on the board, and I have a virtually guaranteed q play coming up.  The Q can wait.
>PK_Gott: AAEGSSU 12B SAUSAGE. +70 205
>Jim_Burlant: AAEMQTX H12 .XAM +39 272
#note Quackle doesn't like this, preferring L4 QAT and 3A MAX.  I'd rather score 39, and guarantee myself the Q play next turn which is why I passed on MAX.  I'm still at 80% here.
>PK_Gott: HOW 13C WHO +35 240
>Jim_Burlant: AEIJQTT C3 Q.ITE +30 302
#note 14J QAID wins the sim, with this choice roughly 1-1/2 points down.
>PK_Gott: OY G12 .OY +23 263
>Jim_Burlant: AAJRTTW L3 AJAR +30 332
#note 11A TAJ wins the sim.  Quackle pans this play, but I figured I'd try to turn tiles and land the blank.  And the tactic paid off.
>PK_Gott: MUV 11A VUM +18 281
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEOTTW M3 TOWED +48 380
#note Best, at 99.8%. Given this board, I wasn't worried about rack building; I just wanted to score.
>PK_Gott: ER C1 RE..... +16 297
>Jim_Burlant: ??AEITT 1A TE.ATIsm +113 493
#note PK took a very long time before she finally made her play, and it had given me enough time to notice that I could play TErATIs(M) 15A as a late exclamation point.  When she put the R here, she hadn't even finished pulling her first tile before I slapped this down.
>PK_Gott: ELLNOPR -  +0 297
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: LN D8 L.N +4 497
