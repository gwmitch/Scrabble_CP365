>Toh_Weibin: ?ADOOST 8D TOStADO +66 66
#note Saving the 2 points for better defense didn't really seem to be worth it.
>Quackle: ACELSTT E5 CAL.TTES +90 90

>Toh_Weibin: BFIMNNR C11 B.N +18 171
#note Miss B(HAJI), but not much I can do with this rack. Maybe BIN 6A, but I have some doubts.
>Quackle: EIMORWY A13 YOW +35 222
#note This was actually Quackle's lowest-scoring move throughout the whole game. I never know when the duck's wearing a hat.
>Toh_Weibin: EEFIMNR B2 FIREMEN +93 264
#note OK.. I can't do much with BFIMNNR, except get lucky with a 2-vowel draw!
>Quackle: AEGIMPR 13F EPIGRAM +72 294
>Toh_Weibin: CEGKNTU H12 K.NG +42 306
#note EUK(I)NG is better here.
>Quackle: EEINPST M8 PENTISE +96 390
>Toh_Weibin: CENORTU N2 TROUNCE +76 382
#note CORNUTE L4. I am obviously having trouble with easy words, but I am playing these moves too quickly.
>Quackle: AABELNO O8 ABALONE +95 485
#note ABALONE would still have gotten down if I'd played CORNUTE, but for much less.
>Toh_Weibin: DEIITVY O1 VIED +39 421
#note This is actually more interesting than it looks. VIED is obviously the best for score/ balance, but VIDE on the left (A1) is a wiser choice - I suppose this is because Quackle's envisaging bingos -TY or -RY, complementary to my leave. Intelligent!
>Quackle: EIOSUVZ K10 ZOU.VE +36 521
>Toh_Weibin: EGITUWY 14D WEY +34 455
#note I'm feeling a little uncomfortable with keeping the W or Y (especially the Y or W with U) here, because one of the best bingo lines (S hook to TOSTADO) will be hard to use with either. I overlook WYTE C1 though, which is clearly stronger.
>Quackle: ADIOORS 15K .IDOS +62 583
#note Nice!
>Toh_Weibin: ?EGILTU H3 LIGUl.TE +59 514
#note d(I)GITULE 3A overlooked, along with a couple others. Good enough, anyway...
