#note Q suggests MAMBO is better, maybe it's right since BOMA is quite dangerous and the A hook isn't really necessary.

#note Don't think I'll be losing my lead too soon with this move... possible threats are line 1 and line O.

#note But I certainly didn't expect this! MAMAGUY: (Caribbean) to tease

#note I miss a new word here - (S)LAIRGED J8.

>Toh_Weibin: AAERTWY O1 WARY +53 247
#note C11 YAW is a good choice too, besides AWRY at the same spot as WARY. I missed YEUKED, though.
>Quackle: AEEEINR 14B EA.E +14 258
#note This opens up very volatile spots.
>Toh_Weibin: AEEEINT I7 E.E +11 258
#note Interesting how "dumps" like 15C T(E)NIAE or 9H (R)ETINAE sim better than E(R)E. TENIAE sims the best. These move definitely would require a player with skill and confidence to play off bingo-friendly tiles with the potential of an unfriendly draw, especially when the scores are so close. (RETINAE opens multiple scoring spots with the J, X and Z and the favourable circumstance after this is probably for me to draw some of these biggies, or a bingo) M3 (V)E(N)AE is a better move than mine, if the fish is still to be made. The simple EE 15A would serve as a functional block for easy scoring. (G)EE N5 is also good.
>Quackle: ?DEINPR A9 PINDERs +91 349
#note Ouch.
>Toh_Weibin: ACEINNT N1 AN. +15 273
#note OK, AN(E) is weak, because there's no point playing off the A, seriously. Just fishing off the N would be good enough. This is where pool awareness comes in - while some players will pick the higher scoring K4 (DOW)N(Y) for 12 points, the best fish is 13C N(O)/N(A). This is because of the J and Z still in the bag. Somehow though, the fish sims very close to N(E)ANIC 15C and TONIC 13C which do the blocking job too - but why play off so many tiles, when FHHPJQXZ are still in the bag?
>Quackle: FHJNNTU 13C J.HN +51 400
#note Oucht.
>Toh_Weibin: CEINORT 15D .RECTION +86 359
#note Have to hope for a magic Z for the next move.
>Quackle: FHINTUX 14K UNFIX +32 432
>Toh_Weibin: ALOOOPZ O13 O.O +30 389
#note Not the best. 13K POOL is better, possibly setting up for AZL(ON)S L10 next move. Again, nice!
>Quackle: HIOQSTT M11 THO.T +22 454
#note Very good setup by Quackle.
