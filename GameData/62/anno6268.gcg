#note Got it confused with a buncha other crappy BE- words.  BICOLOR/BROCOLI, as he pointed out after the game, permeated my subconscious, too.  As did CORBEIL/BRICOLE, though distantly.  Bad mistake, an error of about 170 points, as you'll see.

#note C(L)oAKING or whatev for 88 is the right play.
>Winter: BDENRZ M7 BR.NZED +44 140
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACGIKN J6 CrA.KING +82 136
#note Well, it's the best play, but prospects for coming back are gonna dwindle fast.

#note Best static eval, but a pretty bad play.  We probably don't know, though, that CRACKING takes an S.
>Winter: AP 8M .AP +17 223
#note I think that, there, pretty much locks it up unless I hit the G now.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGINRST L12 RING +21 210
#note Weird, Q says dump the S for 19 on CRACKING.  I saw (Z)IG, but figured him for the last S.  Not so, though.  Odd that he used it for ABOS in retrospect, although this board isn't really conducive to esses if you don't know CRACKINGS.  I opted to try to keep it close.  Big mistake.

>Ryan_Fischer: EISTUVW -UVW +0 210
#note I didn't see what WIVE accomplished, but WISE(CRACKING) is fun, albeit futile ('cause though it scores 31, the leave is atrocious).  I probably shouldn't have exchanged, but I didn't see anything better.
>Winter: AQT 14F QAT +36 289
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: EISSTTT E5 TIT.. +10 220
#note It cracks me up that my play is evaluated best.
>Winter: EELLR 5C RE.ELL +6 295
>Ryan_Fischer: EESSTTU D1 SUET. +12 232
#note SUTTEES no go.  Just trying to create some lanes.  Perhaps UT(E)S would be better, I don't know.  SUET(E)* gets a pretty good valuation, but it's bogus.  I got it confused with SUINT, now that I think of it.  And SUETY, and SUET.

#note I thought PRETELL was good!  :o
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AESTUU 4H AUTEUrS +67 333
#note Too little too late.  Q recommends TAU, fishing for a winner.  Probably a really good idea.
