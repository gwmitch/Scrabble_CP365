>Tim_LeCompte: AEEPY 8D PAYEE +26 26
>Jim_Burlant: ?GILLNS I8 SeLLING +69 69
#note Didn't know any of the 8's (jINGALLS, sINGALLS, SIGNALLy) except SPeLLING.  I'm at 61%, and I lose 13 equity for this choice.
>Tim_LeCompte: HLSU D8 .LUSH +20 46
>Jim_Burlant: BINRTVW G6 VI.W +15 84
#note G5 WIVERN and G5 WIVER win the sim.  This choice is one of 4 choices that sims within 3 points of WIVERN G5, which I didn't think of.
>Tim_LeCompte: DEHK 12H H.KED +34 80
>Jim_Burlant: BEELNRT 11K BEL +21 105
#note Best.
>Tim_LeCompte: OOT 10I .OOT +15 95
>Jim_Burlant: CEENRTZ E5 ZET. +26 131
#note Any of 4 plays - this choice, ZESTER 11B, 11B ZEST, or 12C CHEZ - sim within a point of each other, with this and ZEST duking it out for sim winner honors.

>Jim_Burlant: BCEIJNR 15L BI.E +30 161
#note I didn't like this position at all.  I suspected that he was probably up to something with the Q.  After thinking about it, I felt that if he didn't have an S, I would be ok. Quackle understandably prefers 6B JIBE; while I hated the leave with this choice, I wanted to make sure he couldn't hit me with QADI for 75.  When I asked him about this after the game, it turned out my hunch was on target; he had the Q and was looking to set it up.
>Tim_LeCompte: AER H12 .EAR +26 139
>Jim_Burlant: CCIJNRV 6B JIV. +30 191
#note Too many points not to take them.  This is best, nothing else sims within 12 points.
>Tim_LeCompte: QU 14F QU.. +34 173
>Jim_Burlant: ACCINOR 15C CONI +18 209
#note F3 OCA wins the sim; I preferred to take away the easy hook and turn the extra tile.
>Tim_LeCompte: ANR F8 .ARN +14 187
>Jim_Burlant: ACIRSUW O8 CURS +25 234
#note C11 AURIC wins the sim with O8 CAWS coming in second.  Yes the W is a clunker, but on this board I don't see the point in playing for the bingo, so I'd rather unload the U.
>Tim_LeCompte: DF 13M F.D +14 201
>Jim_Burlant: AAEITTW L6 AWAI... +12 246
#note Quackle's choices are C3 AWAIT and  E11 EAT 17.  I figured that if I had to open, turn the extra tile and hasten the end of the game.   I'm at 69% now.
>Tim_LeCompte: INOT B6 .OINT +14 215
>Jim_Burlant: EFMNOTT A8 MO +26 272
#note Didn't see MOTIF and figured that I needed to prevent the cheap X bomb at 8A.  I wasn't as concerned with him hitting REMIX C3.
>Tim_LeCompte: OS J14 SO +21 236
>Jim_Burlant: AEFNRTT M3 FATTER +30 302
#note I'm at 87% with this; apparently, if Quackle is to be believed the best play is F2 FETA.  Not sure I buy that; I'd rather turn 6 and score 30.  
>Tim_LeCompte: ?AMORXY -?AM +0 236
>Jim_Burlant: EGIMNPU E11 UMP +27 329
#note K2 GUIMPE (which I didn't know) wins, followed by K4 UNPEG.  This sims 4th, just shy of 95%.
>Tim_LeCompte: AEY K5 YEA +21 257
>Jim_Burlant: EGGIINO C2 GENI. +12 341
#note Whoops - right idea, wrong execution.  Didn't see it one row lower for 5 more points.  But it still gets the job done.  GENII C3 is best, with this play simming second.  He's got the X and the blank, and with this lead it's okay if he hits it for 40.  I don't want to let him have 60, and that's what this play was intended to block.
