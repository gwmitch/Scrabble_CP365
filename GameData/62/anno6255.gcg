>Monique_Kornell: ACIOT 8D COATI +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: ?NNOORX 7H OX +19 19
#note Best, despite leaving duplicated N's.
>Monique_Kornell: CDU G5 DUC. +25 45
>Jim_Burlant: ?NNORSU 5A UNROuN.S +66 85
#note With this combo I was happy just to find this.   Best bingos are 5D RUNDOWNS and E4 PRONOUNS.  Play incorrectly scored as 58.
>Monique_Kornell: AEILOSW -AEI +0 45
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGIOU H1 AGUE. +21 106
#note Considered B2 GUINEA and this.  Sim winner is EUGENIA B1, which I didn't see and even now I'm not sure I like that option.  I concede that EUGENIA and GUINEA clear the rack better than AGUES, but wasn't keen on slotting another 3x3 with an E in second position while she had just exchanged 3 and I would be sitting on a random rack.  I felt that, all things considered, leaving the U in the A column was the safest bet and she'd have to hit a 5 or 6 starting with J or Q to really burn me badly.
>Monique_Kornell: EHU 6A HUE +19 64
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIIOV D8 .AVIE +20 126
#note Well, I don't have to worry about the A column any more.  Phew.  CIVIE in the same location sims slightly better, though 2F VOGIE wins the sim.  
>Monique_Kornell: OPT 6I OPT +20 84
>Jim_Burlant: BEIKOOR C11 BROOK +28 154
#note Recalling both her exchange and her last play which I figured was an S hook setup, I figured it would be safer to put something clunky like the K into the triple line rather than give her the easy hook with something like BOOK or KOBO at C11.  Even simming against an inferred S, Quackle prefers C11 KOBO.  I don't. C12 BOOK, sacrificing 2 scoreboard points to this choice, would have been slightly better to preserve more of this rack.
>Monique_Kornell: IR 15A IR. +21 105
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEHIQ 3G Q.A +23 177
#note I debated whether or not to play the I, but worried that if I hung the I, she could come back with something like MIRIN for 34.  Quackle docks me 8 points for this.  While I disagreed with Quackle last turn, I think the duck is right this time - if I play QUAI, I can possibly can come back for at least 40 on the next turn.
>Monique_Kornell: ANOORST L6 SANTOOR +72 177
#note K4 RATTOONS scores 82.
>Jim_Burlant: BEEEGHI J2 HIE +27 204
#note E11 BEIGE wins.  Much better than this.
>Monique_Kornell: EFL K2 ELF +30 207
>Jim_Burlant: ?BDEEGY E11 BEY +33 237
#note BOOGEYED 14A 100!  Had no idea that BOOGIE was also spelled BOOGEY.  1K DEBYE is the best non-bingo option.
>Monique_Kornell: AGN J6 .ANG +20 227
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEGILV 1K DEVIL +38 275
#note Deceptive rack; it looks like there should be something in it, but there isn't.  This is the sim winner, with nothing else coming close.  
>Monique_Kornell: AJR K11 JAR +40 267
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEGMNW M11 GEM +26 301
#note 14A MEOW wins; too bad I couldn't see it. If I was going to play here, I'm not sure why I didn't play WEN in this same location.  Chalk it up to game-8 fatigue.
>Monique_Kornell: ADFL C2 FLA..D +24 291
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEINWY 9C Y.W +18 319
#note Had no idea there was a bingo in here - ANYWIsE 14F wins 95%; this choice wins 84.  Probably should have paid more attention to the generous number of I's and E's in the unseen pool and played VIEWY M1 for 28, which is the best non-bingo option.
>Monique_Kornell: DE 3G .....ED +34 325
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEINT O1 .INEATEd +74 393
#note Best bingo; other option is LEgATINE. 
>Monique_Kornell: ENP 14A PE.N +20 345
>Jim_Burlant: ILSSTWZ 1G Z.S +12 405
>Monique_Kornell: IIMRT N5 MIRI +19 364
>Jim_Burlant: ILSTW 10F WILTS +28 433
>Jim_Burlant:  (T) +2 435
#note Recalling the incorrect score on my UNROuNDS play, the final score recorded as 427 - 364.
