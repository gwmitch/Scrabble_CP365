#note Quackle likes PUT in the same place a smidge better. I see why ...Holding O and D sets me up nicely for the next turn.
>Chris_Cree: ?AEELNS J2 ENAbLES +69 90
>Laurie: ENNOTVX 4I T.XON +24 109
#note Quackle  things I should have saved the T and just played AXON.
>Chris_Cree: AERUU 5J .UREAU +32 122
>Laurie: AEINOVZ O3 ZO.AVE +57 166
#note I was hoping for a U.
>Chris_Cree: ?ADGLOR 2D DiALOG.R +61 183
>Laurie: EIIIINR -III +0 166
#note Hmm.  Only question is whether to trade 3 Is or 4.  Quackle agrees with my choice.  I did draw another I, but it worked out.
>Chris_Cree: EORTV 1K OVERT +38 221
>Laurie: AEIINRS 12G SENARII +75 241
>Chris_Cree: AHM 1F HAM +43 264
>Laurie: LOPRTTY 3B PROTYL +41 282
#note I was really happy with this play.  I considered M9 POLITY and 11J POTTY, but then came up with this.
>Chris_Cree: GIO K10 GI.O +10 274
>Laurie: AACOTTT 1A ACTA +26 308
#note M9 ATTIC is worth consideration to get rid of an extra T, but the extra 10 pts is worth it.  ACTA is also Quackle's top choice.
>Chris_Cree: IIL B3 .ILI +8 282
#note The I's are back.  Luckily, not in my rack.
>Laurie: EINOSTT A6 TONIEST +76 384
>Chris_Cree: AD 3M AD. +32 314
>Laurie: BCDEMWY M12 .CY +16 400
#note Quackle's top plays include H12 EMYD and J11 BAWDY.  I had only a minute or two left on my clock and was feeling a bit timid about opening the triple lane.
>Chris_Cree: IN B12 IN +4 318
>Laurie: BDEGJMW 6N B. +20 420
#note Tough choice here.  I didn't even consider the top sim choice of 14L GYBE.  That forces him away from his setup, but then what do I do after he plays O12 KIER, or o11 HIKER?  
>Chris_Cree: EHIIKRS 14B SHIRK +50 368
#note For reasons I don't quite understand, Q's top choice is C13 EH.  
>Laurie: DEGJMW J11 M.WED +22 442
>Chris_Cree: EI 15J .IE +5 373
#note Chris can squeeze out a few extra points by playing 13B NE, blocking JIG.  Then I'll have to play H7 GOWN and he can score 8 with N1 RID or I2 GIT
