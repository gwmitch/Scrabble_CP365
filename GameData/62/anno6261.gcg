>Jim_Burlant: AENOPTT 7H TOP +17 17
#note I put down POT, thought about it, and changed to this.  Quackle prefers POT, and with good reason.  I was only considering front hooks to determine which was better and I forgot about all the easy  backhooks to TOP.  I justifiably get dinged 5 points for this one.
>Paula_Catanese: AEW K5 AWE. +20 32
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINRT J7 ..A +5 22
#note Best, and I'm winning 51% with this choice.  5J AA is the runner up.
>Paula_Catanese: ?EEORTU 9B rEROUTE +61 93
#note 6B placement scores 63.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEINRT D2 RETAINE. +68 90
#note Didn't know the back-hook to play TRAINEE at L1, which scores 80 and is clearly best.  This is the second best choice, albeit at a huge equity loss.
>Paula_Catanese: ENORSUV 2A OVE.RUNS +76 169
#note 
>Jim_Burlant: ADGHINO B6 HOA.DING +74 164
#note Best, but I'm only at 34% with this, the only playable bingo.
>Paula_Catanese: DVW 8A V.W.D +44 213
#note ?!?!?
>Paula_Catanese: DVW --  -44 169
#note After the game even Paula didn't know why she tried this given that she also had the X and could have played VOX for 39.
>Jim_Burlant: ADENORZ A6 ADZ +80 244
#note Between her mistake and my last rack, I'm now at 81%.  
>Paula_Catanese: DVWX A1 V.X +39 208
>Jim_Burlant: EMNOORT 1F MOO +27 271
#note Oh well.  I only knew MONTERO and there was nowhere to play the 8's I did know, ANTEROOM and MOTIONER/REMOTION.  A small part of me was tempted to try TAEM*/MONTERO but that would have been sure to draw the challenge, as it would have pushed my lead to 113 points.  I didn't know NONMETRO, which would have played on row 12 for 72.    Of the non-bingo options, Quackle prefers MOON for 30 and docks me 3 points relative to MOON for trying to preserve the rack - I don't quite get that, given the size of my lead and the fact that ENRT is a dynamite combination.
>Paula_Catanese: JW C1 J.W +36 244
>Jim_Burlant: EGNNRTT E8 T.NG +12 283
#note The sim says this position is a tossup between this and RONTGEN in the same location.  I didn't think this rack needed to be broken up.
>Paula_Catanese: BCO L3 COB +18 262
>Jim_Burlant: CEFKNRT 3J FE.K +26 309
#note Bit of a miss.  Didn't see J2 plays (J2 FECK in particular), which win the sim and are better than this.
>Paula_Catanese: YY 5C Y.Y +18 280
>Jim_Burlant: AACNRTT A13 ACT +18 327
#note Best.
>Paula_Catanese: DEEF C11 FEED +31 311
>Jim_Burlant: ANORRTU 4D .OUR +9 336
#note Didn't know any of the M3 plays - KRONUR, KNAUR, KRONA and didn't look for KRAUT.  To me this was just a rack-cleaning situation.
>Paula_Catanese: IQS N1 QIS +38 349
>Jim_Burlant: AGINPRT O1 IT +41 377
#note Without a playable bingo, not much else to do with this rack.  Besides, given the pool I'm very likely to get the I back, so no big deal to part with it - though I didn't want to give up my T.  This is best, at 55%.  Presumably, due to breaking up ING synergy, IN O1 only wins 45%.
>Paula_Catanese: BNU 10J NUB +15 364
>Jim_Burlant: AEGINPR 11K PI +20 397
#note There just wasn't getting away from a row 11 play here.  After double-checking the tracking and taking several minutes on this turn, I opted for this over UP, with Quackle claiming my choice has the highest valuation but winning 79% to 81% for UP.  I disagree.  Advantage to UP:  the GAINER leave.  But I thought the downsides outweighed the upside.  Downside:  I felt it was too probable I'd wind up with another high-prob bingo I couldn't put down.  Downside:  If I played UP, it would be too easy for her to bingo on row 12 with S?? still unseen. PI scored 20 instead of 8, and I thought it might make it a little harder for her to get a 7 down.  At least by scoring 20, I've given myself that much more margin if it comes to an end game.  And with III still unseen, there's a good chance I'll get an I back.
