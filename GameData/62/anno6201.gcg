#note JH: "(Wow. This guy's word knowledge is the worst. I bet I could get away with any phony I want.)"
>Jason: EJLQVWY --  -100 482
#note DW: "Tip #65, never play a phony bingo when there are exactly seven tiles in the bag. Your opponent will then have full knowledge of your rack and the unseen tiles!"
#note JH: "Like you could even do anything with that knowledge. You're a fraud, Mr. Wiegand!"
>Dave: ACEHMOT 15G MO.CHATE +95 349
#note DW: "Don't be absurd, son! Just because I don't study those fancy-schmancy 8-to-make-9 hooks, it don't mean I'm a fraud! Trust me, those words are useless!"
#note JH: *sigh* "Look. You just gave me a spot for another 8-to-make-9. I'm starting to believe all those Tips on How to be a Scrabble Master are bogus."
>Jason: EJLQVWY O10 .....L +78 560
#note DW: "You're right, kid, they are bogus. Here, let me give you a real tip: there's no greater strength than being perceived as weak in the eyes of your enemies. Of course I've studied all the 8-to-make-9 hooks. I've even studied the 6-to-make-13 extensions. I know it all, kid. And here's another tip for you: watch out for Mr. Wiegand's traps, because you just walked right into one. I always win, son. Remember that."
