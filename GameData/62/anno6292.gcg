>Colosa: ACEIRTW -W +0 0
#note Kevin's actual rack.
>Tunnicliffe: ABIKNNZ 8G ZIN +24 24
#note I was considering this or 8F BANK. The 8F position because I can maybe infer an S or ? from the trade, and I get a shot at a big Z play. Settled on this to give Kevin fewer letters to play through. Really, though, ZIN is too hookable. BANK was probably better.
>Colosa: ACEIIRT J7 ICTERI +25 25
#note ICTERI*. Wasn't too sure about this one. I remember seeing ICTERUSES as the plural, but wasn't sure whether this was good as well. In the end, I allowed it because Kevin blew up his rack for 25 points, which I don't mind.
>Tunnicliffe: AABEKNT 11H BA.K +20 44
#note Well, if you know TANBARK, you can score a bundle here. BARK is a distant second.
