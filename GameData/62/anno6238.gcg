#note Quackle prefers the 8G placement, by 2 points.
>Becky_Dyer: AEKSW J4 WEKAS +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEHSZ K3 ZED +37 45
#note Saw HAZED and ZOEA.  Decided on this as opposed to HAZED because I wanted to use the H at 7I on the next turn.  I7 ZOEA wins the sim, but I didn't like giving up the easy backhook, points notwithstanding.   This play only gives up 4 points to HAZED K1, which was the other choice I seriously considered.

#note Darn.  Here I have the chance to put down a cool bingo and miss them all (PHEASAN(T),  SAPHENA, ANAPHASE).  Looks like I have much work to do if I'm ever going to become a true STEE.

#note The only playable bingo.

>Jim_Burlant: BCEINVY 8L ENVY +36 185
#note BEVY (which I didn't see) is best.  I just gravitated to the O15 triple.
>Becky_Dyer: X 3K ..X +38 142
>Jim_Burlant: BBCEIJO 7C JIBB +28 213
#note Whoops!  Better at 7D for 3 more points.
>Becky_Dyer: EIOOORY -EIOOO +0 142
>Jim_Burlant: ACENORT O1 ENACTOR. +98 311
#note Best bingo, and now I'm at 99%, even with the blanks unseen.

>Jim_Burlant: ILNORSS D6 S.R.OIN +16 327
#note I looked at this for a while and thought I saw a disconnected 9 in there.  I put the entire rack down, looked at the bingo, and realized that SIRLOIN only took one L.  Oh well.  Maybe not a good equity play (sim winner is 10B LIONS) but practically any legitimate play wins over 99% here.  If I'm going to hemorrhage equity, this is the time to do it.

>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOTY N6 MA.IE +30 509
#note N5 AY is the sim winner; this play is 4th.  Don't know why I played MAVIE instead of MOVIE, but this worked out nicely.

#note Becky told me after the game she was pretty sure DIOLE* was bad but she was trying to block my out.  I still had good options even if she did block.
