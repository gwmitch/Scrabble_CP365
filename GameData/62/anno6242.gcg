#note K6 FORAGE!  But I do benefit from this mistake...sort of.

#note In this position it initially took me a while to see the non-bingo 2x2 TEARING, but then I didn't like the vowel placement next to the F6 TL.  So I fiddled, fiddled, and fiddled, and found this.  I was was SO proud of myself for this find because not only did it solve the vowel placement problem, but I thought she might not know the back-hook and I could hook my other E the next turn!  In other words, I knew the bingo, had the 7th tile in my rack, and didn't put it down.  On the count of three:  one...two...three...<<FACE PALM>>

#note My father is a golf fanatic and I thought this was a legitimate compound word.  Honest. The legit bingos here are TErMITE, TEaTIME (which I thought was 2 words) , EMITTEr, and EMITTEd.  The only thing this drew out of Laurie was a compliment on a nice find.

#note Looks like I'm not concentrating too hard, am I?  As unfathomably poor as this play is - DAMNS L4 wins the sim - I'm still at 95%. At least if I have to hemorrhage equity, I'm picking the right time to do it.

#note Yet another bingo - AMATOLS - I don't know makes it into my rack.  Equity loss?  Don't ask.

#note Best bingo is 14B TRIADICS, which I didn't know.  I figured this  hook had sat there long enough.

#note OMG, is this good?  The game was over but I thought that I could get some more spread if I challenged this off.  And after thinking about it, curiosity got the better of me.  Yet another feather in my cap this game. <<unsuccessful challenge>>
