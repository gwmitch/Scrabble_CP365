>Jim_Burlant: EIKLNOW 8D WOKEN +32 32
#note This play sims interchangeably with 8D WELKIN and 8D WINKLE, neither of which I knew.
>Jesse_Wornum: AJM C7 JAM +36 36
>Jim_Burlant: CEIILUV E8 .CULI +14 46
#note Bleah. H7 UNCIVIL wins, with this choice finishing roughly 6 points down.  I'm at 43% winning chances here.  I ruled out any plays that didn't shed the U. 
>Jesse_Wornum: AR 9E .AR +15 51
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEIUV 11C VA.UE +8 54
#note I completely blanked here, all I saw was UVEA 7H and this play - pathetic. JAMBEAU wins the sim, but I was too blinded by having dumped a U and gotten a U back that same turn.
>Jesse_Wornum: CNORS H11 SCORN +39 90
>Jim_Burlant: BDEGIRZ D11 .BIDE +26 80
#note 10D BUG wins, but I didn't see that.  Nor did I see REAWOKEN.
>Jesse_Wornum: ELO C11 .OLE +26 116
>Jim_Burlant: DGIPRUZ 7G PUG +21 101
>Jesse_Wornum: DII 14G I.ID +9 125
>Jim_Burlant: DEINRUZ K11 DIZEN +36 137
#note Phony.  REAWOKEN is best, but I never saw this extension any time this game. 
>Jesse_Wornum: GGQVWYY -GGVWQYY +0 125
>Jim_Burlant: BNORTUW L10 WOT +19 156
#note Despite my blundering, I'm still at 56% winning chances here.  As poorly as I've been playing to this point on day 2 (rounds 1 - 4 were Friday evening and this is now Saturday morning), I needed to be lucky because I sure wasn't playing well at all.  And Jesse's next play should tell you that I wasn't going to have much luck in this one.
>Jesse_Wornum: ?AERRSS M6 eRASERS +70 195
>Jim_Burlant: ABENNRU 8L B.NE +27 183
#note I saw URBANE and didn't like it because of what it did to the board; it killed the S hook on PUG and created a board that would be way too easy for Jesse to defend.  Right now I'm at 29% winning chances.  L4 UNBAN, which I didn't know, probably would have been best.
>Jesse_Wornum: ?EFIPTV N6 FE. +28 223
>Jim_Burlant: AENPRTU I13 P.U +17 200
#note Forget about REAWOKEN, which I'm blind to.  TOPAZ 13G wins the sim, but do you think I saw that given how I'm playing today?
>Jesse_Wornum: OT D6 TO. +15 238
>Jim_Burlant: AEGINRT 14B G.. +10 210
#note Obviously he's got the S...all I could see was this because I was blind to REAWOKEN.  Pathetic.
>Jesse_Wornum: AELV A12 VEAL +39 277
>Jim_Burlant: AEINQRT E5 QI +24 234
#note Whiffing on QINTAR, which would have scored 55.

#note I have nothing to say.
>Jesse_Wornum: OSY J2 YO.S +31 341
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHIRT 9B E. +4 278
#note At this point I stopped annotating.  A horrendously played game by me.  Final score 321 - 392.
