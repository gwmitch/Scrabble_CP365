#note This leaves the legitimate choices in the dust.  Peter held this and, after almost 3 minutes, let it go.  He told me after the game he did so because he wasn't sure, he thought it seemed plausible, and it gave him his comeback play.

#note I can only play what I know...and I had no clue there were any bingos (a 7 and a handful of 8's) in this rack. All I could see to do was dump the W and go on from there.  10F COWbIND wins the sim at 90%.  This play sims at 84%.
>Peter_Huszgah: EELOORT 10D RETOOLE. +63 106
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEINNQ 12K .INCE +22 126
#note I didn't like this play, but felt that 22 points were too much to turn down, especially since I was sitting on the blank.  7F QI is apparently the play; with the duplicates I felt it more important to turn tiles to get out of this rack.   
>Peter_Huszgah: ILV O12 .VIL +21 127
>Jim_Burlant: ?DNOQSS 14N Q. +22 148
#note Now no choice - dump the Q.  This is best.

#note DACRONS scores 2 more; I liked this for defense. I'm at 84%.
>Peter_Huszgah: ILY H12 I.LY +27 202
>Jim_Burlant: AAABEGT O4 ABA +10 262
#note Whoops - realized right after I'd hit my clock that I missed BAA in the same spot.  Quackle prefers this play at 7F, with 9H BA (which I didn't see) winning the sim.  Not sure I would have played it if I had seen it; I can't see playing for 16 and keeping duplicated A's.  I'm at 75% with this choice.

>Jim_Burlant: AEERRTU D6 TRUE. +6 278
#note Crucial miss - probably the game-deciding play.  What do you do here if you don't know that you have an 8 (URETRAL) in your rack?  All I could come up with was the old standby:  turn some tiles and hasten the end of the game and hopefully draw out of this nonsense.  Normally I'd want to keep AERT together, but with TTTT still unseen, I figured I could afford to part with the T.  Best non-bingo play is 14F RULE.  I didn't see that spot until much later in the game.  
>Peter_Huszgah: EENV 8A VEN.E +24 245
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEGRS C3 RAGA +12 290
#note Quackle prefers C7 ANA or M2 AA.  I only saw E4 AGA and didn't like it because of the unseen Z.  I also didn't like C4 AGA; even though I had the R, there were still 2 R's unseen and I thought I could get burned by putting AGA down.
>Peter_Huszgah: JW 4B J.W +26 271
>Jim_Burlant: AEEISUZ B7 S.IZE +34 324
#note Perhaps panic setting in?  I'd been unable to put any points on the board for 3 turns and felt that I needed to take the points.  Quackle thinks the best play is E13 CUE, presumably to set up my Z for the next turn.  The big question - would row 15 have stayed alive if I had played CUE?
>Peter_Huszgah: ABIMT A11 AMBIT +38 309
>Jim_Burlant: AEERTUU 14F RU.E +13 337
#note Death rack.  Quackle says the best plays are I8 PULE, J13 RUE, E13 CUE and exchange EUU.  I don't think any of them would have helped.  I needed to block the D on row 2 but couldn't see anything to unload the U and block that didn't give him a clear shot at row 1.  If I block row 2 with AE O1, what do I do next turn with ERTUU?
