#note Okay, this one starts good, but is really pretty ugly.  You probably shouldn't watch.  You've been warned!  (Bernardina overtook me in spread to play Winter in the finals for first.  I win and he loses by enough, I get second.)

>Ryan_Fischer: DEMNOOT --  -74 110
#note I... really don't know why I just didn't play the valid bingo.  I got it confused with NOONTIDE.  Dumb.  Just dumb.  But again, why is it my phonies never get any traction?  I've seen more ridiculous stuff let go all the time.
>Anne_Hay: IX D11 XI +31 75
#note EGyPTIA(N) 2x2 90.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEMNOOT 8A MOON.D +33 143

#note EGyPTIA(N) 2x2 for 90

#note H(O)W leaving ERSTT?  Hmm...  Well, for 7 less it might be worth it.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEKNOST 11J KOA +23 260
#note Well, this is best, but I don't know if I like it in hindsight.  Trying to obscure the DOGEYS hook.

>Ryan_Fischer: EISTTVY B6 ...TY +25 311
#note I thought this was cute -- blocks the M, scores decently, balances.  But, it does open the triple.  Q says TIVY.  Maybe.
>Anne_Hay: AEILNP A10 ALPINE +38 293
#note Wonder what the 7s tile was.  This is grief I could do without.  But she's less of a threat to bingo now.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIILSTV C12 LIVE +17 328
#note 2A VI(S) 12?  Hmm...  Some Es still out.
>Anne_Hay: ORW O1 .ROW +13 306
#note When she did that, I really thought I had it locked down.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AISSTU L10 ...S +13 341
#note N9 ITS 28 is safe now.  I was just trying to see if she'd make a mistake that I could pounce on.  Instead, I got pounced.
>Anne_Hay: O 13E .O +3 309
#note ...
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AFISTU 3G F. +9 350
#note I saw FUSTIc in my head on the drive home.  It would've locked things up nicely.  FUSTIAN/FISTULA (saw FISTULA when I typed in the rack).  No go, no need anyway.  But this, what happens now, is just painful.
>Anne_Hay: F 15C .F +9 318
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAISTU 2J .U.I +18 368
#note I'm oblivious to the lane she's created, thinking GO was just a fish.  What a prayer.  Crazy thing is, I had her tracked as EELORST which would've gone down there too.  Major now or something.  Q finds 11C A(XI)Al 19 for the block.  Yay...
>Anne_Hay: AEELRST G9 RELATES +64 382
#note I was gonna play SATAy to go out, but NOOO, she had to bingo out and then do a little dance.  Ugh.
