>Camela_Hicks: BOUY 8G BUOY +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: AEFGNUW 9I FEW +27 27
#note Best.  While I'd normally prefer to unload the U due to all the asynergy it creates with so many tiles, this scored too much to turn down.
>Camela_Hicks: IMNT 10F MINT +18 36
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGNUY 11D GUY +21 48
#note Didn't know GUANAY, couldn't think of YUGA. -5.0
>Camela_Hicks: DEERV H10 .ERVED +33 69
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEEHN D10 A.A +8 56
#note D10 AGHA wins; I preferred to keep the H for some balance.  15D AAHED sims well but I don't like shutting down row 15 while I'm trailing.  But it would have prevented her next play.
>Camela_Hicks: FIORX 14D FOXI.R +32 101
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEHIN 13E HE +19 75
#note Geez.  I see HE and I can't find HEAVE?  Somebody, please wake me up!  Interestingly - despite my giving up 14 points on the scoreboard, I only lost 7 equity for this way-too-fishy play. 
>Camela_Hicks: CEELNOQ -CEEL +0 101
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEINN 13H .ENEtIAN +75 150
#note Her exact words as this came down:  "Blinding!"  I swear I'm not making this up.  Anyway - the best bingo here is DECENNIA, which I didn't know and would have played at 15H.  But this doesn't exactly work out too badly...
>Camela_Hicks: EO K9 .OE +12 113
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADGIPS O8 PAdDI.GS +158 308
#note Camela had spent a LONG time on that last turn before she fished off her O and E...and I was sure hoping I wasn't about to get zinged with a 3x3.  When I saw this, I was relieved.  DAMPINGS also plays here.
>Camela_Hicks: ADDSTUZ -  +0 113
#note <<lost challenge>>
>Jim_Burlant: BEKLORS N6 BLOKE +32 340
#note The game is clinched, of course, but any number of plays are as good as anything else here equity-wise.  This is one of them.
>Camela_Hicks: AEILRST C4 REALIST +61 174
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRSZ B6 ZA +64 404
#note She was putting her bingo down from the T back up and I was hoping she would have hit DUELIST so I could have put down SUZERAIN...ah, well.
>Camela_Hicks: IPT A7 PIT +20 194
#note Inncorrectly scored as 18.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEINRS D7 ED +16 420
#note Quackle prefers thatI play  15A DINE for 24. With the high probability that I draw into another bingo, why break this rack up?
>Camela_Hicks: IQ O5 QI +15 209
>Jim_Burlant: EINORSU 10B U.. +5 425
#note I'm greedy, I admit it.
>Camela_Hicks: CEMOT 15A COMET +42 251
#note Maybe this is why I should have played DINE 15A a couple of turns back.
>Jim_Burlant: EINORSS E2 SENIORS +75 500
#note Best bingo.
