#note Quackle likes VIE with the slightly vowel heavy leave, but I preferred this, not only to balance the rack but also to create more bingo lanes.  (Two on column C and row 6.)
>Looby: BCEEL C3 CELEB +31 142
>Dave: BEFIRSY C9 BRIEF +35 147
#note FEY B4 is a nice alternative, although it does give back some play on row A.
>Looby: DEIINRU 11F UN.IDIER +68 210
>Dave: DHILSVY O12 H..D +36 183
#note HIVED might be a little better than this, but it's good to take the O15 spot out, because one of us is bound to score well with it at some point.

#note Need to restudy the sixes.  The anagram of this is the right play.

#note I thought that WEN B12 made high scoring plays to the triple easier than this.

#note A tough spot here.  I saw some column J bingoes, but I wanted to do more with both blanks than that.  (Probably would have played the one with two blank I's.)  I couldn't find the only bingo from the E, but it only scores one more point.  I figured with this leave I had a good shot to draw something from 1A or maybe something to hook MAVIES.  As I found out after the game, my intended bingo would have given him ORDNANCE for a double double.  If I had found the better play at A1 earlier, this would have worked out radically better for me.

#note I took too long on this play, which started to get me into time trouble in the endgame.  Up to this point I had managed to move pretty fast and kept things close with Looby on the clock.  TRANQ is pretty close to hopeless.  Although the score is close, it's bad endgame timing.   With him on the move in a 7 vs. 6 endgame, he's likely to go out first for the win.

>Dave: AINOQRT M2 QA.I +28 419
#note Neither I nor Quackle can find a way for me to win here.  Objectively best is QINTAR M6, followed by JUGA/ARM, and OR 3M for a 441-430 loss.  I spent most of my remaining time on this play and had less than a minute for the rest, which is a bit of a shame because it's a really interesting, intricate endgame.
>Looby: ALNRT 2M .AT +24 447
#note LEARNT to go out is best.  This move lets me catch up a lot, but not quite enough.
>Dave: NORT 15A ON +17 436
#note EYER immediately is best, to threaten the good scoring out of NOTA J1.  Best play is then YEN, AT/AT, RAT/RE, and ON for a 456-460 loss.
>Looby: LNR 3H ..N +8 455
#note Now he should play EYER.
>Dave: RT 6A ...R +14 450
#note RAT here makes it 447-455, but I was just blitzing my moves at this point.
>Looby: LR N1 L.R +5 460

#note My time remaining: 0:31.  Looby's: 1:58.
