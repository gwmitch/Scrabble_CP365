#note Q likes it, tho the leave is atrocious.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: DI F8 .ID +10 130
#note 8B DI(HYBRID) 20 -- cool.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIINNSU E10 IN +7 192
#note 11B ENNUI is definitely the play.  I was going to exchange if she didn't open, but I wanted to score and make it harder for her to hook a bingo.  Epic fail.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEINOSU F4 O.D +15 207
#note This move really creates trouble later -- so oops.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEINSUU 12J UNAU +10 217
#note And suddenly, I'm in a spot of trouble.  I'm not sure if this play was too bright -- what else to do, though?

#note Ugh!
>Teresa_Schaeffer: MRU 11J RUM +21 273
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILSTT C9 T. +6 233
#note Probably shouldn't fish to AEILST, but whatev.  Q has a buncha better two-tile fishes.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: ILRTW 14J TWIRL +26 299
#note Now this game has just turned into a big ol' luck fest.  Let's watch!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILOST 14A ISOLATE +73 306
#note Got it!  Gotta obstruct things down low, but I'm really not obstructing much at all.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: FK A13 K.F +30 329
>Ryan_Fischer: EJORSTY 15H JOY +47 353
#note What a sitch-e-ation!  Gotta pass up JOYS for 78 'cause it empties the bag.  200 ratings points ago, I would have slapped that down without a second thought and watched my opponent bingo out.  So, JOY it is!  And then I come back with an S play off TWIRL if all goes well.  Right?  RIGHT?!

>Teresa_Schaeffer: ?ACDILR --  -78 329
>Ryan_Fischer: AEENRST -  +0 353
#note Well, I know her rack.  I know the G is in the bag.  I could fish for some strange garnets and the like, but not without giving her a place.  Not worth it.  I didn't think she'd find anything is the thing.  So it didn't cross my mind to play something to the L and block.  Which is what I should've done, 'cause this game is still highly losable.  Q just doesn't get this game.  The champ doesn't think to block.  I think RENA(L) would do the trick, and doing an actual sim wins 90+% of the time.  Wonder why not 100%?  In the time I had left, I couldn't figure out what to do, so I passed (quite stupidly -- I didn't think she'd see anything, but there are things I should've blocked instead of going for a stalemate.
