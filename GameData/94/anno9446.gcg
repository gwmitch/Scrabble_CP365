#note Lots of options here. In the high-scoring department, there's (D)EJEcT O10. One major point I forgot to seriously consider is that Nick (oops, William!) usually has a pretty good rack after VERT. I liked this because it set up a good spot for bingoing with my Es. In fact, this seems conducive to Billy having a good rack because it opens another spot for me to bingo in if he does.
