#note C9 STRATAL 75.  Ugh.  #10693.  Juuust outta common range for me.  LATH, but I didn't wanna open an X spot.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EFIJNTU C10 J.NE +33 73
>Ryan_Fischer: AFIPRST H10 AFRITS +32 50
#note B13 FA 15?  I knew I shouldn't have broken up this rack, but was being impatient.  E4 FAIT(H) 22 is another option.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EFGINTU 12H .EFUTING +78 151
#note Well, at least I'm not giving him anything he didn't already have.

#note Pretty: E5 QOP(H)S 40!  Also: that same damn Q bomb spot I'd miss!

>Ryan_Fischer: ?NOOOQW -OOOQW +0 231
#note Looks like I just got his crap!  And TOTALLY missed the big-ass Q spot for 42.  Wow.  Q likes trading the O, but really, I'm better off keeping one vowel in case I draw none as is what happens.
>Matthew_Bernardina: DDEEISS O14 DE +21 309
#note E10 E(L)D 22.  This is better defensively, obviously.  Knowing the full rack, it's O1 IDES 31 (or DIES); S(H)IE(L)D E7 30.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BLLNRY J3 B.RYL +18 249
>Matthew_Bernardina: DEHIOSS 13K DOS. +21 330
#note O1 HODS 40.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ELNOSV 6A eLEVONS +70 319
#note Perhaps sLOVENS or O1 VOES 37?  I had an inkling somewhere that I remembered that RAVELING did take an S, but then GRAVELING and TRAVELING would be out.  Of note, too, is VO(UDO)N for 20.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AEHINSW A4 WE.NS +33 363
#note Champ says WH(e)EN for 42 is 96% to win.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGIIKQU H1 AQU. +39 358
#note If there were 9 tiles unseen, I(F) J11 might be an option, setting up my K with my Q to go elsewhere.  As it is, it's grim.  AQU(A) is the best play (as I thought, with like 12 minutes to deliberate), but it's only a 15% shot to win.  I'd pretty much need the X to be in the bag, I think.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AHINPUX 7A .IX +37 400
#note NIX is right, setting up WHAUP.
>Ryan_Fischer: GIIKO F4 GI. +17 375
#note Blocking WHAUP.  Whoo, I played an endgame right.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AHNPU L1 UNH.P +10 410
#note Excellent.  Many moves are 100%.  This is the first that loses both the H and P.  3L HA 18 is champ's choice.  I don't think I can go out from that.
