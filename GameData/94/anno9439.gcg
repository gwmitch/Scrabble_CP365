#note I knew I was fucking this up. You might even say I SCRUTINIZED this play. I even saw TYR(O)NIC after the game. I'm not really *too* upset about this because it's the kind of thing I wont miss once I've studied it as an alphagram. There's just so many permutations of possible bingos to look at, I just didn't really anagram the rack. Yet somehow I end up with the completely common BUTYRIC. fail.

#note I welcome suggestions here. My play is bad. I should have made a better fish. After the first two racks, and this being the 4th tough game of the day out of 4 games, I just didn't have the energy to think it through, and as a result made a bad play. Gotta push through.

#note If I can have a better leave, maybe I have an outside shot, but I think I'm pretty toast here. Quackle nows me and says V(I)G for 11 wins 1/12. I guess thats possible.

#note Yet again no time left. I figured the only way I could win was to have Nick spaz and challenge a word, and have it be good. I was pretty sure this was phony, but wanted to give myself a chance. As it turns out, I still would've lost by a few. Oh well.

#note Probably one of the worst games I've played in a tourney this year. Not acceptable. Other two games were uninteresting / I didn't write anything down. These 4 were what mattered.
