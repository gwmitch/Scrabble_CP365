#note What would you do?  Champ says AGO then this.  I whiffed.  I figured xAO would be next.  It is.

#note Right idea, didn't extend it.  (TAX)ATION.
>Steve_Bush: GHIN 6C NIGH +30 72
>Ryan_Fischer: EEINNOT J9 NO +9 43
#note Still TAXATION.  Champ prefers NE here, or NEO(N).

>Ryan_Fischer: BDFILOV 11J BOVID +27 176
#note Champ prefers this placement just barely, at 4.06% win pct running a many ply sim.  Gonna take a miracle to come back.  BIFOLD is another, uglier option.
>Steve_Bush: PRU 2J PR.U +12 270
#note Well, that could be a break...
>Ryan_Fischer: EFIJLOS 3G J.FE +30 206
#note Hehe, JO(W)LE(D) would just make things worse.  You'll see.  I'm fine with JEFE.

#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIKLOSS O11 SKIES +54 260
#note Lotsa goodies left, gotta roll the dice.  Champ likes SOL(O) for 27.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?ANOSUZ 14J ZONUl. +68 343
#note Okay, so Champ says just take the bingo.  I figured I needed to bingo twice, which is why I took ZONUl(E), leaving AS.  I can still hook NOB, OR I can come under the Z with my A.  ZOUAv(E) mighta been better with the As left, but the pool is consonant heavy.
>Steve_Bush: RT K10 R.T +5 414
>Ryan_Fischer: AAACESS 15G CASA +29 372
#note Aw.  And the pool looked so good too!  10M AE 11 leaves CASAS to go out.
