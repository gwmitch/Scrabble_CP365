#note 8F is obviously better. This is a less than random rack because I overdrew by about 20 as a joke, and ended up with these tiles. I do this to XP every now and then referring to the time when Stu overdrew against him and had 13 tiles on his rack. That's my excuse.

#note XP tried DJITTERY#, which is Arabic Scrabble. It didn't stay. I think he forgot that once he put down DJITTERY he could still make another play. In his defense, it was game 5, getting late, and we were all tired. TI(N)Y or (K)ITTED seem fine.

#note Storyline: See the main issue here is that I said out loud that I wasn't sure if UNWINGED was good. I thought it might've been # (it is). I'm pretty sure I somehow came across it on Zyzzyva in the last two or so days (while studying # words), and somehow the memory stuck with me. Funny how memory works. Dunno if XP would've challenged if I hadn't said anything, but heck, I've got bingos in two other spots. I think it's a good play if I don't state my unsurety ahead of time (and my only inkling was that I thought I'd seen it be #, maybe).

#note GLaSSIE makes the game a tossup, though as it turns out would've given me a spot. But c'mon XP, everyone knows the anagram of SINGLES is GINLESS! :)
>dacrON: AEELPRU 13B PU.E +16 282
#note I'm not good at making plays with full knowledge of opponents rack. I failed to learn from this position because I didn't go through all his possible bingos. PUCE allows SLEIGhS - a tough find, but one I should notice. My goal was to force him to open a triple for me to come back with, but I can't always score well next turn with AELR leave. ECU blocks all the 70+ bingos, keeps PEARL for next turn, a great leave, and a scoring tile to come back with next turn. Really gotta put in the effort and not get lazy here. Just stupid of me.

#note flip the O around for 8 more. XP didn't want to empty the bag, and was going for a potential OUT- bingo at B3. Quackle says it's looking hopeless no matter what.
>dacrON: EELOOPR 15J LOOPER +31 382
#note I mistracked, and didn't manage to fix it in my retracking. I suspect that if this had been a tournament I'd have gotten it right, and noticed there was an O in the bag. He can still have O(U)TLEADS, if I don't block it. The best way to do this, says champ, is OP at B1, which even enables me to draw some bingos (which will of course get blocked). Still, PEO(P)LE seals the deal, which I'd have played if I had taken the time to track right. But since my retracked pool showed no bingos remaining, I didn't bother blocking. Also I think I knew he had the F anyway. But still, not a bad exercise.
