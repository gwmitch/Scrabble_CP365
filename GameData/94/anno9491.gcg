#note Yeah, XP blocked awesomesauce. One downside to this play is that it keeps a good leave but a bad board for it. The other leaves, with Gs, were much worse, so I chose this reluctantly.

#note Fun! HEaDIER and RE(PAVED) might be better, but this seemed cool, and the difference was marginal.

#note Conrad pointed out XP's critical miss of SWIZ.

#note Again, I might exchange too much, but I just wasn't sure where the Q was going after HORN, and I didn't love playing with six tile racks. I get way to afraid of bad leaves, and this might be an important weakness to check out.

#note OFA(Y) is also reasonable. This gave me an awesomer play tho :D.

#note He's got drek and I have some good X spots, so this seemed reasonable. ROW is probably even better.
