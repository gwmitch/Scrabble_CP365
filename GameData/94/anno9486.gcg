#note VARIA is the one i was looking for. oops. I was all excited to discuss this rack, but Quackle shuts me down...

#note UNHORSE...
>dacrON: ACIMRUY F4 YUM +26 40
#note Lots of choices here! YUM, MAY, CUMARI(N), etc. YU# would've come in handy here - should've asked Isaac to play ycollins#.
>Isaac: ADILOSY 11A SOLIDA.Y +74 140
#note almost played SYNODIAL*, chickened out on HYALOIDS.
>dacrON: AACEIIR C9 CI.IA +20 60

#note We were in fact ZARLESS# because Zar decided to work instead.

#note Probably should've just dropped the F, since Isaac likes offense, and may not block the B. In hindsight, maybe using the S to make a play from H1 is the best idea?
>Isaac: ?EGINOR O6 sO.ERING +61 429
#note (B)OwERING is the play.
>dacrON: DEEINRS B14 ED +13 335
#note and I finally had a bingo, too. Pretty much given up here, just trying to give myself two shots at the G to cut spread at 2L.

#note sure champ, i'll fish. lolz.
>Isaac: GIOTTUW H1 TOUG. +33 480
#note 1N TI V sticks me. This is best of the non V-sticks though, and it's just a casual game.
>dacrON: INNPRV N1 V.R +9 370
#note right, I don't have to play the V lol. 8 less.
>Isaac: ITW 1H .WIT +7 487
#note Curious as to where I could improve my chances of coming back here. Don't think I played all that badly though. Any sage wisdom?
