>me: DEHNRRU 8H RUDER +14 14
#note HN is a pretty lousy leave. NURD, URN and DUH top the sim.
>them: RWY M6 WRY +20 20
>me: AAEHNOS 9I HO +21 35
#note Didn't know RUDERY, held and released. 5K AHA is best, I didn't even think of the WRY hook til the drive home.
>them: ABW 10J WAB +31 51
>me: AAELNOS L10 .OA +10 45
#note Again with the WRY hook.I saw the DOW(N) hook but couldn't find the scoring play- 11G ALONE is best. I think the fish is OK this early, but it's going to fail me repeatedly...
>them: CM 11K M.C +22 73
>me: AEELLNS M11 .EL +12 57
#note Fish fail #2. (sims best though.)
>them: ?AFILOR 6G AIRFLO.s +71 144
>me: AELNPSS -  +0 57
#note Held and challenged. Looked like it should have been two words. Darn. Plus I wasn't 100% on my own bingo.

>me: AELNPSS 14H NAPLESS +86 143
#note I'm back in it!

#note That didn't last long.
>me: AEINOTX 14B TAXI +35 178
#note 15K OX, duh. Scores 1 point more and leaves AEINT. Rushed this one.

>me: DEGINOO N2 GOOD. +12 190
#note Looked for a A column play but didn't see/know OOGENY, GOONEY, DINGEY. My logic was 'open up the board when you're down', but it was for too few points and used too many tiles. Looks to me like this is the point where I threw away any chance of coming back.

#note Rewarded with drawing three vowels. Probably should have exchanged. 
>them: HKL D9 H.LK +22 312
>me: EEEINTT I12 TE.. +5 208
#note Fish fail #3. Was trying to leave E column and 2/3 row open. E4 TENTIE tops sim, which I don't get.
>them: EOQRU E5 ROQUE +33 345
>me: EEEINNT O4 NE +9 217
#note C'mon! Fourth fish is the charm... as long as he leaves the top open.
>them: BIM F9 MIB +17 362
#note M3 BI is the blocking play (with the 3 tiles I know about). 
>me: ?AEEINT 2H INTErA.E +60 277
#note Luckily I found the only playable bingo.
>them: GZ H1 Z.G +39 401
>me: ADGIRTT D3 DRAG +17 294
#note OK, anyone want to try and figure out which letter I should play off for the long shot 8 letter out bingo (if he doesn't block the spot)? I think there are two answers, though I'd still lose. I'll post the answer on the blog later.
