#note 6I (F)EU 8 says Champ.  COTEAU is a little too volatile.

#note Champ likes this best.  It was between this and DUPED for me.  DUPED gave too much back, I figured.  DUDE is a decent option, too.

#note PAYS is cute, but probably won't be enough to catch him.  PATY at least gives me a fighting chance...

#note Saw B(I)MA, it surrenders.  Although, even if I bingo it won't catch him.  It's the principle.  BU(N)N for 12 is Champ's top choice.  I guess to go out quickly.  Mine fishes for UNBEARS.  First saw MANURES/SURNAME, but it wouldn't go down.
