>James: DGIIMUY 8G GUY +14 14
#note Tricky - I can see the benefit of exchanging instead of playing but DIIM is so-so (and the ability to play it all off as IMID or MIDI is worth it, as is the chance to play a hook off MI) and so I decided to go for it. 
>Chris_: CGIOR 7I ORGIC +18 18
>James: DGIILMN 6C MILDING +72 86
#note Best - only bingo, only spot. 
>Chris_: AAEL 5C ALAE +21 39
>James: DDEHLLS L4 DEL.SH +22 108
#note I missed LAMEDH C4 - that would've definitely been the standout play. Otherwise, it's hard to decide if you want to play tiles and draw more or exchange (like exch DDLS or DHLS). As it is, I went with DELISH to play off and hold DL while blocking some easier bingo lanes (off ED, through the G or I, etc) while creating some slightly harder ones (the D) or more dangerous ones (off the H). Had Chris not played ALAE, I'd have played SHILLED D4 actually, just to get rid of so many tiles. 
>Chris_: AEW K5 WA.E +30 69
>James: DELNTUX 4F LUX +22 130
#note Miss - EXULT M9 scores better. The DENT leave of LUX is attractive but it's not worth 10 less points, particularly since EXULT's leave of DN is fairly good to draw to given there are no more Ds and only 4 Ns to deal with. 
>Chris_: IMN H1 MIN. +39 108
>James: ?DEINTU 1H .UTiNIED +83 213
#note Well, this worked out better than I thought. This scores best and leaves far less lanes than UNSUITED or UNUNITED H8. 
>Chris_: AAKP 7B KAPA +25 133
>James: EEIRSTV 8A VISE +43 256
#note Best - the use of the S is justified since it dumps the V and the best non-S play (VET M3) scores 21. 

I was going to play LIVERIEST D5 had Chris not played there too... good thing, since LIVERIEST isn't good. Pity - I thought it might be. 
>Chris_: AV B7 ..VA +13 146
>James: CEEERST 11B SECRETE +80 336
#note Best - only place for a bingo. 
>Chris_: IR F2 RI... +8 154
>James: AABNOOS M9 ABOON +22 358
#note I was more interested in blocking Chris's chances to bingo, hence ABOON. OBA 10E is the better scoring play with a nicer looking leave (ANOS instead of NS). 
>Chris_: ?EJZ L12 JEeZ +78 232
>James: AABHSWY 10F WAB +35 393
#note WAB is best - I keep SHY N8 or something else at N10 in future. And there's no play at the Z. 
>Chris_: FIRT 15H FRIT. +51 283
>James: AHNRSTY N8 THY +41 434
#note Best - good leave and I have the case S and A for HAHA and HAHS. 
>Chris_: Q J14 Q. +31 314
>James: AEENNRS O4 RENNASE +98 532
#note Best.
