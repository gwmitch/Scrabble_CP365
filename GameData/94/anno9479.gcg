#note 4K WELSH 41?  Lotsa plays keeping two Vs.  I didn't want to subject myself to that.  Q prefers keeping the L and/or H.
>Robin_LaPrelle: IO 4K OI +12 65
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEJNSU I3 JE.. +19 120
#note UNFIX or SUBFIX before ditching the J, apparently.  I'd get it next turn.

#note H10 SEMINA or SIMIAN 39?  5D BI 8.  Champ's top 3 there.  I split the difference with PIMA which is 8th for Champ.  She's close to a bingo.  I want to, too, but I'm hoping mine will even play considering how the board looks.  Maybe if she hits and I miss I can score big on column A.
>Robin_LaPrelle: ?AENRSW 12H WANtERS +82 178
#note K8 UNSWEAR and ANSWERS are 84
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEIINS H12 .INE +21 193
#note Yup, it's that kind of weekend.
>Robin_LaPrelle: AAINORT 15G A.RATION +59 237
#note That kind of weekend.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEILS 5B CA.LE +18 211
#note I didn't want to take the S spot juuuust yet.  Figured I could put it off one more turn, try one more time to bingo on M or N.  This is the highest simming play that doesn't spend the S.  CA(S)EI(N), while cute, won't win the game.
>Robin_LaPrelle: CEHTT A11 TETCH +35 272
#note Whoops, thisz bogus.  TETCHY, but no TETCH*!  How irritable.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIRSUV O13 VIS +45 256
#note Okay, now I gotta take it.  The right play is to know all the words, challenge off that phony, and then take this.
>Robin_LaPrelle: GHOT C11 GOTH +20 292
>Ryan_Fischer: EEFORRU K9 REF. +28 284
#note #10159 - N5 FERREOU(S) 65(!)  Well, isn't that special?  Thought this was so clever.  This or FOE, if you don't see the bingo.  FURO(R)E is also an option.
>Robin_LaPrelle: BILL 14J BILL +28 320
>Ryan_Fischer: EELORSU C1 LEU +10 294
#note 14A (C)O(H)ERE 26 (was available previously, too). Nowhere on Champ's radar this time.  B4 E(C)U 7.  Risky, though.  And only one place to go.  LEU is 2nd.  Force her to take that spot and leave mine alone, or the triple is mine.
>Robin_LaPrelle: DEW 1A WE.D +30 350
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EIKORS 3L KI +20 314
#note Surprisingly, KI doesn't show up that high.  For a human, dealing with these two spots is a bit more daunting than for a computer, especially for the junk unseen.  I didn't know dROSKIE(S), but wouldn't play it if I did.  I really doubt KO(A) is best as Champ says considering how EASY it is for the opponent to block the S as long as s/he has a vowel and the V.
>Robin_LaPrelle: DGIRUV N1 VID +22 372
#note Partial rack.  Given what I had, DRUG at N3 looks like it'd do.  She put it down at N2 first, but picked it up.  I'd have the same trouble in her spot.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EORSTY O3 STOREYs +89 403
#note Just had to do a bit of a gut check -- was I really sure of STOREYs?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was.  STROYED or STROYER, too.  Or any number of things to the S.  So I started out this game really unlucky only to get a big break when things looked hopeless.  Not par for the course on the weekend, but I'll take it.
