>Lilia: EEEIOOU 8F IRID +10 10
>James: ABDKLTT F7 B.LK +20 20
#note Goals: to score fairly well and to hold onto a rack that could be built upon. ADTT isn't the strongest leave; to that extend, playing BATTIK leaving DL or DIKTAT leaving BL are better but I missed them. 
>Lilia: EEEOOSU 7H QI +27 37
>James: ADRSTTU 6I DAUT +12 32
#note DAUT was played to draw more letters and hold onto the S. Choices like DUST or DAUTS (making BILKS) are okay as well because they score well. At this point, I thought the game was too early to play off an S for 8-9 points. 
>Lilia: ABENS 11B BEANS +25 62
>James: GMMORST C6 GROMM.TS +84 116
#note Only bingo - best. 
>Lilia: FNNRRTX K5 J.RAL +24 86
>James: AEIILTV 12A VI.AE +34 150
#note I missed AVAIL 8K. Strangely, VITAE is favored slightly more by Quackle. Mostly, it's because AVAIL is said to give too many extra openings and allow for a slightly higher average return play (no matter that the V is placed out to the triple). Between the two plays, I think AVAIL is better but can see the argument for VITAE, because an opening is created for a 7 that favors me (as I already have a T).
>Lilia: EFNNRTX A12 .UGH +33 119
>James: EFILPTU 8A FL.P +36 186
#note Best. 
>Lilia: ENT 13E TEN +7 126
>James: EGIOTUY L8 GOUTY +29 215
#note GUYOT L2 is slightly favored by Quackle, because of the better leave (EIT v EI). At this point, I favor GOUTY for the most part because I will have blocked up a few bingo spots with the play. However, if I was down or if I had a massive lead, GUYOT would be more useful to me since I would create openings to either come back or try for an even bigger lead. 
>Lilia: ENV 11I VEN. +14 140
>James: EHIIOPR 14F HEIR +30 245
#note I missed HERIOT L1, which is 5 more points. Both HERIOT and HEIR are potentially dangerous, as no blanks have been seen (but there have been no plays signalling one is in Lilia's hands, either). HEIR was a calculated risk because there are limited tiles (one F) that would do a lot of damage on playback, so I took the 30 to play off 4 tiles and see if that lane would get blocked up as well. Interesting play that Quackle suggests is OI B14, because it leaves some very good tiles to score with on the next turn. 
>Lilia: DZ J10 Z.D +33 173
>James: EINOPWY M7 YOW +31 276
#note Best move. To be cautious, NEW 15H might be a worthwhile consideration but most other considerations are not. 
>Lilia: ADEFOOU -ADEFO +0 173
>James: DEFINOR 15H FEOD +41 317
#note Best, but most decent plays at this point are close to guaranteeing a win.
>Lilia: AEX M12 AXE +25 198
>James: ?AILNPU N12 PULI +33 350
#note Missed PLUvIAN N2, sPINULA N1 and PINnULA in a variety of places. Of them, I would play PLUvIAN since even a bingo by Lilia using AGONE/AGONS wouldn't likely be enough to raise a major comeback. That being said, LUPIN N10 is recommended if one wants to hold onto A? (39 is a great score to hold onto good tiles for the future) and is also a very strong candidate over PULI. 
>Lilia: IO B14 OI +15 213
>James: ?ACENOT O6 OCTANEs +82 432
#note Smartest sound bingo, but jACONET N4 is interesting because it creates some fun O-column plays using AGONE that Lilia may not know. 
>Lilia: NS 15M S.N +20 233
>James: AACEINW N5 AW +26 458
#note Score well, don't open another lane, keep a good leave. 
>Lilia: OOR A5 ROO. +7 240
>James: ACEEINT 4L CANE +20 478
#note She can play fREESIA, which I missed. As such, playing TEA E5, leaving CINE in a few spots, looks to be in order. 
>Lilia: ?AEEIRS 4A pRAISE +17 257
