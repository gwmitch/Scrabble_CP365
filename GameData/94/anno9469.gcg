#note Best of the plays that use the Z.  I don't like hanging on to power tiles longer than a turn unless there's a good reason (or it's the X).  Q likes BORN 10B best.

#note 6G BAGN(I)O 29.  I liked how tight this was, juxtaposed with a redraw for JARGON or something better.  GOBAN, INBORN, and BOGAN are all options too.

#note Q likes this.  P(A)VED or C(A)VED are options too.  Not good ones.  I like this 'cause on the off chance I draw the L I have TRAMPLED for 48.

>Ryan_Fischer: CDEEHPU 15H .EUCH +16 285
#note Well, I missed some really good plays in trying to block row 15 and go for TRAMPLED again.  All the plays are over 90% to win, but why open one or two lanes with DEEP or CHEEP when instead I could close one of the remaining two?

#note O10 DIGEST 37.  Little easier for him to hit a bingo with that, though.  A lot easier, actually.
>Steve_Bush: AERSW H1 RESAW. +30 250
#note Gutsy!
>Ryan_Fischer: DGIIIOR 4D OIDI. +12 331
#note YUCK.  Now I've got a dilemma.  Need to block, but really don't have anything to do it with.  Really should've paid more attention to the pool and played GIST, I guess.  Or found DIGEST.  Champ finds (R)IGID and G(E)OID, two good blocks.  It rates RIGID higher, but I think GEOID makes it much harder to bingo.  OIDI(A) is 3rd.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEGIQRT M2 QAT +39 370
#note Okay, he's used 4 good tiles so it's likely he ran into the K, V, or Y and is in trouble.  But with those lines, he's still got a chance.  Champ says 3E QI 25 wins 99% -- sim says 82%.  Simple enough.  QAI(D) also wins 97%.  Wrong play, just got lucky.
>Steve_Bush: ?ADENTY 1B pEDANT.Y +63 346
#note He went over by a few seconds trying to find this.  2A ANDEsYT(E) 88 wins even with the time penalty.
