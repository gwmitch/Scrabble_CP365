>Mark: OOOOO -OOOOO +0 0
>James: AAFILTU 8D FAULT +24 24
#note FLAUTA 8D is worth considering because the U is usually not a desirable tile to hold on to, but the positioning of the resulting vowels just wasn't worth it. FLAUTA 8C alleviates that problem but for 4 less points I thought it wasn't worth it. 
>Mark: AEEIJTZ 9F PIA +15 15
>James: ACDEGIW 10H WIG +17 41
#note WAG 10H is favored, I guess because CDEI looks to be a better leave than ACDE. I'm not utterly convinced myself. 
>Mark: EEJOTYZ 11I TOEA +13 28
>James: ACDDEIX 12J AXED +41 82
#note Best - it scores well and while ADDAX L11 scores 3 more and may hold a slightly better leave (CEI to CDI), the positioning of the X is quite risky and invites Mark to make a strong return play. 
>Mark: AEFHJYZ -AEFHJYZ +0 28
>James: CCDEEIT 13E TICCED +21 103
#note After an exchange, I thought this could be a good move to start closing down the board. After it, I'd have a 75 point lead with one good and one poor bingo lane open. Other moves like CECA E5 are better to keep the board open but I'm not sure that's needed at this point. 
>Mark: EINORRS 14D TAD +17 45
>James: EGHJMPR 12D PEH +26 129
#note Quackle likes HEMP 7C more, which I agree is stronger in that it plays off more tiles and scores better. PEH was my way to force a bingo on the 15-row that needs an E in a restricted form (needs to start with E, SE or have some vowel-SE form in it) or to otherwise make sure it had to be played elsewhere. Also, from playing it, an O or U is useful go JOG or JUG. 
>Mark: EINORRS I2 ORIENTS +68 113
>James: GJMOQRU 11C JOG +36 165
#note Best - JORUM 11A scores more but it leaves the J open and I also forfeit my QU- combo. 
>Mark: LLOORRT 5C LIONIS.R +66 179
>James: GMMQRUZ D3 QU.Z +44 209
#note Best play. 
>Mark: AA 9C AA +8 187
>James: FGMMRVW 2G VR.W +18 227
#note Not the best move. Quackle likes CWM H13 most. The points outweigh the other considerations. VROW is competing with a bunch of exchanges of 5 or more tiles. VROW was played to try and gum up the board further. 
>Mark: BDEOORV 15F ENTAIL +26 213
>James: DFGMMOR M12 .ORM +14 241
#note Quackle likes exchanging most here (holding the D only). It makes sense because none of the moves are any good, and there is an especially sweet set of tiles left (SS?? among them). Mark has shown that he didn't have those or he'd have played a bingo last turn, which makes this choice more attractive. After a lot of deliberation, I played DORM because I was hoping to draw the last A and play GRAMS H1. On this board, that could go a long way to solving the game. 
>Mark: BEIOORV 6B BI.E +25 238
>James: DEFGMYY N13 FEY +34 275
#note Best - it scores well. There's no Ts, so a blank bingo along the O column would need the blank to be a T, which isn't super unlikely. Mark's play doesn't really lead me to believe he has much of anything at this point, though. 
>Mark: ELNO 15A LENO +18 256
>James: DEGHMNY 10L HYMN +24 299
#note After LENO, I wasn't sure what to think. Separately, both BIZE and LENO don't give any indications as to what may be in Mark's hand, and it may be that he's just making plays for the highest scoring tiles. However, after 7 played off tiles, I been sure he had to have a blank by now. However, maybe he was tailoring his rack for something other than the tiles I would play with HYMN, so I went on to play that, playing to H1 be damned. 
>Mark: ABO 9M BOA +24 280
>James: DEEGKSV K5 SEG +26 325
#note Wow. BOA was a signal that Mark didn't have good bingo tiles yet either, indicating he likely didn't have either blank. As such, I was looking to play for 3 tiles and save DREKS O8 so that I would have a good chance to outrun his bingo. Quackle has an even better setup for that - GANEV O8 keeps DREKS as well and scores another 13 points while taking out a line to a triple. 
>Mark: ??ENRSU 6K .N +2 282
>James: DEIKRUV H1 D.EK. +58 383
#note Best play - he will bingo along any of the lanes anyway. 
>Mark: ??EORSU M1 sOURESt +63 345
>Mark:  (IRUV) +14 359
