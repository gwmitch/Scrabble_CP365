#note i missed 3i ZA(K)AT.  i've studied the word - just failed to spot it.  c2 ZA sims well too because of the super strong ACERT leave.

#note q likes b2 ANEW or b1 WANE marginally more.  Probably as it creates EVET and i have one of two remaining R's for R-EVET.

#note q likes B1 CAN a bit more, probably as it opens up a bingo line.

#note beats out 13a COXA - perhaps as it gives me a shot at a column A bingo ending in D or S? as well as keeping a much better bingo leave.

#note i was just gambling to try and get ?ss. this sims 2nd to BRACE.   Question is - is that because NR is a much better leave on this board than N ?  Or, could it be that if opponent bingos then there will be 0 in the bag and 7 on his/her rack meaning that if I bingo out that I get more points from their rack ...... ? .....

#note 15c SeDIT(I)ON scores one more, but there is no win.   perhaps that extra tile from opponent's rack could have made the difference ?
