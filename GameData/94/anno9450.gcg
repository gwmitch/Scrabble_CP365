#note Maybe just (D)AZE 6D or ZE(D) 6B? Those are the equity plays, at least. This just gives a lot back.

#note Wasn't sure about this, but I thought it was probably good. DOZY is the right play here.

>whatnoloan: AGINSSU 3E .IGS +16 267
#note Yeah, I chickened out on SANGUINES but thought DEVISORY was good. Here I wanted to close lanes. Just NAZIS or GUIN(E)A are probably fine, though. This is overkill.

>whatnoloan: AGINOSU 11C ..G +22 289
#note My brain exploded and I ended up making  terrible play, natch. Is there anything that is good and *doesn't* open the board? There's MEOUING, but that just seems to allow a comeback too easily. As you can see, I am totally lost this game, mainly with this and ZIGS. (Conrad, teach me the nines!)
