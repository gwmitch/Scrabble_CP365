#note Interesting sim result - Q prefers that I go short with this rack and only play 8H OW for 10.  Given her next rack, I do have to wonder how different this game would have been had I done that.
>Pat_Barrett: AINOPST F5 PTO.AINS +66 66
#note Best bingo for Pat, if the sim is to be believed, is MAINTOPS F8 70.  This sims roughly 1 point and 1/2% winning chances down on MAINTOPS.
>Jim_Burlant: AILOTXY 12D XY.TI +32 60
#note Hmmm.  Q points out a really cool extension I didn't see:  LAY(WOMAN) for 48.  Second choice is G8 AX 34, and I didn't want to keep the Y.  I didn't like any of the choices; WAXILY killed too much of the board, so I felt like the least objectionable of all plays was to just dump the rack, unload the X and Y and try again.  Q doesn't like this a whole lot, docking me 15 pts to LAYWO<AN.

#note Q prefers KAON keeping duplicated E's.  Amazing how it seems to know what I'm going to draw on the next turn; I thought getting rid of the duplicated E would have been prudent; had I played KAY instead of KEY, I'd have had a bingo next turn.
>Pat_Barrett: FG G7 F.G +27 123
>Jim_Burlant: AAELNOR 5E A.O +10 100
#note Now I'm getting frazzled; had I played KAY on the previous turn I'd have had RELOANED on row 15. LEARN is certainly a nice leave, but it's not worth giving up 26 pionts on the scoreboard for it.  APNOEAL 5E is obviously the play;   Fair to say that the duplicated rack flustered me more than it should have.  This is weak.

#note Surprisngly, one of my 2 best choices.  
>Pat_Barrett: EISV O12 VISE +45 244
>Jim_Burlant: AELLNRU L9 NULLE. +14 125
#note Looking very bleak - best play is L8  ALLURED for 18, which wins 2%.  This wins 1.4.  
>Pat_Barrett: AQ 6D QA. +14 258
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEJOR 11J JO.E +22 147
#note Now I'm obviously rattled.  13 J JEED!

#note I had to make at least one good play this game, right?
>Pat_Barrett: CDILOY 3H .CYLOID +32 307
#note Shame on me - this is no good.  I held it, but was so shaken up that I didn't trust my instincts.  This was costly, as Pat told me post-mortem she landed the blank after I let her get away with this.
