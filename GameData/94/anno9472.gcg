#note Q says xG.  Whoa.  I guess this was kinda silly, breaking this up.  I'm not good at judging how good leaves with a P are.  Apparently very good.  GO or PROG is next best.

#note This is just a mess.  Okay, so playing short has its merits.  I just don't know when.  And this doesn't even register.  Q static likes (O)DDS, which is just... odd!  :)  SH(OR)T is reasonable, but two Ds: Bleh.

#note 12I DO(L)E 35 is what Champ says.  I can see it, maintaining the Z to score later.  Mine's 2nd.
>Jeff_Cook: AOW A1 A.OW +42 351
#note Oooooof course.
>Ryan_Fischer: DINOOTU 12I NO.O +32 344
#note 12K (L)OOT 31 says Champ.  Yeah, that looks right, what with two Ts left.  I was close.

#note I had him tracked even in my frustration and still managed to give him an out.  Just wasn't thinking.  2J DUITs 33.  I wanted to give myself DUI to go out.  Didn't take it far enough and forgot what this would give him.
