#note 9I BOGLE 20, F6 BO(W)LEG 20, D4 LOGI(C) 16, D8 (C)IBOL 18.  Meh, I like mine just fine.
>Timothy_Bottorff: DFU 6F FUD +22 37
#note Well that kinda closes things off...
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEILOR D8 .OLInEAR +70 116
#note Ooh, fancy: K4 OvARI(O)LE 85.  Shoulda seen that.  It was one of the first things that jumped out at me, but I didn't put it together in that spot.  Thisz more or less 2nd.  Sim doesn't like it as much, but I only did a short one.  D6 RO(C)AIlLE 68 does pretty well.

>Ryan_Fischer: ACEFGTU 14A FU..TE +26 142
#note Bizarre.  When I hit gen choices, I was surprised not to see this on here.  It's phony.  Wonder what I was thinking of.  It's best, at least.  Of note: K9 (O)UTFACE (crazy!), GUF(F)A(W) (cute!), FUG(U) (fishy!).

>Ryan_Fischer: EGGILMN 6J MIG +22 215
#note I always forget which 3-letter G words take a double G.  MIGG woulda done.  Also forgot that MIGGLE is good.  Static likes 6J MEG 22 (the whole (L)ING synergy thing).
>Timothy_Bottorff: EHN 9C H.NE +18 129
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEGLNT K8 L.DGmENT +68 283
#note Thought I was in a bit of a tight spot here until I found this.  Upon my telling him this rack, Matt immediately saw GOLDTONE too!  Also: 12C (In)DuLGENT 61.  This is one of the bright spots of the tourney, me finding a play like this.

>Ryan_Fischer: AAADIRS 5J AA +13 296
#note 8K (L)AARI 22.  Was still in the running at this point, and spread was looking like a good thing.

>Timothy_Bottorff: ADERSST 8K .ARDS +25 171
>Ryan_Fischer: ADIPPQR N6 QA.I +34 368
#note He's leaving EST so I now want to make it harder to get a bingo down.  There's still the prospect of him bingoing at left hooking HONE, but I can counter that.  So it's important to take out the triple at the expense of keeping the D on my rack and one point.  8 places (ways) to dump the Q.  Well, 9.  Such decisions.  Hehe.

>Ryan_Fischer: AELNNOS C3 LE.O +19 441
#note Couldn't quite figure out a way to play without giving him a good J play.  Champ says 12I NO(mI)NAL 7, setting up (EX)ES.  Nice.  (This wasn't it; I don't think it even gave me an out.)
