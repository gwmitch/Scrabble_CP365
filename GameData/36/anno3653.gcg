>moh: DFIIMOW 8G FIDO +16 16
#note Best is 8H IDIOM 22.
>jsp: EVX 7F VEX +29 29
>moh: GIMRRWW J6 GR.W +12 28
#note J7 W(O)RM is best, followed by an exchange, and then my play.
>jsp: AFO 9E OAF +23 52
>moh: ILMNORW 10C WORM +27 55
#note I saw that I had WORMIL (best at D4 for 31), but I wasn't sure of it and chickened out. WORM is next-best.
>jsp: CEITU 11E CUTIE +29 81
>moh: ABILNOU 12B BUNA +18 73
#note 10H BANI 25 and 10H BOLA 25 are just ahead of my BUNA.
>jsp: ?EGIJOS -?EGI +0 81
>moh: EIIKLOT 13A KITE +26 99
#note Aarrghh! H10 K(I)LTIE 33 is exactly what I needed! My KITE is next-best.
>jsp: EG A13 .EG +24 105
>moh: EIIILLO -IIILO +0 99
#note I considred 10J LILO 17, and it's a very close call between that and the exchange.
>jsp: DEILRSU -DEIL +0 105
>moh: EEILPRT 12I REPTILE +72 171
#note The only bingo.
>jsp: AEGINTV O6 VINTAG. +33 138
#note NEGATIVE or AGENTIVE from O5. Ugh. Next-best is N10 VA(L)ET 32, and then your VINTAG(E).
>moh: AEEEILS 10J LEE +16 187
#note LEE sims best.
>jsp: ADELNOT 14D TALONED +67 205
#note In, in, in!
>moh: AEIIJOS 13G JO +36 223
#note Neck-and-neck between K3 JIAO 25 (and juicy EIS leave) and my JO for 36 (with its nice score and crappy leave). Quackle likes JIAO better.
>jsp: IQ N7 QI +24 229
>moh: ?AEIISZ 15G ES +25 248
#note The sim winner is the odd 15E AI for a measly 6. It messes up a lot of the triple plays you might have, and leaves me a very nice leave. Nevertheless, I like killing the triple, even with the sub-par leave.
>jsp: HNS M10 SH.N +18 247
>moh: ??ADIIZ L3 IDeAlIZ. +84 332
#note Or thIAZID(E) in the same place for the same score.
>jsp: CNOY 3I YON.C +28 275
>moh: AAABHOS 2I AHA +34 366
#note I don't quite understand this sim result, and am inclined to dismiss it. Quackle thinks 2I OBA is best, even though it keeps two As. Why not ABA? Anyway, My AHA is right in the mix.
>jsp: IPY 1G YIP +32 307
>moh: ABNORST K5 BO +18 384
#note Any play that empties the bag will lose if you have one of the many bingos possible, so it can't be a play like BARON or BATON (1K). Quackle likes 4J BA(D), and it's easy to see why since it blocks the best lane (hooking PAYS). my BO sims second-best.
>jsp: MU 1K MU +10 317
>moh: ALNRSTU 4E TUNAS +15 399
#note There is no way I can prevent your bingo if the E is in the bag, since DROSERA and ADORERS play in separate places. All the other possible bingos need to hook PAY-S, so the play has to mess that up. Interestingly, a six-letter play that ends in S would score enough to win even if you do bingo with DROSERA. I spent a lot of my time trying to find it. There were two, but I was unsure of both: LUNARS and ULTRAS.
>jsp: ADEEORS 15J ERODES +27 344
#note Among the equally good plays that go to that corner.
>moh: LRR O6 .......R +12 411
#note Best, but irrelevant.
>jsp: A 11M .A. +9 353
#note Best.
