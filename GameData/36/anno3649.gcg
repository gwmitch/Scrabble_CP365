#note Ugh. I chickened out on GLOAM, which fits beautifully at 10B. Gotta hit those fives some more. The one redeeming quality of this play is that it opens a DWS lane for my S, but it still sucks. -11

#note Missing KNOLL H11. -8
>Sal: LTUZ H11 .LUTZ +57 208
#note Gee, I wish I'd played KNOLL.
>Evans: AJLLNRY B2 RALLY +48 220
#note Okay, so I missed JURALLY 13G, and even if I had seen it I might have chickened out on it. But RALLY, despite being clearly second-best, sort of ends up winning me the game. You'll see. -6

>Evans: ?EFJNOU 12B J.F. +28 248
#note See the ORALLY hook up top? I'm saving that for later. (Although it's worth noting that Quackle thinks I'm an idiot for not just playing JOE.) -8
>Sal: OW B12 .OW +29 264
>Evans: ?EINOTU 1B OUTlINE +80 328
#note Haha... I did not see SOSTENUTI 14E. This, however, scores much more and was worth waiting for.
>Sal: ABDEIRT 2H TRIBADE +76 340
#note Shoulda played REDBAIT, methinks.
>Evans: CEOOSSU O1 US +17 345
#note I thought this move would have defensive value because it blocks Sal from doing something silly like HAME up top at L1. Turns out I was playing scared, and the duck isn't a fan. Just take the other TWS with COO, which scores a ton more. -15
>Sal: GNR L1 R.NG +12 352
#note Weird.
>Evans: CDEEOOS A13 COD +29 374
#note Okay, so it was dumb to miss COO in the same spot. But is this really a 9- or 10-point mistake? Seriously, Quackle?
