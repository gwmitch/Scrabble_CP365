#note Wanted to set up JO B6, as I was getting killed and a bingo seemed rather unlikely. Didn't know COELOM 5H, but dunno if I would have played it anyway.

#note Champ likes ZOIC B2...not sure how I can win after that. I guess a bingo on row 14, but he'll block after that. I guess he could have all consonants, that's possible, but I'm still down like 27, so I'm pretty screwed. rOC is probably better. I guess ZOIC makes the most sense if I can stick him with JQ, but I was still hoping for JO.
