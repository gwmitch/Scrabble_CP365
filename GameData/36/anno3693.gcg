>Matthew: AABCDIU 6B ABACI +19 387
#note At this point I spent a lot of time with the unseen pool and saw no bingo threats. I was willing to leave the line open to score elsewhere, but I had a nagging feeling. I settled on ABACI because it unloaded and blocked the line which I assumed was useless.

#note It turns out there was a bingo possibility I missed. NEURONAL. And Chris had it. Wow, I'm glad I chose to block.
