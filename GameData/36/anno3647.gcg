#note Not to brag or anything, but this is turn 8 and I've played perfectly so far. This decision is a debatable one though. I thought about playing QI, but there were two problems -- one, AELR? is a lot better than AELRR?, and two, there are five N's unseen, and both spots for QI would be blocking SNARLER if I drew one. Quackle thinks it's fairly close, but likes QI 11N best, QI 6M 0.3 points back, and my play is a 1.6-point mistake. Not bad.

#note Statically this isn't good, but the sim likes it. I think the main reason is I need to unload my N with three more unseen. Quackle still likes ARID 10J best, but the sim is fairly close and I'm really afraid of those N's. RIFER 7K is another idea -- and Quackle does love the bingo changes with AINRS -- but again, what if I double the N's? It seems too risky. -2?

#note If I'm Patrick Hodges, I fish off RSU with RUSE N9 and catch NOV to bingo out with VINDALOO. But I'm me, so I just give up.
