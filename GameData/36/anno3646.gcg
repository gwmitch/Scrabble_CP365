>Evans: DFGIRTU 8F FRUG +16 16
#note I thought it was between FRUG and TURGID. I didn't think of FRUIT, which scores more, or FUG, which is the sim favorite. -1

>Evans: ?EINRRU --  -78 111
#note Tim didn't even hold. I believe his exact words as he smacked the clock and bounded up to the computer were "that one's no good."  UNRETIRE, REINSURE and REINJURE are the valid double-doubles.
>Tim: Q 6H Q. +11 67
>Evans: ?EINRRU M6 RUINERs +70 181
#note Remember those valid double-doubles I was talking about? I somehow manage to miss all three. I suck. -8

#note I am unspeakably luckboxy against Tim.
>Tim: AOZ A8 ZOA +42 176
>Evans: DEIIINT 13G ID +14 283
#note All of Quackle's suggestions here open the board way too much. No thanks. TILDE K6 is the only one I like... the rest look crappy. -9
>Tim: DV 10L D.V +15 191
>Evans: EIILNOT 5I .OIL +8 291
#note There should be a way to give Quackle the inference "my opponent is a way better player than me, so there's no fucking way I'm opening the board with something stupid like IOLITE N1." -4
>Tim: PRS J3 PR.S +22 213
>Evans: EGINPTT K11 P.G +12 303
#note This seems great defensively to me. I'm more afraid if him bingoing with IDS down in row 14 than through that P up top. Quackle wants to score more points with either TINGE N2 or TIPPET 3H. -8
>Tim: CDO 14E COD +16 229
>Evans: EEILNTT 3J .ELT +12 315
#note Okay, now I block the P.
>Tim: EH 2K HE +12 241
>Evans: ?AEINRT 1H ANEsTRI +80 395
#note Props to Tim for not reaching across the table and strangling me.
>Tim: EM B13 ME +15 256
#note I'm assuming he missed IDEM/CODE at H12.
>Evans: AFIOOTU A14 FA +20 415
#note Makes sense for spread purposes to score 20 and take out his best scoring spot. I'm going to ignore Quackle in this pre-endgame... it seems a little wacky.
>Tim: CENST 15G SCENT +30 286
>Evans: EIIOOTU 14I OI +10 425
#note I'm supposed to block his JUBA play. AUTO H1 is best. -3
>Tim: ABEJNSU 2F JUBA +35 321
>Evans: EIOTU F2 .UTE +11 436
#note I'm supposed to play UTE N4 to give him less counterplay. -5
