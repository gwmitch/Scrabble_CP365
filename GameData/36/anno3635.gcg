#note Missed WEAKLIER.  This is a big weakness of mine in terms of board vision.  I just don't even try to anagram with the W or U because there's no way it fits.  Unless it comes to me when I am staring at the rack and then see the tile, I will usually miss stuff like this for bingos when something else is available.  Finding WEAK isn't a problem, but finding WEAKLIER just doesn't happen for me a lot of the time.

#note I really have no idea at this point.  This is one of the most miserable situations in Scrabble, when you are behind, you don't have much of a rack, the board is dying and you are pretty sure you're up against a big rack.  I guess I like DEEM or EM and praying, but I'm not very happy about it.

#note This is a good time to think about your opponent.  EN is dead in the water against a human but works very well against Quackle.  UNLET is probably best against the best human players, but Quackle isn't at that level yet in these sorts of positions.

#note This kind of hurts, as I have a legitimate shot against this rack if I play EN.  As it is the game is basically over here.
