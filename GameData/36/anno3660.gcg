#note the duck likes 13G URB better -4.44  Interestingly, the 'Generate Choices' instant feature (Speedy Player?) lists this Championship choice 8th.  I guess that makes me speedier...
>Elouise: NR 8L ..RN +21 237
>Jeffrey_: ?EIRSSU 5K S.. +12 453
#note I looked around for a while with the N and tried to find SUbERI(N)S but couldn't, knowing Q would whang me.  It even likes (Q)UIRE better than my choice?  -11.8.  My opp. confirmed after that she would have turned this spot into 25+ points (maybe up to 49 points with ZAP considering her next play?)
>Elouise: AZ 13B ZA +26 263
>Jeffrey_: ?EEIRSU O3 nEURI.ES +58 511
#note The duck doesn't like that I avoided the Q (REEQUIPS/RELIQUES), which doesn't make sense to me (the sluttiest lane to take defensively is column O) but the star play here is SqUIREE(N)!!!  I didn't know this one, -15.9
>Elouise: EOW 15A WOE +21 284
>Jeffrey_: EOOTTUV 12I TO +11 522
#note Here's where the equity penalty gets prohibitively expensive: duck wants me to play 12H TOO, thus emptying the bag (against my nature) and I really can't figure out why.  There is no bomb to be dropped at 13G by my opp, just the VOE play I was setting up.  WTF duck?  Of course, no sympathy for my orphan on this rack at this point.  -30.7?  Seriously?
>Elouise: IRTU 6F .UIRT +16 300
>Jeffrey_: EIOPTUV H3 PTU. +7 529
#note So I miss the out-in-two Q wants with PU(R)I then VETO/VOTE, -22  I knew I did want to block MM here but beyond that play VOE next

>Jeffrey_:  (RR) +4 560
#note ...so I object to about 40 of the 95 points docked.  If I had 'optimized' the out-in-two the score would have been 552-308 instead of 563-315, so I added 4 points to the duck's best-spread idea.  Take that!
