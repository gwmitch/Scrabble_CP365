#note I saw JAUNTED but just wasn't sure enough of it. If there were nothing good to play, I'd have done it. But JUNTA was good enough. (-5.9)

#note So this tells me Mark doesn't have the blank, but has a 50% chance of drawing it.
>Matthew: AANRRSU A12 .ARA +21 363
#note This was tough. I really wanted to block the bingo lines, but they didn't score well at all. I figured Mark could easily beat me without a bingo, so I needed to enter endgame mode and pray he didn't get the tiles.
