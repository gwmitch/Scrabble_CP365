>Dominic_Grillo: BDEOX 8D BOXED +36 36
>Jason: ?AIINOU F7 I.IA +13 13
#note Stupidly missed AUDItION because I was focused on dumping vowels and keeping OUT(BOXED) open. (-14.9)
>Dominic_Grillo: DLMNPUU D4 PLUM. +22 58
#note Dominic pointed out after the game that I blocked P(E)NDULUM. Ouch.
>Jason: ?EINOTU 8A OUT..... +54 67
#note Dominic figured that keeping a U on his opening play gave him the inside track for this.
>Dominic_Grillo: CKU 5D .UCK +20 78
>Jason: ?EIINOR H8 .ERIsION +74 141
#note NO(T)IfIER requires two overlaps, and is apparently too difficult for me to see. (-2.8)
>Dominic_Grillo: DO C3 DO +10 88
>Jason: DEGHLQT 13G Q. +21 162
#note Normally I'm not one to "Q panic", but with three U's and four I's gone, no matter what the leave, I'm willing to ditch it for 21.
>Dominic_Grillo: AEEGLNT 10H .EGENTAL +65 153
>Jason: DEEGHLT O7 GEL.ED +30 192
#note HELLED here or the double-double GLEET(E)D at K5 is preferred. (-3.2)
>Dominic_Grillo: AIPRSTW K7 WIR.TAPS +76 229
#note Yeah, seeing GLEET(E)D woulda been nice...
>Jason: CHHNTTW 8J W.TH +11 203
#note Well, this sequence has gone decidedly poorly. Q likes W(A)NT. (-3.4)
>Dominic_Grillo: AEFGN 2B GANEF +38 267
>Jason: CEHJNRT 1E RETCH +37 240
#note I felt there was too much good stuff out and this spot too key to play short with H(A)J. Ducky agrees.
>Dominic_Grillo: RU 13K .UR +10 277
>Jason: ?FJMNVY 12J J.M +32 272
#note His play makes my decision easy.
>Dominic_Grillo: AEILORT 15A RELATIO. +77 354
>Jason: ?AFNOVY 14B FAY +35 307
#note Or OFAY, but given my last three racks I was a little gun-shy. Q says OFAY is preferred. (-4.2)
>Dominic_Grillo: AO 9J O.A +13 367
>Jason: ?DEINOV 2I INVOkED +79 386
#note Nearly played DEV(O)tION before seeing this. Good thing I did, too. As you can see, Dom was all set to go here.
>Dominic_Grillo: AEINORS M2 .I +2 369
#note In the post-mortem, we determined that a play like IRONS at 11B probably would've won, but that's a hard play to make in this situation. I can't quibble with this play.
>Jason: ABNSSVY H4 BYS +25 411
#note Well, from his last play, I know the Z was in the bag. Seeing nothing through the O or U, I decided to block ARENOSE while keeping my vowel. On the 2/3 chance I pick the Z, I got lots of spots. If he picked it, I have potential outs with VANES, VINAS or NOVAS. I liked this play, so naturally Q hates it. BASSY at 4K is CP's clear pick. (-23.0)
>Dominic_Grillo: AEINORS 11B RAINS +22 391
>Jason: AENSVZ O1 A.ZES +48 459
#note I go to 6-0, Dom falls to 5-1. Neither of us would lose again until round 10.
>Dominic_Grillo: EO B1 E.O +7 398
>Dominic_Grillo:  (NV) +10 408
