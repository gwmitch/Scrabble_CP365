>Phil: ?CENNNS E2 NE +6 349
#note He took a really long time on ROM so I assumed he had the blank and was trying to 3x3... either way, this kills 3 lines and I don't need the points or leave at this stage in the game.
>Augy_Adda: AIP 12A PIA +11 266
>Phil: ?CINNOS A12 .INS +18 367
#note Forgot about PONS... either way I'm glad Q agrees with me on passing up CONINES for defense. The ONLY way I'm losing this one is with a 3x3, like I said, spread was a nonissue for me at this point in the tourney.

#note pOLICE 5B blocks everything; I didn't see any nines so my play blocked all others.
>Augy_Adda: ?AEISST 3K S.AT +16 307
#note He went 70 points overtime on this play, missed MEATINESS/TEARINESS/IRATENESS/QAIDS/QADIS. Sry if that was harsh Augy
