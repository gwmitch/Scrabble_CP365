>david: BIOOQTY H8 BOOTY +28 28
#note The computer sim suggests you should go ahead and shed the Q with QI. As harmless as the QI leave seems, that Q will still hamper your racks enough to warrent sacrificing a few points to get rid of it.
>moh: CDINPST I7 DIP +22 22
#note Pretty easy winner.
>david: EIIOQRX J9 EX +30 58
#note Best.
>moh: ?CINNST K3 INCaNTS +72 94
#note With this play, I deserved to lose. I saw STaNNIC, of course, but missed the fact that it played as a double-double (from K5). I totally went to sleep on the OPE-N hook. Ugh!
>david: DIIMOQR 6J Q.ID +33 91
#note Best (tied with Q(A)DI).
>moh: ABEEOTU 12C BEAUT. +22 116
#note Missed 8K (T)UBAE.
>david: IKMORSZ N2 ZORIS +48 139
#note C9 ZOM(B)I 56 is clearly best. 4I ZO(N)K 34 and F10 ZO(U)K are also interesting with their promising IMRS leave, but they're probably inferior to your ZORIS.
>moh: EEOTUVV L1 VOTE +28 144
#note Best (tied with VETO in the same place).
>david: AEEIKMN O1 KAME +51 190
#note Clearly best.
>moh: AAAEOUV J1 AVA +17 161
#note Several exchanges sim better than the plays. Should've thrown back.
>david: AEINORS C7 SEARO.IN +74 264
#note The only bingo.
>moh: AEFNNOU 1F FAEN. +24 185
#note Another bad play--FAUN(A) in the same place is clearly better.
>david: AHHIIRU D8 HI +20 284
#note 14B U(N)HAIR 22 is best, but your HI is reasonable. 
>moh: EEMNOUW 14B U.MOWN +38 223
#note Or U(N)MEW in the same place. They're close.
>david: AHILLRU 8K .HIRL +36 320
#note (T)HURL is a bit better, then (T)HILL, then (T)HIRL.
>moh: ADEEGRT N8 .EGRATED +78 301
#note I was thankful to see that R; there's a ray of hope now.
>david: ?AGLNUU 15G ULU +11 331
#note UNGULAr UNGULAe, both from 2A. 
>moh: EEJOOPW B6 WOP +26 327
#note I should have played WOP at G7 instead. I didn't want to play 15K EPO(D)E because I was counting on JA(D)E keeping me in it if you bingo-ed with the last blank.
>david: ?AEFGNS 2A FlANGES +83 414
#note A1 FaNEGAS is best, but any of the bingos pretty much secure the win.
>moh: AEEIJLO 15L JA.E +60 387
>david: DEGIRTY 11B G.RY +28 442
#note Nice endgame play, setting up EXITED and out.
>moh: CEILLOR G7 COL +22 409
#note G7 COLLE(T) 29!
