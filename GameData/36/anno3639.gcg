#note ZOARIA and Ex. AIOOR are interesting options. ZOARIA is a little open for me, especially given that she probably has bingo tiles after her last play. I don't like exchanging down 28 already; assuming she's bingoing (if not this turn then next) that's a 100 point deficit.
>Joan_Kelly: EENSSTT L2 TENSEST +78 124
#note 10B is the best placement, and I like L4 better.
>Phil: AGIOPRU K3 PIU +20 54
#note Sims decently. Don't know PIROG or GUIRO which would have probably been best at 10G; or GIAOUR. Who knows the only 8 with these letters?
>Joan_Kelly: CFR E8 C.RF +18 142
>Phil: ACGHLOR M1 COG +26 80
#note This, LOG, or HOG are all up there.
>Joan_Kelly: EX 10E .EX +35 177
>Phil: AAHLMRY 1M .RY +24 104
#note Q prefers CAY, but I'll double my A's to keep a more balances leave.

>Joan_Kelly: ADEENOT --  -80 201
>Phil: AEHILLM N6 HA.L +15 136
#note Q prefers HAULM; I prefer keeping the better leave and guaranteeing myself a 30 point play next turn.
>Joan_Kelly: ORU D11 OUR +11 212
>Phil: AEIJLMP 10M IMP +29 165
#note The J is worth 8 points now, but could be worth 24 next turn.
>Joan_Kelly: GIIN 13C I.ING +16 228
#note Long hold here
>Phil: ABEJLMV L10 JAMB +45 210

#note BIgOTED for 4 more.
>Phil: EGLOOTV A6 VOLTO +27 237
>Phil: EGLOOTV --  -27 210
#note I knew it was phony, but I was frustrated here. Shoulda just taken VOLTE, I'm not completely out of it yet.
>Joan_Kelly: ADEI A8 IDEA +23 326
>Phil: EGLOOTV C5 GLOVE +16 226
#note I wanted to try to open the board up top, because if she blocked this spot (which she probably would have) the board becomes bingo-dead pretty much.
>Joan_Kelly: OY A14 YO +29 355
>Phil: ELNNORT 11J LO.N +10 236
#note Sims well, but I would've played PONENT if I knew it.
