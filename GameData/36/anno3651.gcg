#note The only bingo.

#note E2 ZOEAE 40 was the best non-phony. 
>jsp: IKP 10J KIP +37 83
>moh: AEEIOTT E2 TOEA +15 150
#note F10 OPIATE 20 barely wins the sim, but I don't see any reason to open up the 3x3 lane with the lead. I think the best play is 4D IO(D)ATE 16.
>jsp: ?ADNOTU 14B rOTUNDA +80 163
#note The best bingo among many options.
>moh: EEEEILT 15H ELITE +24 174
#note Best.
>jsp: AFRY D4 FRAY +37 200
>moh: DEENOTT 15A DENOTE +34 208
#note Best (by a country mile).
>jsp: ABH 13A BAH +30 230
>moh: AIORTUW 10B WAUR +17 225
#note Best is 12G (S)AW 24, even with the unappealing. IORTU leave. I saw 2C OU(T)WIT 17,  but thought it was defensively ridiculous, but it sims in second place.
>jsp: EJOS 8A JOES +48 278
>moh: ?AIIORT 14J OI +10 235
#note Ugh. I missed IMI(T)ATOR, VITIATOR, and ANTIRIOT, all through the T at 2E. Terrible misses.
>jsp: CELU I4 CULE. +15 293
>moh: ?AFGIRT B1 GRAFfIT. +76 311
#note Best was the cool GIFTwRA(P), with my GRAFfIT(O) second.
>jsp: EGIILLV -EGIIL +0 293
>moh: DHILQRY 5H Q.ID +28 339
#note Easily best.
>jsp: AEEIRST M5 AERIEST +69 362
#note TEARIEST edges out AERIEST, but they're so close it's almost a player's choice. My suggestion of fishing for a better bingo crashed and burned in the sim. 
>moh: GHLRSWY 8K WH.RL +45 384
#note It's best to leave one in the bag, but I didn't realize I was emptying it. The sim winner is the very cool 8K WH(I)G 15! With the last S, I am going to cash well on my next play at 8O.
>jsp: EGILNVV 3A V.V +18 380
#note The best attempts are GIVEN and LIVEN, both at N2. They win if I don't see 12I SYNC for 33. 
>moh: CGMNOSY N2 MYCS +24 408
#note The SYNC play is best.
>jsp: EGILN 2E .INGLE +11 391
#note Or 2E INGLE for three more points.
