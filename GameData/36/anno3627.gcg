>matt: EGIOQSY 8G QI +22 22
#note It's generally best to shed the Q as quickly as possible, and this is no exception. QI is clearly best.
>dave: ?EEMOST I2 dEMOTES +72 72
#note Tons of bingos, all pretty close to each other. E.g., MEsTESO, OMELETS, EMOTErS, gEMOTES, TOnEMES, METEOrS, and so on.
>matt: ADEGOSY H1 GOY +27 49
#note GOY wins by a mile, and it's easy to see why with the very promising leave of ADES and decent score. (There is actually a much higher-scoring play available: H1 SAYED 44, but the ADES leave is so much better than GO that it's better to turn down the extra points. By the way, SAYED is not some stupid past tense of SAY, but another spelling of SAYYID)
>dave: ?AJLOSU 5H J.UAL +24 96
#note I'm glad I blocked AzUL(E)JOs and JALOUSi(E). J(O)UAL is best, and it keeps out mistake-free game alive.
>matt: AADEHOS 6G DO.H +38 87
#note I struggled to figure this one out. The big scorer, DO(T)H for 38, keeps the unappealing AAES leave.  4K HAO 21 keeps the much better ADES leave, but gives up 17 points. The two plays are very close in the computer sim, but my DO(T)H is a bit stronger.
>dave: ?DEGNOS M5 SNOgGED +74 170
#note This is the first mistake of the game by either player, although it's not a terrible blunder. Dave missed H8 (I)NDiGOES 83 and M2 GOdSEND 81. His SNOgGED is nofar behind.
>matt: AAEEIRS L9 AREA +16 103
#note It was best to keep more of this promising (if vowel-heavy) start together. This is a good rack to fish from; for instance, 9F AI 15 sets up nice lanes through the column E and row 10, and the AEERS leave is a consonant short of a lot of possiblities. 
>dave: EINRUWY K11 WYE +37 207
#note The two best plays were K7 WINERY 44 and K9 WIRY 43, either of which made Dave a 9-to-1 favorite in this game. Dave's WYE wasn't bad, though, as it came in only a few points behind the leaders.
>matt: EILRSUX N9 EX +55 158
#note Manna from heaven! Down more than 100, I needed something to kickstart my comeback, and the huge X play was just the thing.
>dave: INNORTU J10 TORN +22 229
#note I'm not a big fan of Dave's TORN, mostly because it keeps the U. G8 (Q)UIN 14 keeps NORT, and 9E UNIT 19 keeps NOR. I prefer either of those plays to TORN.
>matt: ILPRSTU O4 TULIPS +32 190
#note As much as I hated to break up the good parts of this rack, I felt like I needed points to stay within striking distance. My play and O7 PUR 20 are neck-and-neck.
>dave: INNRUVZ 9F ZIN +27 256
#note ZIN is best, putting Dave up 66 on a suddenly constricted board.
>matt: EEIMRTV L3 VI.E +16 206
#note Nothing stands out here. Just a bunch of blah plays like 4K ME 16 (officially best), I10 EM 17, etc. My play is right in the middle of a nearly indistinguishable pack.
>dave: BELNRUV 11I V.... +12 268
#note Without any big plays, this would have been a good time for Dave to close down the board since he had the lead. G2 REV 16 kills the -ING bingos across row 1, which are the likeliest way for me to get into this game (bingos across row 10 are possible but pretty unlikely, and they're almost impossible everywhere else). Dave's V(OWED) keps less than ideal tiles (although the single-tile play made me THINK he had great tiles!). But the bigger problem is that a big A-VOWED play to the triple and this game is tied. Why open that opportunity up?
>matt: DEMNORT G2 MED +18 224
#note I felt like I was cutting off my own hand here, since now I am blocking the best comeback lane on the board. Ugh! But MED stands up pretty well in the sim, coming in just behind DOM and TOM, both at K7 (M-AGES).
>dave: ABELNRU 4D BUR. +14 282
#note H11 ABLER 43! My guess is that Dave went to sleep on the A-VOWED hook (he woke up and hooked it couple turns later). ABLER makes Dave a 19-1 favorite and all but seals this game. BUR(D) does keep pretty nice tiles, but the AELN leave doesn't come close to justifying a measly 14 points when so much more is ripe for the plucking.
>matt: AINOORT D3 A.ORTION +61 285
#note ORATION was homeless on this board, so I was very happy to see that B. As an outspoken conservative, I thought Dave might challenge this play, especially so late in the game! ;-)
>dave: AACEILN 3L .AC +16 298
#note That darned A-VOWED hook again! H11 AECIA was best.
>matt: BEFHLOT C9 HOTEL +35 320
#note Either HOTEL or 5C F(O)H 28. They're about even, with HOTEL just ahead in the sim. FOH has the better lead, but HOTEL scores 7 more points. Six of one, a half dozen or the other, as they say.
>dave: AEILNNP H11 ALINE +31 329
#note Dave wakes up to the A-VOWED hook! ALINE, ANILE, and ALIEN, all in the same spot, are essentially tied for best play.
>matt: ABDEFII B10 FIB +36 356
#note The final tie-breaker in choosing HOTEL last play was that my BF leave was likely to play parallel to HOTEL, with the hotspot being the F at B10. Indeed, the I allowed FIB (but I'd have been just as happy with FAB or FUB). Had Dave ignored the A-VOWED hook, I'd have played ABIDE/AVOWED and kept the F for that spot next play.
>dave: AFKNPRT C1 KAF +30 359
#note Dave's KAF for 30 is solid, winning almost half the time. The computer's Championship Player recommends D12 NARK 38, but it's very close.
>matt: ADEISUW 1A WA.ED +42 398
#note I am forced to play along row 1, but that means that if Dave has a bingo along row 15, I'm beat. In fact, it's what makes KAF about as good as the higher-scoring NARK on Dave's last play. And with the unseen tile pool, there are a ton (33, to be exact) of possible bingos along row 1 (ANERGIC, PATIENCE, CREATINE, PETERING, CREEPING etc.). But a true block of that lane scores far too little, and then I lose when Dave plays to the K on row 1, and a partial block like D12 DAW doesn't achieve either of my goals well (scoring and blocking row 15 bingos). So I decided to score and hope Dave didn't have a bingo. The compuer suggests improving my leave by playing WA(K)E instead of WAKED; after all, I can hopefully play the D at D12 next play. My thinking, though, is that if you have to empty the bag in a close game, go as deep into it as you can (that is, play as many tiles as possible to maximize the chances that you can go out as soon as possible. It's easier to find an out-in-two from a rack of six tiles than a rack of seven).
>dave: AEGNPRT 5B GR.PE +26 385
#note I can't find a way for Dave to win here. He come come within four points with the sequence that follow E3 T(U)P.
>matt: CIIRSU D12 SIC +22 420
#note Best.
>dave: ANT G13 TAN +11 396
#note Best. Good game, Dave. Everyone else, thanks for following along.
