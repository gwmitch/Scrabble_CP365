>Sam: ?ABDORS K8 BRO.ADeS +70 158
#note I put down BOmBARDS first, then saw BROCADeS and pulled the play back. I thought for at least a minute then played BROCADeS. Merrill said he would have went with BOmBARDS. Had I known and seen SkYBOARD I would have definitely played that.

#note Merrill commented after the game that he was one off from EGESTION here.

#note WYN is interesting, but NAFF's probably better anyway.
>Merrill_Kaitz: EEIS 13B SEI.E +30 228
>Sam: ?AGLNSW N6 WANGLeS +81 348
#note My two choices were WArSLING and WANGLeS. Quackle thinks I should have sacrificed the equity, giving WArSLING a higher win% value. I guess there are huge O-line bingos I'm susceptible now, and my spread was already one of the highest in the division, if not the highest. I probably didn't need to take the risk.
