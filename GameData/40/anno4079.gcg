#note this was a hard decision. no great X spots available or likely. don't want to just play SEX b/c of T hook, but maybe it threatens enough holding the Y to be worth the risk.  two blanks unseen, get more out of the bag?  i have no idea. quackle says PIE c11, which scores 5 more.

#note argh again.  agonized b/t rejig and yell, holding rejig for next turn, since he's likely to bingo in C or F and then i have the big comeback play.  go for points now and hope bag is nice to me.

#note this draw assures him the win, as far as i can tell. i tried to look for a way out. i looked at TRULL, but QIS/SWIVE is a win there by a bunch. TULLE looks enough like it may play somewhere in a way that i think he'll just take QI and it'll stay closer.
