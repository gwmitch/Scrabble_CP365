#note YAH makes the most sense here, but it's the one three that I refuse to acknowledge the existence of. I actually have an anamonic for the _AH words, but i couldn't remember it here, and I hate the thought of potentially having a three challenged off.

#note i'm pretty mad about this game at this point. i've given away a huge lead, and i know i haven't used these racks as well as i should have. this is just to block the Q and try again. my other consideration was VINERY, but i thought that gave away too much.  i'm basically waiting for something to happen here. this is hopefully the only game that i made this many mid-game bad decisions.
