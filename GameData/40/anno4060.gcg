#note JK called out "AEINRST!" as he drew, and when the first five were AEIRS, we were both laughing hysterically.
>Not_Jasons: IIIII -IIIII +0 20
>Jasons: AIORRWY I5 WIRY +22 85
#note (C)OWRY, D8. Probably my fault, I pointed out the -Y hook and then we didn't look anywhere else. About an eight-point mistake.

#note I wish I could take credit for this one, but it's Mr. Knows His Power Tile Bingos'. His job was to find the words, mine was to ask "what would Quackle do?" and choose between them. Knappster and I had no idea, but Paul didn't bat an eye. Slightly better than our second option of MOZO, 11H.
>Not_Jasons: CHOO 4A COHO +39 114
#note Having seen a couple turns apiece by this point, Carol turned to Knappster and asked: "What's your job exactly, to hit the clock?"

>Jasons: ?AFIRTW D11 F.W +21 212
#note My internal Quackle was off here ... we discussed WART at 5B (32, IF?) vs. FEW (21, AIRT?). They sim close, but WART has a 4-point edge.

#note Oops. PRImATAL and PARTIALs are three more.

#note With all the E's out, FINE is very slightly preferred.

>Jasons: ?BEEMRU O1 .UMBEREd +92 413
#note I'd like to say I'd have found this in a tourney, but JK set this up so fast, I barely had time to look for bingos. The blank could also be made an R, but needless to say we weren't going to risk it.
>Not_Jasons: DET C13 TED +22 235
>Jasons: AEEOPRT N4 OPERATE +83 496
#note JK had drawing duties until I decided to revoke them. Needless to say, I never did. After pulling this rack, we were laughing so much people wondered what was going on. After he played it, I said: "Ladies and gentlemen, Jason Keller!"

#note I wish it had been a better game ... When I told Knappster I might post it just for laughs, he said: "Just put down the worst possible tiles for us."
>Not_Jasons: EN J10 EN +10 319
#note For fun, find the 16-pointer.
