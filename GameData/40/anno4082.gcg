#note I still have no idea what the best play is here.  My first instinct was GOYIM, which scores and turns over best.  But I dreaded drawing five tiles to BV, especially on an open board.  I opted to play it defensively.

#note And I still get burned.

#note Another unattractive set of options, but this was as good as there was available.
