#note I felt like I could afford to challenge since I had decent scoring plays coming back in two different spots.  I saw COCHLEA (which I wasn't sure of either but it looked real) but had no idea if you could put an R on it.  It seemed like a desperation play on his part to stay in the game.

#note I didn't think twice about RUGRAT*.  I would have hooked an S on it if I had had the opportunity.

#note I felt like I couldn't afford to challenge because there was only one scoring spot on the board (the one he is opening up here).  If I lose a challenge, he's going to hit there for big points then I'm screwed.  For some reason, I thought I had EVERY coming back for 53 points, but when I went to play it, I realized it didn't fit.  Not sure the 15-point difference would have affected my decision not to challenge.
