#note Close between this and FIAT. I thought the F might come in handy for scoring.

#note Carl's comments: An interesting position. My reasoning here was that the play that is most likely to kill me is QUA or QI L11. I realized at the time that I was creating another risky lane, but at least nothing ending in -AJ was possible.  The sim winner is OUT N13, followed closely by UT in the same spot. MOUE N5 also does well.

#note I was hopeful that Carl would play something like BAN L4, leaving me a sure out in two. But he foiled that plan by blocking my second QUA spot.
