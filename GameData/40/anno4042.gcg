>Steve_Krieger: AEMNV H4 MAVEN +26 26
#note "If only I had a rack of QUACKLE," I joked.
>Jason: ADINOOS 6G A.OID +11 11
#note JK wondered why I didn't play O(V)OID. (I missed it.) It will prove significant next turn. Sim likes (M)ONDO, but I don't. A bunch of plays sim closely. (-2)
>Steve_Krieger: AEGINRR J3 GRA.NIER +61 87
#note The bingo through the M is highest-scoring.
>Jason: EENOORS I9 OE +8 19
#note O(V)OID leaves ARENOSE here, but nooo... (M)O(R)ON leads sim by a hair. (-1)
>Steve_Krieger: INX 7E NIX. +36 123
>Jason: EENOORS G3 OE +7 26
#note Still paying for OVOID/ARENOSE, as I draw back what I fished. This was kind of the Keller/Krieger game in reverse ... Steve had 12 points through four turns against JK and yet Jason still had to make a good endgame play to win by four. I had 26 through three turns, came back ... but still lost by four. And now sim likes EO(N). (-2)

>Jason: CELNORS 2B CLONERS +75 101
>Steve_Krieger: BLT D1 B.LT +18 159
>Jason: FLRRTUZ 1G FUTZ +61 162
#note I nearly wet myself when this stayed open. Always nice to erase a 97-point deficit in two turns.
>Steve_Krieger: CEEILNS L1 LICENSE +80 239
#note Just in case I forgot I was playing my daddy.
>Jason: ABKLORR 1L .ARK +24 186
#note Sims closely with ROB at 9E, which I didn't consider. (-2)
>Steve_Krieger: Q G9 Q. +21 260
>Jason: ABDGLOR 8L DRAB +40 226
#note I was pretty sure at this point it was going to be another nail-biter. Seven of our ten games have had spreads of: 48, 44, 21, 27, 11, 42 and this one's 4.
>Steve_Krieger: EHOST 11D THOSE +37 297
#note (Counted as 36 and fixed in the recount.)
>Jason: GHILOPT 12H PILOT +30 256
#note Another way this fit our script: I'm pretty sure judging from his play both blanks are in the bag. I swear, on average the first blank comes out around turn nine when we play. A straight turnover play. First real mistake of the game, missing PLIGHT here and LITHO at 8A. (-8)
>Steve_Krieger: EMW 11K MEW +26 323
>Jason: ??FGHRV N6 FR.G +16 272
#note Yay, both blanks! Boo, no vowels! Hated blocking potential B bingos, but felt like I had no choice. I needed to score and dump. Missed V(I)G at 2K, which wins sim by a bunch. (-10)
>Steve_Krieger: ADENOTY 13I TODAY +34 357
#note I think Steve said in the post-mortem that he left EN here. Nice play.
>Jason: ??AHIUV D9 VA.U +14 286
#note Took a while here. I felt like, with two U's unseen, dumping one was mandatory. I also liked this blocking JUDGE, JUNTA, or something of that ilk at 8A, which renders my potential bingo meaningless. sHIVA at 8A is interesting. It's possible I win win without bingoing, esp. if Steve pulled sewage after TODAY. Not as thrilled with VI(N)A, though, which Duck also likes. I stand by this play. (-1)
>Steve_Krieger: DEGINOS B2 .OSIGNED +66 423
#note Perhaps too risky given the unseen pool. But nothing's a guaranteed win. DINGOES at 14C is his best bingo, but he confessed to not being 100% on it. Ran CP just once; it chose DOSING, 13B. It wins 99+% to less than 90% for this.
>Jason: ??AEHIJ A8 HEJIrAs +113 399
#note After I put this down and designated the blanks, Steve (a la Bob Linn to Bowman at the WSCQT) extended his hand across the table. For a fleeting moment, I thought I could tie or win since I saw the other Y was in the bag. Played it well, but alas, like my usual against Krieger, just short. Heckuva fun game, though.
