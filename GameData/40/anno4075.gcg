#note FUTZ vs FOXES.  in retrospect, i should've played FUTZ since i had an assured sox/oxes next turn. at the time i guess i was going for turnover or something.

#note this is so bad. i was so happy to see something that fit next to the X i didn't even consider the botom lane NEREIDES for 104. SERENADE is also better.
>gi: AEEV 15H EVA.E +41 319
#note twice in a row, i pay for my mistake but still manage to keep a lead.

>k8: AADLLNV 2A VAND.L +24 367
#note take points, move toward the end of the game, undouble the Ls.  NAVAR was the other consideration, but i preferred this leave and not opening two easy bingo lanes (even tho this leaves OVER- 3x3 possibilities).

#note the bag is gross. i can't convince myself of GALOSH(/RESH) without the E. keep H to hook next turn if needed, take biggest points.

#note i manage to pull a consonant out of the bag. poor joel.
