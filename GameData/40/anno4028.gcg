#note DISCLAIMER: This was Dayton 2007. I REALLY sucked back then, as I will demonstrate for the first 3/4 of this game.

#note ANNRRY is correct, the 3rd N is an educated guess.

#note Wasn't my word knowledge so good back in Dayton? Never questioned it, especially with my sexy rack. Thank God I know a lot of words now.

>dacrON: DGIOOTU F6 DO +19 346
#note I think we were both low on time by now...GO C4 comes out on top, with this play 2nd. c4 GO win% = 51%, f6 DO win% = 43%, 14b OUT win% = 37.5%.......................................................................As for Mike's rack, There are 3(?) winning plays. One I guess isn't so hard. See the end of the game for answers / more commentary.
>Mike_Frentz: EIOQRSW N10 QIS +42 371
#note This is not one of them, if I play the endgame (almost) perfectly. His winning plays were Q(AT) 5C (best by a lot), OWE C1, E(MU) 3C (!!!).
>dacrON: EGINOTU C3 EGO +25 371
#note Only winning play. Has to be done before UNIT O8, or he will outscore me.
>Mike_Frentz: EORW 11K ..R. +10 381
#note Best play. I had very little time remaining, so even though this play (and all others) lose, I still have to play the last two moves correctly, and almost instantaneously.
>dacrON: INTU 14B TUN +12 383
#note This is one of them. NU 14B wins by one more point (threatening IT above it), but an unblockable QI looked to win by 1.
>Mike_Frentz: EOW J13 .WE +14 395
#note QI is unblockable.
>dacrON: I 10N .I +11 394
#note wow! go ahead one turn to see solutions, and a challenge (?) for the observer.
