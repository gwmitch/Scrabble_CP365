>Sue_T.: AVW C7 VAW +30 30
>Matthew: AELRSUY 8A RE...... +45 77
#note I knew it was going to be tight between YUK and REAWOKEN. 27 points is a lot to give up, not to mention giving up leaving the line open. Quackle ends up prefering YUK. Tsk. (-2.0)
>Sue_T.: EZ F6 ZE. +36 66
#note As it turns out, YUK would have blocked Sue's play.
>Matthew: ALOSSUY 10C SLAY +25 102
#note 9F SLAY. Wow, I like flushing nine points down the toilet. Dumbass. (-14.5)

>Matthew: DEFLNOT H10 F..NED +30 254
#note I really wanted to play my seven. FANTOD is a word I don't know. (-11.0)
>Sue_T.: AE 10L .EA +13 201
>Matthew: ?LLLOOT B12 LOLL +12 266
#note I need to not be stupid here. 13C LOT wins the sim, but LOLL is still good for a 91% win. (-5.8)
>Sue_T.: ACO G4 OCA +16 217
>Matthew: ?DFOOOT H1 FOOD +35 301
#note Crappy draw, but no complaints about this play. 96.44 win%.
>Sue_T.: ABENRRT 14D BANT.RER +64 281
>Matthew: ?EIIOTT 13D IT +17 318
#note I really hated this play for opening JIBE. It ends up simming fine.
>Sue_T.: ADIRY I3 DAIRY +24 305
>Matthew: ?EIIIOT -IIO +0 318
#note I should have jumped on LIE. This game is winnable without a bingo, and the board is not open. So why am I still playing for a bingo. (-9.7)
>Sue_T.: CEU 15A C.UE +35 340
>Matthew: ?DEIIMT B5 MI +13 331
#note Wow. Didn't make Q's top ten, but sims up to second. I was playing for an ING bingo. 6N MI sims best, which I don't get. (-3.8)
>Sue_T.: AITX 4A TAXI +29 369
>Matthew: ?BDEIMT A1 BIT. +18 349
#note I'm being retarded here. I'm trying to block QUIT because I can't see her other spots: QUIETEN and QUOTHA. I guess my excuse is that end games are hard to solve with a blank on each rack. Yeah, let's go with that.
