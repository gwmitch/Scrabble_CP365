#note Or MALFED.
>Evans: AAEGIOT D3 GOA +20 54
#note Seems less insane than AGIO.
>Sam: ACDRRTT F4 TAD +24 48
#note Not sure if I'd take the points here -- DART 6D seems better.
>Evans: AEGIMNT 7H MINTAGE +70 124
>Sam: CLNORRT 8L TORC +29 77
>Evans: BIIORUZ 3B ZI. +26 150
#note RUBIGO M3, RUBATI L4 and BRUIT K3 all have the superior IOZ leave, and none of them opens the Z for an easy comeback like ZIG does.
>Sam: BLNNORW N2 BROWN.. +28 105
>Evans: BIOQRUV O1 QI +37 187
#note Ugh, what a hideous leave. I should play VIBRATO keeping just QU.
>Sam: AALNSTX 4L AX.N +24 129
>Evans: BELORUV 5H BEVOR +22 209
#note Ugh, this sucks. I spent four minutes looking for a play above AXON, and I miss BURLER and RULER? Well, about three of those four minutes were spent convincing myself that BELOR was ROBLE, not LOBER, and that LOVER had no anagrams. Of the remaining minute, 45 of the 60 seconds were spent laughing at Sam for pouring his 19th glass of water. So I really only spent 15 seconds missing BURLER and RULER.
>Sam: ACLSTVY 3L VA. +36 165
>Evans: DDGIILU J3 DI.I.G +13 222
>Sam: CEELSTY 9K LEYS +38 203
#note I don't think either one of us knew the SWEEPY hook. SCYTHE and SHELTY are both better than LEYS. Also, BROWNERS*. I suspected that but didn't have the balls to challenge.
>Evans: ?DLNRUU 3H DU. +6 228
#note Seeing both sevens in this rack made me sad. Anyway on one hand, I like my play here -- I don't want to play anything that opens the board and lets him come back. On the other hand, my lead is only 19 now and I have a blank -- I should probably stop playing like I'm a huge favorite. I can open the board, bingo with the blank and then play defense. Quackle's choice of LULU K9 may not be that insane after all.
>Sam: ACE 9G ACE +22 225
>Evans: ?EFLNRU B1 FU.E +32 260
#note All right, big decision time now. I can play FUZE, which creates sudden volatility -- there's now two ways to bingo or otherwise score big, both from the F up top, or down column A. He can't block both, and maybe LNR? will bingo next turn in one of those lanes. It's also giving him a spot to bingo or otherwise score big, and he gets first crack at the two spots. My other option is FUD, which is much safer. I didn't like FUD at the time because I had no idea what would happen with my ELNR? leave on this board. Where am I supposed to bingo? Knowing SWEEPY would have helped me answer that question, but that's an awful lot of specificity, not only making the blank an S but putting it in positions 1-3. I guess I could draw one of the SSS? in the pool, though. That might help. But seriously Quackle... 61 percent bingos? What else do I have besides SWEEPY? Into an F? From a Z or a W? I don't think so.
>Sam: EEIILNT A1 IN +23 248
#note WIENIE D8 is interesting. All of a sudden the board's not so closed anymore, and he's got vowels to play through with his LT leave to draw a bingo. Also it digs for blanks -- even if he reads me for having one, there's still a second he can draw.
>Evans: ??LNRRS G8 ..R +5 265
#note Obviously if I know SWEEPY, I play SNARLER. Quackle's second choice is to burn a blank for NURLS A4! I didn't think about this at the time, but it actually makes sense. There's a P and two H's unseen, so he could score a ton in this spot. If I can score 18, block the spot, and keep R?, then why not do it? It's certainly better than fishing, which is what I end up doing.
>Sam: AEEIJLT 11D JAIL +28 276
#note Could have just played JEE, but instead Sam tries a phony four on me. How stupid. Oh, wait... I let it go? Okay then, how brilliant. (For the record, I've studied PARLING so PARL* seemed like a word. PARLING an inflection of PARLE, not PARL*.
>Evans: ??HLNRS -HL +0 265
#note Worst play of my life? Just maybe.
>Sam: AEEIIRT A4 AERIE +21 297
>Evans: ??EENRS B8 SNEERed +66 331
#note I didn't think about the PARLE hook until later in the game, so I miss a bunch of superior bingos here. ENDORSE 12A is best.
>Sam: IOOSSTU 12D OI +24 321
#note This makes sense. The pool's ugly enough that I'm not going to bingo. I might prefer RIOT (or ROOT), but this works too.
>Evans: HHKNOTU 13A K.NT +24 355
#note AIT/THUNK wins 100 percent of the time! Taking away big scoring plays with the JAILS hook is crucial here, and I didn't find a way to do it. I deserve to lose here.
>Sam: OOPSSTU A13 .OS +22 343
#note This is the only win. If he takes SPOUT right away, I have OKEH for 40 and the sure win. Instead he plays off OS first, blocking OKEH, and then he has two nice spots for SPOUT.
>Evans: EHHLOTU 12G EH +16 371
#note Blocking the best SPOUT spot. This is best.
>Sam: OPSTU 14D SPOUT +20 363
>Sam:  (HLOTU) +16 379
