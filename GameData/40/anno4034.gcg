#note TWEAK is better.
>Stefan: ?EENPTY H8 .NtETYPE +89 89
#note Now now.
>Evans: AEEHRTV F6 HEAVE +33 55
#note Sims right up there with K6 THRAVE. I like this better because it's a bit more volatile and I'm an underdog now.
>Stefan: EEILOTZ J2 ZEOLIT. +38 127
#note Cool play. Wins the sim -- ZEOLITE 11G, ZEP 14F and POETIZE are all worse.
>Evans: BEIIRTU 2J .IBET +32 87
#note This is probably best, but you could make an argument for UBIETY 13C just to ditch that U. I wanted points here.
>Stefan: CIRVX M1 C.RVIX +36 163
#note Heh. Never seen the word on a Scrabble board before.
>Evans: FHIJRSU E10 FUJI +33 120
>Stefan: ABY E5 BAY +26 189
>Evans: AHLMPRS G11 HAM +28 148
#note Really terrible play. First of all, I didn't know ZIBETH; second of all, I didn't even consider taking the points with FUJIS/PLASH or FUJIS/PLASM; third of all, I missed the cute LIMPA K1. This is like a 17-point mistake.
>Stefan: EINNU G2 ENNUI +12 201
>Evans: DELPRSU O2 SLURPED +100 248
#note Don't think I've ever scored 100 exactly in a turn before.

>Evans: AAGMRST 15G R.GMATAS +62 310
>Evans: AAGMRST --  -62 248
#note NO!! Not REGMATAS!! MEGASTAR!! This is a big now.
>Stefan: ?ADIINO 15A IODINAt. +77 306
#note Nice find.

>Stefan: ACLNOST 5C CA. +7 339
#note This fishes, but I'm not sure what for. I don't know what I think of this play.
>Evans: EGNORRT M10 R..T +14 401
#note This is much less insane than the other things I was considering.
>Stefan: DELNOST J10 D.. +11 350
#note "Let's just hope you mistracked." ~Stefan
>Evans: AEGGNOR 13A GAG +24 425
#note I should take out the bottom-right TWS with TONGA or TANGO. All his best plays are in the bottom-right corner -- I can block them all in one fell swoop.
>Stefan: EELNOST O10 S.OLEN +21 371
#note Ooh, LESSON N9!
