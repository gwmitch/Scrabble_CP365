#note This was the point I started to feel guilty for the racks that were just falling into my lap.  Recants is a little bit better.

#note Had some really clunky letter and wanted to get rid of them.  Was thinking plover.  Plove is not good.  Some of my wins get tainted by errors.

#note Took me a while to pull the trigger on this because I thought I would create a big X play; then I saw I had the last remaining i.  If she wanted something big, she would have to burn the blank, which I assumed she had.
