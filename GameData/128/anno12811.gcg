>John: EHU 8G HUE +12 12
#note I would have figured after 4 losses in a row that things would ease up, but I'm apparently still enough in contention to play John again.  
>Matt: FGORRSW J7 FROW +25 25
>John: ADEEINT 10F ANTI.EED +64 76
>Matt: AEGNRSV L4 ENGRAV.S +76 101
#note Yeah, I'm not giving him the S to play from.  
>John: OXY 11E OXY +40 116
>Matt: ?AILNQZ 5J QI. +24 125
#note Banking that I can cash AZAN next turn.
>John: ?IKNOST D8 INKpOTS +85 201
#note Nice.  Also INKSPOT#.  
>Matt: ?ALNNTZ 8L .ZAN +39 164
#note Whenever I can draw a duplicated N, I will.  Sheesh.  Maybe NAZI is better based on his next play.
>John: EOT 9L .ETO +26 227
>Matt: ?ELNPTT 12C T.PE +20 184
#note PETIT for 1 more, dumping an extra consonant.
>John: ACINRY E4 CAIRNY +29 256
>Matt: ?ADLNOT C2 sANDLOT +69 253
#note I lose the game here.  I figured that this was the bingo line most like to be hit back.  So that's why I didn't go for DALTONs 13F.  ANTICOLD is 76 and would have also worked with my next rack.
>John: EHLO 13B HO.EL +36 292
>Matt: DEIILOS 14B IO. +19 272
#note He blocked DOILIES.  Of course.  
>John: AJR B1 RAJ +31 323
>Matt: DEFILLS F5 IF +28 300
#note Not a great leave, but the right draw can hit a bingo at 14F, and this keeps me in hailing distance.
>John: MUV G3 VUM +17 340
#note Thought the O's were gone, but he must have had the case O at this point.  Very hard for me to block.
>Matt: ADEGLLS 15A GEL +22 322
>John: AW A1 AW +26 366
>Matt: ABDLRSU N6 BL.. +12 334
#note Now I commit to bingoing.  If I track right and see there's an O still left, I should play at M2, something like BUD.
>John: CEIOPRS 2F COPIERS +78 444
#note Maybe I can survive this if I play DALTONs and follow that up with DOILIES the very next turn.  
>Matt: ADMRSUU 1H UM +28 362
>John: BDEEIT O1 BETIDE +34 478
>Matt: AADGRSU M3 GAS +23 385
#note SUGAR 14F.
>John: EI 10B EI. +9 487
#note FROWIE# is 12, that's cool.  This game was winnable, I just didn't make the right choice at the pivotal play and John played very effectively (as usual).  
>John:  (UARD) +10 497
