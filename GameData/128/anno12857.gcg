>Matthew_Larocque: ?ISTUVW F8 .UV +15 15
#note I'd rather not keep the V, U, or W here - but I have to keep one unless I exchange. I figured setting up an s-hook would be to my advantage. V(O)W works too, but gives him an easy hook to use.
>Eric_Tran: AEX 9H AXE +39 115
>Matthew_Larocque: ?FILSTW 10J WILT +30 45
#note I didn't even put much thought into finding a bingo because I dismissed it too quickly. I also didn't know WISTFUL. SWIFTLy should have been easy though because there aren't very many ways to arrange these letters. I can't really afford misses such as this if I'm playing higher rated players.
>Eric_Tran: AEGMOU L7 MOU.AGE +22 137
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CFORST N4 FaCTORS +79 124
#note I wimped out of playing CrOFT(E)RS, and I didn't think playing FaCTORS for 82 at 14A was worth the 3 extra points. I didn't know the word COFFRETS. *CROFTED is the phony.
>Eric_Tran: DEENO O1 DONEE +28 165
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEINOT O7 ODE +25 149
#note Yuck. I really did spend forever on this rack and still failed to obtain my 72 points. It wouldn't have hindered his next play too much, but this is still a pretty awful miss.
>Eric_Tran: DEEILOS 11C OILSEED +74 239
>Matthew_Larocque: AFILNTW 12A WAFT +37 186
#note Or FAWN, WAIF. I think I shoulda played FAWN.
>Eric_Tran: CIKOPR 13G POCKI.R +42 281
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGHILN A10 HA.ING +39 225
#note HANIWA, nice word. I'm pretty screwed so might as well just keep scoring.
>Eric_Tran: AIV K5 VIA +16 297
>Matthew_Larocque: AAELRTU 9A TAU +18 243
#note For some reason I have it in my mind that UNTHAWING is a word, and I feel like it might be a long shot way to make this a bit closer.
>Eric_Tran: Q 6J Q. +31 328
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHJLRY 14F JAY +38 281
#note I didn't hesitate much here, but I should have in order to play YEH 7G for 45. I don't know, the X usually screams hotspot and I still forgot about it.
>Eric_Tran: AB N1 AB +19 347
>Matthew_Larocque: EHILRRR A7 RE....... +48 329
>Matthew_Larocque: EHILRRR --  -48 281
#note Nothing to lose... since I've still forgotten about the X and nothing jumps out as a good play I try a stupid phony.
>Eric_Tran: NOPU 15D UPON +21 368
>Matthew_Larocque: EHILRRR E5 LIR. +8 289
#note Geez. I know it's a blank T and all, but it's just getting silly now.
>Eric_Tran: ITZ 6B ZIT. +33 401
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEHRRS F2 RHEAS +30 319
#note Sim suggests ERAS in this spot. Even if I draw an outbingo I won't win, so emptying the bag isn't really that big a deal. Just thought maybe I could get lucky and score 30 and then bingo. 
>Eric_Tran: IMR B6 .IR.M +35 436
>Matthew_Larocque: EEELNRS 14L SEEL +21 340
#note Not sure what the best way to play this is. 7G SER wins in the sim, but what do I do with EELN next turn? Champ came up with (I)N at C6. So I'd guess he would play either TY(IN) or T(H)Y. I'd play something like SEEL 14L which also blocks his (I)NN. If he playes (I)NN first, I have outplays.
