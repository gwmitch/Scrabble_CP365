>Peter_Armstrong: FFIORSX 8H FOX +26 26
#note His actual rack. Nice play!
>Noah: ?AAEEIV 7E EAVE +16 16
#note All I thought of was that he could be setting up his J (or maybe Y, though unlikely). If I sniffed out FOXFIRES FOXTAILS, FOXGLOVE, etc. as possibilities, EAVE 7J is better.

#note Looked for awhile, but didn't see the best play until a couple turns later.

>Noah: ADELRST 3I DARTLES +75 223
#note Since I'm taking a lead, I chose this placement since it leaves more scoring spots open.

#note As I expected, SCROOGE is the only possible bingo for Peter...on row 15. However, I spaced on the F, which adds FIREDOGS and FORGOERS! JAW is the play here, still giving me a chance after those bingos, and allowing me to block any of them with GLAZE if he fishes. While it also allows something like OUTSCORED or OUTRIDERS, I can still beat such a bingo.
