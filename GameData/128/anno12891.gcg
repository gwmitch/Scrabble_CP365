#note Wow...I thought of PENNONs but not the obvious spot for it.

#note While OX scores the most, this saves a likely X play for next turn and really limits Mike's options.

#note This isn't a good play. I thought Mike might challenge because this word is an island six and he surely has studied BEDEVIL, but perhaps hasn't seen BELIVE before. But this is still a bad play. If I had 100% confidence Mike would challenge, it would be okay. But it's not even close to that, since there's a good probability he's seen the word and also a good probability that I just gave him a spot for a bingo. BEY, which I also thought about, is probably better than this, but EVENLY, which I didn't see, is certainly best.

#note I wasn't sure of the correct play here. Quackle suggests 15L AVOS, to block ORC. Seems good. AVISO is also better than this play.
