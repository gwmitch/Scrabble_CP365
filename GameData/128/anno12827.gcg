#note conrad said there was a case to be made for not insta-challenging and playing HABITAT for more points. i think letting the opp get away with a phony bingo is a huge penalty, but maybe i'm completely wrong about that. it makes more sense if it's a stem bingo too. i actually didn't notice habitat anyway though. he said something like "must be genetics" but i still HAVE to block the bingo; i woulda rather played something like 1H BOAT. ABA sims best (i suck) (-2.5)
