#note i had visions of playing BODIFUL*/VENDU* and decided it was more likely that i'd get struck by lightning than that would stay -- and i'd still lose even if it did stay. this was my favorite move of the tournament. if QI is in the bag, it might be so automatic that she won't realize it just empties the bag, and if I luck out I can win this one. DOUBLE is ok too but scores less and bingoes less.
