>Emanuel: EEGU 8E EUGE +10 10
>Matt: ACIJNQW 7C JAW +26 26
#note I should probably play QIN# first, to set up JAW next turn.
>Emanuel: IO 6E OI +10 20
>Matt: AACIINQ 5F QI +22 48
>Emanuel: ?DEIORT H8 .ROTIsED +77 97
#note I was surprised he made this an S instead of a Z, maybe he was trying to draw a challenge.
>Matt: AACIKNR H1 CAIRN +36 84
#note Yeah, might as well dump the other A for 3 more points.  Wasn't solid on KIRANA#, only KINARA.
>Emanuel: DUX 10G D.UX +28 125
>Matt: AEEHKOS 1E HOE.AKES +68 152
#note Yay more delicious food!  
>Emanuel: AHY 2J YAH +41 166
>Matt: AAEGLMT 2D GAM +27 179
#note Oh man I whiffed on ALMAGEsT.  That's disappointing.  I mean, I'm pretty sure he designated the blank as an S.  I should have at least looked harder and found GLEAM, setting up my A for next turn.
>Emanuel: IIMN G12 MINI +18 184
>Matt: AAELNOT F11 TALON +23 202
>Emanuel: ENWZ 3G W.ZEN +44 228
#note Back and forth we go.
>Matt: ADDEEIP 8A PEA +24 226
#note Not sure why I was blind to WIZENED this turn.
>Emanuel: FFVY -FFVY +0 228
>Matt: DDEEILR 3G .....ED +46 272
#note But I got it this turn at least.
>Emanuel: OSV I5 SOV +23 251
>Matt: DEEILRT 9B LIED +27 299
#note All of these homeless bingoes.  With tempo, there's no need for me to be reckless with bingo lanes.
>Emanuel: GIRT 11H .RIG +21 272
>Matt: AEFRRTU 10A EF +27 326
#note I can't do anything about TRIG right now, so I went for points.  I'm still blind to 4L, TERF# scores 39.
>Emanuel: NOSTY L11 STONY +30 302
>Matt: ?ALRRTU E11 UR +14 340
#note Yeah, why not play YURT, now that I have the blank?  
>Emanuel: ELRSV A10 .LVERS +39 341
>Emanuel: BFIOOTT (challenge) +5 346
#note Couldn't remember this one at all, and decided it was worth taking the chance at a 5 point hit with the blank in tow; if this is no good I have the game locked up.
>Matt: ?AACLRT 15K L.ART +24 364
#note Hah!  Find the bingo.  That's insane, I didn't even look there, and I'd never come up with it even if I did.
>Emanuel: BFIOOTT 3B FOOT +23 369
#note His actual rack.  We discussed if he had any good options, but unless the blank is in the bag things are looking dire.  He considered BITTOR#, but I bingo out afterwards with PAUNCEs#.  Yeah the other B was in the bag, bad luck.  
>Matt: ?ACENPU A1 PeACE +41 405
#note UNPACkER.  I looked down to the R and T but just couldn't see anything.  A sloppy game to wrap up this tournament, but I'll take the win.
>Emanuel: BBIT 13A .BB +14 383
#note Wow he has an outplay, can you find it?  Pretty sick.
>Matt: NU 4C UN +14 419
#note I turned in my results slip to Jason Idalski, raised my hands, and said "I am winning all of the games."  I was so exhausted by the rollercoaster of the past 5 days, but ultimately I did enjoy my first Nationals.
>Matt:  (IT) +4 423
