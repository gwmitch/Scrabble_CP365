>Matt: ENOQRVX 8G VOX +26 26
#note Easy, but I am really getting sick of seeing the Q without the U show up on my rack every damn game.
>Marty: BUY 9H BUY +23 23
>Matt: AEINNQR 10G QI +16 42
>Marty: DEFINSU K5 INFUSED +103 126
#note My bad luck continues.
>Matt: ADENNNR L10 NAN +11 53
#note I don't like it but what else am I going to do?
>Marty: EIMP 8K .MPIE +36 162
#note Held it but released.  UMPY# as well, slang for umpire in Australia.  
>Matt: DEFNRWW -WWF +0 53
#note LOL. One might say I was bodyslammed by that draw.  Suplexed even.   Sure I could play FEW for 22, but I was starting to get frustrated by my bad luck in these past few rounds.  
>Marty: ADIT 11E ADIT +27 189
>Matt: ?EEGNNR O8 .NGiNEER +77 130
#note uNGREEN# goes for 81.  Didn't know it.  This keeps row 13 open which I probably will need at this deficit.
>Marty: ABCHI 12A BIACH +35 224
#note Yep, that means what you think it means.  I luv Collins.
>Matt: CGORSTT B10 GR.OT +20 150
#note Gah, CGTT draw after a bingo.  At least I had a good option to balance here.
>Marty: ADEFINR 13H FREDAIN. +80 304
>Marty: AKO (challenge) +5 309
#note Very nice fit.  I'm pretty sure it's good but I don't have a shot in this game otherwise.  
>Matt: CLLMSTZ J12 L.Z +32 182
#note I just can't help but laugh at this.  I'm sunk.
>Marty: AKO A12 .OAK +34 343
>Matt: CLLMSTV -CLLMV +0 182
>Marty: AEJLRRT 10B .RRL +11 354
#note As in riot grrl#.  I know the TWL acolytes think this is ridiculous, but I don't have a problem with this word like I do with MEDCINAL#, for example.
>Matt: ADEESST 6H STA.DEES +63 245
#note Maybe I can draw something like RIOJAS next turn.  If I'm insanely lucky.  Not likely the way this day is going.
>Marty: IIW O3 IWI. +11 365
>Matt: EEOOTWY H2 YOWE. +15 260
#note I didn't know what to do here at all.  OYEZ scores 26 and leaves the top of the board alone, that does look best to me.  This actually doesn't sim too badly by winning percentage.  
>Marty: AA G4 AA +9 374
>Matt: EEHLLOT N2 THOL. +28 288
#note Noooo, I have always wanted to play THEELOL.  HOYLE looks good, it opens up Row 1 for -ES bingoes next turn, if I draw well.
>Marty: EIORSTU D3 STOURIE. +68 442
#note Scored as 66.  
>Matt: CEEJLMO 6B JO.LE +30 318
#note Just trying to end the game at this point.  Champ Player approves of my play FWIW.
>Marty: ?AEGOPV 8A VOG.E +27 469
>Matt: CEMTU M1 TEC +28 346
#note This is right too, blocking zAP and all the other plays.
>Marty: ?AP N11 PA.t +17 486
#note Another disheartening game where I fell behind big very early and couldn't mount any sort of comeback because of awful drawing in the midgame.  Bleh.
>Marty:  (MU) +8 494
