#note wasn't totally sure if it took the S or not, but it seemed a little better than FOU
>Peter: ?EGILOZ D1 GLOZE +37 245
#note his actual rack, I believe
>JD: AEEOORT E4 AE +23 225
#note this is my first play of the game that quackle really dislikes. OATER wins the sim, scoring and flipping over extra tiles in search of a blank or one of the 3 esses. my play is worse because the board is kind of closed.

>Peter: ??AIQSU --  -194 245
#note in this case, it turns out I was screwed all along
>JD: EOORTUX F11 .OUX +27 252
#note I now know his rack. however, I didn't spot LALIQUES/SILIQUAE which is about ~120 as opposed to he ~100+ for his other bingoes. OX at F3 is therfore the best play, still giving me a chance to bingo next turn.

#note it seemed that I might as well try creating a lane. quackle suggests HAD at L12 trying to draw the case E. my chances look slim.
>Peter: ACV K11 VAC +27 436
>JD: ADGILSW 3C W. +20 396
#note nothing I can really draw, might as well score with WILD at A7 and try to draw an out.
