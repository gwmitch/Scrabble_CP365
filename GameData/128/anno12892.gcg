#note KUDU is another option, an option which I didn't see. I'm not sure which is best. KUDU leads to a low equity, high entropy board. DUKED leads to a high equity, low entropy board.

#note 3A SYN 21 and 8G YID 7 are strong plays that don't open two good scoring spots. They look better.

#note With the JO spot I liked ORRT better than IRRT. I also liked ORRT better than ORRT because IRRT seems better than ORRT on boards with a lot of potential bingo spots for it, and this doesn't look like one of those boards. On the other hand, there are more Os than Is left in the pool. Honestly, the difference is probably negligible.
>Peter_Armstrong: AEEILPT F8 EPILATE +68 307
>Noah: ?AEORRT 12F .ERATORs +66 343
#note There are a few good options here: this, MORTAREd M1 and ROT L3. I thought about the former but not the latter. I think I should've played ROT, because this is a great board for bingos and ROT scores well enough. Knowing when to pass up the bingo and when not to is really tough for me, and something I regularly got wrong both ways.
>Peter_Armstrong: COT L3 COT +30 337
>Noah: AELNOTV H12 .OVE +21 364
#note I also considered TROVE and 2F VOILE 24. I liked this play over VOILE. because it reduced the entropy of the D hook. I think I must have miscounted the vowels in the pool or something because ALN seems better than ALNT due to the vowel shortage. 
>Peter_Armstrong: EHW 11I HEW +35 372
>Noah: ACHLNOT 13H .H +22 386
#note Though Peter's last play was not ideal, this draw definitely was. Now I have a lot of options. I'd say his rack after HEW is pretty random. I thought my play was really strong here because it played off only one tile while it kept a very stable leave relative to the pool. I could also play AH 10J for some points, but I liked this better because having a balanced rack, especially with the last A, is really useful here. However, there is another good option that i didn't think about: blocking the X spot at N2. I might do this with CHON or OH. Peter is not going to like getting the Q. I am going to hate getting the Q, and my winning chances when I draw the Q sometime in this game are going to be quite bad in general. So I need to hope Peter draws the Q. But if he does, how can I prepare for it? Well, the main way for him to defray the disadvantage of the Q is to score. This can mainly be achieved with the W, Z, and X. The X is probably is the easiest of these tiles to score with. 
>Peter_Armstrong: OX 2M OX +40 412
>Noah: ACLNOQT 2G Q. +11 397
#note I played this instead of QI 10E because it blocked ZOA, but I should consider that QI 10E blocks WIZ. The only way for me to win is probably drawing ECOTONAL and either not getting it blocked or having him sacrifice quite a bit to block it, so QI placement doesn't really matter. For spread purposes, I might block WIZ because he can't have ZOA if I draw ECOTONAL.
