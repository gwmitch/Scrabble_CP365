>Martin: AILRV 8D VIRAL +24 24
>Matt: ?DFHIIP 9G DIF +20 20
#note Take the points with HIP.  The blank makes the F not so bad to keep.
>Martin: CDEMN E7 M.NCED +22 46
>Matt: ?BEEHIP F10 HE +30 50
#note I'm obviously not in a good state of mind right now, after 5 straight crushing losses.  I should see EPHEBoI at the very least.
>Martin: ARTY 12B TAR.Y +27 73
>Matt: ?ABEFIP 13A FAB +26 76
#note Don't ask me why I didn't play FIB.  
>Martin: BOW 14B BOW +31 104
>Matt: ?EEINOP J3 PEONIEs +67 143
#note EPIgONE for 83.  I need to not let a string of defeats affect my play like this.  This is the lowest scoring of 5 TWL bingoes I could have played.  
>Martin: Q 7I Q. +21 125
>Matt: AIORTXY 15D ORIXA +45 188
>Matt: AGIISTY (challenge) +5 193
#note Drew the challenge here at least.  OXY scores 49.
>Martin: DEERT 14F DETER +30 155
>Matt: AGIISTY 13I YAGIS +37 230
#note No Quackle, I am not playing YAGI there with 3 other S's unseen.  
>Martin: AEELSZ 15J SLEAZE +51 206
#note That hurts, but I still should be in control of this game.
>Matt: EGIINTT O12 GIT. +7 237
#note Good lord I suck.  Just play this at 12L.  Dump the E as well, why not.
>Martin: LUU 12K ULU +15 221
>Matt: EEIJNRT K11 J.. +22 259
#note JADE scores 28 and keeps the potent EINRT. 
>Martin: AAENRST 4C ARSENAT. +68 289
#note And now I have lost control of a game I should be winning with no problem.  Lots of bad mistakes added up to this situation and now I have to scramble.
>Matt: EEINORT K5 RONE +28 287
#note EON scores just 4 less and keeps a more balanced leave.
>Martin: AKSU L7 SKUA +38 327
#note Oh crap.
>Matt: EIMNOPT 10E ..OP +20 307
#note Not sure why I'm trying to fish here, the bingo lines suck.  Play POEM for 32 before he can hit that spot.
>Martin: W G13 W.. +17 344
>Matt: CEIMNTT 5C MET +20 327
#note Hey I remembered ST# this time.  INMATE is probably my best play that I know, behind MICATE#.
>Martin: DIV 6B DIV +22 366
>Matt: CHINOTU M9 HI +20 347
#note I just don't know.  He probably has the blank.  3F HUT apparently wins 1/8 of the time.
>Martin: ?EGILNO 3H LI.OGENs +77 443
>Martin: ?EGILNO --  -77 366
#note dIPLOGEN# is the bingo that plays here.  This gives me a second life, watch how I blow it!
>Matt: CNOOTU H1 OCT.N +21 368
#note OK, I can't actually "blow" it, unless he phonies again.  He had GArE for 25 if I don't give him the C to play to.  I couldn't see the bingo and I was running out of time so I just played this, hoping he would not find anything and I can go out with OU down low.  
>Martin: ?EGILNO 2A NEOLoGI. +78 444
#note Well done by him to find the bingo.  I've gone from being in contention for 1st to 23rd place in the span of 6 lousy losses.  Right after this I called Katie and had a breakdown, then I'd find out about the cheating drama at lunch, by a kid I had stuck up for.  One of my shittiest mornings ever, and I was actually quite glad to have the bye, to have some time to decompress away from the game. 
>Martin:  (UO) +4 448
