>Roy_Kamen: ABIRRY 8G BRIARY +30 30
>Noah: ABEEOOR K6 AE.OBE +16 16
#note OBE looks pretty good here, because it gives the least easy stuff back.
>Roy_Kamen: AFIW J3 WAIF +31 61
>Noah: AEGNORV L1 GOVERN +30 46
#note Maybe WOVE? This play seems fine.
>Roy_Kamen: OX 7H OX +36 97
>Noah: AEIJNNU L11 NINJA +28 74
#note Quackle puts AEIN as TEN MORE POINTS than EU. The U is pretty bad, but I usually fail to realize how bad it really is. I guess i should've played JUN, though I do like that this board is more open. 
>Roy_Kamen: CIO 15J CI.O +6 103
#note Plays like this (along with some stuff he said after the game) indicate that against Roy I should play as open as possible to make him try to close openings.
>Noah: ADEHIMU J10 AMU +18 92
#note Wanting to open as much as possible.
>Roy_Kamen: EGHIINS 1F SIGHIN. +36 139
#note Roy's actual rack.
>Noah: DEHIORU 2E UH +26 118
>Roy_Kamen: EFOTTYZ 3B FYTTE +30 169
#note Roy's actual rack.
>Noah: DEINORV M9 DRONE +28 146
#note I didn't think of fishing plays here. OV(A) is a great way to do this, better than VOW. IV sucks, and I know this, but I didn't come up with much else.
>Roy_Kamen: OOZ 2A ZOO +39 208
>Noah: ILSSTUV 4H SU.V. +9 155
#note LUVS was annoying because it opened a scoring spot AND blocked a great bingo lane. So I played this.
>Roy_Kamen: LLL -LLL +0 208
>Noah: EIILSTT D3 .ITLEIST +68 223
#note Apparently TITLEIST is a golf ball company and this is why I was sure this was a word. Only TITLIST.i
>Roy_Kamen: ??ADNRS H7 ..DAiNeRS +77 285
>Noah: AAACEEL 8A AEC.A +21 244
>Roy_Kamen: EGLMU 15C GLUME. +10 295
>Noah: AEEELRW N8 WEE +15 259
#note I think I overrated AELR here, partially, and underrated AEELR, and didn't realize how difficult WE N13 made things for him. I like WE.
>Roy_Kamen: DEIKLOP O5 POKE +45 340
#note Chickened out on PODLIKE.
>Noah: AELPQRT 10B QA. +32 291
#note PELTeR is best.
