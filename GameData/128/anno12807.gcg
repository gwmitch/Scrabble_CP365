#note This was a tough call.  FEZ E10 scores a lot more than any other play, but it has a lot of problems.  Keeping the extra consonant does me no favors, plus I've changed the board from one in which she didn't have many scoring opportunities to one in which she can easily make big scores off the Z.  It seemed better to clean the rack out the best I could and allow the board to open more, hoping that I'll be able to do even more with the Z soon.
>Marsh_Richards: AGNO 8L AGON +22 50
>Dave_Koenig: AAHHLOZ E9 HAHA +32 74
#note The star play here is GHAZAL#, which I did not know.  Without knowing that, this is one of the better alternatives, as it not only scores well but also creates big opportunities to score with the Z.  However, HOHA# in the same spot was a slight improvement.
>Marsh_Richards: BMO D10 MOB +35 85
#note Marsh underscored this as 34 and neither of us caught it.
>Dave_Koenig: ADEELOZ N8 .OZED +35 109
#note DOZE C11 seemed reckless with the huge number of back hooks.  ZOOEA# N6 manages the rack well, but also gives up friendly back hooks.  Considering that right now seven letter bingos are unlikely to fit on the board, I wouldn't want to be that accommodating.  However, ZOOEAL# and ZOOEAE# are probably a bit better than my play.

>Dave_Koenig: CEIKRST 14F ST.CKIER +76 262
#note A bit of blindness on my part in that I could have played all these tiles one row higher to make STOCKIER for 10 more points.  Given how blocked the board is getting, there is value in making it harder to bingo on row 15, but 10 points is a lot to sacrifice for that advantage at this point in the game.
>Marsh_Richards: ANP N4 NAP +25 220
#note I don't know Marsh's rack, so I can't judge this play too harshly, but this may be an important moment to look for an alternative.  There is a significant danger after this play of the board becoming so blocked up as to make comeback chances very low, as in fact happened in the game.  If she was intent on playing these exact tiles, I might have preferred PAN C11 for only two points less but keeping more bingo lanes open.  I might have also looked for other ways to start tearing open the upper left quadrant of the board before it was too late.  (It's true that she did end up taking away a big X play for me, but I don't think that's the most salient factor.  She might draw the X herself, and having that volatile possibility is good when you're trailing.)

#note I only thought of DEUTERIC and not its anagram CUITERED#, which would have played.  But I am also firmly in the driver's seat after my play.
