#note Cesar: i suck so i chickened out on CALIX. thought it was only CALYX. oh, someday i will study again. someday. (-8)
>Zoarf: ?IKSSSU 14E SUSlIKS +86 239
>Zarfo: IILPRTY -  +0 196
#note Cesar: let me explain why it's right to challenge here, even if i know 100% that SUSLIKS is a word. first of all, it's his third bingo draw out of the bag, and it's an exceptionally low-probability word. it looks like a misspelling of SOUSLIKS which I did know. the chances of him drawing IKSSSU? out of the bag are so low that it is more likely that there is NO word in that rack rather than a word. therefore, i would challenge again, even if i knew the word 100%. makes sense.

Noah: wut?
