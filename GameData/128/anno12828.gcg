>cesar: FIPSTUY 8G YUP +16 16
#note i have quackle on the brain too much. after discussions with the various young bay area phenomena they said fusty was significantly better but YUP is only half a point behind. you guys need to recalibrate :P (-0.5)
>bruce_w: ??ABDIO H1 ABOIDea. +80 80
#note double-blanked again, check. worst-case scenario (seriously, a bingo to a U) check.
>cesar: FINSTTU 3H .UTFIT +20 36
#note i may need to be more open-minded and keep INSTT (with FUB). 3G TOFU also looks better. this was not a well-thought-out play. i always tend to try to score more in these situations, but i especially need to keep a good leave now with no blanks to bail me out. (-2.5)
>bruce_w: AAEH 5D AAHE. +18 98
>cesar: EGNOSTV 4A VENT +26 62
#note VIG is a lot better than VENT. stop trying to score cesar!!!! GANEV sims best. argh. argh. argh. it's ok, GOS can be saved if i don't draw 4 consonants to it. (-10.5)
>bruce_w: HORTY B2 TH.ORY +28 126
>cesar: CGGOPRS L1 GR.G +16 78
>bruce_w: AEW A7 AWE +23 149
>cesar: ACLOPSX 9F POX +36 114
#note sacrifice points to come up with a better bingo leave only to draw the X, check. debating between COX and POX but what about just OX? that like, totally blows my mind, man. also coxal is cool. (-5)
>bruce_w: DEEGR 10C GREED +22 171
>cesar: ACILNRS B9 LAC +19 133
#note i made many suboptimal plays this game and got burned by all them. even though this is less than a point and a half back, 6E LINE doesn't have the problems this does. (-1.5)
>bruce_w: EEJT 12A JETE +44 215
>cesar: INNRSST A12 .INS +33 166
#note i was desperate to bingo and sacrificed an S for that. quackle still likes RSST better (in case i don't bingo). didn't think of that. (-3.5)
>bruce_w: IQ A1 QI +35 250
>cesar: CINRSTV -CNV +0 166
#note playing scrabble is not like making a decision in a vacuum. at this point i'm B1, i had a bad first game, i'm getting killed in this one, the worst case scenarios keep happening for the past four tournaments, and i become unable to find a play like VINCA. maybe i don't have what it takes. (-12.5)

#note i don't understand. how did he not have the Z?
>cesar: AEELOOV 12H .EAVE +24 270
#note 1L GAVE keeps the previous E and is not so violently aggressive. WEAVE is kind of dumb. (-5)
>bruce_w: BZ F12 B.Z +34 348

>cesar: ADILRSS M12 RIL. +20 373
#note ok, i misplayed this pre-endgame quite badly with two minutes on my clock (that's another thing i need to work on), i ended up liking LAIRD best afterwards. quackle likes fishing for a bingo though. 2N SI or E4 SAIL or C2 SIN. what if i don't get it? those score enough that they might be worth it plus more importantly he'll freak out and try to block since i leave one in the bag. but i had two minutes. that's my own fault, i played this game awfully.
