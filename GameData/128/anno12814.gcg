>Matt: AEHIORY 9D HOYA +21 21
#note This game is pretty sloppy, to say the least.  HONEY scores 6 more and keeps a comparable leave.
>Pat: ABINR 10G BRAIN +14 22
>Matt: EEFIKMR 10B FEM +23 44
#note REFIRE is 39, should have played that.
>Pat: DIPV I9 V.PID +17 39

>Matt: ADEIOTU (challenge) +5 102
#note Play the O as well and I score 10 more points.  Drew a challenge.

>Pat: ?AEENSW --  -64 73
#note Yeah that was surprising.  I challenged it off pretty quickly.
>Matt: AEEOOUU C10 .UOUAE +12 208
#note Yay I got to play this word.
>Pat: ?AEENSW 6E AWE +19 92
>Matt: ?BEEGOO 7H GOBOnEE +64 272
>Matt: ACEHNRZ (challenge) +5 277
#note She held, then muttered "What is a GOBONEE", then challenged it.  Once she did that, I started salivating about her S-hooking it next turn.
>Pat: ?EINSTV O1 INVEnTS +90 182
>Pat: ?EINSTV --  -90 92
#note Insta-challenged, at which point she said "Well you must know what a GOBONEE is".
>Matt: ACEHNRZ 15A CH.Z +84 361
#note I'm sorry that I'm putting the hurt on my opponent, but man this game was so cathartic and desparately needed.
>Pat: ?EINSTV M1 INVEST.d +70 162
>Matt: AENORRW 1L W.RE +33 394
#note AERR > ANOR apparently.  Interesting.

>Matt: JMNOORU N10 JOMON. +62 470
#note Phony Yahtzee!  The Collins definition of JOMON specifically says "No -S".  JORUMS is the right play.

#note Trying for one last bingo.

#note I've gained back 275 points of spread at least, and managed to not go winless.  Funny end to a miserable day.
