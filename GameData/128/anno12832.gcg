>JD: FHIIORY 8G HI +10 10
#note kind of an interesting opening rack, FIORY seemed most likely to lead to a bingo to me. quackle disagrees. just FOY or HOY win the sim, IF is pretty close, HI sims about 4-5 back. whatever nonexistent synergy I cooked up here wouldn't be able to make up for the fact that the H is a lot better than the F.

>JD: ?FIORSY --  -86 10
#note well, it was this or SCORIFY, and I figured I would try this one first. Jerry took it off immediately. Turns out PROSIFY# is good in collins, not that that's why I tried it.
>Jerry: AJT 6I TAJ +18 36
>JD: ?FIORSY 6E FOY +27 37
#note I was all set to give SCORIFY a shot, and even put it on the board but then I realized that FOY at 6E was just about as good as bingoing anyway, so I might as well pass up the bingo since I was now a bit uncertain about it. Turns out SCORIFY is the only 7 in FIORSY?. FOY actually wins a sim, tho he knows I have the blank and will presumably make it tough for me to bingo if he can.

#note brimstone is pretty badass! I was all set to try YEHS* but YEPS is the one that's good. YEPS and YUPS are both good.

>JD: GIKNORS 1G KING +33 143
#note jerry blocked SKIORING! I passed up RISK for 6 more, which sims a bit better.

#note nowhere for REVALUE, VENA wins a sim, but UVEAL seemed pretty good with a lead in hand

#note my first missed bingo of the tournament, this is a toughie...but it has zero effect on my win percentage here anyway. funny thing is, my play is phony!!
>Jerry: ADO 4A DO.A +24 222
>JD: ?ABDHIN B6 HA +28 356
#note missed bingo number two, these misses are uglier but again largely inconsequential. if I really wanted spread I could play BAH at M1 and go for a bingo/3x3 on column A.
