>Matt: AEKSVWZ 8G ZEK +32 32
#note Maybe VAW instead?  I like taking the points now with ZEK, but VAW does a nice job of restricting his scoring opportunities next turn.
>Jeremy: BOR 9F BOR +20 20
>Matt: ABEISVW 10B WAVIES +40 72
>Matt: ?ABIINY (challenge) +5 77
#note IIRC, he knew WAVEY took an S, but wasn't sure on WAVY pluralizing like this, so he challenged.  It's precisely why I picked this over WAIVES, since defensively they seem to be similar.  
>Jeremy: EER D10 .EER +14 34
>Matt: ?ABIINY 14A BIrYANI +87 164
#note Yay delicious food!  Also of note: BIRIYANI#.  
>Jeremy: AEM A12 MA.E +33 67
>Matt: EGIILNT 13G LIGNITE +75 239
#note I seriously almost missed this.  Dummy, play the bingo!
>Jeremy: ?AFIRRU 15G sURFARI +82 149
>Jeremy: ?AFIRRU --  -82 67
#note He said he saw UnFAIRER, but being already down 170 points he went for this, which he thought was good.  I held for quite awhile, thinking it was probably good considering Collins can be awesome like that (It's a surfing expedition, a SURFARI*!), but for 5 points I went ahead and challenged.  He was probably thinking of SUFFARI, which is just an alt spelling of SAFARI.  Greatest phoney I've ever had played on me though.
>Matt: CDEIRTW 15G DREW +28 267
#note Duh, TWICE.  TWICER# and TWIRED# are best.
>Jeremy: ?AFIRRU 14M FUR +17 84
#note Again, passing up the bingo for extra volatility while he still holds the 2nd blank.
>Matt: CEIMNPT O12 PI.N +27 294
#note I was all set to play CAMPEr for 40 until he opened up the 3x3.  I should play PERM or MERC since points are good.
>Jeremy: ?ADIORT 7A AsTROID +76 160
#note No, it's not slang for ASTEROID.  This is a geometrical figure.
>Matt: CEEMOTT A4 COM.TE +39 333
>Jeremy: DHU B2 DUH +21 181
>Matt: AESSTTV J3 VASTEST +79 412
#note Luckbox.  
>Jeremy: IJN C1 JIN +27 208
>Matt: AEOQSTY 12K QAT +45 457
#note Double luckbox.
>Jeremy: ADGIN 1C .ADING +48 256
#note Aw, he blocked my JOYOUS play.
>Matt: ENOOSUY 6E YO +16 473
#note Duh, play YOU down column, restricts more lanes and ditches another bad tile.  NOYOUS# I didn't know, that's even better.
>Jeremy: AF 2F FA +28 284
>Matt: AEENOSU 14I EON +29 502
>Jeremy: CLL 4I C.LL +12 296
>Matt: AEOOSUU 12G OO +11 513
#note Blocking stuff like GOX and POX.  
>Jeremy: EGHLORX 12C H.X +13 309
>Matt: AEPSUU M1 PAUSE +21 534
#note Can't play it at M3 for 2 more, since that sets up his R.
>Jeremy: EGLOR 6M REG +14 323
>Matt: U 6A .U +9 543
#note Most of the spread I had bled during that 7-game losing streak I've made back in just 2 games.  Funny game this is.
>Matt:  (LO) +4 547
