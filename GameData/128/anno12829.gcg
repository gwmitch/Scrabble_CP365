#note typically keeping ES and AES are pretty close, but why did i ever think this was a good idea in this series of tournaments? the california open never ended (and also extended backwards a couple of tourneys). (-1)

#note i actually cursed here. i'm really sorry. i missed RIFLIPS though. who has the presence of mind to find plays like that during such a bad streak? top players do. MIR 12 C seems counterproductive (-8.5)

#note i have no chance to win this game anymore after aviate, but i spent like 8 minutes here between trying to find a bingo and trying not to eat all of the tiles one by one. missed a better bingo that i actually remember seeing, so i'm not sure what's up with that. (-9)
