#note This play seemed pretty obvious, so I'm surprised to learn that exchanging BIIO sims best here, presumably because it doesn't give anything back. (-2)

#note Sometimes you just have to hold your nose and swallow. There are some other reasonable options that are tough to spot, but my play sims best. What are some of these other options?

#note No way-- it's FINERY L10, scoring an extra point, keeping a better leave, devaluing row 15, and saving the A hook for next turn. Surprised this is only (-6).

#note Better than PERV, if anything because of NIP K9... but also because of what I drew.

#note Questionable. You could make an argument for DIED B3. However, since there are many bingos starting with OUT- at B8, it doesn't really take out the lane; in fact, it makes the lane more difficult to block.
>Opp: LOOW C5 WOOL +19 303
#note So here's the position. One in the bag. The game is essentially won even if he bingos out. What bingos do you need to watch out for? Can you block all of them? Do you worry about getting stuck with the Q? Do you consider making your opponent worry about it (by passing)? In general, would you play differently depending on who your opponent is (STEE, Wiegand, Quackle)?
