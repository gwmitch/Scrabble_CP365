#note Ugh, UREDIAL. That's so bad I was tempted to pretend I forgot the rack.

#note Awww, MOONPORT! Aside from that, Quackle would rather I just play EAT since this board is already nearly dead.
>Steve: ??BELMS 8H ....BEaM +48 202
#note Rated about eight points above the only bingo (BEDLAMPS).
>Bill: EINORTT 3I TRI.E +16 153
#note Terrible, but I figured the only thing I could possibly try to do here is set up an S-hook to the H1 TWS and hope I draw one, or at least he plays something there and opens the board up a little. Given that he presumably has the other blank in hand and is already up by a bingo, I'm starting to lose interest.
>Steve: QU 11F QU.. +13 215
#note Steve bemoaned that he couldn't do anything good with the STRIPE hook, so he didn't have the I yet. "I guess it's all yours," he grumbled while holding S? and going up by 62. Yeah, I wish.
>Bill: AEGINOT 14M O.. +7 160
#note I have no idea what to do here, as this opens up another lane, but I can't play -ING bingos on either.
>Steve: ?EILNSW 15G SWINdLE +82 297
#note We agreed after the game that a bingo starting with W was probably better, as it makes it more difficult for me to bingo, and he can block up the top of the board if I don't hit this turn.
>Bill: ADEGINT M2 G.D +8 168
#note This is dumb, but understand that I wasn't thinking about winning the game, wasn't really expecting to draw into a playable bingo next turn, and just wanted to give myself a hotspot to actually score some points if he didn't have an A. The clear best play is 12C GADI, which scores the most, keeps the E, doesn't close the current lanes, and actually gives letters to play THROUGH. The only disadvantage is that it turns over four with a good rack.
>Steve: ARVY 1L VARY +48 345
#note Just simulating with this rack, it takes over 1000 iterations for Steve's win percentage to fall under 100%.
>Bill: AEINNST 14A STANINE +70 238
>Steve: BGOUUVX 13C BOX +43 388
#note Actual rack. Steve knew the pool was dangerous, but decided to just take the points. The simulation says BOX wins about 97.5%, while a number of plays blocking the triple-triple win about 99%. It all depends on how paranoid you are, and this time he wasn't paranoid enough.
>Bill: ACEFILO A8 FOCALI.E +176 414
>Steve: EGUU -  +0 388
#note Lost challenge. Steve liked it, but there aren't many ways for him to win if it stays.
>Bill: AHIJLNO 12C OH +27 441
>Steve: EGUU 8A .UGUE +10 398
>Bill: AIIJLNS 1H SALI.... +42 483
#note F5 JINS is better for spread by 23 points, but I didn't know the outplay (a dead six), and this is more fun, anyway.
