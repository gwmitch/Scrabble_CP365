#note I don't like this staircase move - makes his next play too easy.  NAMING I would prefer.  plus, SING looks good but can turn really bad.

#note Sim likes VIA to open bingo line. I, rather, tried to preserve the open E.  AI(T) is good as it forces him to open, and doesn't give him much.

#note HWANS is phoney - only SHAWN.  I thought it wasn't good, but got greedy for pts.  Luckily, this stays.

#note My losing play of this game, and to cash.  Just dumb.  I know it's bad, but I get lazy to look for a good play so just slap this down.  Awful.
