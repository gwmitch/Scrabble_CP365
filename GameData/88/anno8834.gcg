#note NAZI 14H actually sims better than bingoing! Easy to see why -- Marlon recently played two esses and he's unlikely to have a third now with 74 tiles still left. NAZI opens a pair of S-hooking bingo lines, 15 and L. It's an interesting volatility play, but I'm not that desperate yet. I'll take the points by bingoing now and staying within the necessary 58.

#note Had to feel pretty good at this point, dangling a V in the only dangerous bingo line left. But this one's not over.
>Marlon_Hill: AA 13K A.A. +14 260
>Evans_Clinchy: KOOORRT D3 KROO. +18 319
#note Needlessly reckless on my part. ROOK 6E is way better, cutting off multiple bingo lines and putting me in complete control. Didn't consider it.

>Evans_Clinchy: ILORRTY 5C R.OTY +16 335
#note Taking out the double-double lane at this point is definitely correct, but this isn't the best way to do it. How about RYE E5? Keeps things closed, and actually keeps a bingo-prone leave to hit Marlon back if he punches me in da mouf. ILORT is pretty strong with five E's and other friendly things in the pool.
>Marlon_Hill: EH 2A EH +24 304
>Evans_Clinchy: EEHILQR H10 Q. +11 346
#note Sim says trade seven! Apparently with this excellent pool, I'm gonna score an average of 40.8 points next turn. Never even considered that.
>Marlon_Hill: ?ADEILO 1A DOLE +35 339
#note This is Marlon's actual rack. I remember him saying bingoing was wrong because it wouldn't help him win by 58. He needs to score first, bingo later. He liked DO in retrospect, setting up the DOLERITIC threat for later.
>Evans_Clinchy: EEHILNR K9 HE +14 360
#note Sim suggests getting rid of the L, not the H. OLE 6D and BETEL 15A come out on top. It's interesting -- rather than just a straight-up bingo leave, it keeps a scoring tile to hit heavy counterplays if Marlon bingos first. I like it.
>Marlon_Hill: ?AIIRRT I6 RI. +5 344
#note Again this is the correct actual rack, and this looks like a pretty awesome play, opening another bingo line.
>Evans_Clinchy: EILNNRW J3 WIRE +13 373
#note This is the only win, blocking all his possible bingos and threatening an out for next turn (WINE doesn't satisfy the former part because of the front hooks, and WILE doesn't do the latter).
