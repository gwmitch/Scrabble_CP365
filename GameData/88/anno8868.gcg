#note Interesting: Static says 8G FAVA 20.  I guess.

>Ryan_Fischer: AAAEHOT 5J AHA +24 71
#note L8 A(L)THAEA 22?  Nah.  A(L)OHA is a bit more reasonable.

>Ryan_Fischer: ACEOPTZ F2 ZO.C +35 106
#note This is an fascinating position, and the one that probably subtly cost me the game.  I see Z(L)OTE and ZO(I)C.  ZLOTE gives an easy 39-point comeback for my 48 points.  ZOIC is 35.  He's just drawn 7.  I have the case A.  I don't think it's too likely that he's drawn one, but the math determining whether or not he has it and whether it's worth this gambit is a bit beyond me.  I decided down 50, I should roll the dice, especially with the AEPT leave.  I neglected to consider P(L)OTZ which simmed 2nd after 1001 spins 2-ply.  ZLOTE first, ZOIC 3rd, of note: AZOTE, CLOZE, TOPAZ, and CAPOTE.

#note Only.

#note Well, that's interesting.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIIMNS 3M MID +20 222
#note I considered 13I MI 18 but saw too many things that could hurt me.  Even still, I should've put him on a bingo rack.  Ugh.

#note Ow!  (silly word, I held for a good while.)
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGINNS 14E INNAGES +70 313
#note First time I've played this.
>Mark_Edward_Owens: GRU H12 GU.R +21 321
#note Well, that gives me a line, but he's gotta be close too.  This is touch and go.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIINPR 1N PI +17 330
#note I made this play pretty quickly, low on time, figuring I'd be likely to hit something (if he didn't -- gulp).
>Mark_Edward_Owens: ENNO 15C NONE +9 330
#note So odd.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEILNR 3F .E +8 338
#note Just have to pray he doesn't hit first.
>Mark_Edward_Owens: ADEILNT 12A DELATIN. +74 404
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIKLNR A12 .ARK +27 365
#note Champ says I2 (U)K(e) 11 wins 32.12%.  Whoa.  You've gotta figure a human player is just gonna close all those lines, though.  I just thought I'd roll the dice on scoring and maybe hitting the E.  I was so low on time and couldn't think of much else to do.
>Mark_Edward_Owens: JOY B10 JO.Y +35 439
>Ryan_Fischer: EEILNOT C8 ETOI.E +37 402
#note With 0:00 on my clock I threw this down.  Phew!

#note D5 (D)AWTIE 26 and out.  Ooh!
>Ryan_Fischer: LN 11K ..N +6 408
#note Yeah, didn't see the new spot for my L he created.  Made this play in a fraction of a second, miraculously keeping 0:00 on my clock!  :)
