>Tim_Michaels: HPU 8G HUP +16 16
>Ryan_Fischer: AADEQSV H7 Q.AD +14 14
#note Hmm... Q(U)A better?  What I played gives ME the sole hook.
>Tim_Michaels: EIW I6 WI.E +26 42
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEESVY 6I .AVEY +16 30
#note I don't want to burn my S just yet when I can set it up here and maybe win a challenge (and balance my rack better than any of the higher-ranking plays).
>Tim_Michaels: AGRY K3 GRA.Y +24 66
>Ryan_Fischer: AEOOSSU 10F OU.S +17 47
#note Meh.  Or N6 SOU 22?  Nah, that gives way too much and takes my hook too soon.
>Tim_Michaels: EHNORT 11B HORNET +22 88
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEOSS N2 CODAS +37 84
>Tim_Michaels: EINN -  +0 88
#note Lost challenge.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEFGIS O3 FED +20 104
#note Hehe, I could play those same 3 letters, flipped around, left two columns, for 36 points!  Oops!
>Tim_Michaels: EINN 12A NINE +21 109
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIILNS B11 ..LI +14 118
#note C7 LESI(ON)ING 74.  Oops.

#note H7 (QUAD)S 25?  Mine's 6th, 2nd highest scoring.  14D LI 6 is interesting, but incredibly risky.  3H is another option.
>Tim_Michaels: EX 12G EX +20 164
#note He said he had the option here of burning the blank for EXTERN for 40-something.
>Ryan_Fischer: ILRSTTW 9C WRIT +14 170
#note Of course I'm not going to get WRISTLET.  And here, I can't afford to open up something like WILT, with 3 Rs left, and exposing that DLS-TWS.  This is a teeny bit safer.
>Tim_Michaels: INR 3H RIN. +11 175
#note That's interesting.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDLSSTZ I2 Z.. +12 182
#note I saw C(HILI)S after I hit my clock.  Didn't consider S(EX)T.  Perhaps I should have.  Z(IT) is trouble because I have my class pictures tomorrow.  Er, I mean it's trouble because if he bingos I only have one plausible spot of bingoing back instead of two.  Depending on what he bingos with, of course.  I think I'm limiting his options, but I'm really limiting my own.
>Tim_Michaels: JOOU -JUOO +0 175
#note He started to put down JU(G) before he exchanged.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDLSSTV B10 C....S +19 201
#note I think I have to take the points here, rather than exchange.
>Tim_Michaels: ??INORT 13H INTROns +71 246
#note There are a lot of 9s from (EX).  Here, I held, 'cause it seemed so unfamiliar, but he had so much other stuff he could play.  I really thought I was sunk, but made a last-ditch effort to salvage the game.  Of incredible note: cOINTeR(RING) 3A 72!  And: (ES)cORTINg 15A 74.
>Ryan_Fischer: DILPSTV K11 VI.L +14 215
#note I have to set up a spot and pray.  L10 DIV(O)T looks like it might work even better.  Either is relatively easy to block, so I guess I have to hope he doesn't.  VIOL isn't it 'cause I don't have an A (and there are 4 left anyway).
>Tim_Michaels: BEOO 8A OBOE +29 275
#note Miraculously he leaves the spot alone.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEPSTU 15E UPDATES +88 303
#note And I get a miracle draw!
