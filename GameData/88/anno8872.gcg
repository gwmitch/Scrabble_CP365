#note fILIBEG for one more point, and I'd much rather put a G in the 3x3 lane than an R. 
>opponent: DEFLNOR 6E .NFOLDER +68 114
#note Or INFOLDER or ENFOLDER (worth the most). I did hold this for a bit. 
>scott_jackson: AEESUVY 15A EVE.Y +30 122
#note this or VEE(r)Y are best, the latter just slightly preferred because it gives a worse bingo lane on the A column.

#note I would've played O(V)ATE 30 but I didn't want to give up the last E. Apparently I should have done so anyway. The bigger priority is keeping the U anyway.
>opponent: ADP 8A DAP +22 303
>scott_jackson: DEIOSTU N8 OUTSIDE +72 382
#note For some reason I didn't play this at 10F, which scores best and also has the best defensive value, giving the least amount of new bingo lanes and shutting down some other ones.
