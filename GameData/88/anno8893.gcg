>Ryan_Fischer: GIIIQRT C2 QI +32 319
#note I could've played QAT to block, but GIIIR isn't going anywhere fast.
>Robin_LaPrelle: CDEINRS 15A CINDERS +93 278
#note And she still would have had RESCIND or DISCERN for 87, so blocking wasn't worth it anyway.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIIRTV 1J .RIVET +30 349
>Robin_LaPrelle: ATU M1 .ATU +14 292
#note At this point, I'm thinking she has at least one of the blanks, and has opened an easy-to-hit lane.  Well, easier.  So I'm thinking I should block.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGIKUU 10H AUK. +18 367
#note Okay, C5 (H)AIKU 22 is pretty cool.  Mine is 2nd.  I like it 'cause it blocks off the S lane, and bingos alongside it.
>Robin_LaPrelle: IIIOU -IIIOU +0 292
#note She's really got me worried now that she's exchanging 5.  I figure she's got at least one of the blanks.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGGIIRU O1 .RIG +7 374
#note I am amazed a bit by Static's top choice, (Z)I(N) for 12.  EGGIRU can lead to some stuff, eh?  I don't see it.  Now she can only bingo from the N or I.  Neither of which is incredibly easy.  Mine sims about 3 points back, which is okay.  3M (T)UI 3 just makes another (more lucrative, incredibly hard to hit) I lane.
>Robin_LaPrelle: INT 7K .NTI +5 297
#note As soon as she plays that and I think she has the blank, the first two tiles I put on my rack ARE the blanks.
>Ryan_Fischer: ??AEGIU J10 .UE +7 381
#note M7 (T)EGUmInA 68.  And the OTHER bingo makes both of the blanks Ls.  Can you find it?  :)  I don't remember the Scientology I used to deduce that (K)UE was the best non-bingo play, but I spent a LONG time and gave up on finding bingos.  Relieved that there are only two that are kind of hard with two blanks.  But still, I should have found one.  The thought goes like this: okay, a lot of Es left, so I should get rid of one.  Wanted to keep the I for a backdoor (F)I(C) play.  BEATIFIC is possible!  But playing KUE won't give me that!  I was thinking BEAUTIFIC* is good, too, but it's not.  The IG, in this case, with the N unseen, could be useful.  And of course, I can make the blank a C or S to hook ANTI if needed.  I think KUE was blocking the I line, too, which is kinda dumb.  Anyway, it was an overload of information that made me do that when really I should've spent what was left of my 15 minutes or so trying to bingo instead of trying to play.  I just didn't try hard enough.

#note All 4 bingos score 65.  ANGIOMAS and ANAGOGIC two ways.  Glad I didn't miss anything on the triple.
