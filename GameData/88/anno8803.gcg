>Jeffrey: AEEEFJO E6 FE.JOA +32 112
#note find is not too difficult, playing JEFE somewhere had its appeal, I do sometimes miss this 6 in the field tho...
>Jason: AAENRTZ 2C ATRAZ.NE +71 177
>Jeffrey: AEEINUV 1J AVENUE +32 144
#note best play, although the rack almost looks like a bingo
>Jason: CFHIL F10 FILCH +44 221
>Jeffrey: INQRSVW G7 V.W +34 178
#note best for the shortie
>Jason: BOY 1A BOY +29 250
>Jeffrey: EINQRSU O1 .NQUIRES +104 282
#note more fireworks!  although someday not seeing the 7 first will cost me.   I thought the E for SQUIREEN would have been cool too...

#note great draw here, good time to have it

#note Q likes GAI(T)ER O10, -8.9, although after the miss earlier I saw GERARDIA potential right away
>Jason: DLLY 10J D.LLY +21 369
>Jeffrey: AEIMRTU 4A ITEM +36 413
#note right spot, wrong length- ITERUM better them, obscure 6, didn't know it
>Jason: PP I12 P.P +7 376
#note this really confused me, so a great play strategically normally, except that I had drawn the case O
>Jeffrey: ACHMORU 13C HA +22 435
#note ok so I was in serious defense mode here, thinking the only way I lose is a column  B bingo, maybe -ING, or Row 4.  I thought about MACHO/MUCHO at L3, just thought binger much more likely @ column B.  I didn't even see the bingo through the T, OUTMARCH/OUTCHARM

>Jeffrey: CDMORUW 15G CROW +35 470
#note Q says I'm supposed to spoil his big J4 play but I didn't see it and neither did he.  I just wanted my out in 2, although CROWD should have occured to me. -23.
