>Evans_Clinchy: ABCCKLU 6H CU.BACK +27 116
#note Missed CUBICAL 5G, which is an awesome way to shut down his scoring options. This sims a couple points back.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?DEILLR 9B fRILLED +68 184
#note Eww, missed COLLIDER!
>Joe_Petree: ATTV D8 V.TTA +24 94
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEOSTU 1L .EDU +21 205
#note Overlooking how juicy that S hook on CUTBACK is. ETUDES/CUTBACKS for 45 sims better than this.
>Joe_Petree: OXY E11 OXY +39 133
>Evans_Clinchy: EIOSTWY C12 TOWY +30 235
#note STEWY O6 and WYE C12 both sim a little better than this. I think if I'd actually bothered to count how many points STEWY was, I'd have played it.

>Joe_Petree: AEGHOPS --  -110 133
>Evans_Clinchy: EEINSTU 15C .E +6 241
#note Joe had telegraphed that he knew HYPOGEA but was unsure about the S, so I've gotta block this lane. I missed a cool way to do it, though -- LUNIES F9. This sims a couple points back.
>Joe_Petree: AEGHOPS B13 HOP +39 172
>Evans_Clinchy: EINNSTU A11 NUT +10 251
#note Pretty weak. Sim again says to take the CUTBACKS hook, this time with UNSENT.
>Joe_Petree: AEEGRSV L6 .VERAGES +76 248
>Evans_Clinchy: DEINOSS O6 SOD +30 281
#note Finally taking out this spot, but a longer play like NOISED would be better.
>Joe_Petree: AMR K10 MAR +22 270
>Evans_Clinchy: EHIIINS 13I HIE. +17 298
#note Not bad, but just fishing off an I with TAXI sims better. Interesting idea with four O's and a blank in the pool to hit INHESION 4C.
>Joe_Petree: AEG F11 GAE +24 294
>Evans_Clinchy: AEIINOS M11 OI +9 307
#note I'm sensing his rack will better than mine, since I could easily draw crap with such a vowel-heavy pool. Mucking up bingo lines felt right.
>Joe_Petree: AO K2 A.O +16 310
>Evans_Clinchy: AEIINOS 8A OI +7 314
#note Sim says to take points now, with EOSIN H11. I thought a bold move like that could wait a little bit.
>Joe_Petree: ANR N6 .NAR +13 323
#note Pretty ridiculous -- I had played OI a couple turns earlier to prevent bingos, and now look. I draw FANNIES, and it actually fits in line N for 83. Joe blocks it, though.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEFINNS 14G NAIF +33 347
#note I hate to play off four tiles with such a weird pool, but I need points. Basically I'm praying not to draw the Q... or if I do, to draw the blank with it.
>Joe_Petree: EELT 15F TELE +26 349
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ENOQSZ N12 SuQ +26 373
#note Scoring with the Q, keeping multiple Z spots in reserve. That'll work. Phew.
