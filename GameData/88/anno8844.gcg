#note I did not know TROOPIAL was a noun. (Surprisingly to me, this placement wins the sim.)

#note Among plays not in column K, this is OK. KI at 6B instead is an interesting option.

#note I put down TESTING at 11D before seeing it landed one short of the double. Unsure of TESTINGS* and not wanting to give myself headaches (and a potential lost turn either way) about it later (and blissfully unaware of the juicy -S hook up top), I played the other one for the same score.
>Paul_Epstein: ?ACEIIR 12F REAgI.IC +70 188
#note But if I play TESTING, Paul can't bingo. Hmph.

#note Paul's exact rack. He said he considered the sim winner of JE(W)S, but hated keeping the UZ combo. Now take a while with my next rack, considering that all you have to do is keep this game within 48, before deciding what you'd do.
>Jason: DELNTTV H11 V.LET +24 265
#note In terms of straight win %, CP's clear that the top five plays are through that A. Although given the situation, a board mucker-upper like VELD at 13E intrigued me. The problem was that if Paul hits from the C, now the board is not amenable to my coming back to make it close. There was also the question of which play to make. LAVED/VANED/DAVEN scored three more and keeping the D was a little dicey with two more unseen. I even considered a play like TED at 9M as kind of a punt. What would you do?
>Paul_Epstein: EEISSTZ 15A ZESTIES. +104 353
#note As I lifted the bag to draw, Paul put this down. I froze, bag just below my head, and said "You've got to be kidding me." Even after Paul wrote down his score, I couldn't move. Still a little stunned at how fast this one got away. (Turns about Paul had (AD)ZE if I'd played VELD or maybe TE(W)S to set up SZ if I'd played TED.)
>Jason: AADDENT 9M TAD +22 287
#note There was still a slim chance if I could hit the C, a line that would be hard to block (and if Paul blocked for like 10, I might be able to run to get within 48). For whatever reason, I didn't even see DAD instead.
>Paul_Epstein: EQY D2 Q.E.Y +43 396
#note I guess that line wasn't so hard to block after all.
>Jason: AADEFNU F2 NA +16 303
#note Worth a shot.
>Paul_Epstein: ?OW K2 WO.s +38 434
>Jason: ADDEFSU -  +0 303
#note I learned TROOPIAL was a noun. Paul played it confidently, but I had to hope was that he was confusing it with something else.
