#note Best.
>Woody_Chen: AENOP 9F PAEON +22 22
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEEINSZ J6 ZEI. +33 61
#note Best according to quackle, but I didn't see J8 AZINES (sims .25% worse, but I'm sure with my word knowledge, it's a better play for me.)
>Woody_Chen: ABEM K4 BEAM +31 53
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEEGNSS L6 SENEGAS +85 146
#note Best. Learned this yesterday when i missed GENEvAS/sENEGAS at a point where spread would have helped. Game was locked up at that point.
>Woody_Chen: AEIORST 4G AERO.IST +72 125
>Michael_Kapernaros: AILRTUV 5B VIRTUAL +74 220
#note Let AEROBIST* go after a thirty-second hold because I have a response to it. I may or may not challenge if I don't have it. Not sure.
>Woody_Chen: HO 6E OH +28 153
>Michael_Kapernaros: EFGIOTT K11 FIG +26 246
#note First real mistake. M9 FOGIE is 17 points better with a slightly worse leave, not that TOTE is anything great.
>Woody_Chen: ADW C2 WAD. +16 169
>Michael_Kapernaros: EOOTTVY B1 TOY +27 273
#note Again, wrong side for the parallel play. VOTER or TOYER at D1.
>Woody_Chen: DEEILOR N1 LOI.ERED +72 241
#note Convenient, because...
>Michael_Kapernaros: ?EEFOTV O7 FOVEaTE +103 376
#note I draw into the first blank of the game. And some other convenient tiles.
>Woody_Chen: HKU 1L HU.K +45 286
>Michael_Kapernaros: DDIQRTT -DIQRTT +0 376
#note Second-best. I exchange all but a D here. 11 vowels (AAAEEIIIOOU) and 15 consonants (CGJLLNNNNPRSWXY) left, plus a blank. I keep the D for for FOVEATED (especially if I draw the C or that part of the board gets closed down). Quackle likes 14M DID- which i consciously turn down, especially with the blank remaining- because a bingo response plus QRTT of a leave is frightening to me- and I want no part of assisting a triple word score bingo.
>Woody_Chen: ACN 3H CAN +16 302
>Michael_Kapernaros: ADEGLPW A1 AW +30 406
#note There are a few better ideas here. ALP in the same spot is better, or PLEW/PLED at N10. Quackle still likes me hitting the 14th row with the W, the only word I considered down there was GLAD (which sims similarly to AW).
>Woody_Chen: ADIL 3L LA.D +16 318
>Michael_Kapernaros: EGIJLPR 13I JI. +19 425
#note Blocking... Still, I don't like that the bag has two O's...
>Woody_Chen: ?EINNOT 14D mENTION +73 391
>Michael_Kapernaros: EGNPRSX 10G REPS +38 463
#note Missing EX(CEL) or EX(CEL)S, H1, and hoping that one of the three remaining unseen tiles is a vowel. E12 PREX is a more conservative option. Not worried about 15H because I have the case E and the only thing that'll play there without that contains DT and doesn't score overly well anyway. The more pressing worry of a Y on 15D went unnoticed by me, but I'm scoring well enough and he can't hit that spot with the Q AND the Y if he's got it because I have the E. I didn't stop to think about...
>Woody_Chen: IOQTU 15A QUOIT +49 440
#note .... this.
>Michael_Kapernaros: GILNXY 15J NIXY +25 488
#note Second-best. D8 (C)YLIX plays better, but I didn't know it. 
>Woody_Chen: DR M13 DR. +14 454
#note Worried that I might have played NIXY too early, but then saw 3B (YA)RD and that if I stop it with YAG, 12D stops DIS/DIN. Of course, If I know CYLIX...
