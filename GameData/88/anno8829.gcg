#note Won a short sim 'cause I simmed until it jumped to the top. :)  No but really, it's a decent play.

#note 14B PE(E)WIT 26?  I guess for some defense considerations, but static never considers that anyway.

#note This is pretty interesting.  L3 LIES 25 wins 100% according to Champ.  I guess my fish might not be that smart though it sets up two bingo spots.  I(N) only wins 37.5%  (L)I, the other fish I was pondering, is 62.5%.  Oops.  But if you start a simulation with I(N) it has it winning 100%.
