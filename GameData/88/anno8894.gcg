>Ryan_Fischer: EEHINNP 8G HEN +12 12
#note 8D PENNI 20, 8D PINENE (!) 22.  Never studied PENNIES/PINENES before.  Odd.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEIIRT B8 TIDIERs +74 171
#note Whoops: K5 DITsIER 91.  I played too fast, and seized on the spot he opened.  BEDIRTIE(d/s) for 86, too.  Also, InDITER for 78.  To be fair, until now, I wasn't entirely sure HENT even took an S.  Another reason why PIT was bad when I coulda played POH and had him a bit worried.
>David_Gibson: AEHY A12 YEAH +54 143
#note Yeah, that hurt.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCRRSV 12A ..RBA +20 191
#note Best, only 'cause everything else is so bad.  It took a lot for me to play it though.  xBRV is next.
>David_Gibson: FORW 11E FROW +30 173
#note Coulda been woise!
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CDRRSV G10 C.RD +9 200
#note It's this or xCDRV.  This kinda puts a stranglehold on this part of the board.  I'm fine with that.
>David_Gibson: CIIILVW -CIV +0 173
#note I think this was close to his rack.  Rare that he tells people that, but it was just so bad.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AERRSV 2E ARRiVES +65 265
#note I'm not going to play at K8 with 3 Ses out (still unsure of HENTS).  Not playing K1 to slot an A after an exchange.  14G is out for the same reason.  Hence, this or REAVERS.  I'm happy with how it turned out.

>David_Gibson: AEPSTY F13 AYE +18 302
#note Champ says F13 APE instead of AYE.  He was considering PEATY for all those points, but then I go out with GOALIE.  STY leaves (FROW)STY for 32 to go out (which came up in my earlier game with Garner, but is much harder to see here!).
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGIO C6 GOA +8 481
#note I play GOA to block T(I)PS.  I FINALLY play an endgame right (not that it matters here).
>David_Gibson: PST D7 PST +15 317
#note He overscored M(I)X by 4.  Whoops.
