#note CAMEO or COMAE have better leaves.

>Matthew_Larocque: EIKORSW 9C WORK +32 58
#note I was considering W(IN)K here as a fish, but decided I was giving up too many points and I would probably end up vowel heavy anyways. Sim likes playing WORK for 30 forming (MENACE)R.

#note I didn't like doing this, since I had many better plays, but I had to kill it. It does set up my S though.
>Shannon_Burns: EUX 2G E.UX +27 173
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEHLSZ H10 .ZALEA +48 245
#note LOL (C)H(A)LAZAS now there's a word I might never see again.
>Shannon_Burns: ?AGITUY L1 GrATUI.Y +84 257
#note Good find.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?HLNSTU 6N H. +26 271
#note NUTSHELL, LUTHERNS (didn't know). This is the best static non-bingo play, though. I had no idea, I didn't want to keep the U but with the blank I thought I could find something. Just not NUTSHELL :/
>Shannon_Burns: DILM I12 MILD +20 277
#note Shannon didn't waste time there did he lol
>Matthew_Larocque: ?LNNSTU 3G L.TU +21 292
#note NoN(AD)ULTS. I didn't even know ULAN was a word, of course I won't find a 9!
>Shannon_Burns: DEGGP K9 P.GGED +22 299
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ILNNQS 5K S.Q +24 316
#note QIS for 31, how hard is that to see, I was looking right in the general area.
>Shannon_Burns: FIT 1L .IFT +24 323
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EILNNS B10 .INNS +24 340
#note Supposedly my chances to win are 84%. But I'm not Quackle of course, and the closeness of this game would indicate a toss-up.
>Shannon_Burns: IOT 12A I.TO +10 333
#note This was a weird play, I'm curious what else he had.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ELOOOY 12K .OOEY +26 366
#note Win % is calculated to be 77% now, assuming I don't do anything really stupid. Because I never do stupid things in scrabble!
>Shannon_Burns: ACEIRRS O10 CR.ERS +33 366
#note Yikes, I so wanted to challenge this. But letting a phony go and winning is better than challenging a good word and then losing. Aka challenging RILLE and losing by 11.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ELOOVW M11 V.WEL +22 388
#note (A)VOW is actually better, to block is best outplay. I like how the sim says nothing wins, you can literally calculate the final scores at this point. How does my play not win, Quackle?
>Shannon_Burns: AI 2N AI +16 382
>Shannon_Burns:  (?OO) +4 386
#note Shannon asked for recount - had me pretty nervous, but all scores were recorded properly. By the skin of my teeth, I kept winning against people I had no right to. It's all downhill from here!
