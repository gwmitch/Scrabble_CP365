#note BUNION seems too reckless.  Remember, I have to lose by less than... 115, I think, to win the tournament.

#note ACRODONT, as he noted.  Also, CORANTO and CORNUTO, and O(S)TRACON.
>Ryan_Fischer: ILNORTU L1 I.OL +24 298
#note Best play, but with him fishing like this, it's inevitable he'll hit me.  9E LAITY 24 is good for scoring and not opening anything up.

#note Matt's wife, Katie, was looking on as he played this, and she was like, "really?"  He responded, "It's my favorite word!"  Yeah, you could say we regressed that day.

#note Well, static says to dump the U.  Indeed, Champ picks it too.  K10 (N)U 4.  You get FIERIES(T) if you draw one of those Is, and FAERIES is still there, too.
