#note missing verdicts.  blah.  need to work on blank bingo practise.  I think most of my misses and struggles were with blank-bingos.  Also missed VISCID.  That said, I'm scoring well for all the junk I've drawn.

#note This was 4 more pts; the A line doesn't look that scary, though QUAG might come down.  3ply sim likes B(I)TT

#note Missing IMPACTOR/PISCATOR here.  Again, I need blank-bingo practice.

#note I held this forever, but again, rely to trust on experts knowing low prob words.
>E_Tran: ?CIMNPR 10J C.IMP +23 199
#note L1 PRIM does a good job of opening as well.  Or C12 PIC scores well.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: GGOY D11 .OGGY +32 310
#note He chickens out on CRIMPY here.
>E_Tran: ?FILNNR L1 FLIR +26 225

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACT 1L .ACT +27 337
>E_Tran: ?ENNQSY -NQY +0 225
#note So bad.  I need to take the pts.  I could do SNYE, but I didn't want to risk CRIMPY.  doh.  We talked about this after the game, how given the score, if he played CRIMPY, I'd have to challenge, and if I played it, he'd have to let it go.
