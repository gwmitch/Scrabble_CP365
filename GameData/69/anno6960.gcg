#note Mitch said he had a bingo, so I don't want to open, nor to give him easy counterplay. Also want to keep the A for 14B or 5L.

#note Want to try and block that line, but I suspect good vowels are on Mitch's rack, so want to keep A and E for HAE(M) or some other scoring play. Also have have a hope that I'll draw into a bingo, and Mitch is sure to open the board. Definitely not going to empty bag.

>Winter: ADEGHST A3 GHAST +19 357
#note Dude, that just sucked. I decided to keep the E, figuring that the back was devoid of vowels, and I inadvertently missed the TWS.
