#note Someone's been studying!  Of note: POST(F)ACE.  Scored as 78.

#note AGIT(ATE)D is favored by .1, presumably because it sets up the Y?
>Matthew_"Ar_Endbrain"_Bernardina: EILMN E2 MILNE. +20 135
>Ryan_Fischer: AADIMTY H1 AD.TA +30 123
#note TAM(M)Y IS good.  Wow!  A fabricy of mixed fibers.  The problem with those lower prob 5s is some look like random somewhat plausible arrangements of letters.  I was way too fancy here.  AD(Y)TA is okay, but AY was probaby easest and best besides TAMMY.  Considered YAY and MAYA.  Nope.
>Matthew_"Ar_Endbrain"_Bernardina: KNO 10G .ONK +27 162
>Ryan_Fischer: DIMNQSY F1 QI +19 142
#note Yeah, MY, but then what do I do with the Q?
>Matthew_"Ar_Endbrain"_Bernardina: IRV 4B VIR. +14 176
#note Well, that.  Betcha he'd've played something else had I played MY.  :P
>Ryan_Fischer: ADMNSUY 2L .AUD +17 159
#note H10 (O)SMUND 36.  Hmm.  YUAN 11H, (Q)U(A)Y 1F, YUAN 11H.  Fail.

#note I figured OI was out because he just fished and if he hits, I'm pretty much toast.  Both blanks unseen, I've gotta go in!

#note ...now it explodes.
>Ryan_Fischer: EHIJNRS L8 HEJIR. +40 255
#note One off HARIJ(A)NS!  Gimme those BLANKS!  Okay, maybe JIN 12J is better.
>Matthew_"Ar_Endbrain"_Bernardina: AEEILRT 14A RETAILE. +76 326
#note Oh, what serendipitous timing.  I wish RETAILED fell out of his brain and he had to play ELATERID.
>Ryan_Fischer: ??AFNOS A12 FA.O +33 288
#note Got 'em!  And there's NOTHING there!!!  No 3x3s or bingos worth playing anyway.  FAS for 46 is interesting, but kills a key line.  Timing is key, somethingI really don't have a handle on.  I was worried my computer was going to melt down trying to calculate the championship plays.  M7 FANO 29 leaving S?? wins 83.33%; FAS 70%.  I don't know.  Instinctually, I'd want to take out the triple, hope to avoid the X.  Which is I guess why FANO fares well -- it blocks the X spot, leaving 4 lanes to bingo.
>Matthew_"Ar_Endbrain"_Bernardina: EU C13 U.E +6 332
>Ryan_Fischer: ??INOSS 5J ..S +10 298
#note I dumped the S so I could bingo out.  If he dumps the X at J13, I'll be forced to find (E)NOSISes, which I very well may have.  But absent HEX, something like OScINeS may win at N3 anyway.  (E)S 9L might be a play, 'cause it sets up a different hook and stop the thread of HEX, which I really should havebeen more concerned about.  Champ says caSINOS win 37%.  I think perfect play by my opponent wins for him.  My play ends up simming 2nd to caSINOS.
>Matthew_"Ar_Endbrain"_Bernardina: AEHINSX M7 HEX +47 379
#note 14J XIS 70 to really screw me over.
>Ryan_Fischer: ??EINOS 15H .lOINErS +71 369
#note Whoops, we agreed to a tie at 377.  I said I was fine with a tie, but he's welcome to recount if he liked.  He declined.  I found that and went out with 0:02 left on my clock, which was a minor victory even though I admit my thought processes leave something to be desired and I still have a lot of endgame work to do.
