#note i did see the bingos here, but i thought that i should take these points and wait a little longer. I didn't like what MESSAGED did to the board when I'm still behind, and I was afraid that leaving this open, he'd just come back with a ton of points and I'd never be able to come back.

#note i should have spent more time here.  i actually saw the move that champ player wanted me to play - BOWPOT - which pretty much assures me an out next turn. i also considered ELBOW to take out the triple lane. my play, if you give him an S in opp rack, has a 75% win chance, and there are many options that are higher.
