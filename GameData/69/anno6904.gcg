#note I just want to win quickly and leave--will the tiles make it easy for  me? Well, not this first rack. I looked to see if anything good jumped out, but I did not want to spend the time to use the Bowman method. Funny thing is, had I taken the time to find UNDERLAY, luckbag here would have scored better.

#note I know the play is bad, the leave awful, I can't bear to leave him this spot, b/c I just know he'll score a million points there--he's just too lucky not to. Given his ridiculuck, I cannot win unless I luck into a bingo myself.
