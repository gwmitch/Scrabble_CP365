>Sam: AAGLOPR 8H GALOP +22 22
#note I missed PARGO, but this is nearly as good.
>Joey: DEGHIIO 9G DOGIE +23 23
#note HIDE I9 was intriguing, since it gave me a shot at GALOPING.  I decided against that because it would probably get blocked too often.
>Sam: AEHNORW 7G HAW +32 54
>Joey: EEHINSU 7K HUE +17 40
>Sam: EJLNOOR 6F JO +30 84
>Joey: AEILNSW N1 LAWINES +81 121
>Sam: BELNOOR 1L BO.L +27 111
#note BOLO M2 sims better. I didn't play it because I was worried about O1 plays, but I think that was an exaggerated fear. In fact, Quackle's simulator has Joey scoring less after BOLO M2 than BOLL 1L, probably because it shuts down bingos. I'd play BOLO M2 if given a redo.
>Joey: AINRTVY 2I VINY +19 140
#note No idea what's right here.  This seemed fine, but I wasn't crazy about it.
>Sam: EELNORA 10I ENROL +27 138
>Joey: AINRTTT 11G TART +17 157
>Sam: BDDEIRS 12D REBIDS +39 177
#note BEDRID and ABIDE are two other nice options, neither of which I spotted.
>Joey: EFINTUY M9 F.UTY +30 187
>Sam: ADINPRR 5G PADRI +24 201
#note I didn't like any of the plays hooking REBIDS, but RAPID is worth considering.
>Joey: CEINNQU E7 QUINC. +34 221
#note QUIN 4L was another option.  Little did I realize that I would be blocking my own bingo.
>Sam: EKNRSTX 8D X. +17 218
#note The best-simming plays are TRES 13B and KNIT 4L, probably because they reach for the blanks. I really shouldn't have played only one tile with both blanks still out; KNIT seems reasonable.
>Joey: CEEFNOR O3 EF +23 244
>Sam: AEKNRST 4H KA +25 243
#note I missed the star play of AKENE M3.
>Joey: ACENORT 3E ARCO +16 260
#note Either I play here or open up a second spot, hoping to get the last bingo.  Tough choice.
>Sam: AENRSST K7 ....S +26 269
#note I didn't see RESAT 13C, which looks better.
>Joey: EEIMNTT D1 MINT +25 285
#note Didn't seem too crazy to put an M in this position, even with Sam seemingly close to a bingo.
>Sam: AEINRST 1A RAI.ENTS +140 409
#note Well, I guess it was crazy.
>Joey: EEIOTVZ H11 ..OZE +45 330
>Sam: ?ADEEMO A1 .EMOlADE +83 492
#note No matter what Sam had, I knew this bingo was coming.
>Joey: EEGITUV J1 G.VE. +16 346
#note GEEZ 14E is actually slightly better because it blocks his best out play.
>Sam: ? E7 ......s +17 509
#note Good game, Sam.  Not as good as last year's game, though.  :)
>Sam:  (EITU) +8 517
