#note I undervalued some good synergy with a TIC or OTIC leave. didn't see UMIAC either.

#note I don't know how hard of a find this is, but this was definitely a game-turning moment and probably one of my best plays of the tournament.
>Wallace_Schultz: ABLRSUU 13G SUBAUR.L +64 268
#note in turn, wallace plays the best bingo anyone played against me this tournament. nice play.
>Magra: ?AIOQST B6 QI +65 188
#note it's pretty cool I came from 145 down and won this one.

>Magra: EEGILPZ 14F ZIP +40 312
#note I tried to do far too much with this play. judging from his last play and the vowel shortage in the pool I judged that he was likely pretty consonant-heavy. at the same time it also seemed that he wouldn't have made his last play if he had an O in his mind. with that in mind I decided that playing at the bottom was the best way to potentially erase the 62 point deficit. in hindsight I was being pretty silly.
>Wallace_Schultz: LRSU 15H SLUR +27 361
>Magra: EEEGGLO 2B O.EE +25 337
#note it's not looking great here...
>Wallace_Schultz: V 9F V.. +6 367
>Magra: EGGILRW O2 WRIGGL. +16 353
#note fortunately a weirdly synergetic draw helps me out. I played WRIGGLY for an extra chance of drawing the blank or the J and because it even sets up a J play at N1. quackle gives me a 22% chance of winning.
>Wallace_Schultz: I 3L .I +8 375
>Magra: ?EJNOPY D7 ENJOYs +37 390
#note I was low on time and managed to totally mistrack and ended up kinda lucking into the right play. it was clear that he was trying to bingo here but my draw allowed me an obvious path to victory.
>Wallace_Schultz: CEEINRS E10 REIN +21 396
>Magra: P B1 ..P +12 402
>Magra:  (CES) +10 412
#note I probably would've gone and played frogger with the freeway if I'd ended up losing this one.
