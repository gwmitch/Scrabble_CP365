#note her actual rack. she accidentally showed me a blank on the first draw.
>Magra: DEFIOSU D8 .UODS +30 30
#note I really wanted to throw down FIDEOUS* somewhere. per quackle my winning percentage is already down to 20%. my best play is probably DUO at 7F which makes tons of sense.
>Sandy_Nang: KNT F6 KN.T +18 72
>Magra: EEFGIPX 7H EX +22 52
#note what a terrible play. this play is so bad that I was convinced sandy had played KNOT at 10B instead. but nope, I just sucked very hard during this game.

#note GIFT looks better than my play. not sure why I didn't see it.
>Sandy_Nang: EF E10 FE +21 162
>Magra: ACFILPT K5 F.ACTI +22 145
#note sort of a tricky play colored by her last move. I spent about 5 minutes and then somehow had like 9 minutes left afterwards. I think CAPLIN is the right move.
>Sandy_Nang: ABOR 8K .AROB +30 192
>Magra: CHILNOP J10 HOLP +30 175
#note PICHOLINE - a French cultivar of olives. now you know. and so do I. PINCH would also have been better. my plays were way off all game.

>Magra: CDEINRU 12G INC.UDER +74 249
>Magra: CDEINRU --  -74 175
#note sigh. I didn't play UNPRICED because I thought it gave back too much counterplay and because I wasn't totally sure if it was good. my winning percentage drops by 40% with this error and really it should be lots more. she insta-challenged too
>Sandy_Nang: ARVY F11 VARY +25 247
#note I guess she didn't see UNPRICED

#note though she has other plays here, I had never seen this word in my life. I pretty much lose if it's good no matter what.
>Magra: AEEIOUV -  +0 289
#note my winning chances are pretty low as is.
