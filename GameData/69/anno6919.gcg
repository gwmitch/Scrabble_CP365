>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: EEISZ 8D SEIZE +30 30
>Evans_Clinchy: DEKMMOT D8 .MOKED +26 26
#note Thought about MODEM I6, but keeping the K didn't seem that enticing on this board. My play sims well.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: EIILP E10 PILEI +35 65
>Evans_Clinchy: CEFJMNT E5 JEF. +28 54
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: ART F7 A.RT +18 83
>Evans_Clinchy: CLMNRTT H7 C.LT +6 60
#note Figured this would be better than exchanging, considering the defensive merit.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: IW 13B WI.. +16 99
>Evans_Clinchy: BHMNRTT -BHMNT +0 60
#note Not sure why I gave up on the rack at this point. The board is so closed that taking points is definitely better. NTH F13 is the play.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: AX 12B AX.. +25 124
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEPRRT 14A PA +20 80
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: ??ILNOW 11H sLOWINg +72 196
>Evans_Clinchy: AERRTVY L8 VER.TY +32 112
#note Awful. Why am I sticking a V in a promising bingo lane when I'm down 116? EYRA 15A is obviously the play here. I've lost my brain.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: ABO 10J BO.A +29 225
>Evans_Clinchy: AEHNRTU 9K H.N +20 132
#note Figured I had to do something to open a lane. The other option is JUN 5E, maybe, but I want to keep scoring.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: EU 5E .EU +10 235
>Evans_Clinchy: AAERTUU I11 .UAU +5 137
#note Shrug.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: MU H14 MU +16 251
>Evans_Clinchy: AENNORT M13 ON +14 151
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: DEINOR 15J DINERO +27 278
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEENRT 9C A. +5 156
#note Debated between this and RALE 9F. Figured I had to open another lane to have a prayer in this one.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: BY B9 BY +22 300
>Evans_Clinchy: AEENRST O6 EARNEST +83 239
#note SLOWINGS#. Didn't like it but thought it'd be a good phony against a Collins-playing opponent.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: HNT N4 NTH +27 327
>Evans_Clinchy: ACFGGLO 4K FLO.G +22 261
#note Sim recommends GONG 4L, setting up FLAG O1 for next turn. Seems reasonable.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: IQ 3J QI +16 343
>Evans_Clinchy: ACDEGII 2K DICE +21 282
#note Missing DEIFIC K1.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: R 8D .....R +15 358
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEGGIO G12 GIE +10 292
#note I have no recollection of why I did this. I think I had to go to the bathroom, so I hurried up and slapped down the first play I saw. Best is NAG 14M for 15.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: DORSSTV F2 VOT. +15 373
>Evans_Clinchy: AAGO 7H .OG +10 302
#note Now the best play is GOO 3E, which blocks his DROSS outplay while still keeping AA 8A to go out for 14 next turn.
>Nawapadol_Sayavesa: DRSS C12 ..S +15 388
>Evans_Clinchy: AA 8A AA +14 316
