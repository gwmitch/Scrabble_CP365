#note had to think about this for a good long while. quackle seems to agree with me that this is less dangerous than opening up the left side.

>Magra: ADELNOO H1 ADO.E +49 187
#note it's interesting how pretty much all the bingos I've missed happened when I had a really big non-bingo play. missing CANOODLE is pretty goofy though.

>Magra: ALNNOUV 2C UNLOA. +9 196
#note well, I saw UNVOCAL but didn't think it was a word. it's miles better than any other play, including my own play which is not very good by any standards.
