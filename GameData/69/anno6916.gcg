#note Not sure what I was thinking of. Had I seen my biggest play of MAYEST N1 I might have passed up the phony bingo as I was unsure of it.

#note Lots of options here: GUIDEWAY (which I didn't know), YUM, WAVY, AW M1 (blocking lucrative M column plays), and SWEATY are some. GUIDEWAY sims best, but the S-hook is probably somewhat devalued since he knows my rack. I didn't mind my play, but YUM could be better with the VIBES hook still open and hard to block.

#note I forget my reasoning behind this play. JEFES seems a lot better, though, as EEFO? isn't especially bingo-prone.

#note There were four plays that scored well on this turn: BORK B11, BERK N7, BILK 8A, and QI. I didn't like setting up the hard-to-block S-hook, but if I keep the Q there might well be nowhere to play it next turn. With the BEGKR leave I am ensured of having a 40-point play next turn as well.

#note Though I was almost certain STONING didn't have an anagram, I didn't want to risk the game on a challenge when I had an 88-point win wrapped up. I also didn't want to have to waste ten minutes of energy figuring out how best to draw UY out of the bag to squeeze out twenty more spread points.
