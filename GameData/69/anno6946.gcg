#note Sweet merciful Jesus, that is bad. I think my train of thought on this play was "ooh, look, a double-doubl--" *brain shuts off*

>Evans_Clinchy: DGINOPR K3 ORPIN +25 69
#note Absolutely terrible. All the best plays hook GAVOTTED, which I didn't see until it was far too late. Also if I'm going to use this lane, why not PONGID? This is just a dreadful play.
>Randall_Thomas: AENPRUV H1 PARVENU. +101 219
>Evans_Clinchy: CDEGHLR 3J C.DGER +20 89
#note Sure, why not. This far behind, might as well start opening triples willy-nilly.

>Evans_Clinchy: GHIILLN C11 HILL +20 109
#note Just gotta keep creating lanes and hoping for the best.

#note HAEING in the same spot is cool, but I didn't want to blow up the rack that much. Down 175, I need to bingo a few times. I'll keep my ING for now.

#note With a pool this promising, I thought the surest route to victory was to play a lot of tiles and aim to go out next turn. Hence nothing that keeps both U's, like AMYL or MAYS hooking HILLY. But the play I completely missed was ASYLUM, scoring 47 and keeping just the one U. I also considered not emptying the bag, but how am I gonna do that? ULU? Nah, I gotta score to keep up. If he bingos, whether it's an outplay or not, I'll just lose. Not much I can do about that.

#note Sweet play by Randall to block both placements of MUSSED.
