>Magra: DDENOOP 8F POOD +14 14
#note nope, do not know ENDOPOD. sigh.
>Brett_Haughney: ADINORV 9D VIAND +20 20
>Magra: ACDENPY 7G CYAN +32 46
#note apparently a sizable error. CYAN somehow gives up 10 more points to opponent next turn. apparently it's just very hard to score after DYE at 10E. Still not exactly sure why.
>Brett_Haughney: EEILORU 6I LOUIE +15 35
#note Brett:  Didn't know CYANO, else OURIE is the play. Should have considered OVULE a little more, but wanted to turn over an extra tile and balance.  Also, this was scored as 13.
>Magra: BDEEPTW M3 BEW.PT +32 78
#note Brett:  Jesse is going to try to tell you this was a bad play.  Don't listen to him.

Jesse: This is ok actually
>Brett_Haughney: EMNORSW 10F WE +35 70
#note Brett: RESOW/N are both cute for a handful of more points.  meh.
>Magra: DEEGRTV 4I VERG.D +22 100
#note really sloppy play on my part up until this point in the game. VEGETE is better.
>Brett_Haughney: MNNORSY 11D MONY +37 107
>Magra: ADEIIKT 8K KI.ED +33 133
#note this is pretty much even with taking the points for KITED at the bottom-left or playing KADI there.
>Brett_Haughney: IILNORS 12G SIRLOIN +77 184
#note Brett:  draw IILO and have a bingo.  Lucky bastard.
>Magra: AAEETXZ 12A ZETA +54 187
#note I thought ZAX would be miles better but it's pretty much even.
>Brett_Haughney: AEGJOQS A12 .AGS +42 226
#note Brett:  lots of good scoring here.  Champ's pick.
>Magra: AEFFMRX 13L FAX +35 222
#note I spent a long time on this but totally missed AFF at 13J. It's not an easy find but it's clearly better than my choice.
>Brett_Haughney: EIIJOQS 14J QIS +38 264
#note Brett:  both blanks unseen.  kill the easy lane.  Don't so much care about Column B.
>Magra: EEFHMOR 13A .FORE +30 252
#note felt like a huge mistake at the time, but he doesn't necessarily have an I after his last play. I thought about playing at the top-right but I don't know how much that really helps.
>Brett_Haughney: EIJNOOR 15H JOIN +46 310
>Magra: EEHMRST J3 H. +5 257
#note METH is a pretty crucial miss. EH at 11J would've been a lot better too.
>Brett_Haughney: BEGLORU I2 LU. +13 323
#note Brett:  Should have played GOR for the true block.
>Magra: AEEMRST N1 TRA.ES +35 292
#note looks a little crazy but leaps out in front on the sim.
>Brett_Haughney: BEGORTU 1L BU.T +27 350
>Magra: AEHLMNR H1 RAH +29 321
>Brett_Haughney: EEGORTT 14C GET +16 366
#note Brett:  Booooo  poor play.  Need to be blocking the top line.  This puts me up 45 which shores me up against the bingo and guards against other high scorers. I shoul have been burned on the next turn, but he misses the 9.  Lucky bastard.
>Magra: ??CELMN D7 LE. +7 328
#note too bad I don't know LEMNISCAL. I think LEV is basically a forced move here.
>Brett_Haughney: AAEIORT 2D AERI.. +8 374
#note sweet block from brett. I thought there wasn't an E out which would've made a block miuch tougher and maybe even impossible. so it goes.
>Magra: ??CEMNU 1A CUlM +37 365
#note should play the blank for 1 more point since he's going out. not that it changes the outcome
>Brett_Haughney: AIOT E4 IOTA +10 384
