#note Wanted to start opening things up somehow. NEEP 10G might be a better option since it scores more.
>Brett_Haughney: ACGMO 4G OGAM.C +26 180
#note This is one of those situations where I hold, think for a little bit, and then shrug and wave it through. I didn't have a clue. Turns out it's Collins-only, weirdly enough.

#note Maybe MON 3I, but I liked the AEMNR leave a lot. Keeping the M for the NORM hook seemed like a good idea.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEFMNRZ 10H MAZER +42 235
#note Wasn't sure whether MAZE or MAZER was better. I picked this since it made the DWS spot tougher to hit.

#note Yuck. I spent a long time on this play, and the two options I really considered strongly were this and (DIF)FER. I chose this because it seemed to control the board best -- there are virtually no bingo lanes left after this play, so I'm forcing him to open first. Decent reasoning... except FARER is obviously a way better play. I never gave it much thought, because I really didn't think it was a word. Sigh.
>Brett_Haughney: IJU 8L .UJI +42 293
#note I guess I closed the board to everything but that.
