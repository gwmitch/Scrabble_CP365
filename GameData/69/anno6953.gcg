#note Weird play--I think I noticed WALLY and WANLY after I hit my clock. The sim likes WANLY.

#note I really didn't want to leave him the easy triple.

#note I spent the rest of the game thinking this took an A when it's only TEGMENTA. Luckily I never played it.

#note The sim actually likes holding the Q here. QIS is pretty crappy for the board, even though it finally gets rid of the Q. And the path I led myself down in the next few plays probably wasn't a winning one. WAIL K10 is reasonable, especially since I can still hit a play at H1.

#note Not a great play. OWNER might be better just to provide a new lane.

>Sam: CEIILRR 12H CRIE. +23 266
#note Perhaps it was the time for RICIN 4A already. Already looking pretty hopeless. I needed to do something more exciting.

#note This was a really tough play. I didn't know CALKIN 6A but that seems like a good play. I was fishing for either TACKLINg or STENCIL. Open to any other options.
