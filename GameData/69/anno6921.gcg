#note I usually like to trade in response to ex. 1, but this play seemed to prevent more sevens than it opened up eights.

#note As it was, I gave Brian a bingo.

#note Normally I would have slapped down DEgAMIS as soon as I saw it, but I decided to be more defensive here after thinking a few minutes.

#note This play was pretty interesting. FIXT is likely to lead to BRA or BRO N13 next turn, while there are many possible leaves for exchanges (Quackle seems to like ex. BRTTV, as the F fits at 1D and the X at 13C, 2B, and 3G). I liked this play because I seemed likely to hit VEX or VOX next turn.

#note VEX sims best, but it might be better to take out the A column with BET.
